[normal]There is scope for an improved mix of services providing care for people with long term conditions – in particular 
[normal]using professional therapists such as acupuncturists, 
[normal]so that more people are treated outside hospital. British Acupuncture Council

[normal]cupuncturists are 
[normal]degree level trained and 
[normal]provide services within loc
[normal]al NHS and social care services.

[normal]C
[normal]ommissioners need to design services which promote such community-based care. BAcC Acupuncturists can treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditions. Patients with long term conditions treated by BAcC Acupuncturists are offered personalised services that 
[normal]should be recognised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is recommended that NHS 
[normal]contract 
[normal]and commissioning 
[normal]mechanisms such as QOF
[normal] and 
[normal]QUIPP
[normal] recognise long term conditions. S
[normal]ervice 
[normal]specifications should recognise Acupuncture to support people with long term conditions
[normal].

[normal]Pilots should be established to test models of improving practice.
