Below is general information and we are happy to provide further details upon request. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Mifalot: Sport for Education, Development, and PeaceMifalot is the largest and most diverse sport for development and peace organization in the Middle East. To date, over 2\n5\n,000 children and youth in Israel, Palestine and Jordan participate in Mifalot's\n programs each year. Founded in 1997 by the owners of Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club and the Kahanoff Foundation, Mifalot's \nvision is:\n&#xa0;\nChildren and youth in our region graduate from our programs with the life skills and tools to learn, grow, excel and develop their co\nmmunity and world. Mifalot has over 300 projects that use football to accomplish the following \nprogram objectives:\n&#xa0;\nMifalot’s local success over the past 16 years is driving our new\n international initiative. To date, we have assisted communities in implementing and adapting our project models to their local needs in Jordan, Palestine, Nigeria, Liberia, Rwanda, \nIndia, \nHaiti and Cameroon. \n&#xa0;\nMifalot leverages the platform provided by th\ne \nHapoel Tel Aviv Football Club to engage political institutions, the corporate sector, the general public and the international community to ensure that due attention is paid to the most pressing social issues in the region and internationally.\n&#xa0;\nThe Hapoe\nl Tel Aviv Football Club has shifted the public’s perception about \nthe role of a professional club in helping children and communities. Rather than carrying the image of a \nmarketing ploy or public relations campaign, Mifalot is viewed by its funders, suppo\nrters, and partners as an earnest and effective use of sport to promote social development and peace.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMifalot\n operates a number of programs focused on peace and coexistence. The goal of these programs is to bring together \ndifferent groups within the\n diverse population\ns in Israel and in the region including Jordan and Palestine. With all of these groups \nfootball \nb\necomes a tool for bridging\n social, religious and ethnic divides. Football \nis\n the common ground that all people like and relate to. It helps individuals from opposing groups realize that they are not so different. From there, we use this common ground to ho\nld a dialogue about differences\n, coexistence, conflict mitigation\n and how to understand and accept each other.\nMifalot's projects include the following:\n-\n \nKnow Your Neighbor/Neighbor's United: Breaking down stereotypes and building trust - both on and off\n the field - between youth from different groups within Israel and between Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians.\n-\n \nCoaches for Social Change: Educating Palestinian and Israeli young adults together to be football coaches and peace educators and then sendi\nng them out into their communities to work as coaches with teams of youth.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMifalot’s success and effectiveness are proven by international and domestic accolades, including: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
