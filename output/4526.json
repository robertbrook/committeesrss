"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Corinne Le Quéré and \nAndrew Watkinson (IPC0050)&#xa0;Andrew Watkinson, Professor in Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia\n.\nIPCC involvement: \nReview editor 4\nth\n Assessment Report\n&#xa0;\nCorinne Le Quéré, Professor of \nClimate Change Science and Policy and Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia\n.\nIPCC involvement: author (L\nead \nA\nuthor\n) of the 3\nrd\n, 4\nth\n, and 5\nth\n Assessment reports, including the Summary for Policy Makers of the 3\nrd\n report (as Draft Author) and of the 5\nth\n report (as Contributing Author). \n&#xa0;\nKey points:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestions\nHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of \nprevious reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions?\nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?\nCan any of the areas of the science now be \nconsidered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?\nHow ef\nfective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?\nDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?\nHas AR5 sufficiently explained the re\nasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?\nDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to \nprevent dangerous climate change?\nWhat implications do the IPCC’s conclu\nsions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally?\nIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?\nTo what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Sci\nence Basis summary?\nIs the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissio\nns appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report?\nWhat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
