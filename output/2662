              [bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]BIS[bold] Sustainability Champion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The committee were keen to see the formal terms of reference of both my role as BIS sustainability champion and the recently formed BIS sustainability committee which I chair. These terms of reference are attached at Annex A.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The committee also asked whether sustainability training was provided by BIS. As my answer on the day indicated, the department does not provide bespoke sustainability training to staff. However, training is available for staff involved in the policy making process, for example on how to construct impact assessment drawing on HMT’s green book. This includes reference to the need to consider economic, social and environmental impacts. DECC run modules on a variety of aspects of carbon, climate change and energy, which are open to all civil servants. I also understand that DEFRA are working with civil service learning to develop an e-learning module on sustainability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I also include a copy of the Regional Growth Fund application form. The form is attached at Annex B (an
[normal]d has been sent electronically)
[normal] The guidance for the document is embedded electronically by hovering over the specific questions. The relevant question in this case is I02, where the following pop-up appears “e.g. benefits to the environment, improvements to transport networks and journey times, scientific advances”. The application form itself is designed to be light touch and is therefore deliberately concise. However, applicants are expected to submit a supporting document alongside their bid in which they articulate the case for supporting their bid. As my colleague, Alex Wilson, said in giving evidence to the committee, the overarching objective of the appraisal, in line with HMT green book guidance, is to fairly set out all of the costs and benefits of each project on an appropriately discounted and risk adjusted basis. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, I attach a copy of all eleven sector strategies as well as the analysis paper published on 11 September alongside the Industrial Strategy Summit.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BIS Sustainability Committee[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The following terms of reference were signed off by the BIS Operations Committee at the beginning of August 2013 and issued following a the first meeting of the Sustainability Committee at the beginning of September 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Remit[bold]The purpose of the Sustainability Committee is to support the Executive Board in providing leadership, co-ordination and guidance to BIS in fulfilling the Department’s sustainability commitments as set out in the Business Plan and Greening Government commitments and embedding sustainability principles in BIS policy making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Director General Finance and Commercial is accountable to the Executive Board for the Department’s sustainability performance, supported by the Board appointed Sustainability Champion. The Committee reports to the Executive Board through the Operations Committee, who act on behalf of the Executive Board. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Department’s sustainability commitments fall under three themes: policy, operations and procurement. Each of these themes is represented through SCS level membership on the Committee. The Committee also has representation from the voluntary BIS Green Guardians network.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Definition of Sustainability[bold]Sustainable development means encouraging economic growth while protecting the environment and improving our quality of life - all without affecting the ability of future generations to do the same. 
[normal]The Sustainability Committee will oversee how BIS takes account of sustainable development as a part of how it develops its policies, how it runs its operations and how it buys its goods and services. 
[normal]Taking account of sustainability in policy making includes considering environmental, social and economic impact of policy. Achieving sustainability also includes policies that contribute to economic rebalancing – across sectors and places, moving to a low carbon economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster resilience, and resource efficiency.
