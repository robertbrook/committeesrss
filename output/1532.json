"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence \nfrom Buckinghamshire County Council (TIC 42)\n&#xa0;A response is given below on each of the issues identified by the Committee as the focus for the request for evidence.\n&#xa0;\n1. How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1 \nGiven the ongoing reduction in local authority funding our current focus in on managing the exi\nsting public transport network and seeking to maintain existing services where they show reasonable usage. In terms of identifying new demand this is largely linked to new developments where funding for additional public transport can at least be pump prim\ned through s106 funds.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nOther new demands in rural areas would be more limited. Our current public transport network is largely based on historic route patterns and smaller communities which generate few passengers are likely to be served only where ro\nutes and road layouts lend themselves at no more than a marginal cost.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nThe common means of identifying demand are through:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;\n2.1 \nBuckinghamshire County Council \nconsiders\n the needs of elderly and disabled passengers through a number of measures:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nFor younger people we offer subsidised leisure (after 09:00) bus travel for 16-19 year olds and some subsidised discretional travel to out\n of catchment schools / colleges. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;3.1 \nCost is the main barrier. Buses are best su\nited to mass transit along corridors and in the current economic climate where the drive is to do “more with less” then inevitably there is a focus on maintaining services carrying larger numbers of passengers. Rural areas have flows which are diverse and \noften cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nWe are experimenting with DRT services using an extension the Northamptonshire County Connect service in the rural NW corner of Buckinghamshire but pre-booking is unpopular and cos\nt per passenger is high with DRT services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\n4.1 \nThis can be an effective solution but local authorities\n are not necessarily able to rely on CT schemes as part of long term strategies (although risks also exist with relying on commercially operated bus services for example) The CT sector is diverse but ultimately schemes are reliant on \nlocal authority \nfundin\ng or \non \nvolunteering \nand \nfund raising by the local community\n - or both.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nThe view, that community transport will simply back-fill bus services cut by councils, is unlikely to become a reality. Most services for isolated rural areas that are council funded are likely to continue to require revenue support; that is why they are s\nupported and not commercial in the first place. The need for support for rural services generally needs to be seen as a given; there are clearly exceptions where geography etc. may help to enable a more viable operation, but on the whole there is little sc\nope for making rural services sustainable. \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nFor the kinds of transport needs faced by very small isolated communities local voluntary car schemes can be a good solution, particularly in areas of relative affluence and higher car ownership such much of\n Buckinghamshire. We seek to encourage such schemes, offer support and advice and some limited pump priming funding but ultimately schemes will only happen where there is strong community support which isn’t necessarily the areas of greatest need.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;\n5.1 \nTaxis are more or less universally available, but the cost is clearly prohibitive for regular use for many people. Wheelchair accessible taxis are not universally available in rural areas however. \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nCost is \na significant\n issue, in particular the fact t\nhat ENCTS makes travel free on buses, in stark \ncontract\n to taxi fares or even Dial-a-Ride fares.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nDRT services are often unsuitable for regular commuting to work. Often schemes only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a\n barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs. DRT can be seen to work better for off-peak accessibility needs to shopping/ town centre facilities and services but experience in Buckinghamshire is that users prefer scheduled services and these are cheaper to o\nperate than DRT.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;\n6.1 \nMany public transport services serving isolated communities can never become sustain\nable, given the low revenue compared to costs, and the aspiration to make these services affordable in terms of financial viability may be largely unobtainable. \n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nUntil the real value of public transport is recognised and used to unlock additional fund\ning then local authorities will continue to be faced with having to cut public transport services and the lower passengers numbers and higher costs associated with serving isolated communities will always see them under greater threat.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nThe continued \nhigh cost of the ENCTS public transport spend also acts as a  barrier to continuing spend on supporting rural public transport services - as many councils understandably feel they are already spending too much on public transport. Given the pressure on bud\ngets this view is at the very least understandable.\n&#xa0;\n6.4 \nThere are also concerns over the impact of BSOG reductions and its devolution. This is likely to\n both \nfurther red\nuce funding and raise operating costs for rural services.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
