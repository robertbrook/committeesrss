[normal]Written evidence submitted by IntierraRMG (UK)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The contribution below (in 
[normal]bold[bold]) is made on behalf of IntierraRMG (UK), a mining database provider, whose head office is in Perth, Australia.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?
[normal]Although the direct contributi[bold]on to the economy from the domestic extractive industry is low, there is a significant contribution from related sectors (see below).[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2. How does the UK-based extractive industr
[normal]y
[normal] support employment:
[normal]a) In the UK, and 
[normal]b) For UK citizens overseas?
[normal]This [bold]emp[bold]loyment [bold]support [bold](both within and external to the UK) [bold]stems, largely, from the UK's historic mining prowess. [bold]Because of its once-large extractive industry, t[bold]he region has a well-developed mining equipment and service sector, which now supplies the internati[bold]onal industry.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]eg i
[normal]n sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?
[normal]Yes, clearly. Manufacturers in the UK design, make and [bold]despatch equipment for the international mining industry, and there are myriad organisations in the UK that can be expected to benefit from this activity. These include the importers and fabricators of metal, transport companies, external (local) consultan[bold]ts on design and construction, and banks/brokers that finance the work. Non-mining UK industries will also benefit from the additional earnings and expertise of the mining-related companies and their staff. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Being an acknowledged centre of excellence will [bold]also attract visits by overseas mining companies, whose executives are likely to visit other associated industries while in the UK (eg the London Stock Exchange, [bold]London Metal Exchange, [bold]staff recruitment firms, risk assessors, security and logistics advisor[bold]s, mining engineering firms and metals traders).[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?
[normal]There is no clear direct evidence of a stronger competitive position. However, the improved strength in related sectors (finance, law and risk assessment) is likely to have made [bold]a positive[bold] indirect [bold]impact.[bold] For example, the UK accounted for almost 22% of th[bold]e finance raised globally for mining in the quarter to end-June. This [bold]made[bold] [bold]the London Stock Exchange third only to the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Australia Stock Exchange.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5. What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extract
[normal]ive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?
[normal]There have been [bold]serious [bold]corporate-governance issues at several mining companies listed in the UK with op[bold]erations overseas[bold], and there is certainly a risk to the UK's [bold]repu[bold]tation. This seems likely, however, to be kept under control.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in en
[normal]gagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?
[normal]There is plenty of engagement between the two sectors, not least through the International Council of Metals and Mining. Nevertheless, more interaction is still required.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7. Does the UK have the skills 
[normal]base to remain a centre for the extractive i
[normal]ndustries and to ensure that UK-
[normal]based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas?
[normal]Yes, there is still a good-enough skills base. This is particularly strong in the finance and legal [bold]sectors, and there is perhaps concern that the engineering skills might start to wither without a strong domestic extractive industry.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8. What is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?
[normal]Very positive, in that [bold]the requirements of [bold]EITI [bold]are essential to maintaining [bold]reputational risk, which is still [bold]a [bold]core [bold]strength [bold]of UK[bold] businesses[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9. Would 
[normal]increased regulation for London-
[normal]listed extractive companies result in competition from elsewhere
[normal],
[normal] or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excell
[normal]ence for best practice and corporate governance?
[normal]There is no choice in this matter. UK businesses are highly regarded for their competence and reliability. Increased regulation might increase short-term competition but it is probably essential to maintain [bold]good practice (especially with so-many overseas companies coming to the UK for finance and advice).[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive
[normal] industries in the 21st Century, 
[normal]and is it in the UK’s interest to
[normal] remain a global centre
[normal]?
[normal]Competit[bold]ion will increase with regard to the UK's supply of equipment and services, so domestic companies must focus on the quality and reliability of their offerings. This will be made easier if the UK (and London in particular) is able to maintain its role as a [bold]global centre of excellence.[bold]&#xa0;
