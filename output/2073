[normal]RoSPA 
[normal]is
[normal] a

[normal]registered charity that promotes accident prevention in all areas of life. 
[normal]Our
[normal] mission is to save lives and reduce injury. 
[normal]RoSPA was a member of the Level Crossings Advisory Group, established by the 
[normal]Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission as part of its review
[normal] of, and subsequent
[normal] consultation paper
[normal] on, the law on level crossings. 
[normal]RoSPA 
[normal]welcomes
[normal] the Committee’s Inquiry 
[normal]into Safety at Level Crossings 
[normal]and 
[normal]is
[normal] grateful for the opportunity to submit evidence.

[normal]Safety at Level Crossings[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]There are over 6,000 level crossings, of many different types, in Great Britain. 
[normal]On average, there are 9 deaths, 7 major injuries and 23 minor injuries on levels crossings each year. In 2012/13, there were 9 deaths at level crossings 
[normal](
[normal]4 pedestrians and 5 vehicle occupants
[normal])
[normal] and 10 collisions between trai
[normal]ns and road vehicles
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]here were 
[normal]also 302
[normal] near misses
[normal] 
[normal]with pedestrians and 152 with road vehicles
[normal], as well as 
[normal]1,822 reported incidents of misuse of level crossings by pedestrians and 1,736 reported incidents of misuse by road vehicle drivers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Over 90% of 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk 
[normal]at level crossings 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]recent
[normal] year
[normal]s has 
[normal]been due to
[normal] user error (e.g., not knowing how to operate the crossing
[normal], misjudging the time it takes the train to reach the crossing or 
[normal]not realising a 
[normal]second train
[normal] is coming) or 
[normal]user abuse
[normal] (e.g., 
[normal]driving around half-barriers, 
[normal]not stopping for red 
[normal]lights, not requesting 
[normal]permission 
[normal]to cross 
[normal]and leaving gates open)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]A review
[normal] 
[normal] of fatal accidents at level crossings in Great Britain 
[normal]between 
[normal]1946 
[normal]and
[normal] 2009
[normal] identif
[normal]i
[normal]ed that 1,250
[normal] people 
[normal]had been
[normal] killed 
[normal]o
[normal]n level crossings
[normal] over that 
[normal]64 year 
[normal]period
[normal]. 
[normal]Fatal
[normal] accidents and fatalities at level crossings fell by about 65% in the ﬁrst half of that period, but 
[normal]then
[normal] 
[normal]remained constant 
[normal]for the rest of the period 
[normal]at about 11 fatal accidents and 12 
[normal]deaths
[normal] per year.
[normal] 
[normal]The number of crossin
[normal]gs f
[normal]ell
[normal] by about 7
[normal]5% over the period
[normal].
[normal] However, t
[normal]he number of fatal accidents ha
[normal]d
[normal] remained almost un
[normal]changed for about 30 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Almost all (
[normal]95%
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]of the 
[normal]fatalities at level crossings 
[normal]we
[normal]re road users.
[normal] Of the 
[normal]1
[normal],
[normal]252 fatalities
[normal], 700 (56%) were pedestrians, 487 (39%) were 
[normal]vehicle 
[normal]occupants, including two-wheeled vehicles and farm vehicles, 44 (4%) were railway staff, and 21 (2%) were railway passengers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]The review grouped l
[normal]evel crossings 
[normal]into three broad types:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal](
[normal]1
[normal])
[normal]              
[normal]Railway-controlled crossings[bold]: 
[normal]railway staff
[normal] operate the crossing (manually or by remote control)
[normal], wh
[normal]ich is 
[normal]almost always interlocked with railway signalling, so it is not possible to clear the signals for a train un
[normal]til 
[normal]the crossing is closed to the road. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]num
[normal]ber
[normal] of 
[normal]this type of crossing
[normal] declined from about 4
[normal],
[normal]150 in 
[normal]the late 
[normal]194
[normal]0s
[normal] to 813 in 2006–2009. 
[normal]A
[normal]ccident rates 
[normal]on these crossings also 
[normal]declined
[normal] and 
[normal]account
[normal]ed
[normal] for only about 5% of level crossing fatal accidents and fa
[normal]talities in 2009. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal](2)
[normal]              
[normal]Automatic [bold]crossings[bold]:
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]approaching 
[normal]train triggers the operation. 
[normal]The
[normal]ir
[normal] numbers grew from zero 
[normal]before the 1960s
[normal] to 800 in 2001/02–2005, 
[normal]but fell 
[normal]to 720 in 2006–2009.
[normal] Accident rates 
[normal]are higher because the
[normal]ir safe use depends primarily on 
[normal]road users observing warnings 
[normal]that a 
[normal]train
[normal] i
[normal]s
[normal] approaching
[normal]. In 2009, automatic crossings accounted for 52% of fatal accidents and 54% of fatalities at level crossings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal](
[normal]3)
[normal]              
[normal]Passive (‘user-worked’) crossings[bold], including footpath crossings
[normal]: 
[normal]those
[normal] 
[normal]crossing 
[normal]must check it is clear to cross;
[normal] s
[normal]ometimes telephones are provided to check 
[normal]with 
[normal]railway 
[normal]staff
[normal]. 
[normal]Most
[normal] level crossings
[normal] are this type
[normal], 
[normal]which
[normal] 
[normal]are typically on private roads, farms, or footpaths. 
[normal]The
[normal]y
[normal] ha
[normal]ve
[normal] declined from about 22,900 in 
[normal]late 1940s 
[normal]to 5
[normal],
[normal]140 in 2006–2009. 
[normal]The
[normal]ir
[normal] 
[normal]accident rate 
[normal](
[normal]mostly
[normal] pedestrian accidents
[normal]) 
[normal]is much lower than automatic crossings
[normal] 
[normal]because
[normal] they are not 
[normal]on 
[normal]pub
[normal]lic
[normal] roads
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]have lower
[normal] usage. However, their acc
[normal]ident rate has not declined
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]they accounted for 
[normal]43% of fatal accidents and 41% of fatalities 
[normal]on level crossings 
[normal]in 2009
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]review concluded that the 
[normal]principal reas
[normal]on why the number of fatal 
[normal]acci
[normal]dents
[normal] has not declined since the early 1970s is the replacement of railway controlled 
[normal]crossings 
[normal]by automatic crossings. However, it 
[normal]notes that 
[normal]automatic crossings have a number of advantages, 
[normal]in that t
[normal]hey 
[normal]do
[normal] not need staff and 
[normal]create
[normal] less delay 
[normal]for
[normal] road users. Nevertheless, they are less safe, so a balance has to be struck between safety, cost and delay. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]here is a comprehensive
[normal] approach to improving safety at level crossings, includ
[normal]ing
[normal] a programme of level crossing closures and improvements, risk assessments using the 
[normal]All Level Crossing Risk Model (ALCRM)
[normal] model, thorough accident investigations and an extensive research and deve
[normal]lopment programme.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]However, given that level crossings are places where roads and road users cross the railway, they inevitably remain high risk infrastructure. 
[normal]T
[normal]he most effective way to reduce accidents, deaths and injuries at level crossings is to 
[normal]close the crossings
[normal] if
[normal] possible
[normal], 
[normal]which
[normal] is Network Rail’s policy. 
[normal]They have 
[normal]closed 700 level crossings across Britain 
[normal](about 
[normal]10
[normal]%
[normal] of the total
[normal])
[normal] since 2009 as part of 
[normal]their
[normal] £130m national level crossing investment programme.
[normal] 
[normal]However, it is 
[normal]not 
[normal]possible to 
[normal]cl
[normal]ose all crossings without a huge investment to provide alternatives, such as tunnels, bridges or road diversions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]The next most effective approach 
[normal]is
[normal] to design level crossings that depend as little as possible on road users behaving safely
[normal], 
[normal]because crossings which depend on the behaviour of road users 
[normal]have the highest accident risks.
[normal] 
[normal]An example of this approach is converting 
[normal]automatic half-barrier crossings to automatic full-barrier crossings with obstacle detection
[normal], so that a train is not cl
[normal]eared to pass the crossing unless it 
[normal]is 
[normal]clear.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]Given the dominance of road user misuse as the cause of level crossing accidents, close co-operation between the railway sector and highway authorities and the police is essential.
[normal] It would also be useful
[normal] if there were fewer different types of level crossings as this would help the public to understand how they should be used.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]The level and type
[normal] of information differs significantly by level crossing type and 
[normal]sometimes 
[normal]within a single type of level crossing. 
[normal]In r
[normal]oad user surveys and trials
[normal] all 
[normal]respondents underst
[normal]ood the ‘stop’ signals 
[normal]but responses to ‘amber’ and ‘not illuminated’ varied.
[normal] 
[normal]Participants identified level crossing advance warning signs, but did not associat
[normal]e the different signs and signals with different types of level crossing. Comprehension of the St Andrew’s cross was particularly poor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Awareness of the possibility of second trains was low
[normal], with participants 
[normal]expect
[normal]ing
[normal] the barrier to rise immediately after the first train.
[normal] 
[normal]In video scenarios, a
[normal]round 25% 
[normal]of 
[normal]participants would proceed over the crossing despite the presence of the lorry on the far side. Around a quarter of these people did not notice the lorry and a signif
[normal]icant minority notice
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]but were prepared to start over the level crossing anyway.
[normal] 
[normal]The study recommended 
[normal]standardising barrier and gate mark
[normal]ings,
[normal] m
[normal]inimising the variety of signs
[normal] and
[normal] using 
[normal]v
[normal]ibro-tactile warning
[normal]s
[normal] (
[normal]eg rumble strips)
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]cross hatching 
[normal]on 
[normal]the approach to
[normal] level crossing
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]Other recommendations
[normal] 
[normal]included 
[normal]enhancing the salience of the crossing itself, and sightlines
[normal] to it
[normal], influencing vehicles’ approach speed
[normal],
[normal] preparing drivers for the possibility that they may have to stop, integrating level crossing signals with traffic lights or road markings and warning road users about additional trains
[normal] when more than one is passing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Vehicle Activated Sign
[normal]s
[normal] (VAS
[normal]s
[normal]) 
[normal]redu
[normal]ced 
[normal]the risk of vehicle
[normal]s
[normal] blocking back on level crossings (ie, entering the crossing when the exit is blocked by other vehicles) 
[normal]by 
[normal]60%
[normal], 
[normal]but 
[normal]only in the 
[normal]short-term (the first three months), after which blocking back returned to pre-VAS levels.
[normal] 
[normal]L
[normal]ow cost mobile VASs could be deployed in short bursts at sites with blocking back problems, especially  where blocking back is anticipated due to local events or road works. 
[normal]T
[normal]he vast majority of more severe events were 
[normal]due to 
[normal]misjudgements made by drivers
[normal],
[normal] but a
[normal]lmost a third of drivers were observed trapping the vehicle in front on the crossing.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]mprovements could be made to public awareness of emergency phones at level crossing
[normal]s
[normal], and 
[normal]to 
[normal]999 call pathways for reporting an incident.
[normal] Three-quarters of people would call for help when faced with a level crossing incident, and 70% of these would use their mobile phone to call 999. Only 27% would use the level crossing phone. A
[normal]s 
[normal]only 42% of 
[normal]people
[normal] were able to explain how to use an emerge
[normal]ncy phone correctly phone visibility
[normal], and use instructions,
[normal] 
[normal]should be improved
[normal]. A standardised Level Crossing Emergency Protocol should be developed
[normal], perhaps along the lines of 
[normal]Network Rail
[normal]’s 
[normal]protocol to support the response to bridge strikes 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]RoSPA be
[normal]lieves that greater use 
[normal]should be made 
[normal]of 
[normal]CCTV
[normal] 
[normal]and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology 
[normal]at level crossings
[normal], prioritising those 
[normal]with an identified problem of road user misuse. 
[normal]ANPR technology enables drivers who mis-use crossings to be identified and issued with a fixed penalty or prosecuted. This would provide a 
[normal]strong
[normal] deterrent, especially if the ANPR cameras are visible and prominent. 
[normal]CCTV can provide powerful images to educa
[normal]te road
[normal] users about the dangers of 
[normal]mis
[normal]use
[normal] of level crossings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety [bold]at level crossings?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]L
[normal]evel crossings represent a growing proportion of the 
[normal]all railway deaths
[normal]. According to the review (mentioned above)
[normal], by 
[normal]2009 
[normal]deaths at level crossings 
[normal]repre
[normal]sented 46% of all railway 
[normal]fatal
[normal]ities
[normal] (excluding trespassers and suicides) – 
[normal]it was 11% in 1946 - 1950
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore, improving safety at level crossings should be one of the top safety priorities for the rail budget.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]Given the fact that road users are the main cause of most level crossing accidents, there is a case for road 
[normal]budgets being used to help fund safety improvements at level crossings. The difficulty is that level crossing crashes and casualties are a very small proportion of overall road accidents and casualties (even though they are a major proportion of railway ac
[normal]cidents and casualties). Therefore, it is natural tha
[normal]t road safety budgets are focus
[normal]ed on the main road safety issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]              
[normal]However, t
[normal]he railways, highway authorities, police and HSE need to work closely together to ensure a consistent and integrated appro
[normal]ach to level crossing safety, b
[normal]o
[normal]th in terms of national policy and local policy at level crossing sites.
[normal] 
[normal]Now that some 
[normal]responsibility for public health 
[normal]has been
[normal] transferred to local authorities, 
[normal]in England, t
[normal]he
[normal]re 
[normal]should 
[normal]also be 
[normal]opportunities for 
[normal]closer working with public health 
[normal]services.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]              
[normal]Mis
[normal]use
[normal] of level crossings by drivers should be treated as a serious criminal off
[normal]ence
[normal] because t
[normal]he potential 
[normal]to cause a catastrophic accident, resulting in multiple fatalities
[normal],
[normal] is clearly high. A collision between a train and a car at a level crossing in 2004 caus
[normal]ed 7 deaths. The law and the penalties should reflect this level of risk.
[normal] R
[normal]oSPA 
[normal]believes
[normal] that 
[normal]current 
[normal]road traffic offences should continue to regulate the conduct of drivers at level crossings
[normal] that cross roads
[normal]; i
[normal]t seems unnecessary to create new offences
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]              
[normal]However, 
[normal]there is a case for new offences related to pedestrian behaviour at level crossings
[normal] because r
[normal]oad traffic offences do not, in general, regulate the conduct of pedestrians. 
[normal]In 2012/1
[normal]3, 4
[normal] pedestrians were killed at level crossings
[normal], 302 were involved in near misses with trains at level crossings and 1,822 incidents of pedestrian misuse of level crossings were reported. 
[normal]The RSSB has 
[normal]estimated
[normal] that the risk of death or serious injury to pedestrians makes up 77% of the total risk to th
[normal]ose crossing the railway at level crossings
[normal]. A
[normal] large proportion of this risk occurs at footpath crossings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Therefore, 
[normal]RoSPA believes that there is a case for 
[normal]new offences that would apply to pedestrians who deliberately mis-use level crossing. However,
[normal] it 
[normal]must be made 
[normal]clear 
[normal]at the crossings 
[normal]when and how 
[normal]pedestrians 
[normal]should cross
[normal] so that 
[normal]they 
[normal]do not 
[normal]face charges for reasonable mistakes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]It is important that laws and penalties act as a deterrent, which means that they have to be widely known, 
[normal]and 
[normal]there
[normal] must also be a perception that those who breach the laws are likely to be detected and prosecuted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]25
[normal]              
[normal]As stated in 
[normal]our
[normal] response
[normal] to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission
[normal]’s
[normal] 2010 consultation paper
[normal] RoSPA thinks that t
[normal]he regulation of safety at level crossings should be governed by the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.
[normal] 
[normal]However, g
[normal]iven that railways and level crossings are a specialised area of knowledge and practice, 
[normal]we
[normal] agre
[normal]e
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]with the 
[normal]provisional proposal
[normal] in the consultation paper
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]that ORR, as the safety regulator for the railways, should remain as the body with overall responsibility for safety regulation at level crossings.
[normal]’ 
[normal]Following this consultation, 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]draft Bill and 
[normal]Regulations under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 are being produced.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26
[normal]              
[normal]H
[normal]ighway a
[normal]uthorities also have 
[normal]duties to ensure the roads 
[normal]near level crossing 
[normal]are safe to use, 
[normal]and 
[normal]appropriate signs and road markings are provided
[normal]. 
[normal]As stated in paragraphs 21 – 25 above, RoSPA believes that deliberate mis-use of level crossings by road users should be treated as a serious criminal offence under road 
[normal]traf
[normal]fic law
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]Co-ordination between
[normal] all the agencies involved
[normal] is essential. 
[normal]Neithe
[normal]r the rail sector nor the HSE have the necessary expertise (or resources) to manage the highways around level crossings and highway authorities and the police do not have the necessary expertise (or resources) to manage the railway side of level crossings.
[normal] 
[normal]Very clear working relationships and protocols between the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
[normal], 
[normal]the Office of Rail Regulation (
[normal]ORR)
[normal], Network Rail, 
[normal]highway authorit
[normal]ies, 
[normal]road safety practitioners
[normal] and the 
[normal]police is 
[normal]crucial.
[normal] A National Level Crossing Safety Strategy 
[normal](similar to one produced in Australia
[normal]) 
[normal]might help co
[normal]-o
[normal]rdinate the activities of all these agencies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]28
[normal]              
[normal]Raising public awareness is 
[normal]difficult to achieve and maintain without the funds to conduct sustained publicity and education campaigns, involving television, cinema, radio, online, social media and print adverts and resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29
[normal]              
[normal]A wide range of education and campaign materials ar
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]available
[normal], including Network Rail’s ‘Don’t Run The Risk’ campaign. Other 
[normal]example
[normal]s include
[normal] the 
[normal]Office of Rail Regulation
[normal]’s
[normal] guide to using level crossings safely
[normal], which is
[normal] aimed at pedestrians and motorists.
[normal] 
[normal]A range of school 
[normal]resources
[normal] and other materials for parents, level crossing users and youth groups are published by Network
[normal] Rail.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30
[normal]              
[normal]Advice is, of course, only useful if it is widely disseminated and promoted and reaches its intended audience. The ORR 
[normal]and Network Rail 
[normal]should work
[normal] closely with Local Authority Road Safety Officers, other road safety and road user organisations
[normal], and public health practitioners,
[normal] to 
[normal]increase the use 
[normal]of the
[normal]ir campaigns and resources
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]LASER 
[normal]Alliance
[normal],
[normal] which is 
[normal]hosted by RoSPA
[normal], and is commi
[normal]tted to
[normal] helping people learn how to make responsible decisions about safety and risk
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] a useful role to play in promoting level crossing safety, in conjunction with road and railway safety partners. 
[normal]A number of permanent safety centre members of
[normal] the
[normal] LASER Allia
[normal]nce
[normal],
[normal] including Lifeskills (Bristol), DangerPoint (North Wales), Flashpoint (Bodmin), Safeside (Birmingham), Risk Factory (Edinburgh), Warning Zone (Leicester)
[normal],
[normal] have scenarios and distribute educational 
[normal]resources about railway safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evaluation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]Evaluation is a 
[normal]key way 
[normal]of
[normal] assess
[normal]ing
[normal] whether 
[normal]education initiatives are effective, and whether they can be improved. RoSPA, the Department for Transport and road safety practitioners produced an online evaluation toolkit (called “E-valu-it”) to help practit
[normal]ioners to evaluate their road safety education, training and publicity interventions.
[normal] A similar approach and resource could be developed for railway education campaigns.
