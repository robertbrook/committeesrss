[[[-biodegradable bags.]]]&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence submitted by WRAP – which stated 25% of household waste is food waste (7M tonnes tonnes), whilst carrier bags account for 1% (&lt;280,000 tonnes).2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; If it enters the household waste recycling stream, much of this plastic is sent to China to be reprocessed.2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Other witnesses – PlasRecycle and British Polythene Industries – currently have the capacity to process over 160,000 tonnes of waste plastic film in the UK (this includes sources of plastic film beyond 2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; PlasRecycle also stated it was possible to use IR technology to separate starch based films from polyethylene but it is not possible to separate oxo-degradables from polyethylene2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; According to DEFRA, the level of food waste collected and recycled by local councils from households was expected to be 300,000 tonnes in 2013. 2.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; This volume of food waste can easily be contaminated by plastic bags – in Italy where overall organic recycling is at a similar level to England this result in an extra 64,000 tonnes of waste going to landfill.2.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;  This results in significant extra costs for councils, and there is a significant opportunity to reduce this volume of food going to landfill and the quality of food waste which is then recycled. Compostable bags (already used in food bin caddy liners) have been shown to support both goals – in the UK and Italy. A trial run with the Co-op Supermarket chain in Oldham has shown that organic contamination by traditional plastics dropped by 95% in the area where local retailers promoted compostable carrier bags. 2.8.&#xa0;&#xa0; It has also saved the council £2000 in the first three weeks of the trial.2.9.&#xa0;&#xa0; Unfortunately, oxo-degradable bags are unsuitable for this purpose as they also contaminate organic recycling. &#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;  More than 98% of single use plastic bags are imported form the Far East.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, no oxo-degradable bags are produced in the UK, instead they are mainly manufactured in the Far East along with most other plastic bags through a licensing system for third party production. On this basis, it is unlikely that an exemption for oxo-biodegradable bags will lead to job creation in the UK.&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[ ]]]In Italy, retailers, industry, local authorities and NGOs promote the reuse of compostable bags for food waste collection. The primary mechanism is an agreed wording, printing in a large font on all bags advising of the bags dual-use.4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, the process of legislating and citizens adapting to the new system has been shown to raise awareness of environmental issues more generally.4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; According to the OECD “the law has helped to build widespread citizen awareness of the need to protect the natural environment and the fundamental role played by innovation in this respect. Estimates show that 88% of Italian citizens recognise that biodegradable and compostable plastics are a key innovation capable of triggering multiple positive effects”. 4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; An example of an Italian bag is shown below:&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; During his evidence Mr Stephen stated there were three international standards for oxo-degradable plastics. This was not entirely accurate. 5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Standard BS8472:2011 - “Methods for the assessment of the oxo-biodegradation of plastics and of the phyto-toxicity of the residues in controlled laboratory conditions” which as inferred by the title is a laboratory test method, does not contain pass / fail requirements (since it is a test not a specification) and is not applicable in the wider environment.&#xa0;5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no ISO standard specification for oxo-degradable plastics, there is an ISO test method for ageing of film and an ISO method for determining ultimate biodegradation in soil. No ISO standard specification contains requirements linking the two methods of test.&#xa0;5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; In response to a comment by Professor Thompson that the research cited regarding biodegradation in the environment required the plastic material to essentially be cooked at high temperature prior to being subjected to biodegradation testing. Mr Stephen said this was a requirement of a laboratory test. With regard to the applicability of the “cooking” in response to the industry response to the Defra EV0422 report in 2012, the research team from Loughborough used the data in the cited study to estimate the oxidation time of the oxo-degradable plastic in the UK environment with an average temperature of 10 degrees Celsius.&#xa0;5.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; They concluded that the time for oxidation in the UK environment would be 9 years. Mr Stephen told the committee that biodegradation of oxo-biodegradables takes two years; therefore the conclusion from this research is that this product would take 11 years to biodegrade in the UK environment.&#xa0;6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; In Italy, a ban and higher charge for bags has seen a dramatic drop in use of throw away plastic bags and littering of them.6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The replacement of traditional bags with compostable bioplastic bags has seen an improvement in management of food waste – successes which have been repeated in trials in the UK.6.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; The Italian experience has led to the creation of jobs through big, industrial investments in traditional marginal areas. A similar regime in the UK could have similar impacts.&#xa0;&#xa0;14 January 2014&#xa0; Page1, WRAP  evidence to the EAC – see here  Page 5, WRAP evidence to the EAC 20,000 tonnes, page 1, PlasRecycle evidence to the EAC – see here  140,000 tonnes - page 1, British Polythene Industries evidence to the EAC – see here  Page 45, See written evidence to the EU sub-committee D inquiry into food waste – see here See www.compost.it Please see the briefing from Oldham Council submitted alongside this report Ibid, Oldham Council report Page 28, Environment Agency LCA of Supermarket plastic Bags – see here http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/aim-investor/1326-symphony-environmental-technologies.html ISPO: New biodegradable plastic bags.
