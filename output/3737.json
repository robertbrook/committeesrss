"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Anthony Bradley QC (CRJ 11)The present inquiry \nseeks\n ‘to \nexplore how the role of the judiciary would change were the \nUK\n to move towards a codified constitution, and the challenges that this changed role would present\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nThis paper contains some\n \nbrief\n answers \nto the \nbroad \nquestions posed by the Committee\n, and it does not attempt \nto \nexplore all the implications\n of th\nose\n questions\n.  \n              \nThe primary role of the judiciary is to uphold \nthe principle of civil and criminal justice and \nthe rule of law\n by\n \ndeciding the\n \ncases\n \nthat come \nbefore\n courts\n and tribunals\n,\n resolving disputes \nover\n \nissues\n of law and \n(subject to \nthe role of \nthe jury in criminal cases) \nissues\n of fact, and sentencing those convicted of criminal offences.\n  This role\n \nis exercised subject to the \nsupreme \npower of the Westminster Parliament to legislate for the \nUK\n.  As well as interpreting legislation by Parliament,\n the courts \napply and \nas\n necessary develop \nrules\n that \nderive from\n the\n \ncommon law\n.\n  \nT\nhe role of the judiciary includes power to review the \nlegality of \nacts of ministers, civil servants, the armed forces and other public \nbodies\n:\n the procedure of judicial review is \na\n \nprimary means by which the courts ensure that government is conducted according to law.\n  \nThe independence of the judiciary has been a vital \nconstitutional \nelement since at least 1700.   \n              \nBecause of\n \nBritish\n involvement in Europe\n, decisions \nby \nUK\n courts \nare now \nsubject to review or oversight by the Court of Justice at \nLuxemb\no\nurg\n and the European Court of Human Rights at \nStrasbourg\n. \nThe \ncontinued \nexistence of an independent judiciary is a pre-requisite in these areas of European law.\n              \nThe creation of \ndevolved legislatures \nin \nScotland\n, \nWales\n and \nNorthern Ireland\n has \nadded ‘devolution issues’ to\n the jurisdiction of the courts\n.\n              \nThe Human Rights Act 1998 \n(HRA) \naltered the traditional role of the courts by \nrequiring\n them ‘where possible’ to interpret legislation in a manner that is compatible with rights protected by the E\nuropean Convention on Human Rights\n.  W\nhere this is not possible, \nthe higher courts may \ndeclare that a statutory provision is incompatible with a Convention right. \n Even if the courts make a ‘declaration of incompatibility’, the statut\ne\n remains in force\n;\n \nbut \nthe HRA provides \nspecial \nmachinery for enabling the incompatibility to be removed\n by the government\n,\n acting with the approval of Parliament.\n \nIn what principal respects might this role be changed if the UK were to move towards a written constitution?Th\ne answer must depend on the \nextent of movement towards a\n written constitution\n and on the nature of the constitution to be adopted\n. \nA\n.\n              \n The\n \nexisting \nrole \nof the courts \nneed not change merely because\n a written \nor c\nodified constitution is adopted.  \n The\n most limited form of \nsuch \na constitution would simply \naim\n \nto reproduce the existing pattern of relationships between government, Parliament and the courts;\n \nParliament would \nretain \nunlimited power to legislate for the UK, the courts would not \nhave \npower to review \nthe validity of \nlegislation\n,\n \nand \nno special process would be \nrequired should Parliament wish to \nmake constitutional changes.\n   \nThe codified constitution would thus lack any special \nstatus \nto distinguish it from other Acts of Parliament\n.\n              \nAn obvious comment on \nthis \nlimited \ngoal is to ask whether it \nwould be \nworth \nachieving\n.   Moreover, if the written text were to include a\nreas\n of government that are \nnow \nsubject to \nunwritten \nconstitutional conventions, existence of \nth\ne\n \ntext \nmight \nwell\n \ngive rise to \nnew questions \nfor the \ncourts.  At present, a court may \nreject \na c\nlaim\n based on a convention by saying that the convention is not law.  If the constitution \nwere to write down \nall or some of \nthe conventions\n (e g as to the conduct of ministers)\n, \nit would be \nmore \ndiffi\ncult for the court to refuse to intervene if there were grounds for saying that the rule in the constitution had been breached\n.\n    It would be \npossible, but not wholly \nsatisfactory\n,\n for the constitution\nal text\n to guard against this by providing that certain \nparts \nof the constitution were not to be interpreted or enforced by the courts.\nB.\n              \nA\nt the other extreme\n,\n the \nwritten constitution might \nbe \ngranted \nthe legal status that it has in countries\n \nwhere the constitution is ‘fundamental\n’\n \n(or supreme) \nlaw and the powers of all \nstate \ninstitutions \nare said to \nderive from it\n.   \nSee the \nUS\n Constitution, Article VI (2): \n              \n“This Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States\n which shall be made in \n              \npursuance therefore … shall be the supreme law of the land.” \nA\n \nrecent example \nis in\n the South African Constitution\n of 1996, section 2: \n              \n“This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct \n              \ninconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be \n              \nfulfilled”.   \nIn \nMarbury v \nMadison\n \n(\n1803)\n, \nthe US Supreme Court decided that laws made by Congress must conform with the Constitution\n, and could be quashed if they were contrary to it.  The supremacy clause in \nSouth Africa\n provides explicitly that laws inconsistent with the Constitution are invalid.  \n              \nWhere a constitution contains \na supremacy clause\n,\n it is now to be expected that the courts\n \n(or possibly a \nConstitutional Court\n) \nwould acquire the role of enforcing the constitution, since anything contrary to the constitution would be unlawful.   \nSo\n the courts\n, as ‘guardians of the constitution’,\n would \nhave\n power to review the constitutionality of acts of the legislature\n and the \nexecutive\n.\n  \n \n              \nTo\n what matters would \nthe \npower to \nreview\n apply\n?  This \nwould \ndepend on wh\nether the constitution \nincluded \nfeatures\n such as \nprotection for \nfundamental rights\n and liberties\n,\n a formal separation of powers\n, \na \nfederal\n structure,\n the \nincorporation\n of international and European law \netc.\n \n \nAll s\nuch provisions would \nlimit \nthe legislative authority of Parliament\n.\n  \n(The constitution would also be likely to include provisions requiring Parliament to make laws on stated topics – for instance, the conduct of elections.) \nIt would \nnecessarily \nfollow that \nParliament \nw\nould \nbe unable\n \nto amend the constitution by ordinary legislation\n: \nthe amendment process would be set out in the \nconstitution\n, and might require, for instance, \nspecial majorities in Parliament, endorsement by a referendum etc.\n              \nOne \nissue \nto\n be addressed is \nwhether decisions of the Supreme Court (or Constitutional Court) interpreting the constitution should be final, subject only to constitutional amendment, or whether a way might be found of enabling\n the wishes of Parliament \nto prevail over the Supreme Court\n’s decision\n.  On certain matters, for instance, the Canadian constitution provides for \nthere to be ‘\nexpress \nlegislative over-ride\n’.\n \nIt\n \nis arguable \nthat weaker forms of judicial review\n,\n especially as regards social and economic rights, are more acceptable on democratic grounds than the strong form of judicial review\n,\n in which a constitutional amendment is required to overcome a Supreme Court decision.  (See:\n \nM Tushnet, \nWeak Courts, Strong Rights: Judicial Review and Social Welfare Rights in Comparative Constitutional Law \n(2008)\n and \nS Gardbaum\n, \nThe New Commonwealth Model of Constitutionalism: Theory and Practice \n(2013)\n)\n. \n For the latter author, the HRA technique of a ‘declaration of incompatibility’ provides a weaker form of judicial review \nbut one \nthat \nmay be defended\n.\n \n              \nWe may conclude that\n \n(except in the \nunlikely \ncase of a ‘no change’ constitution) \nthe role of the judicia\nry w\nould\n \nbe extended on the\n adoption of a written constitution: \nthe nature and extent of that change \nwould depend on the contents of the constitution.\n              \nThe \nmain\n responsibility for \nall legislati\non\n is a matter for the government and Parliament.  I do not consider that the judiciary should be consulted on whether the\nre\n should \nbe\n a written constitution, nor on what it should contain\n.  \nThe political neutrality of the judiciary means that, for instance, judges in \nScotland\n should stay out of the current independence debate. \nMy advice would be different \nwhen the general structure of a \nnew \nconstitution ha\nd\n been settled \nthrough the political process, and a subsidiary \nquestion ar\nose\n of fitting the existing judiciary within that struct\nu\nre\n.  Plainly the jud\nges\n \nwould protest if, for instance,\n a new constitution w\nere to \nerode the\nir\n independence \nor to diminish their existing role, \nfor instance by taking away the power of courts to interpret legislation or t\nhe sentencing of \ncriminals.\n  \nBut for purposes of the present discussion, enactment of a codified constitution would add new jurisdiction to the courts, and would not take away existing jurisdiction.  \n              \nSince a codified constitution may take \nmany\n forms, no \nsimple\n answer is possible.  However, if the courts are to have power to hold an Act of\n Parliament unconstitutional, then, on the basis that the constitution is fundamental law, it would follow that they should have power\n to quash the offending provision\n by making a declaration of invalidity\n with immediate effect\n.  A \nmuch \nlesser power\n, and one\n \nthat would need to be spelled out in the constitution\n,\n \nwould be\n power to issue a declaration of incompatibility on the lines of th\nat\n under the HRA, s 4.\n                 \nBeyond this, \nit might \nbe \ndesirable \nfor the constitution to \ninclude provision on such matters as - which court or courts \n(all, or only some?) \nwould have th\ne\n \nnew \npower\n;\n whether prescribed procedure would need to be followed before \nthe power\n was exercised\n (\nfor instance, by requiring the Law Officers to be informed)\n;\n whether \nthere would be rules about who \nwould have standing to apply for a\nn Act\n to be reviewed, whether any time limits would apply\n;\n \nwhether \nprovision \nshould \nbe \nmade \nfor issues of urgency\n;\n and whether \na\n court should have power to postpone the quashing of an unconstitutional statute to enable Parliament to make acceptable legislation in its place.  \na)&#xa0;What would be the implications of these powers on existing constitutional doctrines, including parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review?&#xa0;               \nT\no confer these powers on the courts would \nbe to supersede\n the legislative sovereignty of Parliament \nwith\n a different doctrine\n; \nthe \nextent\n of \nthe new doctrine \nwould depend on the various limits that the constitution impose\nd\n on \nthe legislature.\n  \nJudicial review as it now exists (in administrative law\n and under the HRA\n) would not necessarily be affected.\n  \nMinisterial responsibility to Parliament would not directly be affected, \nbut\n the government would\n have to take constitutional limit\nation\ns into account in proposing new legislation.\nb)&#xa0;In the context of question 3, what can we learn from the interaction between the UK courts and the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights?              \nThe conferment of power to hold an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional might mean that cases that \nnow \ngo to the two European courts could be decided by the \nUK\n courts.  This would depend \nto an extent \non \nthe \nprovision made \nin the constitution \nfor\n EU law and the ECHR. At present, \nUK\n courts are required by EU law to give direct effect to rights under EU law, even in the face of a \nUK\n statute.  The position is different as regards the ECHR\n,\n application of which depends on the Convention itself and the Human Rights Act \n  \nThe courts in the UK are already conversant with EU law and with decisions of the Strasbourg court.\n              \nApart from the position under the \ndevolution \nActs\n, \nUK\n courts and legislators have no experience of prior review of proposed legislation.  One disadvantage is that political opponents of a Bill may turn their opposition into a legal attack on the Bill, \nby\n seeking political support from the courts.  Prospective review of this kind is necessarily abstract\n, and the common law tradition has had little experience of \nit\n.  In some contexts, for example if the constitution were to establish a formal system of federalism, it might be appropriate for a question as to t\nhe power of a legislature to deal with a particular subject to be resolved before a \nB\nill is enacted.  But a\n key question is whether \nprior \nreview would bar review taking place in a concrete case when the \nlegislation has \nbeen implemented. \n It would not be \nacceptable\n for cases involving fundamental rights to be conclusively decided while a \nB\nill was before Parliament, \nas\n this could mean that an individual would be unable to challenge action taken in a way \nor for purposes \nthat had not been foreseen at the earlier stage of abstract review.\n              \nIn many countries, including \nGermany\n and \nSouth Africa\n, a separate \nConstitutional Court\n exists.  This court \nis \nlikely to be\n the exclusive arbiter of disputes about the constitution, so that other courts \nmay not\n deal with \nsuch\n questions, and must refer them to the \nConstitutional Court\n. The creation of \nsuch a  court\n \nwould be justified \nonly if, for whatever reason\ns\n, judges sitting in the ordinary courts \nwere\n thought to be unsuitable for, or incapable of, deciding constitutional questions.  One reason \nin many European countries \nfor creating a \nConstitutional Court\n is the desire to include in \na ‘mixed’ \ncourt \nthose \nwith experience of politics and government\n, and this is unlikely to suit a \nlegal system based on \nthe common law. If senior politicians, retired civil servants, \nrespected\n professors, \nhigh ranking army officers and diplomats \netc \nare to serve on such a court, \nin addition to professional judges, \na separate appointment procedure would be needed, \nand \nthe\n political parties would have to agree on means for securing \na \nbalanced court\n.\n \nThis is indeed a wide question.  I have drawn attention in answering question 1 to various forms of judicial review of legislation.\n  \nThere is a \nhuge\n literature about the wisdom within a democracy of subjecting questions that are essentially political in character to a framework in which the decisions are made by judges\n.\n  \nThe model of the US Constitution \n(\none of \n‘strong judicial review’) \nis not the only one on offer\n in comparative terms\n.  \n2\n5\n November 2013\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nEmeritus Professor of Constitutional Law, University of Edinburgh; research fellow, Institute of European and Comparative Law, University of Oxford; formerly in practice as a barrister, specialising in public law; legal adviser to the House of Lords Committee on the Constitution (200\n2\n-\n5\n); a vice-president of the International Association of Constitutional Law, 200\n4\n-\n7\n; author (with K D Ewing) of\n Constitutional and Administrative Law \n(15\nth\n edn, 2010) and editor (with M Janis and R Kay) of \nEuropean Human Rights Law: text and materials \n(3\nrd\n edn, 2008).\n"
