[[[summary]]] :&#xa0;The absence of a strategy embracing all arms of government is making the delivery of low carbon innovation exceptionally difficult – and the current disconnect with policy, exacerbated by existing poorly targeted instruments, have combined to undermine the group’s achievements and business confidence in the low C sector. &#xa0;Climate change remains an inappropriate (and weak) driver of behavioural change and innovation in businesses and homes – and for the vast majority of people, needs to be interpreted in terms of ‘energy efficiency’  reducing costs, ‘energy security’  keeping lights and heat on and the UK infrastructure functioning (hospital, traffic lights etc.) &#xa0;By intensifying the ‘bottom approach’ to complement the current top down approach, the LCICG should engage and mentor SME’s using the substantial knowledge base in government to facilitate innovation, through use of flexible and smaller value funding mechanisms, the LCICG could then deliver incremental but solid steps towards innovating across all sectors. This could be based on a ‘development plan‘ for each of the TINA priorities broken down into manageable steps.  &#xa0;Many SMEs cannot contemplate taking on high risk projects but they can offer a desk in their company. Investment in paid interns could mobilise a graduate workforce with a common mission – mentored via web based tutorials. This would help companies to gather the information needed and help them to identify where the opportunities might be. &#xa0;It’s important to acknowledge that innovation can be difficult and slow work – it is really only in extreme conditions of emergency / war / need that humans innovate ad libitum as a survival strategy. Nevertheless, ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ can be used to good effect NOW  to drive the low C innovation agenda, but it must be interpreted in terms that businesses and homeowners will understand (ie. enlightened self interest). &#xa0;In response to the specific questions posed : &#xa0;&#xa0;It may  - but a strategy is absolutely essential to engage all arms of government around this agenda in a coordinated way – the current disconnect with policy (eg. delay in EMR reform – and knock on effects for market pull) and  ‘warmist’ / ambivalent rhetoric by government, are undermining business confidence to the point where many are asking  - do the lights have to go out before government wakes up to the fragile state of our energy system ? This has recently been compounded by the withdrawal of RWE from R3 Atlantic array which had the potential to bring £4bn investment to the SW and South Wales. &#xa0;The Low Carbon Innovation agenda needs to be framed differently in government to ensure policy and the LCIC group are pulling in the same direction.At the moment for too many UK nationals ‘greenness’ is anachronistic – and mainly associated with a failed political party and logically  green deals  / green taxes = saving the environment = tree huggers = a luxury we can’t afford. The vast majority of UK population (whether business or homeowner) are too remote from climate change to take it seriously as a driver for innovation in their business - much less change their own behaviour  &#xa0;To engage people with the low C agenda, we need to play to ‘enlightened self interest’ ie. energy security (=light and heat stay on), resource and energy efficiency (=saving money), new / growing innovative businesses = jobs) and (by the way) also reduces C emissions = the only responsible way forward.&#xa0;Moreover LCICG urgently needs a strategy which is future proofed against changes in  government – this is too important to be subject to whims of change in governemnt.&#xa0;&#xa0;The LCIC group are doing a very good job but it’s hard to judge whether current measures are adequate or not  – dithering over EMR has had very serious consequences and the concern is that over the next few months we will see many offshore wind R3 consortia deserting the UK for more attractive investments overseas. The offshore wind sector is such a fantastic opportunity for the UK – where else do we have the opportunity for this scale of investment at the moment ? it is particularly galling to witness parliament justifying the UK slippage by reference to other European countries – which they claim are moving more slowly than the UK – not so - four EU countries have already reached their 2020 renewables target ! &#xa0;As above the lack of joined up policy means that policy is working against the LCIC group aims for eg;  pricing of water and energy are precisely the reverse of those which would yield an immediate effect in terms of changing behaviour. At the moment the more energy you use the less you pay - ! Nor are the instruments which could be adopted in the commercial and domestic housing sectors sufficiently targeted or ambitious enough to effect real movement towards more energy efficient buildings. The wealthy and even not-so-wealthy but employed middle classes can currently easily afford their energy bills, so they need to be mobilised via legislation. This is the sector which has the potential to deliver a high number of  jobs into the construction industry and even a whole new industry around retrofitting our buildings stock for energy efficiency – and much more quickly than any other sector because of relatively low skill base required on the ground.    &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success? &#xa0;The LCICG needs to adopt an expanded and more ambitious ‘bottom up’ approach to build confidence and intensify its engagement with SMEs – where after all &gt;90% of  innovation characteristically occurs (whether in UK, Mexico  or Singapore). &#xa0;Noting that only 35 of the 170 applications from energy entrepreneurs were funded by the LCICG, perhaps the residue merit further scrutiny ? a relatively small amount of funding (£100k)  can make a significant difference to the ability of SMEs to innovate especially  when collaborating with Research Councils  – as this is equivalent to one year of post doc time / two years of post grad time. These amounts are also relatively low risk in terms of an SME’s ability to take on additional staff / manage the risk, and do not tie them up in extended periods of writing bids. The public sector needs to lead this activity at grass roots to ensure that innovation is in line with strategic low C innovation priorities and to provide adequate mentoring / practical support.  &#xa0; Without a low C innovation strategy document to refer to,  it is not clear why, but the TINAs appear to have omitted the environmental dimension from almost every aspect of driving the Low C innovation agenda for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy – to the point that consideration of novel (low C) materials, streamlined technologies for monitoring / assessment (sensors/ automated / satellite systems / multi use platforms are all omitted. This is despite the fact that they contribute very significantly to reductions in energy use through reduction in ship time, dematerialisation and potential removal of unsustainable materials from supply chain, material and resource efficiencies and reductions.       &#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?&#xa0;As a general point the desertion of private investors wanting returns within 5 years from many renewable projects, has highlighted the need for longer term sustained support as the sector gets to grips with technologies which are cost effective to build, are reliable and deliver energy as predicted.  &#xa0;The TINAs provide a clear indication of what is needed per sector – but it may be beneficial to break them down into manageable bite sized chunks of work and to formulate a development plan for each priority – then to proactively engage prospective businesses around the issues rather than progress via open ended calls ? this saves time and ensures optimal use of  the knowledge base within the LCIC team in DECC. &#xa0;Innovation is not always a linear process, diversions and unconventional trajectories towards the end game, which can have false starts as well as surprising results, mean that entrepreneurs and innovative companies benefit significantly from flexible funding mechanisms. &#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?               Short term funding timelines undermine business confidence – and make it almost impossible for even the most innovative companies to contemplate carrying the risk involved if other aspects of their business are under strain or to plan how they might interact with public sector to achieve their potential. Essential that LCI team facilitates confidence building as result of interacting with its team - mentoring proposals towards achieving the desired end game should be a recognised role rather than simply as agency to procure the science. Engagement will roll out to a larger pool of businesses and improve significantly as businesses experience successful outcomes. Timescales to achieve effective outcomes need to be of the order of decades not 3 to 5years. &#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?&#xa0;By adopting a ‘bottom up’ approach to complement the measures in place at present. (Apologies if you are already doing these things but I do not have enough information) &#xa0;              (1) go back to the 170 (less 35) energy entrepreneurs projects not funded and check whether any of them could be re shaped and assessed to fit with TINA priorities - whilst noting that this is already a group of companies which have an appetite to innovate and carry the necessary risk in their business. (2) run calls via RCs in every TINA sector aimed at achieving smaller but solid incremental steps in the priorities identified, involving more modest sums of money (not millions- perhaps £100 to 300k). Make sure these calls are supported by webinars via KTNs eg. the Energy generation and Supply KTN  or other networks to ensure wider engagement of the right businesses. (3) put as much as possible into paid internships –the demand is a bottomless pit; every business is unique but could / should have paid intern to investigate some aspect of business which needs improving / cost cutting, energy resource efficiency - plus interns often have good ideas – there is no need for any ‘good’ graduate or post grad to be out of work. Progressing this workforce via web based mentoring would be very cost effective and efficient and facilitate group learning. (4) make the LCIC team much more visible and proactive – perhaps secondments into regional partner organisations, make sure all team are able to attend  appropriate industry conferences / seminars regularly, are out talking to people / businesses to make sure that they have up to date intelligence from priority sectors and maintain an opportunities pipeline based on intelligence gathered from discussions with businesses.&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?&#xa0;              Government IS NOT maximising opportunities to learn within and beyond EU. There is much to learn from Denmark for eg. which as is now well known built its wind industry on the back of UK lead –  also for eg. the Cornwall energy project in 1986 twinned villages in Denmark and Cornwall to map their energy resources – the Danish village is now self sufficient in energy and earns income from its windmill whereas the Cornish village is still in the same situation as in 1986 despite have energy resources for a town 30X its own population; Germany on the other hand has very strong policy drivers through its commitment to a non nuclear future – this means they HAVE to succeed in the renewables sector and this is a significant driver for innovation; South Africa has taken the lead as the nation with the fastest growing renewables sector - when persistent power cuts hit the western Cape leading  to chaos in hospitals, traffic control systems  etc. and threatened the future of its tourism industry SA , government finally acted !   Cardiff city is already having to manage energy use across the city to minimise the likelihood of black outs....  &#xa0;At the moment we have many approaches from international organisations (mainly government) wanting to learn from our research in offshore wind, wave and tidal sectors, and to build their own industries. UK consultancies have benefitted from the R&amp;D / consultancy experience in UK and we currently have a narrow lead in wave and tidal internationally. It is imperative that we maximise our efforts to bring these sectors to fruition in the UK alongside other low C initiatives.   &#xa0;It is incomprehensible that we would risk the opportunity to exploit UK offshore resources (eg. Atlantic Array ) to bring energy production within UK national boundaries. Why is it a good idea to ‘save’ Grangemouth on the basis of fracked shale gas shipped in from the US ? and ‘feed’ Milford Haven on the basis of shipped gas from the middle east ?                 Finally important to note that innovating can be difficult and slow work – we need to be patient – we are talking about re vitalising the innovative spirit in a nation of box tickers ! in our efforts to maintain the status quo we have stymied entrepreneurship and innovation,  so we have to start with education, encouraging lateral thinking, rewarding innovative thought and left field thinking, by  not straight - jacketing young people by asking them to  regurgitate text book answers. This will take time – so a long term strategy is essential.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
