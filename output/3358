[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1 
[normal]Scope exists to make this country a better place for disabled people and their families. We do this by running a range of services, raising awareness of the issues 
[normal]that disabled people face and influencing change across society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We provide support, advice and information for more than a quarter of a million disabled people and their family members every year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 Scope welcomes the opportunity 
[normal]to submit written evid
[normal]ence to the 
[normal]Committee’s Inquiry and would be happy to provide oral evidence if requested.
[normal] Our submission focuses on the questions relating to 
[normal]public expenditure on 
[normal]social care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1 Social care is the support that enables disabled people to liv
[normal]e independently and with dignity. It supports
[normal] 
[normal]them to 
[normal]do essential day to day tasks such as washing, dress
[normal]ing, eating as well as living independent lives in their community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 Working aged disabled people make up one third of social care users - i
[normal]n 2012
[normal]/13
[normal], there were 
[normal]434
[normal],
[normal]775
[normal] working-aged disabled people in the social care system - out of a total of 1,332,995
[normal]. However, demographic changes mean the numbers of working-aged disabled people needing care are projected to rise by 9.2%
[normal] from 2010 to 2020. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]The impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savings[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]Scope welcome
[normal]d
[normal] the Government’s commitment to investing 
[normal]an extra 
[normal]£1bn in social ca
[normal]re in the 2010 Spending Review
[normal] which was an important recognition of the increasing pressures on the social care system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 However as funding for social care is not ring-fenced, th
[normal]is investment must be seen in the context 
[normal]of a 33% cut in local 
[normal]councils’ budgets by 2014/15
[normal] and the chronic long term 
[normal]underfunding of the social care system
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3. 
[normal]O
[normal]ver the past three years, £2.68 billion has been cut from adult social care - 20 per cent of net spending
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal] With
[normal] the increasing numbers of disabled adults who need care and support
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]we are concerned that the Government’s investment will not ensure the sustainable funding of the social care system
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]As a result of these 
[normal]pressures
[normal], alongside an ageing population, 
[normal]many local authorities have been raising the threshold at which disabled people become eligible for support. 
[normal]However this trend began even before 2010. 
[normal]In 2005, 50% of local authorities set their eligibility criteria at ‘
[normal]Moderate’ needs but
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]y 2012, 84% ha
[normal]d set their eligibility criteria at
[normal] the 
[normal]higher ‘substantial’ needs
[normal], meaning t
[normal]hat s
[normal]ince 200
[normal]7/
[normal]8 the number of people using care has 
[normal]gradually 
[normal]fallen by at least 
[normal]347
[normal],000
[normal] (see table below)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As a result, just 14% of those with ‘moderate’ FACS needs are 
[normal]receiving care
[normal], while 
[normal]at least
[normal] 800,000 people with care needs are not receiving any support at all
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 
[normal]Unless a sustainable source of funding for adult social care is found, this situation is only likely to get worse. The 
[normal]LGA has
[normal] estimated that spending on social care will 
[normal]sur
[normal]pass 45% of council budgets by 
[normal]2019/20
[normal], meaning that councils will have to cut social care further or drastically reduce budgets for other services
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.

[normal] Research
[normal] by Scope and four oth
[normal]er leading disability charities in “
[normal]The Other Care Crisis
[normal]”
[normal] report 
[normal]has found that 
[normal]this chronic underf
[normal]unding of social care has had a significant impact on disabled people’s lives:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]7
[normal] But recent e
[normal]conomic modelling by Deloitte, contained in the 
[normal]Ending the Care Crisis
[normal] report, has shown that
[normal] investment in social care can lead to significant financial savings for 
[normal]the NHS, central 
[normal]Government and Local Authorities
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For example, a £1.2 billion investment in care for people with ‘moderate’ level needs would result in:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal] £570 million saving to the NHS and local government
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal] £700 million saving to Central Government:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8 
[normal]As evidenced above, there are
[normal] clear 
[normal]long term 
[normal]economic benefits to local authorities, the NHS and the Treasury of 
[normal]investing in care for people with lower level needs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]recommend the Government sets the new ‘national eligibility threshold’, as set out in the regulations accompanying the Care Bill, at a level 
[normal]equivalent
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]‘Moderate’ 
[normal]under the current 
[normal]FACs
[normal] s
[normal]ystem
[normal].
[normal]4. [bold]The impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budget[bold]4.1 
[normal]We 
[normal]wholly
[normal] welcome the 
[normal]creation of a £3
[normal].8bn 
[normal]Integration Transforma
[normal]tion Fund (including a £2bn transfer from the NHS budget) to ensure better integration between health and social care announced 
[normal]in the Spending Review in June this 
[normal]year
[normal], 
[normal]particularly 
[normal]that 
[normal]it will be spent through Health and Wellbeing Boards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]We also 
[normal]welcome the conditions that are attached to the funding which will ensure a joint approach to assessments and care planning will be taken, as well as there being a professional who will be accountable where funding is used for integrated packages of care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 However, given the extent of the long-term underinvestment in social care, we have strong concerns that this transfer of funding will be inadequate to meet the growing needs of working-aged disabled people and additional investment is needed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 Mor
[normal]eover, t
[normal]he Integration Transformation Fund is predominantly to support people being discharged from hospital- the majority of whom are likely to older people and therefore the vast majority of younger working age d
[normal]isabled people may not benefit. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 By f
[normal]ocussing on delayed transfers of care, emergency admissions and readmissions into hospital, and out of hours/weekend packages
[normal], it is also 
[normal]likely 
[normal]that the ITF will 
[normal]reduce existing 
[normal]problems rather than unmet need. Therefore it i
[normal]s likely that investment in mo
[normal]re 
[normal]preventative, 
[normal]community- based 
[normal]s
[normal]ervices will 
[normal]continue to
[normal] be neglected.
