default&#xa0;default1.1 
defaultScope exists to make this country a better place for disabled people and their families. We do this by running a range of services, raising awareness of the issues 
defaultthat disabled people face and influencing change across society.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe provide support, advice and information for more than a quarter of a million disabled people and their family members every year.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 Scope welcomes the opportunity 
defaultto submit written evid
defaultence to the 
defaultCommittee’s Inquiry and would be happy to provide oral evidence if requested.
default Our submission focuses on the questions relating to 
defaultpublic expenditure on 
defaultsocial care.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1 Social care is the support that enables disabled people to liv
defaulte independently and with dignity. It supports
default 
defaultthem to 
defaultdo essential day to day tasks such as washing, dress
defaulting, eating as well as living independent lives in their community.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 Working aged disabled people make up one third of social care users - i
defaultn 2012
default/13
default, there were 
default434
default,
default775
default working-aged disabled people in the social care system - out of a total of 1,332,995
default. However, demographic changes mean the numbers of working-aged disabled people needing care are projected to rise by 9.2%
default from 2010 to 2020. 
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultThe impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savingsdefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultScope welcome
defaultd
default the Government’s commitment to investing 
defaultan extra 
default£1bn in social ca
defaultre in the 2010 Spending Review
default which was an important recognition of the increasing pressures on the social care system.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 However as funding for social care is not ring-fenced, th
defaultis investment must be seen in the context 
defaultof a 33% cut in local 
defaultcouncils’ budgets by 2014/15
default and the chronic long term 
defaultunderfunding of the social care system
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3. 
defaultO
defaultver the past three years, £2.68 billion has been cut from adult social care - 20 per cent of net spending
default. 
default 
default With
default the increasing numbers of disabled adults who need care and support
default,
default 
defaultwe are concerned that the Government’s investment will not ensure the sustainable funding of the social care system
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default4
default 
defaultAs a result of these 
defaultpressures
default, alongside an ageing population, 
defaultmany local authorities have been raising the threshold at which disabled people become eligible for support. 
defaultHowever this trend began even before 2010. 
defaultIn 2005, 50% of local authorities set their eligibility criteria at ‘
defaultModerate’ needs but
default 
defaultb
defaulty 2012, 84% ha
defaultd set their eligibility criteria at
default the 
defaulthigher ‘substantial’ needs
default, meaning t

default8 the number of people using care has 
defaultgradually 
defaultfallen by at least 
default347
default,000
default (see table below)
default.
default 
defaultAs a result, just 14% of those with ‘moderate’ FACS needs are 
defaultreceiving care
default, while 
defaultat least
default 800,000 people with care needs are not receiving any support at all
default.

defaultUnless a sustainable source of funding for adult social care is found, this situation is only likely to get worse. The 
defaultLGA has
default estimated that spending on social care will 
defaultsur
defaultpass 45% of council budgets by 
default2019/20
default, meaning that councils will have to cut social care further or drastically reduce budgets for other services

default Research

defaulthas found that 
defaultthis chronic underf
defaultunding of social care has had a significant impact on disabled people’s lives:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.
default7
default But recent e
defaultconomic modelling by Deloitte, contained in the 
defaultEnding the Care Crisis
default report, has shown that
default investment in social care can lead to significant financial savings for 
defaultthe NHS, central 
defaultGovernment and Local Authorities
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, a £1.2 billion investment in care for people with ‘moderate’ level needs would result in:
default&#xa0;
defaultA
default £570 million saving to the NHS and local government
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultA
default £700 million saving to Central Government:
default&#xa0;

defaultAs evidenced above, there are

defaulteconomic benefits to local authorities, the NHS and the Treasury of 
defaultinvesting in care for people with lower level needs
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte 
defaulttherefore 
defaultrecommend the Government sets the new ‘national eligibility threshold’, as set out in the regulations accompanying the Care Bill, at a level 
defaultequivalent

default4. defaultThe impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budgetdefault4.1 
defaultWe 
defaultwholly
default welcome the 
defaultcreation of a £3
default.8bn 
defaultIntegration Transforma
defaulttion Fund (including a £2bn transfer from the NHS budget) to ensure better integration between health and social care announced 
defaultin the Spending Review in June this 
defaultyear
default, 
defaultparticularly 
defaultthat 
defaultit will be spent through Health and Wellbeing Boards. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultWe also 
defaultwelcome the conditions that are attached to the funding which will ensure a joint approach to assessments and care planning will be taken, as well as there being a professional who will be accountable where funding is used for integrated packages of care.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 However, given the extent of the long-term underinvestment in social care, we have strong concerns that this transfer of funding will be inadequate to meet the growing needs of working-aged disabled people and additional investment is needed.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 Mor
defaulteover, t
defaulthe Integration Transformation Fund is predominantly to support people being discharged from hospital- the majority of whom are likely to older people and therefore the vast majority of younger working age d
defaultisabled people may not benefit. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5 By f
defaultocussing on delayed transfers of care, emergency admissions and readmissions into hospital, and out of hours/weekend packages
default, it is also 
defaultlikely 
defaultthat the ITF will 
defaultreduce existing 
defaultproblems rather than unmet need. Therefore it i
defaults likely that investment in mo
defaultre

defaultcommunity- based

defaultcontinue to
default be neglected.
