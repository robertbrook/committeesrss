[[[ (DWB 05)]]]&#xa0;The debate on different powers over taxation at a sub-state level has moved forward not least because of taxation changes in other devolved regimes in Europe, together with the suggestion of greater taxation powers both for Scotland and Northern Ireland. At the state level, evidence from the Republic of Ireland and central European states has further emphasised the central role of different taxation levels in economic welfare.My view is that of an economist concerned at the state of the Welsh economy and the way in which taxation powers and adjustments can be a useful and innovative tool of economic development. This submission therefore is not necessarily concerned with the amount of revenue which might accrue to the Assembly (important though that clearly is, some suggestions on revenue are made below in section 4) but with the usefulness and appropriateness of using (limited) taxation powers as an instrument of economic development.

[[[Preamble:]]]The principle of different rates of taxation within the UK is already established. Different rates are applied to VAT; individuals pay different rates of personal taxation, council taxes vary by definition upon geography. Both the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly have powers to vary income tax and the power to vary corporation tax for the latter has already been suggested. British dependant territories have different taxation rates, not least in rates of corporation tax. The Welsh economy has many structural disadvantages that are beyond the powers suggested by the draft bill; in reality many of the powers to address these structural disadvantages are already devolved. However, the continued decline of the Welsh economy requires the development and use of a variety of appropriate instruments, not least that of taxation, a method that has been successfully used in many economies that have faced similar problems to the Welsh economy. Reversing the decline of the Welsh economy and introducing growth has to be the over-riding priority of any government initiative whether by the Welsh or UK governments. It is within this context that this memorandum is presented.&#xa0;It is of course accepted that some of the ideas that follow may well be seen to be outside the remit of the current suggested legislation. There is an argument however for presenting them at this highly appropriate moment, especially since the draft bill Section 116B, (1) refers to powers to “…amend so as to specify as an additional devolved tax, a tax of any description…” and(2) “…make any other modifications of the provisions relating to devolved taxes…”&#xa0;The memorandum is presented in four sections –

[[[Income Tax]]].Fundamentally a lack of demand in the economy lies behind the problems of limited economic – and social - welfare and can be addressed, certainly in part, by changes in personal taxation that lead to greater spending power.
