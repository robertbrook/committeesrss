"Written evidence from Terrence Higgins Trust (LTC 60)&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nHIV is now a long term condition affecting over 100,000 people in the UK. The number of people living with HIV has trebled in the last ten years. It is therefore necessary to find innovative, more cost-effective ways of delivering HIV care.\n&#xa0;\n2. \n              \nTerrence Higgins Trust supports models of care and support that would deliver savings to the NHS\n and meet growing demand for services\n. These include greater provision of basic HIV care in primary care settings and use of Internet and peer support services, such as our Life Plus service.\n&#xa0;\n3. \n              \nIn order to provide routine care for people with HIV and also as a result of the withdrawal of specialist HIV social care, mainstream \nhealth and social \ncare services need to be better informed about HIV, in order to deliver appropriate care and avoid cases of discrimination.\n&#xa0;\n4. \n              \nThere is a strong association between HIV and mental ill health. Mental ill health can be a result of HIV, but is also exacerbated by financial, social and other personal difficulties. It is also a cause of poor treatment adherence among people with HIV. Psychological and other support should therefore be prioritised in order to support both physical and mental health.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nThe over 50s are the fastest growing group of people with HIV in the UK. This group reports twice as many other long term conditions as their peers, and significant anxiety about the readiness of primary and social care services to treat them effectively and without discrimination.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nTerrence Higgins Trust is the UK’s largest HIV and sexual health charity, with 32 service centres across the UK. We are a campaigning and membership organisation which advocates on behalf of people living with or affected by HIV or poor sexual health.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nWe provide services for people living with HIV to manage their condition and access emotional and practical support. \nThese include one-to-one counselling, peer support groups, health trainers and information and advice covering benefits, housing, finances, employment and immigration. \nWe \nalso \ndeliver community based clinical services\n,\n such as chlamydia screening and rapid HIV testing\n, and\n health promotion campaigns and initiatives which target populations most at risk of HIV and poor sexual health. \n&#xa0;\nBackground to HIV as a Long Term Condition&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nSince the \nintroduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the \nmid 1990s, HIV has changed from being a terminal illness to a long term manageable condition for most people. \nHowever, \nthere remains a \nsubstantial\n need for care and support, particularly \nfor those diagnosed late\n,\n those \nwho acquired the virus before the \navailability of \nHAART\n,\n those unable to manage their treatments or \nthose with\n \na \nmore complex set of social and health problems. In addition, \npeople with HIV are typically challenged by \nsignificant levels of stigma \nand \nun\ncertainty about their prognosis.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThere have been a number of \ndevelopments \nin recent years\n which present new challenges for the long term support and care of people with HIV in the UK. These include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTreating people outside of hospital&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nGiven the rising number of people living with HIV, there is a need to review how HIV treatment is delivered, as there will eventually be insufficient capacity within the existing services structure. Pressure on specialist services is further exacerbated because GPs often refer patients with HIV to their HIV clinic for non-HIV related health problems. \nThis is due to a lack of knowledge and understanding among many GPs. \nThis is unnecessarily costly and can also deny people with HIV the access to GP expertise.\n \nCare for people with HIV must therefore be included in training\n and guidance\n for new and existing primary care staff.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nRoutine aspects of HIV care could also be delivered in primary care settings away from specialist centres. This would increase capacity in specialist services, create savings for the NHS and bring care closer to the patient. There are currently around 33 specialist HIV treatment providers in London alone. A movement towards greater primary care involvement in HIV care would also allow for the development of centres of excellence which could concentrate on highly specialist and in-patient HIV care and could be fewer in number.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nTerrence Higgins Trust is innovating to provide more care for people living with HIV in their homes and communities. We are running a pilot project called One Clinic in London, which provides nurse-led HIV care in GP practices. One Clinic is a two-year project which provides HIV care for those patients \non treatment \nwhose condition is stable\n and have\n an undetectable viral load. Patients can have their medication prescribed and their bloods monitored by a nurse in a GP clinic at more convenient times and locations for them, and avoiding the costs of hospital-based services, which are freed up to support patients with more complex needs. The \nNHS\n \ncould do more to\n support\n \nthis model of care for people with HIV and other long term conditions.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nT\nhe Government \ncould\n also \nsupport national initiatives that use the knowledge and support that can be provided between patients with particular conditions.\n Terrence Higgins Trust’s\n innovative \nLife\nPlus\n \nservice\n, which has been funded by the Elton John AIDS Foundation,\n helps people living with HIV to manage their condition and reduces healthcare costs. \nI\nt is a model that central government could support for various conditions as a low-cost way of improving long term condition management. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nThe main components of the\n \nLife\nPlus\n service include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nHealth Trainers offer support and information in areas that clients or clinic staff have identified. Health Trainers can support making sense of a diagnosis, managing side effects, sex and relationships, understanding medication, how to get the best out of talking to medical staff as well as diet and nutrition. Support can be accessed over the ph\none or by email.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nIn two years, \nMyHIV became\n the largest national network of people with HIV. 10 per cent of people accessing HIV care \nalready \nuse the service and support each other via MyHIV. Users report high levels of satisfaction, with 88 per cent stating that they are now better able to manage their HIV and 93 per cent reporting better knowledge of HIV thanks to the service.\nThe readiness of existing services&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nR\nesearch into the experiences of people living with HIV when using health and social care services has uncovered a number of concerns, particularly in relation to knowledge of HIV and in some cases discriminatory practices among\n \nsocial care workers, GPs and other healthcare professionals.\n As the number of people living with HIV continues to rise, it is increasingly important that these problems are addressed.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nUK r\nesearch \nsuggests that people \nwith HIV most commonly experience discrimination \nwhen accessing public services\n, with health and dental services being a particular area of concern.\n \nA 2008 survey of people with HIV in London found that one third of people encountered discrimination because of their HIV status. Of those reporting discrimination, half said it had come from a healthcare worker: 26% from a dentist, 18% from a \nGP and 10% from hospital staff\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nUntil 2010, funding for HIV social care was protected by the ring\n-\nfenced AIDS Support Grant (ASG). The removal of this ring\n-\nfence in 2010/11 has already led to defunding of HIV social care, and this is worsening as Local Authorities’ budgets \ncome under increasing pressure.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nAs with healthcare, social care for people with HIV has traditionally been delivered through specialist services. As HIV has turned into a long-term condition, there is now a gradual withdrawal of these specialist services. However, mainstream social care services have not adapted to cater for the needs of people with HIV. It is again imperative that mainstream social care staff gain basic HIV awareness to be able to meet the needs of those service users. THT has experience of many situations where the current lack of training has caused discrimination against people with HIV from social care staff. People over fifty living with HIV also express concern that social care staff will lack the necessary knowledge of HIV to support them in old age.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nGiven that the public sector comprises some of the UK’s largest employers, it \nholds considerable potential \nnot only\n to\n improve the delivery of services t\no people living with HIV, but \nalso\n to\n increase HIV awareness and tackle discrimination. A great deal more could be done within the health service in particular in terms of training staff on HIV related stigma. Many health sector employees already receive HIV training from a health and safety perspective – but this does not look at the issue in the round and in some ways could be seen to exacerbate stigma by reducing HIV to an occupational hazard concern and thereby dehumanising the issue in the process.\n \nWe would welcome a Government initiative,\n \nworking in partnership with people living with HIV and representative agencies, to develop a robust campaign to challenge HIV stigma and increase awareness in public services.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nInvesting in strong self management programmes can also improve the situation by supporting people to be more confident and visible around their HIV status and assisting disclosure in key settings.\n \nThe Equality Act (2010) gives people living with HIV some means of redress. However, taking legal action after discrimination has occurred is an arduous and potentially costly exercise. Reductions to the legal aid budget have reduced the capability for people living with HIV to take action against service providers, and this in turn devalues equalities legislation.\n&#xa0;\nAgeing&#xa0;5.1\n              \nTerrence Higgins Trust’s \n50 Plus\n national study of people ageing with HIV\n discovered a range of particular challenges faced by people over 50 with HIV, including\n \nphysical, mental, financial and social problems.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nCompared with their peers, older people with HIV have twice as many other long-term health conditions. Only a third from our study reported they had no other long-term conditions, \nwhich contrasts sharply with the 57% of adults aged 45–74 in Great Britain who had none (Office for National Statistics, 2010). The most common conditions were high blood pressure, arthritis and neurological conditions. Heart disease and diabetes were also common. These conditions are associated with both the long-term effects of HIV treatment as well as ageing\n in general\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nAgain, many \nr\ne\nspondents to the study\n expressed anxiety about needing to use home care or residential care because of perceived, and sometimes experienced, prejudice and ignorance about HIV within these services. Providers of social care services to older people need to train their staff and define good practice in management of clients with HIV, while funders should ensure this is included amongst quality measures. Personalised care budgets could, again, drive change if older people used their purchasing power to choose HIV and gay-friendly providers.\n&#xa0;\nMental health&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nAccording to \na \nrecent study\n of over 2,000 people with HIV in UK, one in four had clinical depression. Unemployment, poverty and lack of a support system of friends and relatives are strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, patients with depression were less likely to be adherent and to have an undetectable viral load than other people in the study. Depression and other mental health issues have been linked to HIV treatment problems before but this is the first study to look specifically at the situation in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \n27\n% of respondents had a depressive disorder from t\nhe responses. Moreover, for 19\n% of respondents this was a major depressive disorder. \n15\n% of employed people \nhad symptoms, whereas 43\n% of \nthose who were unemployed and 53\n% of those unable to work due to sickness or disability had symptoms. Those with enough money \nto cover basic needs reached 13\n% with depressive symptoms, but among those who said they only s\nometimes had enough money, 43\n% had symptoms. Those who could never cove\nr their basic needs reached 53\n% with depression. There was also a clear relationship between degrees of social support and depressive symptoms.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThe researchers also found an association between depressive symptoms and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Among those saying that they had missed no drug do\nses over the past two weeks, 24\n% \nhad depression. Among those \nwh\no missed three or more doses, 42% were depressed. \nIncreasing depression severity scores were associated with higher rates of detectable virus.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nIt is therefore important that psychological support is better prioritised as part of care for people living with HIV. It is equally necessary to address other underlying causes of mental ill health by providing social support and advocacy to address problems related to immigration, poverty, employment and discrimination.\n \nThe complexity of issues faced by some minority groups affected by HIV, for example those caught up in or exiting the asylum system, requires a particularly coordinated approach. Services including welfare rights advice, employment support and immigration advocacy have been commissioned in the past by PCTs.\n As commissioning of HIV treatment and care has become the responsibility of NHS England, t\nhere is no clear home for these services within current commissioning arrangements and we are anxious that many will be lost and vulnerable people living with HIV will lose important sources of support, leading to a damaging impact on their mental and physical health.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The People Living with HIV Stigma Index, November 2010\n Power L, Bell M, and Freemantle L, \nA national study of ageing and HIV (50 Plus)\n, September 2010, http://www.tht.org.uk/~/media/Files/Publications/Policy/50-plus-final-report.ashx\n Lampe F et al. \nDepression and \nvirological\n status among UK HIV outpatients: results from a multi centre study\n. 18th Annual Conference of the British HIV Association, Birmingham, abstract O10, 2012.\n"
