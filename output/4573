[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1 [bold]The evidence presented in this paper is based on research which involved conducting 30 interviews with local authority officers, 
[normal]academy 
[normal]sponsors, 
[normal]academy 
[normal]principals and chairs of governors. Interviews 
[normal]explored
[normal] the local implementation of the academies policy in two local authority case study areas and were conducted between September 2012 and April 2013. 
[normal]The research focused on
[normal] the
[normal] implementation of the
[normal] academies policy in secondary schools. The first case study is a Metropolitan authority in the North-West of England (hereafter referred to as NW-LA). The research 
[normal]in NW-LA 
[normal]focused on interviewing principals and sponsors of academies which were set up under the New Labour government as well as local authority officers
[normal] (current and retired)
[normal]. The second case study is a shire county in the East of England (hereafter referred to as E-LA) which has amongst the highest number of secondary
[normal] school
[normal] converters in the country. Interviews conducted in E-LA focused on principals and chairs of governors of converter academies and 
[normal]current
[normal] 
[normal]local authority officers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The research is part of a PhD project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council 
[normal][grant number ESI01943X/1].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2[bold] [bold]This submission focuses on 3 aspects highlighted by the inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1 [bold]Interviews with local authority officers, academy principals and academy chairs of governors in E-LA explored the reasoning behind schools’ decisions to convert. The three key reasons stated were: 
[normal](1) 
[normal]financial incentives,
[normal] (2)
[normal] fear of isolation and lack of resources, and 
[normal](3) 
[normal]reputational risk.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2 [bold]Financial incentive
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]as
[normal] a governor it’s hard to argue with nearly £1 million going into your school’s infrastructure.” (Academy Chair of Governors)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.3 [bold]The E-LA academies considered in the research converted between March 2011 and February 2012. They therefore received the Local Authority Central Spent Equivalent Grant (LACSEG) before it w
[normal]as reformed in April 2013 (when 
[normal]the LACSEG
[normal] was recalculated,
[normal] 
[normal]resulting
[normal] in 
[normal]the reduction of many
[normal] schools
[normal]’ LACSEG funding
[normal]). All interviewees (working in both the local authority and academies) cited the financial advantages of converting to academy status as being
[normal] either
[normal] the most decisive
[normal] factor
[normal] or amongst the most significant 
[normal]considerations when
[normal] choosing to convert.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4 [bold]This extra money is described as making the policy difficult to argue with and as putting schools in a position where they felt they could not afford 
[normal]not
[normal] to become an academy. Indeed, the incentives are described in 
[normal]a way which
[normal] suggests schools felt they were almost left with 
[normal]no choice
[normal] about whether to become involved in the academies policy or not. This, importantly, clashes with the policy’s official narrative of giving greater agency and autonomy to individual schools – instead of feeling empowered to be given a choice over whether to implement a policy, 
[normal]many 
[normal]local actors reflect that in practice they were unable to turn down the option of converting to an academy in light of the financial rewards this would bring to their school. In addition, this explanation 
[normal]for
[normal] conversion is at odds with the 
[normal]DfE
[normal] clearly stating that 
[normal]becoming an academy should not bring about a financial advantage or disadvantage to a school.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.5 [bold]Risk of isolation / lack of resources
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]you
[normal] have to think about what will happen if we 
[normal]don’t
[normal] do this [convert to an academy]. And we could become a very isolated school.” (Academy Principal)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.6 [bold]Local authority 
[normal]officers
[normal], 
[normal]academy
[normal] principals and 
[normal]chairs of 
[normal]governors revealed another factor that affected schools’ decision to convert to academy status was that they anticipated the majority of secondary school
[normal]s in the local authority area would
[normal] convert. The fear and sense of risk associated with being in the minority of schools that were not an academy were significant. This concern was based on 
[normal]the 
[normal]reasoning that if most schools in the local authority converted to academies the local authority itself would be left with limited resources, leading to a reduced ability to support the remaining schools for which it is 
[normal]still 
[normal]accountable.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.7 [bold]Similar to the issue of financial incentives, this sense of risk relating to isolation and lack of resources was characterised by a sense that, while schools were officially given a choice over whether to convert to academy status or not, in actual fact they felt that they had very little choice due to anticipating a situation where they would be disadvantaged by not converting.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.8 [bold]Reputational Risk
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]there
[normal] was a sense that good schools were becoming academies. 
[normal]Erm
[normal], it was sort of out there in the ether. And therefore you can’t help but feel, ‘
[normal]we’re
[normal] a good school, we ought to become one too’ […]” (Academy Principal)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9[bold] 
[normal]Another perceived risk associated with not embracing the academies policy was related to the reputation of schools. This factor was emphasised less compared to other considerations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]owever
[normal],
[normal] schools accepted that converter academies come with a reputation of being higher-achieving
[normal] schools
[normal] and therefore felt that their own reputations could be at risk if they did not take on the academy label. Again, interviewees 
[normal]placed emphasis on
[normal] what could happen if their school did 
[normal]not
[normal] convert to academy status rather than discussing any anticipated changes related to the choice of converting.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.10 [bold]Summary
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he case study of converter academies in E-LA reveals how schools’ choice to convert was largely based on a sense that financial gains were too 
[normal]substantial
[normal] to turn down and the 
[normal]perceived 
[normal]risks of 
[normal]not
[normal] converting were too great. These justifications for converting sharply contrast with the official narrative of the academies policy 
[normal]which states that
[normal] converters will choose to convert exclusively on the grounds that they will be able to enjoy greater freedoms.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 
[normal]The research 
[normal]also 
[normal]focused on the nature of the role played by sponsors in academies
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A key point to emerge
[normal] was that in this particular case sponsors needed to be understood in terms of the position they occupy in the local area.
[normal] 
[normal]Firstly, all interviewees described their decision to become sponsors as being inextricably linked to the role their organisation plays in the local area. Secondly, the involvement of the NW-LA City Counci
[normal]l as a co-sponsor was crucial in
[normal] convincing sponsors to become involved with the academies programme. Finally, sponsors demonstrated that their activities often reflected the policy priorities of the NW-LA City Council. I have analysed these issues and 
[normal]examined 
[normal]how NW-LA sponsors govern academies in greater detail elsewhere (see 
[normal]Papanastasiou
[normal] (2013)
[normal];
[normal] reference below).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Another way in which the local 
[normal]nature
[normal] of NW-LA sponsors is 
[normal]demonstrated
[normal] relates to their collaboration with principals during the planning stages of the academies. While the NW-LA academies were being set up
[normal],
[normal] sponsors and principals worked 
[normal]together 
[normal]on understanding the specific nature of the area which was going to be served by the academy. Creating a strategy for engaging with the local community was described by 
[normal]both 
[normal]sponsors and principals as requiring careful consideration of issues such as
[normal] demography, local history and
[normal] 
[normal]specific relationships
[normal] of trust which would all affect how the academy would be 
[normal]regarded by the community
[normal]. For example, 
[normal]by
[normal] engaging with parents in the local area one academy subsequently altered the structure of school terms and holidays to reflect the opinion that a long summer holiday was seen as burdensome for parents who could usually not afford to pay for child care, take holidays or enrol
[normal] their
[normal] children in activities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]NW-LA academy sponsorship has also been set up in collaboration with local partners which has meant that influential local
[normal] individuals
[normal] 
[normal]are on
[normal] these academies’ boards of governors. 
[normal]Academy principals describe how this equips them with important knowledge about the area in which the academy is located and the communities it serves. For example, one principal emphasised the value of having an executive of the local housing association on the academy board of governors as a way of gaining insights into housing issues that would be affecting students.
[normal] Principals and sponsors also emphasised how having local authority officers on their board of governors provided valuable contextual knowledge about the wider social issues – such as the nature of drug problems, transport links and child poverty figures – which are likely to be affecting many academy pupils. Thus, the way in which sponsors 
[normal]are personally invested
[normal] in the local area and the partnerships
[normal] they have
[normal] with other local individuals and institutions has been described as equipping NW-LA academies with the resources to deliver an education strategy that is sensitive to locally-specific needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 
[normal]Summary
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he academy sponsors included in the NW-LA case study operate and collaborate in a manner that cannot be disconnected from the locality in which they work. This reveals how
[normal], in order to understand
[normal] the role of academy sponsors
[normal], it
[normal] may 
[normal]be necessary to
[normal] relat
[normal]e
[normal] them to their particular local context. However, 
[normal]these 
[normal]consider
[normal]ations relating to 
[normal]the local context 
[normal]are less
[normal] likely 
[normal]to be
[normal] important in the case of other types of academy sponsor, particularly chain sponsors who can operate across a number of geographical areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]While issues around academy chains are not the central focus of the research, almost all policy actors in both case study areas mentioned chains when being interviewed about the implementation of academies. With the exception of one principal who discussed the advantages of economies of scale which exist in chains, all other comments relating to the activities of chains expressed concern. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]Concerns over geographical spread
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A major concern about chains related to those which govern academies over a large geographical area. There was an objection to the idea of running multiple schools with a single model or ethos, largely due to the perception that this did not allow for enough emphasis on local educational needs or for a ‘local solution’ to be brokered 
[normal]with
[normal]in a school. Running an academy using a generic model was framed in a negative light by interviewees as it is perceived to remove local insights from a child’s educational experience. ‘
[normal]O
[normal]ne size fits all’ chain sponsor
[normal]ship
[normal] was also seen as being ‘imposed’ on schools and th
[normal]erefore
[normal] 
[normal]leading to the removal of
[normal] their individual freedoms. One 
[normal]ex-
[normal]local authority officer described being asked for help by a London-based academy chain which had just acquired a sch
[normal]ool in the north of England. This ex-local authority officer argued that the chain lacked 
[normal]local
[normal] knowledge which resulted in it struggling with how to go about supporting the school. 
[normal]Thus, there is a perceived contradiction between localism and the spread of national academy chains. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]Concerns over accountability
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There was also a widespread concern amongst interviewees regarding 
[normal]a lack of information about
[normal] 
[normal]how and why executives are motivated to run academy chains. The perceived link between 
[normal]the salaries of 
[normal]some executives and the number of academies in their chains was unanimously considered unacceptable because it was 
[normal]thought
[normal] to be emphasising chain growth over the delivery of educational quality. An associated concern is that chains and their executives are accountable to their company rather than the local community served by an individual academy. It was generally 
[normal]considered
[normal] that sponsors from the local area and the local authority its
[normal]elf have a commitment to
[normal] local communities which was not understood to be the case with chain sponsors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]Concerns over governance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Academy principals and chairs of governors argued that they would prefer not to be sponsored by a chain due to
[normal] the nature of their
[normal] governance structures. One interviewee discussed how some chains have started to take powers out of an academy’s board of governors and lift these to a ‘higher level’ which they saw as problematic due to decision-making becoming detached from the immediate school context. This governance structure was also linked back to concerns over decisions not being representative of local community interests
[normal]. A
[normal] board of governors consisting of local representatives such as parents and community members
[normal] was suggested to be more representative of a local community
[normal]. One principal also objected to the idea of being part of an academy chain by arguing that there would be less autonomy for principals due to the central 
[normal]management of academy functions 
[normal]which would 
[normal]normally 
[normal]be 
[normal]carried out at the school level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 
[normal]Summary
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Central to these concerns regarding academy chains is the perception that they 
[normal]disconnect schools 
[normal]from
[normal] an
[normal] education
[normal] that is locally sensitive
[normal].
