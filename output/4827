defaultWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dyfed-Powys [CST0057]default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter dated the 6
defaultth
default December 2013 asking Police and Crime Commissioners to respond the following questions:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI have answered each below.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe this has begun to reduce pressure on the system to produce favourable figures and encouraged better professional judgment. This may result in cr
defaultime figures rising
default. I will monitor this very carefully
default. I 
defaultam
default prepared to accept this if it provides a better reflection of reality.
default&#xa0;
defaultTarget-based performance culture is deeply embedded within the police. Changing it will take time and leadership. My Chief 
defaultConstable is committed to improving 
defaultleadership
default and I have agreed to investment
default to this end
default 
defaultwhere necessary. 
defaultI do not expect crime and detection recording practices to change fast
default, however.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSince taking up office I have sought to 
defaultincrease the 
defaulttransparency 
defaultof police performance
default.Â  
defaultWe
default hold monthly performance boards and
default have established
default an Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny Panel, which assess
defaultes the
default use of cautions. The Chief Constabl
defaulte and I are 
defaultexploring
default partnership
defaults
default with academia, with College of Policing backing, to improve the quality of our performance work. This will bring greater independence, breadth and analysis to assessments of police and local criminal justice system perfor
defaultmance.
default&#xa0;
defaultCrime statistics will always be subject to political and organisational pressure. They 
defaultare undoubtedly useful but 
defaultmust be treated with caution and understood in context. They must also be considered alongside other information, particularly 
defaultqualitative assessments.
