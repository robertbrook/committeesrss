[[[Submission from the City Growth Commission]]]

[[[2]]]

[[[)]]]&#xa0;I note with interest the Communities and Local Government Committee’s inquiry into fiscal devolution to cities and city regions.  The City Growth Commission, launched in October 2013, explores similar questions. The Commission is an independent and authoritative inquiry into how best to enable our cities to respond to the fiscal and economic challenges of the future, in the context of a global trend towards growth driven by mid-tier cities. &#xa0;The Commission will build on the growing consensus in favour of rebalancing the economy and devolving more power to our cities and ask how we can make our cities financially and economically sustainable. It will also ask how growth in other cities can complement London’s economic success and look at the relationship between devolution, reform and growth strategies in London and in our other cities. In particular, the Commission will focus on local labour markets, skills and investment, issues of critical importance to the future of our economy. The ultimate objective of the Commission is to lay the foundations for a significant shift away from the centre and towards cities, and to show the next Government, of whichever party, why this is needed and how it can be achieved. &#xa0;The Commission’s membership consists of:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Lucas]]], Principal Partner, RSA 2020 Public Services&#xa0;Mike Emmerich, Chief Executive of New Economy Manchester, and Alexandra Jones, Chief Executive of Centre for Cities, are also advising the Commission.&#xa0;The Commission’s work programme will run until October 2014 through three main strands: a call for evidence; commissioned research; and high level seminars and roundtables. A final report will be published at the end of the process, including detailed recommendations. Work will focus particularly on:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Skills and labour markets,]]] and how to align decision making and funding of skills agendas at local and national level.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Infrastructure, connectivity, and clustering,]]] including housing, transport, and digital. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Fiscal and policy devolution]]], including cities’ freedom to borrow to invest and to maximise their competitiveness.&#xa0;The Secretariat will be hosted by the RSA, which has run several important and influential Commissions. For example, the 2020 Public Services Commission, chaired by Sir Andrew Foster, was influential in shaping the public service reform agenda prior to and following – the 2010 election by bringing together a range of perspectives across the political spectrum, academia, and public, private and voluntary sectors.   Other examples include the Academies Commission (chaired by Christine Gilbert), and, currently, the Independent Review of the Police Federation (chaired by Sir David Normington).&#xa0;During the course of the Commission’s Inquiry we will publish reports and papers on our findings as they emerge.  The first of these will be a scene setter looking at the factors which are driving growth in cities globally, and the challenges and opportunities that these throw up for British cities. In the Spring we will also host some evidence sessions across the country, after which we anticipate being in a position to discuss some of our emerging findings. If that dovetails with your timescales for oral evidence then I or one of my Commissioner colleagues would be pleased to provide evidence at a future hearing of the Communities and Local Government Committee’s inquiry.  I look forward to hearing from you in due course.&#xa0;Jim O’Neill, Chair, City Growth Commission7 January, 2014&#xa0;1&#xa0;
