defaultGMC briefing note about doctors with criminal convictions on defaultthe medical defaultregisterdefault&#xa0;
defaultThis document provides background information for the Health Select Committee about:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOur processes for doctors who receive criminal sanctionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultOur rule
defaults allow us to deal quickly with doctors who have received a criminal conviction or caution. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny doctor who receives a custodial sentence is automatically referred to the Medical Practitioner Tribunal Service (MPTS), which now hears all cases pursued by t
defaulthe GMC. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs soon as we receive information about such a conviction we consider as a priority whether the matter should be referred to an Interim Orders Panel (IOP).
default 
defaultMost doctors with 
defaultserious 
defaultcriminal convictions are removed from the medical register or 
defaultsuspended for a time and most can only return to work under strict conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther than in the most extraordinary circumstances, the GMC will always call for the doctor to be removed from the register in cases where there is a serious conviction 
defaultsuch as
default sexual misconduct and serious dishonesty.
default&#xa0;
defaultNumber of doctors on the register with criminal convictionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThere are 761 doctors registered with a licence to practise with a criminal conviction (see Annex). This represents 0.32% of licensed doctors on the re
defaultgister. 590 of these doctors’ convictions relate to driving offences. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhil
defaultst
default we almost always call for the doctor to be removed from the register in cases where there is a serious conviction, there are n
defaultevertheless a small number of doctors who are on th
defaulte register who we wanted to be removed and the panel took a different view. There are 14 licensed doctors on our register who we called for to be erased since 2008; 11 of these were suspended, 1 received undertakings and 2 received a warning.
default&#xa0;
defaultDetails 
defaultabout the number of licenced doctors per conviction are included in the Annex. We would be happy to provide further information and statistics if the Committee would find this useful.
default&#xa0;
defaultSteps we are making to improve our processesdefault&#xa0;
defaultWe are about to review ou
defaultr indicative sanctions guidance. This is the guidance used by our decision makers and by panels to assist them in deciding the appropriate sanction depending on the nature of what has been found proven. A consultation with the all interested parties, inclu
defaultding the public will take place next year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor 
defaultserious
default convictions we almost always 
defaultseek
default erasure 
defaultor in a few cases ‘at least suspension’ and we have been pressing the govern
defaultment to give us a right of appeal where we subsequently disagree with the panel d
defaultecision. This will be a major step forward in ensuring the GMC can most effectively protect the public by allowing us to contest a decision by a panel with which we do not agree. The Health Select Committee have previously called on the Government to intro
defaultduce legislation that will allow the GMC to appeal panel decisions when we disagree with the outcome of a hearing. We have been working closely with the Department of Health on this matter, they have agreed to this in principle and have said they will seek
default to introduce 
defaultit 
defaultas soon as possible.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultP
defaultrofessional Standards Authority currently has that right of appeal but it argues that the scope for the appeal is too limited and we agree. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the committee is aware the adjudication process is now managed by th
defaulte Medical Practitioner Tribunal Service which is headed by a former judge His Honour David Pearl and the decisions it makes are autonomous . 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also seeking powers to remove doctors from the register without the need for a hearing if they have commit
defaultted very serious offences which are incompatible with practising as a doctor. 
defaultUnder our rules and legislation only a fitness to practise panel can remove a doctor from the register. In order to be compliant with human rights legislation a doctor would have
default a right to make representations which we would consider prior to removing their name from the register but a hearing would not be necessary.
default We have consulted on this and now just need the legislation to do it. 
default&#xa0;defaultHow we ensure we are notified when doctdefaultors are convicted of a criminal offencedefault&#xa0;
defaultWe work with the appropriate bodies to ensure that we are notified in a timely manner when doctors receive a caution or have been charged with or found guilty of a criminal offence.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe currently receive referrals about doctors from the police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland via the Notifiable Occupations Scheme. This scheme provides guidance to the police to notify regulatory bodies and some employers about arrests and criminal
default record information, including minor offences, of persons working in certain sensitive occupations as the individual comes to notice. A separate scheme operates in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Home Office is currently reviewing the work of the Notifiable
default Occupation Scheme following the creation of the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), which replaced the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA). We are talking to the Home Office and the Police about their plans and if 
defaultthe process were to be refreshed we would expect to continue receiving timely notification of information directly to us. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also refer cases ourselves to the DBS. We have made 430 referrals since 2009 (421 to DBS since 2009 and 9 to Disclosure Scotland)
default. Of these, 129 referrals were in relation to sexual convictions (128 to DBS and 1 to Disclosure Scotland). We are the most active of the health and social care regulators in working with the government and the DBS to develop clear guidelines for referral.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also require doctors to inform us when they receive a caution or criminal offence. Our core guidance for all doctors, 
defaultGood medical practice
default, states that ‘you must inform the GMC 
defaultwithout delay if, anywhere in the world, you have accepted a caution, be
defaulten charged with or found guilty of a criminal offence’.
