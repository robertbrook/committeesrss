Written evidence submitted by the Community Law Partnership (LAI 005)[bold]Introduction [bold]At the outset of this submission we should say that this was drafted prior to the Ministry of Justice publishing the further consultation paper [bold]Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform[bold]. We may ,therefore, be making a supplementary submission to the JC[bold]HR once we have fully assessed this latest paper.[bold]The Community Law Partnership (CLP) is a radical, progressive firm of solicitors specialising in the law relat
[normal]ing to Housing and Public Law
[normal].  CLP incorporates the Travellers Advice Team (TAT), a ground-bre
[normal]aking nationwide, 24 hour advice service for Gypsies and Travellers. 
[normal]In the Ministerial Foreword,
[normal] to the Ministry of Justice Consultation Paper, 
[normal]T
[normal]ransforming Legal Aid :  Delivering a More Credible and Efficient System 
[normal](TLA),
[normal] 
[normal]Chris Grayling states:-
[normal]Tax
[normal]payer
[normal]s
[normal]’
[normal] money has been used to pay for frivolous claims, to foot the legal bills of wealthy criminals, and to cover cases which run on and on racking up large fees for a small number of lawyers, far in excess of what senior public servants are paid.  
[normal]Thi
[normal]s quote reveals an issue which 
[normal]runs through the whole of TLA, namely a complete lack of sophisticated
[normal],
[normal] statistical analysis of the various areas covered.  Where, for example, is the analy
[normal]sis of “frivolous claims”?
[normal]  Who are the “wealthy criminals” and how will the proposals prevent t
[normal]heir legal bills being “footed”?
[normal]  What are the cases which run on and on and who are the lawyers who are paid large sums of money?  
[normal]TLA states that
[normal]:
[normal] “
[normal]T
[normal]he cost to the system spiralled o
[normal]ut of control and it became one of 
[normal]the most costly in the world”. 
[normal]As the UK’s most Senior Judge, Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, stated in May 2013:- “[W]
[normal]hile
[normal] it is true that Legal Aid is higher per capita in the UK than in almost all o
[normal]ther countries in Europe, our Judicial and Court costs are much lower per capita”.  
[normal]Another example
[normal] of the lack of sophisticated, statistical analysis 
[normal]is at Chapter 2 (Introduction) where it is stated at 
[normal]para
[normal] 2.1:-
[normal].........[L
[normal]egal] aid appears to have been provided for cases that do not justify it and to those who do not need it, which undermines public confidence in the scheme.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Once again where is the evidence and what are those cases?
[normal]  Speaking for ourselves, we do not run
[normal] cases that do not justify it nor are we interested in wasting our time in doing so.  We do not provide assistance to people w
[normal]ho do not need it but 
[normal]to people who are desperately in need of it.
[normal]This
[normal] response
[normal] concentrate
[normal]s
[normal] on those areas that we are experts 
[normal]in and that we have experience of.  Obviously we join with our colleagues in other areas of law, including criminal law, who are, effectively, under unjustified attack by the current Government.  
[normal]Paying for permission work in Judicial Review cases[bold] – an a[bold]ttack on the Rule of Law[bold] 
[normal]A large percentage of the Gypsy and Traveller population who live in caravans have to resort to unauthorised encampments due to the lack of adequate sites. If they are faced with a threat of eviction by a local or public authorit
[normal]y where the authority concerned are acting unlawfully (e.g. by failing to follow government guidance) then their only recourse is to seek judicial review of the authority concerned.
[normal] The same applies to many other areas of work covered by CLP.
[normal]The first st
[normal]age in a judicial review application, once lodged at the court, is that a judge will decide, either on the papers or at an oral hearing, whether the case has sufficient merits and should be given ‘permission’ to proceed to a final hearing. In the consultat
[normal]ion paper, the government states, with regard to judicial review applications  (at 
[normal]para
[normal] 3.69):
[normal]We propose that providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for permission (including a request for reconsideration of the application 
[normal]at a hearing, the renewal hearing or an onward permission appeal to the Court of Appeal), if permission is granted by the Court.
[normal]This would mean, in a case where the claimant has Legal Aid, that the lawyer (or provider) would have to run the case to a per
[normal]mission hearing (if it got that far – see further below) without any guarantee that they would ultimately be paid for the work done. 
[normal]Judicial review challenges to local and public authorities are a cornerstone of a democratic society. They allow individu
[normal]als to ensure that local and public authorities are prevented from making unlawful decisions or taking unlawful actions. Without such challenges, local and public authorities can act as they please, safe in the knowledge that their actions will not be scru
[normal]tinized by the Courts.
[normal]Michael Fordham QC has stated:
[normal]Judicial review is a central control mechanism of administrative law (public law), by which the judiciary discharge the constitutional responsibility of protecting against abuses of power by public authorities. It constitutes a safeguard which is essential
[normal] to the rule of law: promoting the public interest; policing the 
[normal]parameters and duties imposed by Parliament; guiding public authorities and securing that they act lawfully; ensuring that they are accountable to law and not above it; and protecting the rig
[normal]hts and interests of those affected by the exercise of public authority power 
[normal]( Judicial Review Handbook, 6
[normal]th
[normal] ed., Hart 2012 p5).
[normal]In 
[normal]R v Ministry of Defence ex p Smith 
[normal][1996] QB 517 at 556 D-E, Sir Thomas Bingham MR stated:
[normal]…the court [has] the constituti
[normal]onal role and duty of ensuring that the rights of citizens are not abused by the unlawful exercise of executive power.
[normal]In 
[normal]R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Fire Brigades Union 
[normal][1995] 2 AC 513 at 567D-568B, Lord 
[normal]Mustill
[normal] stated:
[normal]To avoid a
[normal] vacuum in which the citizen would be left without protection against a misuse of executive powers the courts have had no option but to occupy the dead ground…
[normal]In 
[normal]Roberts v 
[normal]Gwyrfai
[normal] DC 
[normal][1899] 2 Ch 608 at 614, Lindley MR stated:
[normal]I know of no duty of the Cou
[normal]rt which it is more important to observe, and no power of the Court which it is more important to enforce, than its power of keeping public bodies within their rights.
[normal]In 
[normal]R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex p National Federation of Self-Employed and Small
[normal] Businesses Ltd 
[normal][1982] AC 617 at 641, Lord 
[normal]Diplock
[normal] referred to the 
[normal]“progress towards a comprehensive system of administrative law”
[normal] as 
[normal]“having been the greatest achievement of the English courts in my judicial lifetime.”
[normal]And now this government intends to 
[normal]put judicial review out of reach of everyone apart from the rich. As explained above, the proposal is that Legal Aid providers will not be paid for work done on a judicial review case unless and until permission is granted.  
[normal]At 
[normal]para
[normal] 3.62 of the consultat
[normal]ion paper the government state that:
[normal]We consider that the appropriate way in which to address this issue is to build into the Civil Legal Aid Scheme a greater incentive for providers to give more careful consideration to the strength of the case before ap
[normal]plying for permission for Judicial Review....
[normal]What is the evidence that Legal Aid providers are not already doing this?  We believe that Legal Aid providers will always give very careful consideration to a matter before they consider lodging a judicial re
[normal]view application.
[normal] 
[normal]We would question the evidential basis for this
[normal] [bold]assertion
[normal]. [bold]The inference appears to be that practitioners issue judicial review applications frivolously, without having considered the 
[normal]potential merits of such judicial review applications 
[normal]and in apparent contempt of well established funding code guidance as to the merits. This inference borders on the offensive. We assert very forcefully  that
[normal],
[normal] in our experience,  while it cannot always be clear at the outset, practitioners do give proper a
[normal]nd careful consideration to the merits of the case, the prospects of success, the remedy sought and the duty to protect the 
[normal]L
[normal]egal 
[normal]A
[normal]id 
[normal]F
[normal]und. It is a balancing act that practitioners are very adept at performing. In addition, there are clear (negative) cost 
[normal]implications of running judicial review applications that have no merit and, as one would expect, such claims are d
[normal]ealt with very robustly by the 
[normal]j
[normal]udiciary.
[normal] [bold] 
[normal]What is the real evidence? The Public Law Project (PLP) have stated:
[normal]On the Today Programme on
[normal] 23 April 2013, the Lord Chancellor was interviewed by John Humphreys about the Government’s plans to implement changes to judicial review procedure. The interview included the following exchange: 
[normal]Humphreys: 
[normal]“
[normal]Why are you doing it [making the changes]?
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]The Lord Chancellor: 
[normal]“
[normal]Well let me give you a raw piece of statistic that will explain the nature of the problem. In 2011, the last year we had figures available, there were 11,359 applications for judicial review. In the end 144 were successful and all of
[normal] the rest of them tied up government lawyers, local authority lawyers in time, in expense for a huge number of cases
[normal] 
[normal]of which virtually none were successful. We’re not saying there shouldn’t be judicial
[normal] 
[normal]review, we’re not saying that members of the public a
[normal]nd organisations should not be able to challenge public bodies, but what we’re saying is that we have to raise the bar so that we have fewer cases t
[normal]hat have no chance of succeeding.
[normal]”
[normal]A brief look at the official Ministry of Justice statistics (see table 6
[normal] of the document headed
[normal] 
[normal]“Judicial Review Statistics 2007-2011 – tables”) shows that the Lord Chancellor’s reference to only 144 “successful” cases was misconceived. This is of concern, because it suggests that the Government’s recently announced changes to
[normal] judicial review procedure, and its new proposals for restricting legal aid for judicial review, were based on a misreading of the evidence and/or a misunderstanding of the judicial review process. The Lord Chancellor should, more than anyone, be well awar
[normal]e of the constitutional significance of judicial review, as the means by which Government can be held to account by the courts. Restricting access to judicial review – and interfering with the checks and balances of our unwritten constitution – should not 
[normal]be done on the basis of misleading statistics or in an evidential vacuum. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 144 figure relied upon by the Lord Chancellor is false because it only measures the number of judicial review cases that succeeded at a full hearing (as opposed to 212 that fai
[normal]led). But PLP’s research suggests that thousands of cases will have settled with a positive outcome for the claimant in 2011: 
[normal]- after the claim was issued but before the permission application was determined 
[normal]- after permission was refused on the papers but before the oral renewal was heard 
[normal]- after permission was granted but before the substantive hearing. 
[normal]…..Research done by PLP and Essex University confirms practitioners’ experience that settled judicial re
[normal]view cases are settled favourably to the claimant in a substantial proportion
[normal] [bold]of cases
[normal]. 
[normal]It is therefore clear that a substantial proportion of the missing cases and those recorded as withdrawn will have settled on terms favourable to the claimant. 
[normal]A care
[normal]ful analysis of the 
[normal]MoJ’s
[normal] own statistics shows 
[normal]only 515 cases out of the initial 4,074 legally aided cases (i
[normal].
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal] 13%) as having ended at permission without benefit to the client. So as at the end of the permission stage, 87% of the sample of legally aided 
[normal]cases relied upon by the Government had either been settled, had ended following the refusal of permission but with substantive benefit recorded to the client, or had been granted permission.
[normal]F
[normal]or a projection of the number of successful cases in 2011, it 
[normal]is worthwhile noting the response to the Lord Chancellor’s statement by PLP’s Research Director, 
[normal]Varda
[normal] 
[normal]Bondy
[normal], and Professor Maurice 
[normal]Sunkin
[normal] of the University of Essex 
[normal]Unpacking JR Statistics
[normal], dated 30 April 2013
[normal]:
[normal]In summary, based on the statistics 
[normal]available for 2011, it can be estimated that claimants will have obtained a benefit (and by implication that their claims had merit) in over 40 per cent of the civil non
[normal]‐
[normal]immigration/asylum claims issued in that year. This percentage presents a very differe
[normal]nt image to that portrayed by the Lord Chancellor when in his radio interview on 23 April 2013 he suggested that less than 1.5 per cent of claimants are successful in judicial review proceedings (144 from 11,359 claims issued). This serious difference poin
[normal]ts to more than simply a different way of interpreting the statistical evidence. It highlights significant limitations in the official statistics especially for those, including those in government, who need reliable figures on how cases proceed through th
[normal]e system. It is insufficient to rely on statistics that only show how many decisions are taken by judges but do not actually show how individual cases or cohorts of cases progress. This fundamental limitation means that the official 
[normal]statistics provide at b
[normal]est an unreliable evidence base for reform; at worst they are
[normal] 
[normal]grossly misleading. Either way they do not provide a sound basis for reform nor for public
[normal] 
[normal]understanding of JR.
[normal]The experience at CLP reflects the research carried out by the Public Law P
[normal]roject
[normal]. In the majority of our
[normal] cases the local or public authority defendant concedes the matter before the case ever gets to the permission stage. It might be said that, if the local or public authority concede before the permission stage is arrived at, then th
[normal]e claimant will be able to obtain his/her costs in any event.  As is effectively accepted within the consultation paper, this is certainly not the case.  Often, in our experience, a local authority will concede and withdraw the relevant decision (albeit th
[normal]at it might be suspected that this concession has been made because the original decision was unlawful or completely wrong) without accepting that the claimant’s legal arguments were correct.  In those circumstances it may not be possible to obtain a costs
[normal] award against the local authority.  Alternatively a great deal of further work might be required in making submissions to the court on the question of costs and, once again, that extra work may also prove to be fruitless if the decision is made that costs
[normal] should not be awarded in the claimant’s favour.
[normal]The Travellers Advice Tea
[normal]m (TAT) was first set up in 1995 and
[normal] joined CLP when CLP was set up in January 1999.  In the wake of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, new draconian powers of eviction
[normal] were introduced against unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller encampments both for local authorities and the Police.  Despite Government Guidance, most local authorities at that time failed to carry out proper welfare enquiries before deciding to evict an enca
[normal]mpment and failed to have any proper written policies about this issue.  TAT carried out a large n
[normal]umber of judicial r
[normal]eview cases over the years concerning these issues.  Jumping ahead to the present day, it is now very rare to come across a local authority
[normal] that does not at least attempt to carry out welfare enquiries and it is equally rare to come across a local authority that does not have some form of written policy about this issue.  This has come about due to local authorities throughout England and Wal
[normal]es bein
[normal]g held accountable by means of judicial r
[normal]eview.  The vast majority of those cases settled very quickly and usually prior to the question of permission having to be dealt with at all.  
[normal]CLP’s Travellers Advice Team have carried out an analysis of th
[normal]e judicial review cases they have run from the beginning of April 2012 to the end of March 2013. There were 11 cases. Only one of those has so far reached permission stage and permission has been granted. In
[normal] 4 cases, legal aid was granted
[normal], counsel instruct
[normal]ed and we were on the verge of lodging the judicial review when the local authority conceded the matter on terms favourable to our clie
[normal]nt. Obviously there is no method
[normal] in such cases of getting your costs paid by the other side. In one case the matter was l
[normal]odged, interim relief was refused and it was then too late to take the matter any further forward – this was, to date, the only 
[normal]unsuccessful case. In one case the matter was lodged and the local authority then conceded on terms favourable to our client. Si
[normal]nce this local authority had failed to even respond to our pre-action protocol letter they agreed to pay our costs. Two cases were lodged and then settled on terms favourable to our clients. There was no order for costs but, in both cases, there was a pote
[normal]ntial
[normal]ly
[normal] difficult argument about whether the defendant was a public authority or not. Two cases have been lodged and put on hold pending certain matters (and before reaching permission stage). Our prediction at this stage is that both matters look as if th
[normal]ey may settle favourably for our clients. We cannot guarantee that costs will be paid by the other side
[normal],
[normal] however. 
[normal]So the tally out of these 11 cases is:
[normal]Granted permission
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1
[normal]Successful 
[normal] 
[normal]and other side to pay costs
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1
[normal]Successful but no order as to costs
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]6
[normal]Unsuccessful 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1
[normal]On hold
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]2
[normal]Putting to one side for the moment the two cases that are on hold, 
[normal]8 out of 9 cases have either been successful or have been granted permission[bold]. However we have only been paid our costs in 1 out of those 9 cases 
[normal](though under the new proposals we would be guaranteed at least legal aid payment in the one case that has been granted permission). 
[normal]So we ( and counsel) would not be paid anything in 7 out of the 9 cases.[bold]Perversely the proposals in this paper will prolo
[normal]ng cases because:
[normal] 
[normal]There is no demonstration of any understand
[normal]ing of the
[normal] impact of the availability of judicial r
[normal]eview on the administrative performance of public authorities.  The vast majority of JR cases do not even proceed to a certificate as they are settled favourably in their early stages.  But public bodies w
[normal]ould have no incentive to abide by the principles of public law in relation to poor litigants because they would know that the likelihood of proceedings actually being issued would have become minimal.  This effect of the 
[normal]proposal is not considered.  It is
[normal] nonsense to say that individuals would be able to bring such cases without the assistance of a lawyer.
[normal]Additionally, there is a significant failure in the consultation paper to do any proper analysis of the realities of judicial review:
[normal]Concern at the additional costs 
[normal]to the court service caused by an increased nu
[normal]mber of litigants in person has
[normal] recently been expressed by the Court of Appeal. In 
[normal]Wright v Michael Wright Supplies Ltd 
[normal][2013] EWCA 
[normal]Civ
[normal] 23416, Lord Justice Ward stated, at paragraph 2: 
[normal]What I find so depressin
[normal]g is that the case highlights the difficulties increasingly encountered by the judiciary at all levels when dealing with litigants in person. Two problems in particular are revealed. The first is how to bring order to the chaos which litigants in person in
[normal]variably – and wholly understandably – manage to create in putting forward their claims and defences. Judges should not have to micro-manage cases, coaxing and cajoling the parties to focus on the issues that need to be resolved. Judge Thornton did a brill
[normal]iant job in that regard yet, as this case shows, that can be disproportionately time-consuming. 
[normal]It may be saving the Legal Services
[normal] [bold]Commission which no longer offers legal aid for this kind of litigation but saving expenditure in one public department in t
[normal]his instance simply increases it in the courts. The expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would c
[normal]ertainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented.
[normal] [bold]With more and more self-represented litigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service
[normal] in this court, I shall not refrain from expressing my conviction that justice will be ill served indeed by this emasculation of legal ai
[normal]d.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Conclusion [bold]If these proposals are brought in then we believe that Legal Aid providers will no longer be willing to take on  judicial review cases because they will not be able to risk the fact that the case will be run pro bono without any guarantee of payment.  This[bold] will lead to situations where people are deported to countries where they will face torture or even death, where homeless people will remain on the streets despite the fact that the local authority are in breach of their duties, where people, such as Gyps[bold]ies and Travellers, will be evicted despite the fact that the local or public authority are acting unlawfully and where local and public authorities in general will have immunity to act in unlawful ways in the most serious of situations without the individ[bold]ual concerned having recourse to a realistic method of challenging that decision or that action.  [bold]Clearly in many of those cases there will be an outright breach of Article 6 of the European Convention. Additionally there are likely to be breaches of man[bold]y other Articles of the Convention if this provision is brought into force.  We suspect that[bold],[bold] if this provision is brought into force[bold],[bold] then it would be inevitable that there would be a large number of successful applications to the European Court of Human [bold]Rights by individuals who were adversely affected by the fact that they had no access to advice and representation when they urgently required it.  [bold]8
