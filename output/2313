default              
defaultThe 
defaultCBI
default Minerals Group represents the minerals extraction industry within the United Kingdom including all major non-energy minerals and coal. The Group represents 
defaultover 
default500 mineral extraction and related companies either directly through being members of the Grou

default              
defaultThe approximate total value of minerals produced in the UK (including oil and gas) was £37.7 billion in 2011.
default The industry (excluding oil and gas) usually 
defaultextracts between 22
default0 
defaultand 350 
defaultmillion tonnes of minerals 
defaultper annum from the UK landmass, 
defaultdirectly contributes over £10
default billion a year to the economy and provides
default direct and indirect employment
default around 8

default,000 people. It
default is essential to provide the raw materials on which many important in
defaultdustries depend. Minerals are the largest material flow in the Country.

defaultThe purpose of this evidence is to highlight the important role of the UK based minerals extraction industry plays in supporting 
defaultsustainable economic growth
default and that s

defaultExecutive Summarydefault&#xa0;
defaultQuestionsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultcontribution
default that the 
defaultindigenous minerals industry makes
default to the economy is highlighted in paragraph 142 of the National Planning Policy framework published by the Government in March 2012. This states:
default&#xa0;
default142. Minerals are essential to support sustainable 
defaulteconomic growth and our quality of life. It is therefore important that there is a sufficient supply of material to provide the infrastructure, buildings, energy and goods that the country needs. However, since minerals are a finite natural resource, and c
defaultan only be worked where they are found, it is important to make best use of them to secure their long-term conservation.

default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThis importance is restated in 
defaultthe 
defaultResource Security Action Plan
default published by the Government in March 2012. This states in paragraph 21:
default&#xa0;
default21. It is essenti
defaultal that there is an adequate and steady supply of minerals to provide the raw materials for infrastructure, buildings and goods that society, industry and the economy need. Government recognises that where there is increasing and unprecedented demand for n
defaultew mineral resources, such as the ‘speciality’ metals vital for a range of high-tech applications and green technologies, further primary production will be necessary as there is insufficient recyclate from end-of-life products to meet new demand.

defaultT
defaulthe Br
defaultitish Geological Survey 
defaultMinerals UK 
defaultwebsite 
defaultstates 
defaultthat:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK is an important producer of a range of minerals that are consumed in many sectors of the economy. Some 218 million tonnes of minerals were extracted from the UK landmass for sale in 2011. These can be broken down into the following main categ
defaultories with percentages of total production in brackets:
defaultA 
defaultfurther 110.3 million tonnes, consisting mainly of oil and gas (oil equivalent), but also marine–dredged sand and gravel, were extracted from the UK Continental Shelf

default It is an example of the new opportunities for the UK to provide secure supplies of critical and economically crucial minerals for our economy from within our own significant and undeveloped resources. Tungsten is important as it is an essential mineral fo
defaultr use in cutting tools and for hardened steel. Currently almost 78% of the world’s production of Tungsten comes from China. The annual production from Hemerdon will provide around 4% of global demand, meet the demand from within the UK and contribute towar
defaultds exports
default. 
defaultThe mine will employ around 250 people directly, with additional indirect employment.

default1.9
default              
defaultThe national and regional 
defaultco
defaultntribution
default of the sector is more clearly demonstrated by looking at case studies:
defaultCase Study 1: 
defaultCleveland Potash
default Boulby Potash Mine
default 
defaultCleveland Potash owns and oper
defaultates a potash mine (Boulby Mine
default)
default on the n
defaultorth east coast of Yorkshire.  The C
defaultompany 
defaultproduces
default in the order of 3
default million tonnes per annum (
defaultmtpa
default) 
defaultof 
defaultpotash ore and refines 
defaultthis into 1mtpa 
defaultof 
defaultpotash mainly used in the fertiliser industry. Although the Company produces enough potash to satisfy the UK demand, in practice they supply about half 
defaultof 
defaultthis 
defaultmarket with the remainder being imported from Germany, Russia and Canada.  In order to access the potash ore deposit, the Company also mines rock salt
default, which occurs in association with potash,
default producing about 
default0.8 m
defaulttpa which is mostly sold to local authorit
defaulties and highway authorities as de-icing salt. 
defaultThe Company contributes £225M per year of economic activity as measured by product sales.  They support many local small suppliers and service companies.  Half their sales are overseas with approximate foreign
default earnings of £100M per year.
defaultThe Company employs approximately 900 persons in high quality jobs, and a further 150 full time contractor employees. All direct employees are employed at the Boulby Mine with a few
default based at
default the nearby export terminal on the Ri
defaultver Tees. A socio-
defaulteconomic study carried out on behalf of the company concluded that they support approximately 4,000 up-stream and down-stream jobs with a predominantly regional impact.  
default&#xa0;
default              
default              
defaultCase Study 2: 
defaultKier Minerals Ltd Greenburn Surface Coal Mine
defaultKier Minerals Ltd (part of Kier Group Plc)   currently own and operate a surface coal mine in the UK, the Greenburn Surface Mine, near New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Reserves exist to continue until 2022.
defaultBy
default the end of August 2013 site ha
defaultd
default produced 5,492,00
default0 tonnes of coal 
defaultsupplying English
default power stations by rail and contributing to an indigenous solution to UK energy security.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Greenburn operation currently employs 151 hourly paid individuals and additionally 48 sub-contractors are permanently employed 
defaultgiving a total of 199. Of this total 84 live within 10 miles of the site and 116 live within a 15 mile radius. 
defaultIt is estimated that 160 indirect jobs and 234 induced jobs (jobs supported by
default employee spending) are employed
default. 
defaultThese figure are in the context o
defaultf significant unemployment of 10.9% (April 2012 to March 2013)
default 
defaultfor East Ayrshire
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultKier have also contributed £1.54 million (end August 2013) into the local community trust which provides funding to local community projects and will continue to contribut
defaulte on future production.  Kier Group plc has established a Non-Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Centre at Greenburn. To date the Centre has completed 116 vocational qualifications in level 2 Plant Operations plus 6 supervisors achieving level 3 awards.
default&#xa0;
defaultCase Study 3: 
defaultSibelco Kingsteignton (Bovey Basin, Devon) Ball Clay Operations
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Devon Ball Clay operations provide a range of plastic clays unique in Europe and much of the rest of the world. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe properties of these premium Ball Clays and the consiste
defaultncy of the blended products are very highly regarded globally, with exports to over 80 countries and the fact that more than 50% of the world’s sanitary
default 
defaultware contains UK Ball Clay as an essential ingredient. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are few if any viable alternatives to the
default UK Ball Clay component in the UK and the EU sanitary ceramics industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSanitary
default 
defaultware producers regard the UK Ball Clays as essential to their production process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilarly there are currently no viable substitute materials for Ball Clay in most other c
defaulteramic applications. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Ball Clay is of great importance with potentially in the order of 70-80,000 jobs at risk if the supply of ball clay is interrupted. (Source: DTI). 
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTypically ceramic manufacturers cannot carry large stocks of Ball Clay and th
defaultus are highly dependent on the producers for frequent and uninterrupted deliveries.
default 
defaultThe recently published National Planning Policy Framework reaffirmed the status of Ball Clay as a nationally important mineral in the context of the English planning syste
defaultm. 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThis status is nothing new and has been consistently afforded to Ball Clay in the UK since the Government’s Standing Conference in the 1940s, in part, due to its scarcity and limited distribution in the global context.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSibelco’s operations 
defaultcontribute some £15m to the local economy of Newton Abbot and sustain direct employment of over 200 people in the local area, together with a significant number of indirect jobs from servicing through to catering. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe international trade in Ball Clay is a
defaultlso an integral element in sustaining Devon’s local ports, particularly Teignmouth, with between 80 and 90% of extracted mineral being exported. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe export of Ball Clay through Teignmouth consistently equates to circa 60% of the total annual tonnage throu
defaultgh the docks, being almost twice the volume of the next highest tonnage (animal feed). (Source: Teignmouth Harbour Commissioners Financial Report: Y/E April 2011).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe £10m realignment of the B3193 Chudleigh Road currently being developed, will release 
defaultapproximately 3,500,000 tonnes (3.5mt) of consented premium grade plastic clays with an estimated 81% yield (average yield of Bovey Basin Ball Clays is circa 65%), over the next 22 years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the 3.5mt is only the first phase of development, with the
default existing B3193 currently sterilising an estimated total of 24mt of premium grade Ball Clay.
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default              
defaultGlobally
default, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) advise that
default listed 
default extractive industry companies account for approximately 16 per cent of LSEG’s markets b
defaulty number of companies and 22 per cent by market capitalisation. 
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default              
defaultThe development of the UK as a listing destination for extractive industry companies benefits the UK economy in many ways, including job creation, taxation, and strengthening the market
default – for example by increasing the diversity of the UK’s capital markets - which benefits other listed companies and the wider financial services sector.
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default              
defaultBy forming part of a global extractive industries peer group, these companies attract specialised 
defaultglobal investors, analysts and intermediaries to London, giving them access to a global pool of investment capital. The UK’s financial services sector also benefits from extractive industry companies choosing to list in London. Regardless of where a compan
defaulty is incorporated, it is likely to employ UK banks, legal firms and communications firms in its syndicate as it undertakes its IPO (initial public offering) process and whilst it is listed on the market. This provides a source of revenue and job creation f
defaultor the UK’s financial services sector.
default&#xa0;
default1.13
default              
defaultAnother way the listed and quoted extractive industry companie
defaults
default support the growth of the UK economy is though taxation. There are 196 UK-incorporated extractive industry companies on our markets. The LSEG estim
defaultates from these figures 
defaultthat extractive companies on their
default markets, as a group, 
defaultpay £23 billion in domestic taxes
default – more than Government spending on transport or housing and environment for 2013/14
default&#xa0;
default1.14
default              
defaultThe contribution of UK listed global mining industry to the UK economy is 
defaultalso 
defaultwell documented in the recent UKTI publication UK – Deliveri
defaultng Global Mining Solution. This 
defaultstates: 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK has world leading expertise in all aspects of the mining lifecycle. 
defaultThis publication showcases a wide selection of capabilities and case studies from UK organisations, institutions, consultants, companies and experts. It demonstrates that UK companies have the depth, breadth and global reach to deliver expert, effective an
defaultd profitable solutions throughout
default the mining lifecycle and beyond.

default2.1
default              
defaultThe indigenous mineral extraction industry is a major employer in the UK often providing high quality jobs in 
defaultrural areas
default both directly employed in the mining /quarrying operations but also in the downstream industries which depend on the minerals as their
default raw material. The MPA estimate that the mineral products sector alone employ
defaults
default over 70,000 people
default. It is 
defaultestimated
default tha
defaultt
default the secto
defaultr as a whole employs close to 8
default0,000 people. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultDespite efforts by the government to 
defaultstreamline
default the planning and regulatory system in the UK
default,
default 
defaultit
default remains cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. The uncertainty and level of bureaucracy this creates acts as a disincentive for those operating in the UK to invest in new UK based operations.
default4.6
default              
defaultThe 
defaultBritish Ceramic Confederation (BCC) 
defaulthas
default advised 
defaultthat
default UK operations of multinational companies in their membership have reported that they are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain money for capital investments as the payback is much quicker in many overseas countries. A major concern is the cumulative
default (energy + climate-related charges) costs which in the case of brick and clay roof tile manufacturers can be up to 35% production costs in the UK. The perceived lack of energy security – essential in continuous high temperature processes - has also deterre
defaultd some companies in this sector from investments due to risk of damage to assets and / or uncertain business models with highly volatile prices. As a result brick and clay roof tile imports are increasing
default.

default9.1
default              
defaultWhile the CBI Minerals Group focus is on 
defaultprincipally on 
defaultour indigenous extractive industries, it is clear from discussions with
default t
defaulthe London Stock Exchange 
defaultGroup that t
defaulthe UK’s strong listing and corporate governance standards are vital for continuing to attract international companies to list here. Development of the UK’s corporate governance regime has enabled London’s markets to flourish. The UK is consiste
defaultntly ranked as having the world’s strongest standards of corporate governance
default1
default. Indeed, the UK’s listing and corporate governance regime has been replicated by financial centres around the world. Strong listing and corporate governance provides a stable b
defaultase on which a company can operate, and also generates investor conference in that company. Therefore strong corporate governance and listing standards are not just important for how a company is perceived by investors, they, they also have a bearing on a 
defaultcompany’s long term financial performance.
default&#xa0;
default9.2
default              
defaultAs a result of the nature of their business and the jurisdictions extractive companies frequently operate in, they are subject to additional due diligence and reporting requirements compared to companies in 
defaultother sectors making them significantly more transparent and accountable relative to companies that remain private
