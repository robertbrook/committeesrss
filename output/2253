[normal]Jacob and Pat Jowett - Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As regular walkers in the countryside we have often been appalled by the damage to green lanes caused by the use of recreational motor vehicles and sport motorbikes.  The Ridgeway (near London) is a prime example but there are very many others throughout the country where former pleasant green lanes have been turned into deeply rutted, wet and muddy swamps impossible to walk upon.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For this reason we wish to register out strong formal support for the submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental Group and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.  We trust our views will be conveyed to the Committee.
