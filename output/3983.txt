[[[Background]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;3.               Cancer Research UK has a responsibility to its supporters, partners and employees, amongst others, to ensure that it has strong and effective leadership to deliver the best outcomes for the public, for cancer patients and for their families.&#xa0;4.               Cancer Research UK is a complex organisation; the appendix sets out information about its scale and work to contextualise its decisions and procedures for remuneration. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Return on fundraising income]]]5. For every pound donated in 2012/13, 82 pence was available to spend on Cancer Research UK’s work towards beating cancer. The balance of 18 pence was used to raise funds for the future through fundraising activities such as Race for Life events. Investing in fundraising is essential to sustaining income and the Charity’s ability to plan and fund research for the long term. The Charity strives for efficiency in the way it works to ensure that supporters’ money is used as wisely as possible.  &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Employees]]]

[[[ and volunteers]]]&#xa0;6. Cancer Research UK has more than 3,460 employees working across the UK.  It pays the salaries of up to a further 4,000 scientists, doctors, nurses and technicians employed within universities and hospitals.  A large proportion of its £100 million salary budget is dedicated to funding those scientists whose skills and knowledge are central to working towards the Charity’s mission of beating cancer.  &#xa0;7. Great research scientists are at the heart of groundbreaking cancer research.  As a leading organisation in the field of medical research, it is essential that Cancer Research UK attracts and retains researchers of the highest quality to achieve its mission of beating cancer.  It remunerates scientists according to established UK academic scales.  Many are highly skilled experts in their respective fields and are internationally recognised for the high quality of their research. &#xa0; &#xa0;8. The Charity also has more than 41,000 volunteers who generously give their time to Cancer Research UK, making a vital contribution towards the Charity’s achievements.  Volunteers undertake a diverse range of roles, with over 17,500 in our retail shops, 11,000 supporting events such as Race for Life and 7,000 in local fundraising.  They also have a huge impact as interns and campaigning ambassadors. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Transparency]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]9. Cancer Research UK prepares its annual report and accounts in compliance with the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) for Charities. &#xa0;10. Its annual report lists the number of employees (approximately 5%) whose gross pay exceeds £60,000 per year, presented in bands of £10,000. The salary bands published within the annual report enable donors and other stakeholders to see the proportion of Charity resources dedicated to employee salaries.  &#xa0;11. Some of the highest paid employees are world leading scientists who have contributed to major advances in cancer research and continue to do so.  Others are senior leaders with the necessary skill and experience to manage a comparatively complex organisation which, like other international biomedical organisations, demands high quality professional management.  Of the 189 staff members who earn £60,000 per year or more, 105 are involved with scientific work (56%).  84 are ‘non-scientific’ staff (44%) whose work is essential in running the organisation and in sustaining the fundraising that enables the Charity to plan and fund research for the long term.  Cancer Research UK’s fundraising is a sophisticated marketing operation requiring high calibre leadership. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Governance]]]&#xa0;12. Cancer Research UK is a company limited by guarantee and is a registered charity.  It is governed by a Council of Trustees.  This Council is ultimately responsible for the Charity’s strategic direction, supported by a number of committees to which the Council delegates certain authorities. These include a Nomination, Governance and Remuneration Committee, whose role is explained further below. The Charity’s governance fully complies with the Code for the Voluntary and Community Sector, endorsed by the Charity Commission.  Council delegates day-to-day running of the Charity to the Executive Board, which is led by the Chief Executive. The governance of Cancer Research UK is designed to match the standards expected of a FTSE 250 company. &#xa0;13. Cancer Research UK’s Trustees perform an essential role in the effective governance of the Charity. Trustees do not receive payment for their services but are entitled to reclaim reasonable expenses for travel and subsistence incurred in attending meetings and events in an official capacity.  On average, each Trustee claimed less than £1,900 during the year 2012/13.

[[[Recruitment and ]]]

[[[Remuneration policy]]] &#xa0;14.Cancer Research UK’s Nomination, Governance and Remuneration Committee  has responsibility for oversight of the governance policies and procedures of the Charity and also determines and agrees the overall policy for remuneration and pension arrangements for employees.  The Committee, whose terms of reference are regularly reviewed, consists entirely of Trustees. The Committee oversees any major changes in employee benefits including review and approval of the remuneration of members of the Executive Board and the Chief Executive. It also oversees the Charity’s annual salary review.15. The Charity has a series of broad salary bands appropriate to each grade which do not distinguish between function and specific role types, but allow the grouping of roles of similar skill, professionalism and responsibility.  When the Charity considers each role, it sets a benchmark salary range between the median salary of the charity sector and the median of the appropriate private or other sector for that particular role.  Apart from membership of one of our pension schemes, all of which are contributory, remuneration does not include any additional benefits such as bonuses, as typically found in the private sector. &#xa0;16. The Charity aims to be competitive in the market so as to attract and retain the best people, whilst always being mindful of the efficient use of donors’ support. To achieve this it uses external agencies and salary survey databases to ensure that it benchmarks accurately; this approach is reviewed on a regular basis. Positions on the Executive Board are individually benchmarked. While the Charity recognises that it should not and does not compete directly with the private sector in terms of remuneration, its success in recruiting from the private sector is strongly correlated to the breadth, interest and diversity attached to its roles. &#xa0;17. Recruitment for senior roles&#xa0;consists&#xa0;of assessments&#xa0;by senior managers and Trustees, incorporating a&#xa0;technical assessment, as required, to assess specialist capabilities. Where appropriate, external&#xa0;agencies&#xa0;are engaged in&#xa0;the search and selection of candidates. These agencies&#xa0;support the Charity in creating robust selection processes that are&#xa0;comparable to those used in the&#xa0;broader market. &#xa0;The Charity seeks to select the right candidate for each role, to ensure that they will add value.&#xa0;18. The Charity’s current policy is not to disclose the remuneration details of individual employees; however it confirms that the highest paid employee is the Chief Executive. Senior executives do not receive performance related bonuses.

[[[Improving treatments and developing new ones]]]19. Survival rates from cancer have doubled over the last 40 years. The science supported and funded by Cancer Research UK is at the heart of these improvements. In 2012/13, the Charity spent £351 million on research in institutes, hospitals and universities across the UK. It is the only charity that funds research into all types of cancer, across the development pathway from basic biology to large clinical trials. The Charity has helped develop life-saving and life-extending cancer treatments, including tamoxifen and Herceptin for breast cancer and abiraterone for prostate cancer.20. A substantial proportion of Cancer Research UK's scientific funding is provided to its five core research institutes in Glasgow, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester and London. Cancer Research UK is one of the founding partners of the Francis Crick Institute - a world-class centre for interdisciplinary medical sciences, research and innovation, scheduled to open in 2015.  21. The Charity also funds work through fifteen Cancer Research UK Centres.  These Centres provide a national framework to deliver world-leading research, improved patient care and greater local engagement. They drive local partnerships and high-calibre collaborations between universities, NHS Trusts, industry and other cancer charities under a united strategy to accelerate the translation of research into the clinic for patient benefit. 22. Providing an environment in which world-class research can thrive is crucial to achieving the Charity’s research goals. Investment in infrastructure such as in the Centres helps to shape the research environment in the UK so that researchers can make the most of funding from Cancer Research UK and others. It also enables the Charity to nurture the research leaders of the future. The Charity supports research through its involvement in partnerships and networks, both nationally and internationally, as well as funding the work of individual researchers across the UK.

[[[Arming everyone with vital information]]]23. In 2012/13 the Charity also spent £17 million on providing information to people affected by cancer, raising awareness of cancer risks and symptoms, and influencing health, science and charity policies.  It provides information and communicates with patients and the public about cancer prevention and early diagnosis to widen the impact of its research.  It also works to influence decision-makers to create environments that will lead to faster progress in the fight against cancer. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
