"&#xa0;\nFriends, Families and Travellers – Written evidence&#xa0;We are a national charity (no.1112326) working on behalf of all Gypsies and Travellers regardless of ethnicity, culture or background. \n&#xa0;\nWe wish to comment on Clause 21 of the Draft Deregulation Bill regarding the removal of the power of Ministers to require local authorities to prepare housing strategies under section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (including the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers). Whilst this proposal is consistent with the Government’s desire to promote the localism agenda it fails to recognise the particular and urgent need for the provision of additional Gypsy and Traveller sites and the very slow progress of local authorities towards meeting that need.\n&#xa0;\nWe would like to draw the Government’s attention to the recent statement by the UN Special \nRapporteur\n on the Right to Adequate Housing following her visit to the UK and in particular to the extract from that statement set out below. We have highlighted in bold text the particular comment to which we consider that the Government should pay close attention –\n&#xa0;\nIn closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and \nTraveller\n communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Governments and society as a whole. \nDespite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decisions with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller communities with settled communities remains a source of concern. Gypsy and \nTraveller\n communities too should engage more in the political debate and make efforts to ensure that their situation effectively changes. \nThere is no substantive evidence to show that, left to their own accord, local authorities will make sufficient progress towards meeting the substantial shortfall in the provision of accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers and we ask that Clause 21 be deleted or amended.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
