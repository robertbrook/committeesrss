"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Rev Neil McNicholas [FBB0101]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI \nc\nontinue to be in\nc\nensed by the arrogan\nc\ne of those responsible for the day-to-day\n \nrunning of the BBC whether \nits\n Dire\nc\ntor or (and here's a misnomer if ever there was\n \none) the BBC Trust!\n&#xa0;\nTo begin with the concept of a broadcaster entirely supported by \nc\nompulsory\n \ncontributions from the licence fee is truly an anachronism. I'm just amazed that none\n \nof the commercial broadcasters have brought a charge of discrimination against the\n \nBBC, and/or the Government of the day, given that they are forced to compete in the\n \ncommercial marketplace but their major competitor, the BBC, is spoon-fed from the\n \nlicence fee and doesn't have to compete at all.\n&#xa0;\nBut if the \nBeeb\n continues to justify its existen\nc\ne based on its broadcasting history,\n \nthen how come it manages to avoid the founding principles still writ large in the lobby\n \nof Broad\nc\nasting House: \nThis Temple of\n \nthe Arts and Muses is dedicated to Almighty\n \nGod\n. It\n \nis \n(the governors') \nprayer that good seed sown may bring\n \nf\no\nrth a good\n \nharvest, that all things hostile to peace or purity may be banished\n f\nrom this house.\n \nThe sound you hear is Lord Reith turning in his grave.\n&#xa0;\nAlmost without exception the BBC's broadcasting values expressed in that statement\n \nhave long-since been abandoned and before I get into the substan\nc\ne of\n \nmy letter I\n \nwould cite an example from a new\nsca\nst yesterday that proves my point. The news\n \nreader, interviewing an invited guest, began his question with: \"How \nthe hell \ndo we as\n \na nation... \"There is absolutely no need for such coarsen\ne\nss - no excuse for language\n \nof that sort (again it keeps Lord Reith gyrating - though my concern, as a priest, is for\n \nthe offence offered to another, higher, Lord).\n&#xa0;\nI find myself constantly complaining to the BBC about the \"strong language\", \nie\n.\n \nobscenities, included in its (admittedly post 9pm) programming, complaints they\n \ntotally ignore \n- \njust as for decades they ignored the late Mary Whitehouse and her\n \nvaliant but largely fruitless efforts to get them to clean up their act. If the BBC\n \nbothers to respond to \nc\nomplaints at all, it is the usual waste-of-space justification (as\n \nthey see it) that what individuals find offensive varies widely. That may be true, but\n \nthe very fact that they warn people in advance of\n \n\"strong language\" content is an\nadmission\n that they know it is offensive. There is absolutely no justification for\n \nbroadcasting deliberately offensive material into people's homes. We do not pay a\n \nlicence fee to find we have to switch our televisions of\nf\n. \n“T\nhat's how live is\n”\n they\n \nwill say, well maybe, but if\n I\n wanted to see how life is I can sit on my doorstep for\n \nfr\nee.\n&#xa0;\nBut given the arrogance that characterises the \nBeeb's\n typical response to complaints\n \nreceived\n, \n \nit clearly has no intention whatsoever of not broadcasting obscene\n \nlanguage, it and all other broadcasters should be made to at least include a printed\n \nwarning next to a programme in the various TV magazines and programme listings\n \n(as they do for the sex/violence/language content of films) so people know what to\n \nexpect rather than wasting an entire evening waiting to watch a programme that looks\n \ninteresting only to be informed of the language content immediately before it is due to\n \nbegin and having, if they so choose, to switch off or switch channels. I have appealed\n \nover and over for such a consid\ne\nration, but they don't have any consideration \n–\n they\n \ndon't have to - they get paid for what they do regardless - they don't have to justify\n \ntheir existence or the standard of the work they carry out for the money we pay them\n \nand that's the basic problem.\n&#xa0;\nThey are also reluctant to warn people in advance, I feel, because they are afraid of\n \nlosing viewers. If someone has sat there all evening only to be told at the last moment\n \nabout programme \ncontent, it is the \nBeeb's\n hope they will cut their losses and stick\n \nwith it -I won't\n \n- ever. But isn't that totally dishonest? - trying to trick people into\n \nwatching their programmes?\n&#xa0;\nThe various scandals that have surfaced within the BBC recently, not to mention the\n \nscandal also of the obscene salaries being paid to executives and so-called \"talent\"\n \n(star presenters) is a reflection of the arrogance that seems to be rife within the\n \nCorporation. They sit there in their ivory tow\ne\nrs safe in the knowledge that they don't\n \nhave to justify their \"cloud cuckoo land\" existence, a luxury no other company or\n \nbusiness could hope to enjoy. The \nBeeb\n displays a breath-taking arrogance verging\n \non ignorance, and a total disregard for the public who is paying the bills, in every\n \naspect of its operation. I suspect that if some of its executives had to compete in the\n \nreal world they would quickly find themselves at the nearest Job Centre where some\n \nof them rightly belong.\n&#xa0;\nWhat the BBC should b\ne\n made to do in this day and age is either operate on a\n \ncommercial basis like its competitors, or follow the example of PBS in the States and\n \nhave annual fund-raising drives based on a display of the programming it hopes to\n \nproduce. If people like what they see they pledge a voluntary donation to help pay \nfor\n \nit, and if they don't then the \nBeeb\n would have to cut its cloth accordingly - at least it\n \nwould have to justify its existence. On that basis alone, if it were in my power, I\n \nwould close it down tomorrow until it did.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, in the response I received to my most recent complaint about \"strong\n \nlanguage\" it was clear that the \nBeeb\n keeps a list of people like me who they hear from\n \nrepeatedly. Don't you think that's a bit 1984ish? My name is on a list. I don't\n \nconsider myself to be a chronic BBC complainant so much as a principled viewer\n \n- \nlike\n \nMary Whitehouse was - and of course the \nBeeb\n considered (and treated) her as a\n \ncrank too. W\ne\n cranks must stick together if we are to have any hope of affecting\n \nchange for the better - that and my hope that your Committee can bring some long\n \noverdue\n \ninfluence to bear in that regard.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nAnd as a recent correspondent in the \nYorkshire Post \npointed out, you only have to watch \nPoints of View \nto see how they respond to complaints.\n"
