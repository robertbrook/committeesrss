defaultSightsavers is an international development organisation which works with partners to eliminate avoidable blindness and promote equality 
defaultof opportunity for people with disabilities in developing countries. It is estimated that 285 million people across the world are visually impaired, 39 million of which are blind. 80% of global blindness is avoidable, whilst 90% of people who are visually 
defaultimpaired live in developing countries

default3. Introductiondefault3.1 
defaultThis submission is based on Sightsavers’ experience of working with people with disabilities
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultDisability is a crucial but neglected development issue, but there 
defaultare signs that this situation is beginning to change and the UK should take advantage of this opportunity.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission addresses all of the questions in the inquiry terms of reference, but focuses on questions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 in particular. Further
default information is
default&#xa0;
defaultalso supplied in the form of several pieces of supplementary evidence, including a briefing on the ‘We Can Also Make Change’ project the ‘Put Us in the Picture’ report, a case study carried out specifically for this inquiry on the situation
default for disability issues in Uganda, and a research paper on disability and disasters
default. 
default4. defaultBackground: Disability and developmentdefault4.1 
defaultDisability is the outcome of complex interactions between health conditions and the physical and social environment
default. This un
defaultderstanding of disability is in line with a rights-based approach which emphasises the multitude of barriers people with disabilities face to inclusion in their societies, including in accessing financial services, land ownership, and experiencing stigma a
defaultnd discrimination. These barriers restrict the power of people with disabilities
default 
defaultto challenge inequalities and influence their community, reinforcing the relationship between disability and poverty
default. 
default4.2 
defaultPeople with disabilities are often reliant on 
defaultvulnerable livelihoods; face great challenges accessing employment
default, adequate health care
default and education
default; have poor access to adequate sanitation and drinking water; are disproportionately affected by hazards; and experience high rates of violence.
default(
defaultSource
default: 
defaultWe Can Also Make Change
default)
default4.4 
defaultThe
default rights-based approach is still yet to be fully grasped by many policymakers and governments; therefore much development assistance remains moulded by the inadequate and outdated medical model of disability, which focuses on fixing impairments and providin
defaultg specialist interventions without addressing the broader societal context of inaccessibility and discrimination. The lack of knowledge amongst policymakers compounds societal barriers and often results in inaccessible poverty-reduction measures, health sy
defaultstems, physical infrastructure and information materials. 
default4.5 
defaultInaccessibility is also influenced by the exclusion of people with disabilities and their organisations from the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development programmes. A 
defaultlack of engagement is one of four factors identified in a comprehensive literature review
default  which explored the ways people with disabilities are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards (see Annex A). 
default4.6 
defaultIn the last year
default,
default progress made at the
default international scale is encouraging. That the High Level Panel Report on the Post 2015 Development Agenda stated “that no person – regardless of ethnicity, gender, geography, disability, race or other status
default” should be left behind is not only welcome but 
defaultessential. The first ever High Level Meeting on Disability and Development (HLMDD) at the UN General Assembly and its outcome document
default also suggest a significant shift, and that disability is finally being recognised as a development issue by the internat
defaultional community. DFID must grasp this historic opportunity to shape an inclusive global agenda. 
default5. defaultThe need for a disability strategydefault5.1 
defaultThrough the Disability Knowledge and Research Programmes; the Cross Cutting Disability Research Programmes and suppor
defaultt for the Disability Rights Fund and internal papers
default 
default DFID has committed to enhancing knowledge of disability. Sightsavers, through the Programme Partnership Agreement grant
default, has established an innovation fund to test new and innovative inclusive approa
defaultches to meeting the challenges of people with disabilities
default.
default5.2 
defaultMany DFID programmes have an ‘implied inclusion
default’ 
defaultapproach, which assumes programmes that target ‘the most vulnerable
default’ 
defaultwill
default positively impact people 
defaultwith
default 
defaultdisabilities
default. However, as 
defaultnoted at th
defaulte HLMDD, people with disabilities rarely participate in mainstream programmes
default. Where DFID is funding inclusive approaches, the impact of these programmes is not effectively tracked or measured, making it virtually impossible to assess their impact and bui
defaultld an adequate evidence base to inform programme design. 
default5.3 
defaultWe recommend DFID start with 
defaulta narrow focus on a limited number of countries and sectors. This will enable the collection of disability disaggregated data and allow DFID to assess the effectiveness and cost of inclusive programmes.
default5.4 
defaultBy embedding disability rights into all aspect
defaults
default o
defaultf DFID
default’
defaults work; ensuring a real and sustained engagement with people with disabilities; allocating and tracking adequate financial resources; building the capacity of people with disabilities and their organisations; and implementing a robust monitoring and
default evaluation framework, DFID can ensure its work is disability-inclusive. Only through an inclusive approach will DFID
default’
defaults work be effective: a framework for results will allow DFID to put into practice inclusive approaches, and measure, manage and report the
defaultir impact. 
default5.5 
defaultDFID must act now, as in September 2014 the UK is required to submit evidence to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
default. The purpose of this is to set out how the rights of people with disabilities are being implemented in accordance with the UNCRPD. 
defaultAlthough 
defaultthe UK government’s commitment to the Convention has been strong, the panel will review overall adherence and could
default highlight gaps in evidence and practice on Article 11 – Situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies – and Article 32 – International Cooperation, including inclusive international development programmes
default. A coherent strategy would bring added value to
default meeting the commitments of the UNCRPD by making aid more effective and giving DFID the ability to adequately track progress. 
default6. defaultIntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmesdefaultHealth
default6.1 
defaultIncreasingly, evidence is showing that people with
default disabilities experience poorer levels of health than the general population. Whilst some of this is related to increased co-morbidity linked to their impairments, a significant amount of ill health is due to barriers in accessing appropriate information, 
defaultpreventative measures and treatment
default. In health, DFID has a strong commitment to addressing inequity, including providing support in developing strong national health systems that deliver services to the poorest and most marginalised, and its role in helpi
defaultng governments progress towards universal health coverage
default. Each year 100 million people are impoverished through health spending
default. While it is not known what proportion of those affected are people with disabilities, the increased costs associated with di
defaultsability means that people with disabilities are more vulnerable to these financial risks. 
default6.2 
defaultThe UNCRPD requires states to provide equal access to health care and related services for people with disabilities. Article 25 ensures the right of disabled pe
defaultople to equally access “the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability”
default. In DFID priority countries that have ratified the UNCRPD
default 
default DFID can play an important role in improving access to health. 
default6.3 
defaultDFID also
default recognises the rising prevalence of disability through ageing populations, the rising burden of non-communicable disease and changes in risk patterns to health. What is less clear is what strategic actions DFID are taking to ensure that disability rights 
defaultare embedded into health programming. 
default6.4 
defaultDFID should: 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChampion the inclusion of disabled people’s organisations (DPOs) in national health policy and planning
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFacilitate the participation of people with disabilities in programme design, implementation, m
defaultonitoring and evaluation
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisaggregate data by disability in all DFID priority programmes to monitor and track progress
defaultEducation
default6.5 
defaultThere is a strong link between disability and marginalisation in education. Despite significant increases in participation 
defaultover the last decade, and efforts to reduce gender disparities, children with disabilities continue to be left behind. When children with disabilities are excluded from education, their future economic prospects are severely restricted, contributing to a c
defaultycle of inter-generational poverty as they establish their own households
default. 
default6.6 
defaultIt is essential that all children, including children with disabilities, are able to access and complete a 
defaultquality
default basic education delivered through an effective education sys
defaulttem. 
defaultQuality
default education requires an inclusive education approach
default; an approach that reduces the stigma and discrimination that contributes to children with disabilities being kept out of school or having a poor quality educational experience. DFID’s announc
defaultement in September that it would only build accessible schools is welcome, but to deliver inclusive education, DFID must look beyond physical infrastructure and ensure its education programmes address the wider societal context of inaccessibility and discr
defaultimination. 
default6.7 
defaultFor all children and adults, opportunities to learn must exist throughout their lives. The global literacy rate for women with disabilities is believed to be as low as 1%
default - therefore DFID must work with governments to promote quality inclu
defaultsive education and life-long learning. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSightsavers concurs with the Global Campaign for Education’s position that “DFID should develop a high level, cross-cutting strategy on disability, championed at a senior level… complemented by embedding disability-i
defaultnclusion into core processes, with strong accountability mechanisms to ensure delivery at country level, training and support for all country advisers, and disaggregation of all programmes by disability alongside gender, age and other relevant factors
default”.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID
default&#xa0;
default should also ensure that its education work is not just focused on access but on ensuring that all children, including those with disabilities, benefit from good quality education
default. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID education programmes should take account of the need for life-lo
defaultng learning opportunities, in particular in addressing the low literacy rates among people with disabilities.  
defaultWater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
default6.8 
defaultDFID’s 2012 Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Portfolio review acknowledged and listed that targeting the p
defaultoorest will result in more efficient programmes, and lists an increased focus on gender and disability as one of seven guiding principles
default. However, there is no stated framework for implementing and measuring this commitment. DFID also note the impact of p
defaultoor access on people with physical disabilities
default but lack a clear directive on how to mitigate the barriers to accessing adequate water and sanitation. Through PPAs with organisations such as WaterAid, DFID supports programmes with a strong focus on equity
default and inclusion. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA coherent disability strategy is required in order for DFID to systematically gather data and accurately understand the reach and impact of it water, sanitation and hygiene programmes on people with disabilities. 
default              
default7. defaultThe strength of the defaultevidence base on what works: inclusive approachesdefault7.1 
defaultSightsavers has been developing its evidence base through a collaborative participatory research project
default. Findings from Bangladesh demonstrate the value of a participatory approach in building knowledge and identifying priority areas of disability issues. 
default(Source: We Can Also Make Change
default)
default7.3 
defaultEngagement with the poorest and most margi
defaultnalised groups is essential in order to inform effective policies. It ensures agencies do not form inaccessible or discriminatory programmes and that they account for the diversity of disability rather than apply an ineffective generic approach
default. Engagemen
defaultt is at the heart of the twin-track approach, which remains the most effective way of implementing inclusive programmes. This involves mainstreaming an inclusive approach into all development programmes, whilst referring to specialist organisations where n
defaultecessary; and working with people with disabilities and their organisations to build their capacity to advocate for their rights and inclusive approaches
default.
default7.4 
defaultCentral to the twin-track approach is the importance of advocating with and building the 
defaultcapacity of people with disabilities and their organisations to access their rights. One example of advocacy and capacity building is demonstrated in a disability-inclusive disaster management and sustainable livelihoods programme in Bangladesh (see Annex 
defaultB), funded by DFID through the Sightsavers Innovation Fund
default. 
default7.5 
defaultDespite being an early advocate of the twin-track approach
default DFID have failed to demonstrate systematically inclusive approaches. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA coherent disability strategy, applying the best practice o
defaultf the twin-track approach, will enable DFID to implement more inclusive – and effective – programmes.  
default8. defaultFinancial costs and benefits: Accessible costs default8.1 
defaultIn order to ensure inclusive approaches, accessibility costs must be considered at all stages of 
defaultthe project cycle. Adequately budgeting for these costs is essential and will allow DFID to allocate and track adequate financial resources
default. DFID must be realistic about the resources that are required. However, accessibility costs should not be viewed as
default additional; they are a necessary requirement of effective development assistance. 
default8.2 
defaultPerceptions
default of accessibility costs as expensive additions to programme budgets not only neglect the rights of people with disabilities, but also fail to recognise the p
defaultotential economic benefits of inclusive policies. An International Labour Organisation study found that 10 low- and middle- income countries were losing between 3 and 7% of GDP through the exclusion of people with disabilities from the labour market. The f
defaultigures below estimate the ‘price of exclusion
default’ 
defaultidentified in the report for six DFID priority countries
default.  These demonstrate the severity of economic exclusion in real terms, whilst highlighting the economic benefits removing barriers to participation of p
defaulteople with disabilities in labour markets could bring.

default&#xa0;default(Source: The Price of Exclusion: The economic consequences of excluding people with disabilities from the world of work
default)
default8.4 
defaultThe cost of exclusion comes at a heavy price for many 
defaultcountries, but the challenge of adequately allocating accessibility costs is underlined by the lack of accurate data on disability and the costs of inclusive approaches
default. The case of Uganda (see Annex C) outlines these challenges, and also shows how, after
default advocating with partners, the 2014 national census will include questions on disability
default. This demonstrates the results that can be gained through concerted advocacy efforts. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID should adequately budget for accessibility costs in all programmes 
default&#xa0;
default9. defaultMadefaultinstreaming and trainingdefault9.1 
defaultIn line with Article 32 of the UNCRPD, DFID must ensure its development assistance is inclusive. This can be achieved by mainstreaming a disability perspective and providing sensitisation training
default – on a level with recent gend
defaulter initiatives – to all staff, and specialist training on inclusive approaches to specific departments where required – for example, training humanitarian staff on disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction methods. In addition to identifying senior foca
defaultl points responsible for strategy implementation, DFID must ensure inclusive approaches are embedded within the role of Social Development Advisors by providing specialist training so that they are adequately equipped to provide support on inclusive approa
defaultches. This should include knowledge of the disability sector and key organisations for referral in DFID priority countries, in line with the twin-track approach. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThrough the implementation of a coherent disability strategy, DFID should embed disability ri
defaultghts into all aspects of its work.
default10. defaultThe role of the UK: Working with partners and influencing the post-2015 frameworkdefault10.1 
defaultDFID should promote inclusive approaches as a human rights issue to partners of all levels; from communities to NGOs and governmen
defaultts. Many efforts to build capacity have rightly focused on people with disabilities and their organisations, but DFID must also support governments to promote and implement inclusive approaches
default. The mandate of the Convention also gives DFID space to use a
default range of aid modalities – including bilateral, multi-lateral, civil and private sector support – to support governments and place inclusive conditions as part of their agreements to ensure adequate levels of inclusion are met. The potential of inclusive d
defaultonor funding is demonstrated in Uganda, where a barrier to inclusive approaches is not the existence of national policies but their implementation. In 2009 DFID commissioned a scoping study of disability including recommendations outlining how DFID could s
defaultupport inclusive policies
default. However, DFID has not followed up these recommendations, so their development assistance in Uganda has not had the catalytic impact it could have had. 
default10.2 
defaultSightsavers commends DFID for its prominent role in ensuring the High L
defaultevel Panel report called for the post-2015 framework to be inclusive. However, this is not legally binding, and there remains much work to do. The Millennium Development Goals did not explicitly mention disability
default at all. This resulted in inclusive approaches not being prioritised by developing country governments, and also meant that donors such as DFID, that rigorously applied the MDG agenda, supported programmes that were not inclusive. In the case of health, as
default a direct consequence, persons with disabilities have been excluded from national plans and until recently were not systematically present in DFID’s own business cases and country operational plans
default. The recent inclusivity requirement in all business cases
default is significant and welcomed. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe urge DFID to build on this progress by creating a coherent strategy, and to use its political capital to influence other nations on the importance of a disability-inclusive post-2015 framework to ensure development goals n
defaultever again exclude people with disabilities and other marginalised groups.
