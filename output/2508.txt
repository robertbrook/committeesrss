[[[Written evidence submitted by The Hyde Group]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The Hyde Group is a leading provider of affordable housing and makes a significant contribution to meeting housing needs and improving people’s quality of life. The Hyde Group has close to 49,000 homes and houses over 95,000 residents. Hyde provides a range of social housing products ranging from general needs, intermediate housing products and supported housing. &#xa0;Hyde is one of the largest housing association groups working in England, owning or managing homes in London, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, the East of England and East Midlands.&#xa0;We welcome the opportunity to respond to this inquiry into ‘support for housing costs in the reformed welfare system. We would be happy to discuss our response with the Committee in more detail. &#xa0;In summary, we argue that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;If you would like any further information concerning our submission please contacts Elena Scherbatykh, Policy and Research Analyst, on 020 3207 2771 or elena.scherbatykh@hyde-housing.co.uk

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0; Hyde agrees with the government’s ambition to reform the welfare system so that it encourages claimants to take up work. We believe that employment is the best way out of poverty. Employment support has been a key offer of our community investment service, Hyde Plus, since it was set up over 15 years ago. &#xa0;1.2.&#xa0; A large number of working age tenants in receipt of housing benefit are already in employment, albeit very low-paid, intermittent or part-time. The focus of our support to tenants through the welfare changes has so far been on mitigating the impact of any benefit reductions and maximising their income from additional employment or other benefits they may be entitled to. &#xa0;1.3.&#xa0; We used the information we hold about our tenants to identify those who could be affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ and the benefit cap, and cross-checked this data with our local authority partners. This data showed that around 2,500 tenants could be affected, just under nine percent of all of our general needs tenants. As of 20 September 2013, there were 2,246 Hyde households confirmed as affected by the ‘bedroom tax’. &#xa0;1.4.&#xa0; We expected a large number of these to struggle to cope with the having to pay the shortfall. In preparation for the introduction of the ‘bedroom tax’ we developed a strategy for mitigating the impact of changes, and set up a project team to implement it. We developed a communication strategy for our tenants and staff, to raise awareness of the changes and to promote the ways in which we can help our tenants.&#xa0;1.5.&#xa0; In preparation for the changes, we hired 14 new staff members, including an extra employment support and an extra financial inclusion officer.  Four new Benefit Income staff members support tenants to apply for all benefits they are entitled to and for the Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP). These officers have helped Hyde tenants to secure £60,000 in DHP, and £68,000 in additional benefit income for tenants. &#xa0;1.6.&#xa0; We also recruited and trained 50 tenants to act as Welfare Reform Champions. We did this because some of our tenants told us that they were wary of discussing their concerns with Hyde. The Champions have been trained by Hyde’s benefit advisers about the changes and how they could affect other tenants, and support services provided by Hyde and other agencies. &#xa0;1.7.&#xa0; The Champions do not provide personal benefits advice, but can offer basic guidance about the changes and signpost to Hyde and other agencies for help. The Champions join Hyde staff to raise awareness of the changes at community events, talk to their neighbours and friends, and pass on the details of any tenants who think that they might be affected by the changes to Hyde, with their consent. &#xa0;1.8.&#xa0; Hyde has also developed a Housing Options service, delivered by four Housing Options officers. They help tenants to move to a more appropriate accommodation, including smaller homes if they want to avoid the ‘bedroom tax’.  &#xa0;1.9.&#xa0; Despite this support, many tenants affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ still struggle to make the shortfall. In almost six months since the ‘bedroom tax’ was introduced, fewer than half (37%) of tenants whose housing benefit had been cut had been paying the rent in full. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.&#xa0; We welcome that the changes were or are still being rolled out gradually. However, the pilots will only be useful if learning from them is analysed and shared with the sector; and if the level of support the pilots test, in particular in the direct payment demonstration projects, is in line with those likely to be available when the system rolls out across England. &#xa0;2.2.&#xa0; To provide a better picture of how Universal Credit will affect existing claimants, future Universal Credit pathfinders could include claimants who are in low-paid or part-time work or are unable to work, as these groups will form the majority of those in receipt of Universal Credit. This will help to test and better shape the Local Support Services Framework in the future. &#xa0;2.3.&#xa0; It is our observation that those unable to work need support to overcome barriers such as literacy, English language skills, learning difficulties and mental health issues and social isolation. These claimants will need one-on-one support to access the online claims system and manage their benefits. &#xa0;2.4.&#xa0; Housing providers and tenants would further benefit from an independent evaluation of the impact and the effectiveness of the DHP system. We have particular concerns about the lack of transparency about how the decisions about DHP are reached and impact of temporary awards for permanent conditions such as disabilities. We hope that an evaluation of how the DHP system copes with welfare changes will be commissioned and shared with the sector soon. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0; Local Support Services Framework (LSSF) will be the main source of support for new and existing UC claimants. To be effective, LSSF should be simple to access and offer consistent level of services, with housing providers as key members, both in the shaping of an LSSF and its delivery. Housing Options and benefit maximisation support, such as the one Hyde already provides, could become part of the LSSF. Local authorities could consider commissioning these services from providers who can show a good track record in this field. &#xa0;3.2.&#xa0; More flexibility on how Universal Credit is paid and to who would help to support our vulnerable tenants.  We firmly believe that tenants should be able to choose at the start of their claim to have the housing component of their UC award paid directly to their housing provider. If the claimant already has arrears at the point of transition to UC, direct payment could be the default option until any arrears are cleared.&#xa0;3.3.&#xa0; Early learning from direct payment demonstration projects showed that rent arrears among tenants were around eight per cent after the first four months. We understand that the tenants in the pilots received intensive one-to-one support. Many commentators have pointed out that this level of support would be unsustainable after a wider roll-out and that without this level of support rent arrears could double. It is clear that continuing to pay the housing element to housing providers directly is one of the best ways to keep rent arrears and the resulting bad debts down. &#xa0;3.4.&#xa0; We support the need for Universal Credit to prepare claimants for taking up work, including by the way it is paid. However, a monthly payment in arrears does not necessarily reflect how the benefit claimants, the majority of whom are in low-paid, part-time and intermittent work, receive payments. These are more likely to be weekly or fortnightly. The DWP may therefore wish to consider making payments to those who are in work and transitioning into UC also weekly or fortnightly, until their employment circumstances change.&#xa0;3.5.&#xa0; The success of Universal Credit will depend on the availability of banking products which support tenants to better budget and prioritise their payments. We are aware that the DWP has been testing basic banking products with budgeting or ‘jam jar’ facilities. It is important that the results of this research are shared with housing providers and LSSFs as early as possible. &#xa0;3.6.&#xa0; Universal Credit will not include mortgage interest support to households where the claimants or their partner do any paid work. We agree with the DWP select committee which recently recommended that the policy of ‘zero earnings rule’ could put some homeowners in low-paid work at risk of homelessness, should they require the support with their mortgage interest payments as a result of their job becoming part-time. &#xa0;3.7.&#xa0; The National Audit Office recently expressed their concerns that if the DWP adhere to the current deadline for having all claimants on Universal Credit by 2017, the majority of existing claimants, including the 2.3 million housing benefit claimants of working age living in social housing, will be transitioning from housing benefit to Universal Credit in the last two years of the scheme. We would like to see if the report has had any impact on the Department’s thinking on the timelines. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1.&#xa0; Looking ahead, housing providers would benefit from better communication and information sharing between government departments, local authorities and housing providers. This includes timely dissemination of any changes to the timescales for the implementation of the reforms, and to the scope of pilot and pathfinder projects. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0; We are concerned that lessons may be drawn too early about the impact of changes. Only the ‘bedroom tax’ and the benefit cap have been introduced so far. It is widely accepted that of all welfare reforms Universal Credit will have the biggest impact. Therefore it will be crucial to the success of Universal Credit to thoroughly test it and prepare the tenants, their providers and local authorities for these changes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.2.&#xa0; Unlike the ‘bedroom tax’ and the benefit cap, Universal Credit will affect all tenants in receipt of benefits. Some tenants who can cope with income reduced by the ‘bedroom tax’ and/or the benefit cap may struggle with budgeting and paying their rent themselves under Universal Credit. &#xa0;5.3.&#xa0; We are also concerned that the impact of the ‘bedroom tax’ is easier to assess in the short term than in the long term. We feel that the full impact of this measure is masked by the temporary nature of DHP awards, most of which have so far been limited to six months. &#xa0;5.4.&#xa0; The benefit cap, phased in by the end of September, may capture some of the households already affected by the ‘bedroom tax’. It is difficult to predict how tenants will cope this with additional reduction in income and if this could exacerbate the impact of the ‘bedroom tax’.&#xa0;5.5.&#xa0; The gradual introduction of changes also can mask their cumulative impact, both on the tenants’ ability to maintain their tenancies and on the providers’ income streams. Any current predictions of arrears, evictions and bad debt need to be tested over time. &#xa0;5.6.&#xa0; The government and policy makers won’t know what impact the changes will have until long after they have been introduced. This makes forward business planning and commissioning of support for tenants difficult. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.&#xa0; Hyde understands that the Universal Credit is a ‘digital by default’ project, and that the claimants will access and manage their claims online. We agree that online and IT skills are not only key to securing and sustaining employment, but help users reduce their living costs, stay connected to friends and relatives, and combat isolation. &#xa0;6.2.&#xa0; Further steps should be taken to support local authorities and providers to improve opportunities for digital inclusion. This support should cover both the access to IT technology and internet, and improving the claimants’ online skills.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1.&#xa0; The sector is aware that further changes to welfare benefits are being discussed, including  the restriction of housing benefit to claimants aged 25 and over, and the further lowering of the benefit cap. We are concerned that these changes could increase homelessness and restrict social and geographic mobility of claimants who are often already quite vulnerable. &#xa0;7.2.&#xa0; We would urge the government to conduct a thorough assessment of the impact on homelessness of any future changes, as well as to continue to monitor the impact of the changes already implemented. &#xa0;&#xa0;8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Under the Affordable Homes Programme 2011-15 and its extension for 2015-18, announced in the Spending Round, the supply of affordable housing depends on a secure rental income, including from housing benefit. &#xa0;8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As rent arrears grow and the certainty about tenants’ ability to meet their rent payments reduces, associations’ borrowing costs could increase. Any changes to how the support for housing costs is paid could affect the providers’ ability to deliver new homes. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.3.&#xa0; A more rigorous, regular assessment of the impact of changes and a more flexible design would provide more certainty to the associations’ investors and lenders. More clarity about specific measures designed to protect the providers’ incomes, such as the switchback mechanism, would help to assure our lenders and investors. &#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;
