&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Cycle to Work Alliance (the Alliance) (CYS0044)&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary:]]]–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission is made by the Cycle to Work Alliance (the Alliance), on behalf of its members – Cyclescheme, Cycle Solutions, Evans Cycles and Halfords. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our comments are focussed on how the cycle to work scheme can encourage people to take-up cycling, thus creating the critical mass to make the transport mode safer. Additionally, we look at the role the scheme has in making vital safety equipment more affordable for commuters who cycle to work. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The submission argues that better governmental promotion of the scheme could help increase up-take, and improve the safety of cycling for Britons. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also consider the role employers can play in increasing the safety of their staff who commute to work by bike. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recommend the committee calls on Government to ensure the scheme is adequately promoted, so as to increase the number of cyclists on the road and therefore improve their safety. &#xa0;

[[[Introduction to the cycle to work scheme:]]]–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The cycle to work scheme is a government-supported, tax-efficient and salary-sacrificed employee benefit that provides a mode through which employers can encourage their workers to take up cycling.–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Through the scheme, employers loan bicycles and safety equipment to their employees as a tax-exempt benefit for the purpose of commuting to and from work. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the end of the loan period, the employer may choose to give their employee the option of purchasing the bike and the equipment.–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The scheme can save employees up to 42% of the cost of safety equipment. By doing so, the scheme incentivises riders to purchase the equipment that will make their cycle to work safer. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To date, over 550,000 individuals have taken part in the scheme, which also involves over 2,220 bike retailers and over 32,000 employers. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although supportive of the scheme, Government could do more to aid its promotion and remove barriers to entry, therefore delivering greater levels of sustainable transport and improving public health.

[[[s]]]–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key element of the cycle to work scheme’s effectiveness in improving cycling safety is through increasing the critical mass of cyclists on the roads. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As CTC, the national cycling charity notes, increasing cycling uptake is the surest way to improve safety. According to research, the Netherlands saw a 45% increase in cycling from 1980-2005 and a corresponding 58% decrease in cyclist fatalities. Overall, the CTC suggest that doubling the amount of cyclists on the road can reduce casualties by a third. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With this in mind, the cycle to work scheme is a proven mechanism for increasing cycling uptake, and therefore improving cycling safety. In the first half of 2013, industry data suggests that the scheme encouraged over 44,000 commuters to start cycling to work by bicycle.–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research conducted by the Cycle to Work Alliance shows that 54% of scheme users did not cycle to work up before they joined the initiative. Similarly, 72% said they would not have bought their bike and safety equipment had they not been offered through the scheme.–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The financial savings that commuters make on the cost of their bike and the safety equipment through the scheme is the fundamental aspect in their decision to sign up to the scheme. 98% of scheme users say that these savings were either important or very important in their decision to join the scheme, and start cycling to work.

[[[&amp; employer involvement]]]–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Key to the positive impact that the cycle to work scheme has on cycling safety is the financial savings that scheme users make on the cost of safety equipment.–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Through its tax efficiency, the scheme sees users saving up to 42% on the cost of such equipment. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, all members of the Cycle to Work Alliance have discussions with new users about the need for safety equipment, and the risks run if they chose not to wear such products. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the nature of the scheme as an employee benefit, it also plays an important role in opening up the dialogue between employers and their staff on cycling and cycling safety. &#xa0;

[[[Conclusions &amp; recommendations]]]–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The cycle to work scheme is a Government-backed initiative that encourages people to commute to work by bike through making cycling and safety equipment more affordable.–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By doing so, the scheme increases the critical mass of cyclists on the road, which is arguably the most effective way to improve the safety of cyclists. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Additionally, the scheme increases the affordability of cycling safety equipment, and all users are encouraged to invest this in this upon their initial interactions with providers of the cycle to work scheme. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, the scheme is crucial in opening the dialogue between employers and employees on the merits of cycling, and related safety issues. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Alliance recommends that the Committee encourages Government to do more to promote the scheme, so as to improve cycling safety more generally. With the recent devolution of public health and sustainable transport responsibilities to local authorities, there is currently a concern that the scheme is not being adequately promoted. –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Committee should call on Government – particularly the Department for Transport – to ensure that local authorities and employers are well aware of the scheme and its benefits to both users and improving cycling safety more generally. &#xa0;November 20131&#xa0; CTC              2007              Safety in Numbers http://www.ctc.org.uk/sites/default/files/ctc_safety_in_numbers_0.pdf Cycle to Work Alliance               2013              The Green Way to Work http://cycletoworkalliance.org.uk/news_41_2538974460.pdf
