[[[This assessment has not been undertaken in terms of the costs to the public or private sector. Neither has it assessed the sustainability or carbon impacts of the proposed options. In particular it has not assessed impacts from the reduced standards that will result from the proposed changes achieved in those areas that are currently achieving technical standards in advance of even the higher tier of technical standards proposed.]]]&#xa0;3 October 2013&#xa0;
