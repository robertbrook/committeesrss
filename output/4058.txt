[[[ Philip Lee [FBB0040]]]]&#xa0;This document is submitted in a personal capacity, not on behalf of any organisation.&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;The main point of this submission is that the imposition of a tax on the use of a television set, in order to finance a particular broadcaster, is unjustifiable.There are now multiple broadcasters in the UK and there is no need for the government to finance one broadcaster in preference to the others.&#xa0;Details&#xa0;The Television Licence is an anachronism. The imposition of a what is effectively a tax on the use of a television set, in order to finance the BBC, cannot be justified.The tax is regressive because it is a flat rate tax on all households, regardless of income. The regressiveness of the tax is even greater because BBC programs are, on average, watched and listened to by the better off, paid for by all, including the worse off.The high level of prosecutions for non-payment of the licence fee clearly demonstrates the reluctance to pay the fee, in many cases for a service that is not wanted or used.&#xa0;The introduction of digital broadcasting throughout the UK provides a simple way of charging for BBC programs. By changing to a subscription based service, the need for a tax could be removed and the financing of the BBC could be legitimised.Charging a subscription would decriminalise what should be a personal, commercial choice and would render obsolete the whole archaic process for prosecuting those who   do not want to pay for a BBC service that they do not want.&#xa0;There are now a large number of broadcasters in the UK and the BBC should compete with them on an equal basis. Government policy should be to promote variety and competition in broadcasting, not to protect the BBC.If the government needs to own broadcasting channels, these should be paid for out of general taxation and should be clearly designated as government channels, in a similar way to how the BBC World Service is operated.&#xa0;Eventually, when the BBC is operating as a viable commercial entity, the organisation should be privatised.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
