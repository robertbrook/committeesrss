[[[Written evidence from Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) (PEX 0017)]]]&#xa0;The Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) is the representative body for finance staff in healthcare. For the past 60 years, it has provided independent and objective advice to its members and the wider healthcare community. We are a charitable organisation that promotes best practice and innovation in financial management and governance across the UK health economy through our local and national networks. We also analyse and respond to national policy and aim to exert influence in shaping the wider healthcare agenda. We have a particular interest in promoting the highest professional standards in financial management and governance and are keen to work with other organisations to promote approaches that really are ‘fit for purpose’ and effective.
