[[[We welcome DFID’s recent commitments on disability]]], which are an important statement to developing country partners and other donors. 

[[[The UK is ]]]

[[[the leading donor for]]]

[[[ education]]], so its commitments could help to 

[[[galvanise international action]]] to include disabled children and young people in education.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disabled people are among the 

[[[most marginalised]]] from education but also from other services, and face daily discrimination. 

[[[DFID ]]]

[[[should ]]]

[[[therefore ]]]

[[[develop]]]

[[[ a high level, cross-cutting strategy on ]]]

[[[rigorous ]]]

[[[accountability]]]. DFID should move towards making the 

[[[inclusion of disabled people]]] 

[[[a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding]]], with all education programmes a priority.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[‘mainstream]]]

[[[, with an emphasis throu]]]

[[[A]]]

[[[ll teacher-training supported by DFID ]]]

[[[should]]]

[[[ incorporate inclusive teaching methodology]]]. This should be supported by the necessary resources, specific timeframes for implementation, and clear accountability. All programmes should be 

[[[disaggregated]]] to show how they reach disabled children, young people and teachers.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In line with a 

[[[‘twin track’ approach]]], DFID should put in place 

[[[additional resources and support to re]]]

[[[ach disabled people]]]. DFID should develop a ‘

[[[Disabled Children’s ]]]

[[[Education Challenge Fund’]]] using the learning from the Girls’ Education Challenge Fund, and 

[[[invest]]]

[[[ in research]]] to strengthen the evidence base on disability.&#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Disability must be a core priority]]]

[[[ for post-2015 as part of a wider focus on equity]]]. The UK should continue to champion the ‘

[[[leave no one behind’]]] principle, the 

[[[disaggregation]]] of all targets by disability, and the principle that disabled people have to be included in order for targets to be considered achieved. A goal of 

[[[quality education for all, prioritising the most marginalised]]], is urgently needed to address the crisis in educational equity and quality. The UK should lead a ‘

[[[Global Partnership on Disability Data]]]’ to improve the data and evidence on disability.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Global Campaign for Education is an international education campaign, with over 80 national coalitions across all continents. GCE UK is the UK branch of this campaign: we are a coalition of 30 international development NGOs and education unions. GCE UK maintains a strong link with parliament, working closely with the APPG on Global Education for All, and through the ‘Send My Friend to School’ campaign.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Disabili]]]

[[[ty must be recognised as a core development issue]]]. 80% of disabled people live in developing countries and the UN calls them “

[[[the world’s largest minority]]]”.  It is clear that the MDGs, and post-2015 goals, will not be achieved without the inclusion of disabled people. Ensuring that disabled people are included in UK aid programmes is an obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The MDG of achieving universal primary education by 2015 is “]]]

[[[not on track]]]

[[[”]]], with 57 million children of primary age still out of school and progress all but stalled. 250 million children are in school but failing to learn. The Global Campaign for Education argues that in most countries, 

[[[disabled children are more likely to be out of school tha]]]

[[[n any other group of children]]]. In Nepal, an estimated 85% of all children out of school are disabled. In Ethiopia, fewer than 3% of disabled children have access to primary education. A study by Plan International of its 1.4 million sponsored children recently concluded that the likelihood that a disabled child did not attend school was often more than ten times greater than a child without a disability. Disabled children are also less likely to remain in school and move up to the next year group.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many statistics quoted about disability are contestable because of 

[[[the invisibility of disabled people from national statistics in developing countries]]]. The data gap has a major impact on education, where 

[[[even basic data on disabled children in and out of school is frequently absent]]]. Planning for the inclusion of disabled children is also challenging without information about the type of impairment children have (whether long term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment). &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Disability is highly interrelated to other aspects of inequality]]]. The exclusion of certain populations including disabled people but also girls and women, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, and those living in remote rural areas or informal settlements has hindered progress towards the MDGs. 

[[[D]]]

[[[i]]]

[[[fferent dimensions of exclusion overlap]]], e.g. adolescent ethnic minority girls living with disabilities experience triple exclusion. Of all the excluding factors, 

[[[disability has the strongest correlation with poor educational outcomes]]].

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[We welcome DFID’s recent commitments]]], particularly that all schools built with direct DFID support will be accessible, and the commitment to work with partners to improve data and evidence on disability. These announcements are 

[[[an important ]]]

[[[statement]]]

[[[ to othe]]]

[[[r donors and developing countries ]]]that the UK is serious about including disabled people in its aid programmes. GCE UK has worked hard to support DFID to strengthen its focus on disabled children’s education, and we 

[[[urge ]]]

[[[it]]]

[[[ to build on this progress ]]]

[[[to become a world ]]]

[[[leader on disability, in particular]]] 

[[[by committing ]]]

[[[that]]]

[[[ all ]]]

[[[teacher-training]]]

[[[ supported by DFID will incorpo]]]

[[[rate]]]

[[[ inclusive teaching methodology]]].&#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While there is strong momentum, and DFID has examples of good practice, it has 

[[[no formal framework for the systematic inclusion of disabled people]]] throughout its programmes, and 

[[[no formal checks]]] are in place to ensure that disabled people benefit from UK Aid.&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID has previously recognised the importance of a 

[[[“twin-track” approach to disability]]] which sees the active “mainstreaming” or inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of their development work (eg. ensuring education programmes support disabled children), coupled with additional inputs and resources which recognise the marginalisation of disabled people and provides them with targeted support. 

[[[This approach should now be thoroughly emb]]]

[[[edded in DFID’s work]]].

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[DFID has previously]]]

[[[ taken steps to integrate disability within its education programme]]]. GCE UK welcomed DFID’s production in 2010 of a ‘

[[[Guidance Note on Education for Children with Disabilities]]]’, and later worked with DFID to produce a summary ‘one-pager’ which was sent by DFID to all Country Offices. However, a 2012 GCE UK survey of six countries suggested that 

[[[only half ]]]

[[[of these Country Offices were aware of ]]]

[[[the ‘one-pager’]]]

[[[, and only one was implementing it]]]. In its report ‘Equity and Inclusion for All in Education’, GCE UK analysed 14 DFID Country Operational Plans and found 

[[[just two mentions of disability]]]. The report raised concern that, although there were examples of good practice, there was 

[[[little evidence of DFID engaging in ]]]

[[[strategic planning to ensure that ]]]

[[[all]]]

[[[ education initiatives prioritised marginalised groups – such as disabled children - in a comprehensive way]]]. DFID 

[[[could draw many lessons from its success in mainstreaming gender]]] and prioritising girls and women, and could apply these to disability. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Barriers to education for disabled people are the result of complex factors involving social, economic and political systems, and the way in which schools engage with disabled children, their families and teachers. Responding to these barriers requires strategic cross-sector planning. 

[[[DFID]]]

[[[ should]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[therefore develop]]]

[[[ a high level, cross-cutting strategy on ]]]

[[[disability]]]

[[[, and implement this in a ]]]

[[[sensible ]]]

[[[phased ]]]

[[[approach at all ]]]

[[[levels of its work]]]. This strategy could draw lessons from DFID’s Strategic Vision for Girls and Women, and the disability strategy of Australia’s development agency. The strategy should be 

[[[championed at a ]]]

[[[senior]]]

[[[ level]]], clearly emphasising its importance internally and to partners.&#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, 

[[[a paper strategy will not lead to sustainable change without]]] 

[[[rigorous]]]

[[[ accountability]]]. 

[[[DFID should move towards making the inclusion of disabled people a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding]]], with education programmes a priority.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GCE UK’s analysis highlights that the 

[[[devolved nature of DFID’s operations creates challenges for consistent implementation]]]. Strategy must be complemented by 

[[[embedding ]]]

[[[disability responsiveness]]]

[[[ into core processes]]], with strong 

[[[acco]]]

[[[untability mechanisms to ensure delivery at the country level]]], 

[[[training and support for country advisers,]]] and 

[[[disaggregation of all programmes by disability]]]. The inclusion of disabled people should be 

[[[a requirement of all DFID Business Cases and Country Op]]]

[[[erational Plans]]]. &#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A network of 

[[[trained]]] 

[[[leads/focal points in all DFID Country Offices ]]]should report back regularly to a central senior 

[[[‘]]]

[[[Disability]]]

[[[ Champion’]]] on planning, implementation and evaluation of inclusive programmes. These leads could also be 

[[[contact points for consultation]]] with external groups of (and groups representing) disabled people. However lessons should be learned from the experience of gender mainstreaming. DFID has previously highlighted that gender focal points often proved disappointing due to a "...lack of clarity about their roles and responsibilities [and] lack of management support". Another risk is that staff may assume that since the focal point is ‘doing disability’ no-one else has to do anything. 

[[[Focal points therefore need]]]

[[[ to be given sufficient resources, time and authority]]].&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GCE UK welcomes DFID’s existing support for 

[[[Disabled People’s Organisations]]]. DPOs play an important role, empowering disabled people to participate in decisions that affect them, and changing attitudes towards disability in society at large. 

[[[DFID ]]]

[[[should ]]]

[[[continue to strengthen its support for DPOs, using a range of approaches that deliver effective ]]]

[[[participation ]]]

[[[in-]]]

[[[country]]]. DFID should also 

[[[place a clear requirement on its Country Offices to in]]]

[[[volve ]]]

[[[DPOs]]]

[[[ in programme development, implementation and evaluation]]].

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GCE UK is strongly supportive of 

[[[DFID’s leading position as the largest bilateral donor to basic education]]]. We urge DFID to use this position to 

[[[further prioritise ]]]

[[[disability]]]

[[[-inclusion]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[in]]]

[[[ education]]], which would 

[[[galvanise other donors]]] and see a step-change in support to disabled children, young people and teachers.&#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unequal access to education is often exacerbated by the prevalence of a medical deficit model of disability, which perpetuates the notion that disabled children must adapt in order to ‘integrate’ into mainstream schooling, or be educated in a separate ‘special’ education system. At the same time, the nature of children’s impairments is often poorly understood, resulting in inappropriate service provision. GCE UK argues that 

[[[carefully planned and implemented ]]]

[[[inclusive education ]]]

[[[strategies]]]

[[[,]]] utilising the expertise of staff in rehabilitation services and special education schools, that support the 

[[[inclusion of disabled children in mainstream schools]]] are appropriate in the large majority of cases. Such strategies enhance the 

[[[quality of teaching and learning for ]]]

[[[all chil]]]

[[[dren]]]

[[[, not just disabled children]]]. DFID should 

[[[embed]]]

[[[ inclusive education as a leading principle of its education programmes]]], thereby strengthening the focus on disabled children and simultaneously strengthening education systems and the quality of learning for all children.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While DFID’s commitment on accessible school construction is welcome, it is important to note that directly-funded school construction forms only a small part of DFID’s work. Similar commitments 

[[[should be made]]]

[[[ in areas ]]]

[[[which constitute a]]]

[[[ greater part of DFID’s spending and portfolio]]]

[[[, ]]]ensuring that provisions are made for accessible 

[[[school infrastructure, transport and learning materials]]]. DFID is a strong leader in supporting 

[[[teacher training]]], which is fundamental to meeting MDG 2 and improving the quality of education. In order to be inclusive of disabled children, teachers need to learn about and practise inclusive education during pre-service and in-service training. 

[[[DFID ]]]

[[[should integrate inclusive education throughout the teacher-]]]

[[[training it supports]]]

[[[, and seek to also train specialised teaching assistants to support children with complex needs within a mainstream environment]]]. DFID should 

[[[promote]]]

[[[ the recruitment of disabled teachers]]] including the reasonable adjustments needed in schools for this. &#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID should play an influencing role in its 

[[[dialogue]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ with ]]]

[[[developing country]]]

[[[ g]]]

[[[overnments ]]]

[[[to encourage ]]]

[[[disability-inclusion in ]]]

[[[the education system and governance]]]. One systemic barrier is the problem of 

[[[divided ministerial responsibility]]], where education for disabled children is the responsibility of a different ministry than that responsible for the education of non-disabled children. This division usually reflects the view that the disabled need welfare rather than equity in educational opportunity and often leads to segregated responses to disability. &#xa0;6.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The marginalisation of those with disabilities is often compounded by other inequalities. For instance, girls with disabilities are less likely to get an education, vocational training or employment than boys with disabilities or girls without disabilities. 

[[[DFID should build on its strong work to reach marginalised girls – such as the Girls Education Challenge Fund]]]

[[[ –]]]

[[[ by]]]

[[[ ensur]]]

[[[ing]]]

[[[ that such mechanisms support disabled girls]]]. There are good examples of GEC projects that aim to do this, and we urge DFID to make this systematic by 

[[[establishing]]]

[[[ support for disabled girls ]]]

[[[as ]]]

[[[a requirement of all GEC projects]]].

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In line with the “twin-track” approach, DFID should put in place 

[[[additional resources]]]

[[[ to support disabled children and young people]]]

[[[’s education]]]. DFID should:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID’s guidance highlights that “

[[[educating children with disabilities is a good investment]]]”. Prioritising disability within DFID’s work should not be thought of in terms of an additional cost burden. On the contrary, 

[[[the costs of not investing in support to disabled people are much greater to the countries where DFID is seeking to deliver development progress]]]. By one estimate, USD 135–192 billion is lost from the GDP of low-income countries per annum as a result of disabled people’s exclusion from the labour market. Educating disabled children reduces welfare costs and future dependence, and increases children’s own potential productivity and wealth creation in turn helping to alleviate poverty.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In many cases, 

[[[where disabled people and their needs are considered early in the planning of projects, additional costs are minimal]]]. Directly relevant to DFID’s commitment on school construction, UNICEF note that the costs of integrating accessibility into new buildings can be negligible (less than 1% of the total cost) compared to the higher cost of making adaptations to completed buildings.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[DFID should invest in projects to improve disability statistics ]]]

[[[to better measure]]]

[[[ progress]]]

[[[ for disabled people]]]. For instance, working closely with the UN Washington Group on Disability Statistics and with UNICEF, and providing financial and technical assistance to national statistical agencies. It is also important to invest in participatory qualitative research looking at the impact of the inclusive projects being rolled out, such as looking at “Quality of Life” measures, in order to establish best practice. &#xa0;8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID should lead in working with other education partners to improve support for disabled children. This includes other education donors such as 

[[[AusAid]]], and multilaterals like the 

[[[Global Partnership for Education (GPE), UNESCO and the World Bank]]]. DFID is represented on the Board of the GPE, whose new strategic plan includes a strategic focus on ‘Reaching Every Child’, with inclusive education a priority within its implementation plan. 

[[[The GPE is the only multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into school for a quality education]]], and with the GPE’s replenishment taking place in 2014 the UK has an important opportunity to strengthen GPE’s focus on disabled children.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Prime Minister and DFID have already shown important leadership on the need for post-2015 goals to include disabled people. GCE UK welcomed the UN High Level Panel’s (HLP) recommendations as they relate to disability, including the "

[[[no one left behind]]]" transformative shift; the emphasis on the need for 

[[[disaggregation of indicators by disability]]] for measuring progress; and the commitment that "

[[[no target should be considered met unless met for all social groups, including people with disabilities]]]". 

[[[We urge DFID to champion these elements as the negotiations continue]]]

[[[.]]]&#xa0;9.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; E

[[[nsuring disabled children and other ]]]

[[[marginalised groups are both in school and learning is a critical challenge for post-2015]]]. The HLP’s illustrative goal “Provide quality education and lifelong learning” rightly emphasises that there is an education crisis with millions denied their right to education. 

[[[We]]]

Seventy-six per cent of children with disabilities are estimated to be out of school in Sierra Leone. The programme will therefore include activities to mobilise communities to foster inclusion of girls and boys with disabilities, removing specific barriers to access and providing a safe and secure learning environment.” – p10, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225715/Education_Position_Paper_July_2013.pdf DFID (2010), ‘Guidance note: Education for children with disabilities – improving access and quality”, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/67664/edu-chi-disabil-guid-note.pdf Metts, R.L., World Bank (2000), ‘Disability Issues, Trends and Recommendations for the World Bank’, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf  As quoted in DFID (2010), ‘Guidance note: Education for children with disabilities – improving access and quality”, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/67664/edu-chi-disabil-guid-note.pdf UNICEF (2013), ‘The State of the World’s Children 2013: Children with Disabilities’, p19, http://www.unicef.org/sowc2013/files/SWCR2013_ENG_Lo_res_24_Apr_2013.pdf As outlined in GPE’s new ‘Strategic Plan 2012-2015’ - http://www.globalpartnership.org/media/docs/library/GPE_Stategic_Plan_2012-2015_English.pdf UN High Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda (2013), ‘A New Global Partnership:Eradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable development’, http://www.post2015hlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UN-Report.pdf GCE UK (2013), ‘No Child Forgotten: Education and Inequality Post-2015’, http://www.sendmyfriend.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/GCE-Post-2015-Policy-Paper.pdf
