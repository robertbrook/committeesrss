My title is Europe\n&#xa0;\n2020 Programme\n&#xa0;\nManager, which means I lead employment and social policy interactions with the EU for the Department for Work and Pensions.\nThe Chairman: Before I ask the first question, do you have an opening statement, Mr\n&#xa0;\nGray?\nAngus Gray: Thank you for this opportunity to make some opening remarks.  I thought it would be helpful to briefly set out the way the \nYouth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative \nwill work in the \nUK\n and to set that in the context of our wider efforts to tackle youth \nun\nemployment.\nThe primary responsibility for tackling youth unemployment, of course, rests with \nmember state\ns.  The Government already ha\nve\n a range of help in place, including the \nYouth Contract\n, which provides additional support for young people\n,\n worth almost £1\n&#xa0;\nbillion over three years, providing work experience for all young people who want it, wage incentives, incentives for apprenticeships and additional support for disengaged 16 and 17\n \nyear\n&#x2011;\nolds.  \nIn addition,\n there is the Work\n&#xa0;\nProgramme, which offers tailored support for young people who have been claiming \nj\nobseeker’s\n&#xa0;\na\nllowance \nfor more than nine months.  We are also using some of the current ESF allocation in \nEngland\n on young people who are not in employment, education or training.\nWe estimate that the UK share of the \n€3\n&#xa0;\nbillion Youth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative will be worth €194\n&#xa0;\nmillion, which will be shared between the five regions in the UK \nthat\n have a youth\n \nunemployment rate of 25% or higher.  In \nEngland\n, those regions are inner \nLondon\n, Merseyside, \nTees\n \nValley\n and \nDurham\n, and the \nWest Midlands\n.  South\n-\nwest \nScotland\n is also expected to qualify.  The money needs to be spent by 2018.  The €194\n&#xa0;\nmillion equates to just less than €40\n&#xa0;\nmillion \na\n year.\n  \nThe money therefore makes an important contribution to our efforts to tackle y\nouth unemployment, but it is dwarfed by the scale of our other existing investments.  \nThe Youth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative has been added to the \nEU’s \nESF r\negulation\n,\n and so it will be integrated into the \nESF \noperational programme for \nEngland\n.  As with ESF overall, it is for \nmember state\ns to decide how to spend the money.\n  \nThat will include the Youth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative, but operational programmes need to be\n \nnegotiated and then agreed with the European\n&#xa0;\nCommission.  The main thing they will be looking for is \nan assurance\n \nthat \nthere is a clear rationale for our proposal, based on the evidence.  Proposals need to reflect the differen\nt position\n in each \nmember state\n: the level of unemployment, delivery systems and the coverage of existing provision.\nI should perhaps have clarified at the beginning that I am responsible for ESF in \nEngland\n only, because the structural funds are a devolved matter.  In \nEngland\n, the \nlocal\n&#xa0;\nenterprise\n&#xa0;\npartnerships\n, of which there are 39, have been asked to develop strategies for how the funds should be spent.  That includes the ESF, the European\n&#xa0;\nregional\n&#xa0;\ndevelopment\n&#xa0;\nfund and \npart of the European \nagricultural fund for rural developme\nnt.  There are seven of these LEPs affected by the Youth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative\n,\n so they have built proposals for how to spend that money into their overall approach to the structural funds.  They have been consulting local partners over the summer about their plans\n,\n and they submitted their draft strategies to us on 7\n&#xa0;\nOctober.  We are now working with them to ensure \nthat \ntheir proposals add value to what already exists.  We are hoping to see some interesting and creative approaches to tackling this important problem.\nThe Chairman: Mr Wells?\nBill Wells:\n That was the only opening statement.\nThe Chairman: And likewise?\nLindsey Lewis:\n Likewise.\nQ2 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: O\nne thing strikes me.  When you started off, you mentioned \n€184\n&#xa0;\nmillion out of €3\n&#xa0;\nbillion\n. H\now is that sorted out?\nAngus Gray: It is based on the analysis of which regions in the EU have youth unemployment of 25% or more.  There will obviously be countries with much higher levels.\nThe Chairman: What is the Gover\nnment’s position with regard to youth unemployment in the \nUK\n?  What is the role of the devolved \nA\ndministrations in tackling the issue?  You did relate to that up to a point.  Who would like to answer that question?\nLindsey Lewis: If I may, Chairman, I will start to answer and then I will ask my colleague Bill to follow.  While youth unemployment in the \nUK\n is significantly lower than much of the rest of the EU, \nthe \nGovernment believe that\n this is still a significant issue that needs to be tackled.  Around 9% of \n16\n to \n24 \nyear\n&#x2011;\nolds are unemployed and not in full\n&#x2011;\ntime education; we think this is too high.\n  This is why the Government have\n implemented a range of policies to address this: those that Angus touched on, the Youth Contract\n,\n and the Work Programme in particular.  \nWe are also reforming apprenticeships to create more opportunities for training via that route.  Our aim is to make our apprenticeship programme the new international benchmark for excellence.  We are seeing success.  For example, the number of \n16 to 24 year-old\ns who are not employed or in full\n&#x2011;\ntime education fell by 7,000 in the last quarter and has fallen by 65,000 since the recent peak about two years ago.  I will ask my colleague Bill whether he wants to add anything.\nBill Wells: It is quite important to distinguish between unemployment and other forms of worklessness.  Perhaps the best division is between those on \njobseeker’s allowance\n, those on other benefits and those not on any other benefits.  In general, the story is that those on JSA are improving; those on other benefits—primarily lone parent and disability benefits—are at roughly the same level they were \nat \nbefore the recession.  The major problem tends to be \npeople \nwho are not on benefits and who are making the transition from education to work.  In our evidence, this is on chart\n&#xa0;\n5.  These people have not \nyet \nmoved\n.\n \nThe Chairman: \nYes\n, they have \nmoved f\nrom one to the other.  \nBill Wells: It is important to realise that quite a lot of these people are not on benefits and are quite difficult to get hold of to help.\nThe Chairman: Why are they not on benefits?  It cannot be that they do not know benefits are available.\nBill Wells: This is because it is \n16 to 24 year-old\ns: 16 and 17\n \nyear\n&#x2011;\nolds are not eligible for benefits.  Also, sometimes it takes a long time either to move into education or employment\n,\n or to get involved in the benefits system.  That applies equall\ny to people leaving university.\nOver the last decade or so, it is taking longer for people who are leaving all forms of education to move into work.  In general, the story regarding the other two aspects that I mentioned—\njobseeker’s allowance\n and other benefits—is very good compared \nwith\n the mass unemployment of the 1980s\n,\n and as Lindsey said, for those on unemployment benefits there is now an improvement for those aged 18\n to \n24.\nThe Chairman: \nCould I ask a final question on that?  Have you done any work that gives you good evidence of how long it takes for somebody who, say, leaves school to actually \nget\n a benefit?  I ask \nbecause \nthere are an awful lot of scare stories in local newspapers at the moment.  The statement was made to me only yesterday that it takes 15\n&#xa0;\nweeks for somebody to get a benefit.  If they are not living with their parents and have left school, this is really quite serious.  Do you have any idea about this?\nBill Wells: The people from the DWP might want to add something to this, but there is a distinction between whether you are applying and then how long it takes you, once you have applied for it, to get the benefit.  The problem lies in \nthe \nfirst of those, not the second, because Jobcentre\n&#xa0;\nPlus has targets for how quickly the benefits are paid.  \nThe Chairman: \nCould you actually tell us what the targets are, once someone has registered?\nAngus Gray: I am afraid I have not come—\nThe Chairman: \nIf you have any solid evidence on that, we would be grateful.\nAngus Gray: No, we will have.  Certainly, when I was working more closely with Jobcentre\n&#xa0;\nPlus, we published data regularly on those clearance times.  As Bill says, as well as the potential gap before someone realises there is help available and they claim, in the processing part of the organisation we also face the problem that people need time to respond when we ask for additional information.  Sometimes the delay is because they did not provide the evidence we asked for in the first place.  The delay quite often starts there.\nBill Wells: \nFifteen \nweeks sounds like an awfully long time to clear the benefit.  I would be very surprised if the evidence suggested it was anything like that.\nThe Chairman: \nThe problem with \nsomething like \nthis is \nthat \nit is always the rogue one that gets noticed; I do understand that.\n  The question also asked what the role of the devolved \nA\ndministrations is in tackling the issue\n.  Is it different from the way it is tackled in \nEngland\n?\nLindsey Lewis: Employment policy is not devolved\n,\n except in \nNorthern Ireland\n.  \nNorthern\n&#xa0;\nIreland\n tends to take a mirrored position to \nGreat\n&#xa0;\nBritain\n.  However, related issues such as \ntraining, skills and education are devolved issues.  All the devolved authorities can choose how they approach those important issues.\nQ3 &#xa0; \nLord Haskel: Mr\n&#xa0;\nWells told us about splitting up unemployed young people into three: people on \njobseeker’s allowance\n, people on other benefits and people on no benefits.  Is there any further disaggregation necessary of the different types of young people and their different needs, so we can ensure the effectiveness of the policies?\nBill Wells: Again, I probably have to distinguish between those on benefits and those not on benefits.  The focus of the work on people on benefits is individual\n&#x2011;\nbased; it is not based on their characteristics.  When they come in, there is a discussion with their advis\ne\nr, if it is Jobcentre\n&#xa0;\nPlus, as to the most effective way to get them into work.  There is a jobseeker’s agreement, which will take account of individual characteristics: for example, whether a lone parent \nneeds\n to have a certain work pattern.  However, the general policy of the \nUK\n in this area is to focus on the individual and not to identify particular groups and treat \nthem\n as homogenous groups.\nLord Haskel: On the question of disaggregation, when we get the figures quoted they usually include full\n&#x2011;\ntime students.  You carefully disaggregated the full\n&#x2011;\ntime students.  How many full\n&#x2011;\ntime students are there?  What is the real figure?\nBill Wells: I am not sure \nthat \nI should say this is the real figure, but there are about 950,000 people on ILO unemployment and about 300,000 of those are in full\n&#x2011;\ntime education.  The improvement in ILO unemployment, although not substantia\nl, has been greater than among\n the ILO unemployed who are in full\n&#x2011;\ntime education.\nLord Haskel: Do you disaggregate the people as to their capabilities: for instance, into higher skills levels or higher academic levels?  Do you judge people and say, “He does not have much potential” or\n \n“She does not have much potential”?\nBill Wells: I will let my DWP colleagues talk about this a little.  It differs in different parts of the system.  If you \nare going in\nto the Department for Work and Pensions, the disaggregation is based on the most effective way of getting them into work.  If you go through the education system, it is based on the best way to get them into education or the best way to get them into training.  From an employment perspective, which tends to be my background, the distinction is based on the most effective way of getting people into work.\n \nAngus Gray: That is absolutely right: there is this individual diagnosis.  You would tend to give advice based on all sorts of things: ability, but also aspiration and motivation.  Often, the problem with young people is getting them \nfocused\n and interested.  At the beginning of entering the labour market, finding something that interests them and that they are capable of is as important as anything.\nOn your disaggregation point, the only thing I would add is that there is a bit of bias in the system around age.  There is a bias towards education and skills the younger they are in this group\n,\n and there is a growing bias towards work as they get older.\nThe Chairman: There is a big focus on NEETs. H\now useful is it as a category?\nBill Wells: It is slightly unfortunate that everybody collapses\n it\n into the word “NEETs”, because it is actually “not in education, employment or training”\n,\n and so, for example, someone who leaves university and might be waiting to take up a job is included in the NEET figures.  This is a nightmare\n, given \nthe different definitions in this area.\nThere are two definitions I would distinguish between, which might be helpful: one is unemployment, where people are looking for work; the other one is what I call economic inactivity, which is where someone is outside the labour market and not looking for work.  The workless include both those groups.  The problem tends to be, as I \nintimated\n before, among\n the people who are not looking for work and not looking for education either.  It is the workless people who are regarded in the labour\n&#x2011;\nmarket statistics as not looking for work, where the structural problem in youth worklessness\n, \nas I would call it\n, \nhas grown over time.  If you do not look for work, you will not get a job.\nAngus Gray: Bill’s analysis of the numbers is absolutely right.  However, you can look beyond the numbers at some of the people we worry about.  This is my own word association, but when I think about NEETs I think about some of the most disadvantaged young people.  At the \nyounger ages, you\n might think of persistent truants and people who have chaotic lifestyles at home.  You need to find them first, but the focus on them is absolutely crucial, because we are trying to avoid them losing\n—\nThe Chairman: \nT\nhe ability to work.\nAngus Gray:\n Yes.\nBill Wells: To pick that up, part of the story is that there is a greater focus within the system on the most disadvantaged people.  One of those elements is how long they have been in that situation.  The long\n&#x2011;\nterm unemployed would receive more direct help from Jobcentre\n&#xa0;\nPlus, whereas the expectation is that you get the short\n&#x2011;\nterm unemployed to look for work effectively and most of them will find that job within not very long at all.\nThe Chairman: A lot of these people come from homes where people have never worked; there is no tradition of working.  There is \nmore \na tradition of, “Well, we will just g\net\n by\n. T\nhere is\n nothing \nwe are skilled for”\n— \ndepression really\n. \n \nIs that true?  We hear a lot of stories about that.  Again, this could just be anecdotal.\nBill Wells: It is overstated.\nThe Chairman: Is it?  I see.\nBill Wells: It may be that the numbers do not tell the whole story, but if you look at the stories about two or three generations where nobody has worked, from what we can tell the numbers are quite small.\nThe Chairman: Do you have any actual evidence of that or numbers you could quote us?  It would be great if we could actually make that point in our final report.\nBill Wells: Yes, we do.\nThe Chairman: Do not worry about it now, but we would be grateful if you could send it to us.\nBill Wells: Yes, of course.\nAngus Gray: My understanding is that Bill is absolutely right, but you do get families and communities and where there is very little work.  Never having worked is quite a high bar.  You might have done the odd week or two\n,\n and then you are not in the “never worked” category.\nBill Wells: \nT\nhe concentration of worklessness \nmay be \nan issue, rather than the history of worklessness.\nQ4 &#xa0; \nLord Fearn: To what extent is the Government’s position on youth unemployment influenced by EU policy?  How are EU actions to tackle youth unemployment generally being interpreted and delivered in the \nUK\n?\nLindsey Lewis: \nMy \nLord Chairman, employment policy remains a \nmember state\n competence, but we do value the opportunity given by the European\n&#xa0;\ns\nemester to share experiences with other \nmember state\ns.  For example, we are sending a \nUK\n official to a mutual\n&#x2011;\nlearning event in the \nNetherlands\n in November and we are holding a mutual\n&#x2011;\nlearning event here on the minimum wage in April next year.  We will take part in multilateral surveillance, as part of the European\n&#xa0;\ns\nemester process, where we will be challenge\nd\n on our performance in this area and we have the opportunity to challenge others.\nThe Chairman: It is a useful function, is it not?\nLindsey Lewis: I believe so, yes.\nLord Fearn: When this deputation goes, are they going with \nUK\n policy on the unemployed?\nLindsey Lewis: The people who are going are policy officials, who are responsible for developing our policy.  It should inform policy development going forward.\nLord Fearn: What \nis the backup from \nthat?  Where does it go after that, when they get back from \nHolland\n?\nLindsey Lewis: It informs the policy process.  It is an opportunity to learn about a number of other countries’ policies and the way things work in their systems and to feed that into policy development in the \nUK\n.  There is no formal product, but it then becomes part of our knowledge base and our understanding.\nBill Wells: There is an important point about how most different countries have different systems.  Therefore, it is not a case of, say, going to the \nNetherlands\n,\n seeing the system and importing it wholesale over here.  The good ideas of things that seem to work are purloined by us and put alongside ours to see whether we could develop the policy in ways that suit the \nUK\n system.  Particularly in the employment field, the labour markets tend to be quite different in many of the \nmember state\ns.\nQ5 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: What I was going to ask follows on from that and\n from what \nMr\n&#xa0;\nGray said at the beginning about the EU’s Youth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative, which has the rather odd acronym of YEI.  How does that tie in with our own policies?  Let us divide it up, if you would, into the \nyouth\n&#xa0;\nguarantee \nscheme, European\n&#xa0;\nalliance for apprenticeships and the quality framework for traineeship\ns.  Taking that last one, I notice that the paper from\n the\n Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which I thought was very good, said about traineeship\ns\n that if some of the Commission’s proposals were taken into account it would not \nactually \nproduc\ne\n the right sort of answers; it would do exactly the opposite.  Could you deal with these three different categories?\nAngus Gray: To start with the overall bit about the YEI, the good news is that it is an additional source of funding, rather than a set of activities.  Because it fits within the European\n&#xa0;\nSocial\n&#xa0;\nFund framework more generally, it is for \nmember state\ns to \ndesign\n what they are going to do with the allocation.  That very much leaves us free to design interventions \nthat\n we think are appropriate for our context.  However, probably most importantly in \nEngland\n, the challenge for the European\n&#xa0;\nSocial\n&#xa0;\nFund is always to add value to what already exists.  In some of the EU \nmember state\ns, the structural\n&#x2011;\nfunds investment is either the only thing or by far the biggest thing that happens in their country on these topics, whereas we already have substantial investment of all sorts.  Therefore, what you need to do is make sure ESF is filling the gaps.\nWe have seen this with some of the strategies that have come back\n. O\nften, one of the things ESF can helpfully be used for is preparing people so they are ready for other mainstream provision\n, \nif that makes sense.  If they are some of the most disadvantaged, finding and equipping them so they are more likely to benefit from a traineeship or an apprenticeship is one of the key added\n&#x2011;\nvalue actions we can take.  In that respect, the YEI is not a separate \nEU\n policy that we have to worry about\n. I\nt is largely a source of money, with which we can do something sensible.\nWe do have more reservations about the Youth\n&#xa0;\nGuarantee, not in its aspiration that you need to help young people with a range of different offers, but more in the insistence that it should be done at the four\n&#x2011;\nmonth period.  As Bill was saying, particularly for those on \njobseeker’s allowance\n, people already find work quickly.  Over 80% of 18\n to \n24\n \nyear\n&#x2011;\nolds flow off \njobseeker’s allowance\n within six months.  If you put that kind of mandatory blanket provision in place\n \nat\n four months, you will actually slow that down and hold people back from entering work when they would have done otherwise.  It is a cost\n&#x2011;\neffectiveness issue\n,\n and the dispute hinges aro\nund that four\n&#x2011;\nmonth threshold.\nWe have succeeded\n, \nat least in our reading of the \nr\negulation\n,\n \nin making the \nr\negulation more flexible on this point.  The release of the money is not tied to the implementation of a Youth\n&#xa0;\nGuarantee scheme; it is one of the things you can do with it.  There is a clause in the \nregulation\n now that talk\ns\n about including the Youth\n&#xa0;\nGuarantee scheme.  \nClearly\n, that only applie\ns\n where regions and countries are implementing one.\nOn traineeships and apprenticeships, we are very much behind the principle of the European\n&#xa0;\nAlliance for\n&#xa0;\nApprenticeships.  It is about sharing good practice between countries.  As ever, we are slightly sceptical about mechanisms and bureaucracy and whether you need an alliance as such to deliver that, but learning from each other seems a perfectly sensible thing to us.  If other \nmember state\ns want an alliance to share it, that is fine.  We are still partly reserving \njudgment\n on \nthe \nQuality Framework for Traineeships.  Traineeships are something we have started to introduce in \nEngland\n as of August this year; we are relatively new to them.  The focus is really about taking people who are not quite ready for apprenticeships and giving them that first intervention to help them take advantage of further help in due course.\nQ6 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: On the traineeships, you are \n“\nwaiting to see\n”\n, \nmore than \n“\nalready feeling\n”\n.  It is rather implied by the paper that there are some points in this it would not be sensible for us to apply.  I get the feeling that it is too rigid.\nAngus Gray: Yes.  There was a sense that the definition they are using is much broader than \nwhat we would term a\n traineeship.  We are not quite sure whether it is helpful or not.\nEarl of Liverpool: On th\ne\n point you have made, \npage 27 of the \npaper you are referring to says, rather strikingly, “As a result, there is a potential for such a measure to exacerbate youth employment rather than reduce it”\n.\n  That is in paragraph\n&#xa0;\n98.  It is quite a striking statement and I wonder \nwhether \nyou could enlarge upon it somewhat.\nBill Wells: I would link this with the four\n&#x2011;\nmonth \nissue\n.\n \nEssentially, there is what works and also what you tell people to do.  However, in general, the \nUK\n’s \napproach \nis to have a rights \nand\n \nresponsibilities agenda, which is about ensurin\ng that the individual themselves tries \nto take up a job and trie\ns\n to move into education.  There are some sanctions associated with that.  Rather than that, if you pick someone up and put them into something that does not suit them, it may retard their improvement.\nIt comes back a bit to the focus on the individual and the help and pressure that is applied\n: \nthat they go for something that suits them, rather than something that is specified \non a blackboard\n.\nAngus Gray: There is another point here, which you see played out in other policy debates: one man’s quality threshold is another man’s rigidity.  We are worried that the attempt to impose a quality threshold on traineeships means that the bar is set so high it would be \nto\no difficult to get employers involved in offering anything.  This is what we are getting at here: if you are not careful in your definition, you preclude all sorts of really valuable activities.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: \nIn terms of \ndevolved Administration\ns, you mentioned having to negotiate how \nthe \nmoney is going to be spent with the European\n&#xa0;\nCommission.  First of all, how does that work in general?  Secondly, how does it work when it is a \ndevolved Administration\n?  South\n-\nwest\n&#xa0;\nScotland\n would be the only area in question.\nAngus Gray: We have layers of agreement with the Commission.  There is a partnership agreement, which is at a \nmember state\n level.  We\n have to make a proposal and get i\nt agreed and negotiated with the Commission; that covers the whole of the \nUK\n.  Our approach there is to set out an overarching \nUK\n narrative about what we think the issues are and what we need to do.  There are then chapters for each of the \ndevolved Administration\ns going into more detail\n.\nYou are right: we are trea\nding a line at the moment between the \nmember state being\n the whole of the \nUK\n and some of these issues being \ndevolved.  In that document, we try\n to\n do that.  Beneath that are things called operational programmes\n,\n and they are at the level of the \ndevolved Administration\n.  The European\n&#xa0;\nSocial\n&#xa0;\nFund operational programme will be for \nEngland\n only and there will be a separate one for \nScotland\n.  The detail of how they will use the Youth\n&#xa0;\nEmployment\n&#xa0;\nInitiative will be set out in their operational programme, which is for them to design.  They separately negotiate that with the Commission.\nThis will be my first attempt at this\n;\n I am not clear what the negotiation will actually look like.  We will propose it on paper and they will tell us the things they do not like.  My understanding is the hard conversation will be about target levels, as you might expect.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: \nYou mentioned a hard conversation.  Is it very time consuming?  Is it like going to an old\n&#x2011;\nfashioned bank manager\n who says, “No, y\nou are not going\n to get the money, sorry\n.\n”?\nThe Chairman: \nHe is too young to know about bank managers.\nAngus Gray: I have heard of them.  My sense is \nthat \nnothing is absolutely speedy in dealings with the Commission, but it is not supposed to be a lengthy, drawn\n \nout process and, indeed, they are committed to getting it done maybe quicker this time than we have managed in the past, because the tripartite negotiations over the regulations have taken time\n. W\ne are now in October with no regulations agreed\n,\n with a January start date.  We will need to be swift in our discussions.\nQ7 &#xa0; \nLord Haskel: \nRather than the memory of bank managers, I wish to talk about traineeships very quickly.  They are what we used to call sandwich courses, but you are too young \nto know \nthat.  I would like to know how keen employers are on these various schemes.  How keen are employers on having traineeships and putting effort into it?  Of course, without the \nco-operat\nion of the employers, it is all a bit of a waste of time.\nAngus Gray: Precisely, yes.  I do not know about these precise schemes; they are relatively new.  We only launched them in August this year, so we probably do not have any feedback on this particular scheme, but my experience of working with employers in Jobcentre\n&#xa0;\nPlus was always that the trick was to speak their language\n.\nIf you go with a pre\n&#x2011;\nprepared product that is traditionally bureaucratic and full of detail and requirements, they will push back\n. H\nowever, for their own economic growth and business, they need good people\n, \nand they need to take advantage of young people.  It seems to me, therefore, that our task in \ng\novernment is to design things that work for th\nem and work of the individual.\nBill Wells: The focus on \nthe \nindividual is partly that th\ne individual gets to the job or \ntraineeship that suits them.  If it does not suit them, the employer will not \nfancy them a lot\n,\n because you have two sets of people who are not happy with the arrangement.\nLord Haskel: Presumably, it is a way of employers assessing the abilities of somebody.  Then they can decide whether or not to employ them.\nBill Wells: It is one of the benefits of that.\nThe Chairman: \nThis has been a very useful discussion.  Can I just track back for about 30 seconds to the four months versus the six months?  This has been a bone of contention for a long time.  \nIt was \nI think \nthe Netherlands that said at a conference I at\ntended\n that it is only a month or \neven \na week in \ntheir \nexperience.\n  Do you have any evidence to give us about the 28 \nmember state\ns and what the comparable figures are?  Is it that we are taking much longer than anybody else\n,\n or is it that the Commission \ndoes not realise\n the reality of the situation, which is that it is nearer to six months than four months?\nBill Wells: We will have some evidence across the EU, but this is one area where the particular situation in \nthe \nUK\n is quite important because, as Angus said, particularly on JSA the outflow rates are so large in the first year that it really is a waste of money \nparking \nsomeone who could be getting a job.  Having been involved in this discussion for a number of years, it is really the focus on the individual.  We have resisted the four\n&#x2011;\nmonth period; in fact, we have resisted most of the very short periods.  Part of the reason why people do it sooner rather than later is that they sometimes lose the young person, because they are not eligible for the benefit and therefore, when they leave school and go wherever they go into, they say, “Let us get them before they get lost\n”.\n  This is only one of the very many different systems across the EU\n, and\n one size does not fit all.\n \nThe Chairman: \nThat point obviously needs making, however.\nQ8 &#xa0; \nEarl of Liverpool: We had an interesting discussion about NEETs earlier, but I wonder if I may come back to them for this question.  The EU and \nUK\n youth\n \nunemployment policies place great emphasis on young people not in employment\n,\n \neducation\n or training.  Is this emphasis justified or are there good arguments for steering greater support towards \nmore \nemployable young people, given that they might have a faster and more sustainable impact on overall youth unemployment?\nBill Wells: I have touched on this a bit before, in the sense that it is important to realise that \nNEETs\n are not exactly the most disadvantaged or the most “unemployable”.  They are a range of different people\n.\nIn general\n, the \nUK\n policy is not to help those who need the least help; it is to help those who need the most help.  Most of the \nUK\n system is about pointing people\n in the right direction and \nmaking sure that they behave properly in terms of their rights and responsibilities.  However, when that does not succeed—it tends to be either on the education side or the employment side—they get\n more\n help from the state.\nOne of the things I should say is \nthat \nour labour market is sufficiently flexible that there are jobs for everybody, in the sense that it is very diverse and dynamic.  It is actually quite difficult to regard someone as unemployable, because the range of jobs in the \nUK\n is quite great.  Labelling them as unemployable may have damaging consequences as well.\nThe Chairman: \nDo you not think somebody should take that up from a political point of view or at least advertise that everybody can do a job and everybody can get the enjoyment from a job?  There are so many different varieties of job.  \nBill Wells: \nAngus might need to finish it\n.\nAngus Gray: In the words \n“\nsupport\n”\n,\n \n“\nattention\n”\n or \n“\nhelp\n”\n lurks a plethora of offers.  Actually, even for people who are on the more employable end of spectrum, some of the employers I have spoken to think that one of the gaps is good\n \nquality careers advice at the moment.  This is quite a theme in the plans that are coming forward.  They are saying, “We have some really exciting opportunities coming up over the next few years as we build \nX\n, \nY\n and \nZ\n”.\n  A good example might be the announcement of the nuclear reactor in \nSomerset\n.\n \nHowever, we do not have enough kids coming through the \nschool \nsystem who think that is a worthwhile outcome.  \nW\ne need to educate the labour force of tomorrow about the opportunities that do exist in this area.  That is not skills help or investment but, as you say, good signposting and good advice to them about what opportunities are coming up and therefore what choices they might make.  It is an important part of the system.\nQ9 &#xa0; \nBaroness Valentine: I am trying to join up the dots on some of this.  I am \nchief\n&#xa0;\nexecutive \nof London\n&#xa0;\nFirst, which is an employer group, so I understand the \nLondon\n dimension of it.  Very roughly, the number of vacancies and unemployed used to be about the same\n. Y\nou now have 25% youth unemployment in inner \nLondon\n.  I did not quite get what you were saying, but you are saying that employability skills may not be a big problem across that 25%.  Then you have lots of low\n&#x2011;\nskill entry jobs.  You know the old Pr\nê\nt\n&#xa0;\nà\n&#xa0;\nManger thing\n,\n where people go on hospitality jobs, he\nlping as waiters and waitresses—\nand \nthen you play in immigration as well, obviously, to that\n.  However, I cannot quite get \nwhat \nthe spectrum of those 25% youth unemployed is\n \nfrom what you are saying\n.  I can understand \nthat \nthey are all individuals, but what I hear most typically from the employers is \nthat \nif \nHilton advertise\ns\n a job for a waiter, no local British person applies\n. L\nots of other people apply.  There is something going on there\n.\nYou also hear that people do not have the employability skills\n. \nI am sure you are bored of hearing this\n. They \ndo not turn up at nine o\n’\nclock in the morning and they do not have the work ethic.  I then hear these anecdotes that they come from families \nwith \nthree generations \nwho \nhave not been employed and therefore they do not have a culture of working, but you are saying \nthat \nthat is something of a myth.  I cannot make \nall\n these things join up.\nBill Wells: Can I have a go at a couple of these?  The first thing is that the 25% is not a static group.  It is very important to realise that people move in and out\n of\n jobs quite a lot.  \nA\nbout \n6 million\n people move into and then out of a job each year.  To some extent, the unfilled vacancies are almost irrelevant, because there is always a range of vacancies available.\nThe other element about the flows into work—you mentioned Pr\nê\nt\n&#xa0;\nà\n&#xa0;\nManger—is not true.  There are lots of young people moving into jobs.  A lot of the 25% is a sho\nrt period of unemployment while\n they take up the job.\nHowever, the other feature that is real, which we mentioned, is this point about where you lose people from the system and they are not looking for those jobs.  The numbers that we quote with some g\nlee about the JSA off-\nflows do suggest that most people who get on\n \nto JSA leave\n,\n and leave for a positive outcome\n,\n very quickly.  There is not the same success with people \nwho \nwe are not in touch with\n,\n and they tend to be people who are not looking for work.  It is important to focus on the flows in this.  There is a set of positive flows, which most young people go through and find jobs across a range of industries\n. T\nhere is then a smaller group who we mostly have not \ngot hold of\n, who are there for a long period of time.\nBaroness Valentine: \nHow would you describe the employability skills of that group you are talking about there?\nBill Wells: We do not know, because we cannot \nget\n them.  From the surveys, they tend to be dominated by people at the lower end of the employability\n \nskills spectrum\n. H\nowever, they are not all in that group.  I am less sure about this, but the employability of this group seems to have improved over time.  It is the matching of the individuals to the jobs that is really quite important\n, \nif we are going to concentrate on jobs.  There are similar issues around moving into education and training.\nAngus Gray: One of the risks here is that the generalisation of the diagnosis could lead to a generalisation about the solution for the individual.  It is one of the things we are always weighing up.\nThe Chairman: \nThat is life, though, is it not?  We all do that.\nAngus Gray: \nW\nhat you do not want to do is say, “Everyone has to be at this level before we even allow them to think about \ngoing into \nwork\n”.\n  As Bill says, there are all sorts of vacancies.  Equally, I am \npretty \nsure \nthat \nmy classics degree made me less employable.  \n \nThe definitions are key.\nLord Cotter: \nI have \na wee little\n point.  I was very pleased to hear you mention careers advice and guidance\n \nyourself.  N\not to diverge\n too long by talking about it now\n, on the other hand\n it comes through very strongly indeed from employers\n.  I\nt also comes through very strongly in a lot of the written evidence \nthat \nwe have rec\neived from all sorts of sources. I\nt comes through very strongly indeed from \np\narliamentarians\n,\n and I do not think \nthat \nthe Government as such\n, \nwithout being too specific\n, \nare prepared to address that issue.  I hope officials will be pushing in that direction.\nThe Chairman: That is a very good point.  Thank you, Lord\n&#xa0;\nCotter.\nQ10 &#xa0; \nBaroness Hooper: There are only certain \nUK\n areas \nthat\n will be eligibl\ne to receive the €6\n&#xa0;\nbillion earmarked.  You said at the outset \nthat \nthose are areas where there is unemployment of 25% or more.  If I may be permitted a little personal reminiscence, when the European\n&#xa0;\nSocial\n&#xa0;\nFund was introduced in the earl\ny\n 1980s, I was a \nMember of the European\n&#xa0;\nParliament for \nLiverpool\n.  In Liverpool there was need, but in \nLiverpool\n there was also a very well advanced group of civil society representatives.  With help, encouragement and information from me, in that first year we received more in social funding in Liverpool than anywhere else in the \nUnited\n&#xa0;\nKingdom\n.  My question now is this: what work is being done, and by whom, to prepare and deliver projects that will help with the youth unemployment and be able to tap into this earmarked funding for the 2014\n&#x2011;\n16 period?\nAngus Gray: This is very much a joint enterprise.  As I said in my opening remarks, we have \nset local\n&#xa0;\nenterprise\n&#xa0;\npartnerships the task of \nleading on the development of strategies for the structural funds in those areas.  If, like Merseyside, they are one of the YEI areas, that will include this element, recognising where their skills lie, w\nhich is principally in employer \nled conversations about growth.  We have also made clear that they need to develop new strategies in partnership with others.  You have mentioned civil society\n. T\nhat is one of the key groups they need to consult and involve, but there are many others, too.\nWe are currently assessing the strategies, but our first pass suggests that they have mostly done a good job on consultation with partners and they can continue to do that.  They are coming up with ideas about how they might use it.  It is fair to say they are in high\n&#x2011;\nlevel embryonic form at the moment, but the common \ntheme was\n careers advice and guidance\n, as \nI have mentioned already.  Because they are business leaders, they have an opportunity to display leadership in their area and work with employers to help young people make that transition from education into work.\nWhether it is people leaving care or people suffering other disadvantages, the other theme is a recognition that more specialised and targeted help for some of those groups might be necessary.  The process we are going through is agreeing those strategies with those areas.  It will then become even more of a joint enterprise between \ng\novernment and the area, turning those into more detailed plans that the\nn\n turn into projects and delivery on the ground to target the individuals, areas and themes that they want us to focus the money on.\nBaroness Hooper: Are we prepared to take it up as rapidly as the Commission is advocating?\nAngus Gray: There are many nights \nwhen \nI wake up in a cold sweat\n,\n and that was increased with the notion that YEI had to be frontloaded in the first two years, until my more experienced colleagues reminded me that because of the European rules on spend, the two years is when we have to commit the money, but the \nn+3\n rule\n \nmeans that we do not have to spend it all until 2018.  We have to get our plans in order quickly\n. W\ne have to mobilise the procurement and project sta\nrt\n relatively quickly.  However, we have a total of five years to spend the money\n, which is more reassuring \nand\n,\n \nI think, \nperfectly possible.\nLord Cotter: \nWhat is the Government’s view on the use of the European\n&#xa0;\nSocial\n&#xa0;\nFund to tackle youth unemployment specifically?\nAngus Gray: It has long been a feature of our use of the ESF to focus on young people.  As I said earlier, we use it \nin \nthat way at the moment.  This is just a strengthening of that focus.  Without the YEI, we would have \nfocused\n a decent proportion \nof the resources \non youth unemployment.  I would be surprised if there were many of the 39 areas that do not have a focus on youth unemployment, given its current level.  In the five areas covered by this, it would simply be an additional focus in order to use the additional funding.  The important thing, as I have said a few times, is that we design interventions that fit with what already exist\ns\n.  The notion that we should be helping young people as we emerge from recession must be absolutely right.\nLord Cotter: L\nocal enterprise partnerships\n \nhave a really strong focus locally in all \nareas on \nthe point of view of the business side of things.  How do you \nfeel\n you would specifically work through the \nlocal enterprise partnerships \nto advance the sensible use of the ESF?  They are rather \nfocused\n not on social issues\n but on how businesses are run in the area\n. T\nhey are important \nfrom\n that point of view, of course.  How can you use them?\nAngus Gray: You are absolutely right.  From the point of view of the ESF, this is genuinely both a threat and an opportunity.  We have stressed tha\nt the LEPs cannot do this alone\n because, as you say, they have a particular focus.  \nAll\n the boards are a mixture of business and civic leadership—i.e\n.\n local authorities.  Local authorities clearly have a very keen interest in a whole range of social issues, but particularly youth, because they have a key accountability in relation to young people and raising the participation age, so they are engaged.  Even with that\n,\n the LEP by itself is necessary but not sufficient\n. T\nhat is always what I say\n.\nThis is why we have required them to engage with a wider range of partners locally to get ideas about what should be done.  It is also a real opportunity, because although, as Bill says, there are jobs coming up all the time, we also need more growth.  Therefore,\n we \nwould be more likely to engage young people in those upcoming opportunities if we can both drive \ngrowth \nin local areas through these funds and use \nthe \nESF to make sure people can take advantage of \nthe \nopportunities\n,\n and make that link between employers and young people\n, \nboth encouraging them to make opportunities available\n and\n, on the issue of careers guidance\n, having\n a powerful story about what jobs will be coming up.\nQ11 &#xa0; \nLord Cotter: Can I pick you up on your words once again?  There is a little window of opportunity there.  You mentioned relating to young people.  Again, this is something \nthat \nmany of us feel very strongly about.  Again, quite a lot of the written evidence \nthat \nwe are getting is talking about what is happening in \nEurope\n in terms of relating to young people.  Quite a lot is done in that direction.  There is a concern that perhaps—you mention\ned\n it\n, so\n I am picking up on it—there is a great need for young people to be around the table and tell\ning\n us what they really think about their different areas of experience.  What do you think of that?\nAngus Gray: What we tend to do\n, \nnot just with young people\n, \nis engage with representative groups.  There is a slight challenge here if you are thinking about young people who are out of work who you want to help into work.  They disqualify themselves from the organising committee by getting a successful outcome.  I am not sure how you would con\nstruct\n that kind of body in such a flexible and dynamic labour market\n. E\nqually, we are open to ideas and thoughts about how to make that work locally, because you need to design services that appeal.\nThe Chairman: \nWe are \nopen if\n you have further ideas yourself.  If you do, please let us know.\nLord Cotter: \nYes, please do, because it really is such an important issue.  \nThe Chairman: \nIt is terribly important.  Certainly, we have discussed this around this table before now.  We cannot ignore these people.  We simply cannot do it.  It is more important that we really get started on that bottom part\n while \nobviously encouraging \ng\novernment.\nLord Cotter: \nThis is such a strong issue.  There was a very good debate on Friday about young people voting at 16.  A lot of issues came out of that.  \nPlease\n pick up on that\n and help us.\nThe Chairman: \nIt is in \nHansard\n for the House\n&#xa0;\nof\n&#xa0;\nLords last Friday.  It was Friday, was it not?\nLord Cotter: \nIt was on Friday.\nQ12 &#xa0; \nBaroness Valentine: \nYou have already touched on best practice from other EU countries.  I know you have said \nthat \nyou cannot lift and shift things, but are there examples of things that have the germs of ideas that you would like to see how you can implement or in some way plagiarise in the \nUK\n from the rest of \nEurope\n?\nLindsey Lewis: We do not have specific ideas, but \nEurope\n is a fertile ground to look at what other \nmember state\ns are doing.  In the scheme of thi\nn\ngs, we are actually doing quite well in\n \nthis area.  We have seen lower levels of unemployment\n th\nan following previous recessions\n,\n and we are doing better than the European average.\nHowever, there are European \nmember state\ns that are performing better than us\n,\n and some of them are performing\n better\n than us because their economy is doing better, but there are ot\nhers that are performing better\n but have also had a difficult economic time.  One of those examples would be the \nNetherlands\n.  This is partly why we are going to take part in this event in November to try \nto\n explore \na bit more \nwhat they are doing and what drives their outcomes.  However, as we said before, the \nNetherlands\n has a structure that is quite strongly based on sector\n&#x2011;\nwide collective\n \nagreements with employers, which is quite different from our own situation.  How much we can lift directly is not clear, but it should still have some interesting learning \nopportunities \nfor us.\nBill Wells: As well as that, there are multinational organisations.  In our evidence, we mentioned some of the work that is done by places like the OECD.  For a very long time, they have considered young people\n. H\nowever, they have also considered best practice across the whole of the labour market.  Therefore, we listen to them, partly because they tend to try to evaluate the results and make them generally applicable.  Some of our policies have a strong feeling of some of the reports from the OECD.\nBaroness Valentine: Can I follow up on that\n?  \nThe OECD sound\ns\n like a very good example.  This is probably a whole set of prejudices all muddled up together, but my sense is that Germany has training much better ingrained into the private sector and has had that philosophy\n \nfor many years, whereas in Britain we passed it all over to the public sector for a couple of decades and it is now trying to come back in again.  I am interested \nin\n, for instance, the German example\n,\n \nor\n \nare\n the lessons more about the broader context in which one does training, rather than specific examples\n?\nBill Wells: There is a history for this, because our system at one stage look\ned\n much \nmore \nlike the German system\n, albeit \nquite a long time ago.  You are quite right: it is embedded in both the education system and the labour market.  The transition for a large part of the youth cohort \nmostly \ninto apprentices is a big feature in \nGermany\n.  It is partly the quality of \nthe \napprenticeships, but it is also the links between \nthe \neducation and the apprenticeship and between the apprenticeship and what happens when people leave the apprenticeship\n.\nWe may not be able to replicate the German system, but the setting up of the wiring and increasing the extent of jobs with training, particularly apprentices, is something we probably ought to aspire to\n. W\ne have not managed it for quite a long time.\nThe Chairman: \nWe have not managed it yet.\nAngus Gray: We are probably slow to\n give\n credit \nto \nwhere we get \nour \nideas from, but we have been pushing and massively expanding our apprenticeship programme in recent years.  We have introduced the traineeships this year.  It does not say on the bottom of the tin, “Imported from \nGermany\n”, but it would not surprise me at all if my colleagues were learning what worked from them.\nBill Wells: I think we have probably spoken to \nGermany\n before.\nBaroness Valentine: \nI am sure we \nwould \nhave spoken to them\n first and then imported it back\n.\n  \nHowever, your 2020 horizon is almost the kind of timeframe in which there might be a cultural shift.  One of the \nissues\n we were discussing is that this\n is\n not a quick\n&#x2011;\nfix problem.\nAngus Gray: It is partly always about the dual system: trying to give equal parity to academic and non\n&#x2011;\nacademic routes f\nro\nm 16.  That is a cultural thing\n,\n and through their long history\n,\n \nin \nGermany\n they have that cracked.  We do not\n, \nyet.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: T\nhis is the final question\n. I\nt will raise a few har\ne\ns, I think.  What is the Government’s view on encouraging the migration of unemployed workers from areas of high unemployment to those of high employment, both within the \nUK\n and across the EU?  I have to declare an interest.  \nHaving been educated in Ireland\n, \nI always say that \nthree times in my lifetime \nthey educated people for the \nemigrant\n ship, but in fact two of the results were that a much higher skilled labour force came back.  It is in the DNA of the Irish to travel the world\n. I\nt has been since about the fifth century.  However, bear in mind \nthat \nthe p\neople we are talking about now think nothing about going off to Stansted and having a weekend in \nItaly\n, whereas when I was their age it would never have happened.  I \nwonder\n whether that comes into your thinking at all\n. D\no the Government actually think in this way?  I hop\ne there are no reporters here.\nBaroness Hooper: \nThis is being broadcast.\nThe Chairman: \nYes it is\n, \nof course.  However, they might suggest, “She says, ‘Shove them all abroad’ or, ‘Migrate from the Isle of Skye to the \nIsle of Wight\n’”\n.\n \n However, w\nhat is the view?  \nLindsey Lewis: As you rightly say, there are two aspects to this.  There is one about moving within the \nUK\n and one about moving within the EU.  In the \nUK\n, we do already \nencourage \njobseekers to search for work beyond their immediate location.  \nJ\nobseeker’s allowance\n claimants are expected to search for work within 90 minutes’ travel distance from their home unless they have a specific issue like caring \nresponsibilities\n or a physical or mental condition.  Jobcentre\n&#xa0;\nPlus \nadvisers\n can also provide jobseekers with support to cover the costs of\n attending\n interviews within the \nUK\n.  There is support and encouragement for moving around.\nAs regards the EU, t\nhe \nUK\n supports the principle of free movement of workers within the EU\n. H\nowever, we need to be careful that we do not end up shifting unemployment around \nEurope\n.  We want to attract the brightest and best to the \nUK\n and we want to use EU workers to fill short\n&#x2011;\nterm skills gaps in shortage professions while we train \nUK\n workers to take \nup \nthose positions\n.\nW\nhere there is high demand for labour\n but it cannot be filled locally, e\nncouraging migration can be helpful\n. \nGermany\n would be a good example.  \nIt has \nlabour shortages and \nit is \nencouraging migration from \nmember state\ns with high unemployment, like \nSpain\n.  That could be helpful.\nBill Wells: I had a couple of characteristics to mention about the diversity of individuals and jobs as well.  The first thing is that, within the \nUK\n, it tends to be that the people who are workless are in the same place as where there are jobs.  For example, in \nLondon\n there are 5\n&#xa0;\nmillion jobs, but there are only around 3.9\n&#xa0;\nmillion Londoners in work.  The rest are taken by commuters, basically.  There are opportunities for people who are there.  A similar example is \nMiddlesbrough\n. \nI do not know whether it is a town or a city.\nThe Chairman: It is a city, I am sure.\nBill Wells: I am sorry.  It is a city that has a major problem, but there are actually more jobs in Middlesbrough than there are people from \nMiddlesbrough\n who are in jobs.  The reason I emphasise this is that there are opportunities\n.\nMoving a bit more broadly to the overall situation, the employment rates of migrants within the EU ha\nve \nmoved to be higher than for the domestic group\ns\n.  That is true whether it is for Polish people coming over here or British people in \nSpain\n.  If there is a theme for what I am saying, it is that because there are these vacancies, if you can match the people with the vacancies you get very surprising results\n.\nThere is a very diverse situation with higher levels of employment than you might imagine in southern \nSpain\n among\n British people who have never been close to speaking Spanish\n. A\nnd vice versa\n: \nthere is the \nPrêt à Manger\n \ndiscussion\n.\nQ14 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: \nThat is very interesting.  It has been brought to my attention that the OECD report in the writt\nen evidence—the Government seem\n to emphasise this quite a lot—suggests there is more updated research available, such as Eurofound, which is the work foundation.  Why have you taken th\ne old and probably out \nof\n \ndate research as opposed to this more recent research?\nBill Wells: I have two comments on this.  We mentioned one set of information in the OECD.  They have subsequently done quite a lot of work, including on young people.  We used this as a summary of what we thought was best practice.  Regarding the comparison of Eurofound and the OECD, there tends to be a greater market orientation in \nthe \nanalysis within OECD than there is within Eurofound.  It is not that we do not take information from \nall\n these \nelements\n; it is more that we can recognise some of the features of the policies and institutions in the UK in some of the OECD analysis more than we ca\nn in Eurofound’s, for example. \nThe Chairman: \nI \nwonder\n whether it would be worthwhile having a second look at that.\nBill Wells: Yes.\nThe Chairman: \nDo not spend much time doing it, but if you could\n,\n let us know.  I am a bit concerned \nnow \nthat this has come into my brain.\nFinally, I always ask our witnesses, if you were in my position, what questions would you have asked that I have not asked and how would you answer them?  I do not suggest that you should give me the answer straight\n \naway, but again on the basis that we have found this session very interesting and most informative\n—\nwe want to take the most we can from you, and there might be glaring \nholes\n that we have not actually covered\n—\nif you could think about that and write to us, we would be delighted.\nBaroness Hooper: This may be one of those holes.  A\nt the outset, \nAngus\n&#xa0;\nGray said he was speaking for\n \nEngland\n, as it were.  On the background information, it says “\nEngland\n and \nGibraltar\n”.  Given that I have a debate coming up on economic development \ni\nn the overseas territories later this week, I would be very interested to know if any of this applies to \nGibraltar\n, please.\nAngus Gray: Do you want me to answer now?\nBaroness Hooper: \nYes\n,\n \nbecause the debate is this week.\nAngus Gray: The current ESF \noperational \nprogramme, which I am responsible for, is \nEngland\n and \nGibraltar\n.  As you are probably more aware than I am, \nGibraltar\n i\ns a fairly unique place.  While\n they run their own ERDF programme, we subcontract the ESF\n programme\n to them.  That is not \nquite \nthe right language, but \nthat is kind of\n the relationship.  I have encouraged them to take fuller ownership of the ESF for next time.  It is clearly some extra work for them and a bit less work for me, but that has not been the main driver.  The opportunity to integrate what they are doing on ERDF with what they do on ESF is an opportunity I am encouraging them to take.\nBaroness Hooper: \nThey are not exactly a high unemployment area in any event, but there could be youth issues that could apply.\nAngus Gray: Indeed, yes.  The good news is that because it is such a small \ncommunity\n, they tend to know the young people who are out of work\n,\n and they know which ones who are out of work because their parents are too generous and those out of work because they need help.\nThe Chairman: That is a new category, is it not?  On that happy note, I am sure I speak for all the Committee when I thank you all very much indeed.  It has been a most helpful session, but we would like further information from you\n, \nif you have it.  Thank you very much.\n&#xa0;\n"
