As part of improving their provision for financial education we\n encourage\n the schools involved to \nform \nmeaningful and \nlasting partnerships \nwith the \nsupporters \n(funders) \nof \nthe\n programme\n. \nSupporters\n currently\n include Experian\n, Santander, JP Morgan, the Building Societies Trust, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Threadneedle and M&amp;G Investments. \nWe facilitate financial education employee volunteering opportunities to make financial education real and relevant to\n young \npeople’s lives, and to help \npupils link learning in the classroom with life outside. Appropriate inputs from private sector industry experts can make a real impact on outcomes for students and can add significant social capital to disadvantaged young peopl\ne, particularly in relation to their aspirations around work\n, career choices\n and future lifestyle.\niii.\n \nCrucially, as an independent charity with financial education expertise, we provide an essential quality assurance role in ensuring that information \nand\n resources\n used by teachers and students are impartial and free from \nbranding\n. We also \nensure supporters’ employees are adequately prepared for their volunteering experiences so the best possible outcomes are achieved for students. \npfeg also f\nacilitate\ns\n \na\n \nstrong, practice\n-\nbased teacher network on behalf of the \nschools\n involved with the programme.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
