[[[Ombudsman]]]

[[[ Service]]]”. I have concerns that some people in authority start with the assumption that complainants who did not have their cases investigated do not have a justified grievance and are simply unhappy they did not get the outcome they wanted. This attitude as justification of why the Ombudsman investigates so few complaints and on review very rarely finds they made a wrong decision means there will continue to be missed opportunities to improve patient safety. I believe patient safety should be a priority of everyone involved in the Inquiry and this basic principle must be addressed.&#xa0;It took the hospital 10 months to conduct a review and respond to my complaint. It took the PHSO a further 13 months to give me their decision not to investigate. I asked the PHSO to review how they made their decision and they have agreed to take a look. I am now waiting for their response which can take up to 16 weeks. I have given copies and evidence of my complaint to my MP Mr George Hollingbery.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.  There is clear evidence from the notes and response letters that a critical blood result that the hospital stated

Failure to provide a safety system for reporting critical results inevitably leads to potentially serious delays in management. The Ombudsman, without evidence made assumptions on timings to justify delays which I find very worrying and only highlighted more concerns of patient safety. They did express concern the hospital made no mention of reporting procedures and said they would share this information with them. However without an investigation to find exactly where in the system the failure happened and provide remedial action or education to prevent it happening again it could easily happen to many other patients.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.   I would like my points considered with regard to recommendations made in the Baroness Fritchie report regarding benefits to wider public safety which stated that the Ombudsman should

My letter from the Ombudsman declining to investigate was dated 10th June 2013, the day before the Inquiry and is therefore proof of their working practice at that time. The Ombudsman accepted the recommendations made by Baroness Fritchie and used them to introduce their new strategy in November 2012. However following the Ombudsman’s response to my complaint I would question how effective this review and the new strategy have been. Who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations and how is the true value of this or any other review measured? I would be grateful if the PASC could give serious consideration to these questions during the inquiry.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
