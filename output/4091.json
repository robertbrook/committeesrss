"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContractual requirements of ESF through the SFA’s contracts are divorced from local priorities, and don’t adequately reflect specific targeted wards, vulnerable young people or characteristics. Consequently, there is very little local accountability through the current co-financing system\n,\n or evidence of NEET figures reducing over a three year period as a result of SFA commissioned activity.\n&#xa0;\n1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommissioners who are far from Birmingham and its NEET young people are awarding contracts to national providers who often have no knowledge or track record of work with NEETS in this city. Major regional contracts are currently with Primes who have no local presence and are often poor at connecting with local NEET populations.&#xa0;1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Authorities are under a statutory duty to secure suitable and sufficient places in education or training, for all young people in their area aged 16-19 (and up to age 24 for those with learning difficulties or disabilities).  The current system of ESF co-financing through the SFA does not allow local authorities to discharge these legal duties effectively, as interventions for NEET young people are not specific enough to meet the needs and address the barriers of individuals. \n&#xa0;1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the national landscape changes, with regards to a shift from national policy making to localism (ie LEPs/Core Cities), there is a clear role emerging for local authorities to take a strong and influencing lead to drive forward economic development, including the skills system. Driving forward alignment of public sector investment with key strategies and priorities of the LEP/Core City is essential in tackling some of the most stubborn issues related to socio-economic activity… There must be a dual approach of broadening access to jobs and skills and creating jobs in the first place.&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is little evidence of a community of good practice being shared across the city, specifically good practice related to employability and skills delivery in the workplace. Providers themselves acknowledge that the huge diverse tapestry of provision in Birmingham is hard to navigate.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA single organisation should manage provision from beginning to end and ensure the necessary linkages, but not deliver all components – specialist organisations are better placed in many cases. There are enough quality organisations locally to deliver these services to young people.&#xa0;1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Local Authority needs to have more influence over what type of provision is commissioned in the City / Region so that specialist providers can advise them on what is required. For example ESF provider has not been able to respond to needs of young offenders; despite raising this issue being raised, it hasn’t been\n possible to influence a change.\n&#xa0;\n1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe tendering, procurement, contracting and contract/performance management should all be done on a local level, led by Local Authorities in conjunction with LEPs.   Given the travel-to-learn patterns in 14-19 education, a Sub-regional approach (Birmingham and Solihull) would be effective. &#xa0;\n1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe underlying economic structures of a given economy and the interplay of the labour market makes public policy particularly challenging when administered at the national level … I would suggest that the local authority has a clear role to play marshalling the strategic levers and linkages bringing employers/providers and other stakeholders together to help resolve some of the most stubborn inequalities in the city. The city could use commissioning as a key strategy that would influence the whole process.\n&#xa0;1.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe supply of post 16 education and skills (and arguably pre-16) has become increasingly market-like over the last 20 years, with a proliferation of different types of providers drawn from the public, private and third sector. Evidence (high NEET rates and youth unemployment) suggests this has led to market failures resulting in many hard to reach groups being excluded from mainstream provision. Further, because providers exercise certain freedoms it is quite possible that working with disadvantaged young people takes second place, as disadvantaged learners could be considered high risk groups in terms of success rates and resource intensive (ie propensity for profit) compared to young people who have already achieved a standard of education ie 5 GCSEs A*-C and have a high probability of completing their programme of study.&#xa0;\n1.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBirmingham requires a more nuanced system able to deal with the diversity and complexity of need which exists in the city... \nCurrent approaches to developing employment opportunities for young people are hampered by their very ‘universality’: they do not take account of individual circumstances, barriers and psychological aspects affecting behaviour and motivation\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommissioners need to assess bidders’ understanding of holistic intervention which will address all barriers and improve young people’s confidence, motivation and resilience, rather than focus on mainstream educational ability. EU contracts need to include an element of pastoral and welfare support.&#xa0;\n1.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven where pr\noviders have experience of post-\n18 provision, this does not equip them to work \neffectively \nwith\n the 15\n-18 cohort.\n&#xa0;\n1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA combination of competition and data-sharing barriers prevent partnership, co-operation and pooling of resources between providers. Addressing this would require issues of double-funding and double-counting to be overcome.&#xa0;1.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiscounting in tenders leads to ‘race to the bottom’ on unit price, leaving insufficient funding to sub-contractors to deliver quality specialist provision\n.\n&#xa0;1.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSFA Minimum Contract Level requirements disadvantage smaller providers – even a voluntary sector consortium which was originally set up by LSC for this purpose is now unable to compete for contracts. Bidding processes are also too complex and drawn-out.&#xa0;\n1.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVol\nuntary and community\n sector \norganisations \ncurrently find \ncommunication with LEP very difficult – even for consortia of vol\nuntary\n org\nanisation\ns that \nthemselves are \nlarge employers \ncollectively \nand \nare \ndelivering big programmes\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDelivering to profile is seen as more important than quality of delivery / sustainability of impact. Providers themselves recognise that entirely back-ended funding structures may not be appropriate to working with some cohorts.&#xa0;1.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCon\ntract holders \ndictate to\n referral agencies,\n \nrather than \nresponding\n to identified needs of specialist agencies or young people themselves. \n&#xa0;\n1.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBirmingham definitely needs more local commissioning arrangements, the Single Work programme model has not delivered well. The Youth strategy is better as it has more effective sub- contracting arrangements but even it is heavily bureaucratic. &#xa0;1.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe s\nhort term nature of EU funding works against national providers building local linkages; even where a national provider has successfully delivered a programme locally, they may still fail to win a future contract in the same area.\n&#xa0;\n2              Innovation&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding is currently focused on intervention rather than prevention and delivered by providers that ‘parachute’ into the area while there is funding. This means that there is no local legacy from current ESF projects and we go through a cycle of short-term projects that reinforce the status quo. The SFA contracts do not ensure that there is sustainability of the methodolog\nies, relationships and systems.\n&#xa0;\n2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current system of ESF co-financing through the SFA, does not allow the funding to be used to promote innovation, particularly for pump-priming new initiatives or for capacity building of the education and training sector. The nature of the providers often means there is a lack of awareness of what has already been tried locally. &#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrent contracts offer no incentives for providers to go the extra mile, either because unit price for each participant is too restrictive, or because the contract holder seeks to maximise income.\n&#xa0;\n2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA great deal of resource and time is spent by those providing social support in bringing together the myriad of agencies who have been involved with the young person for some time in order that they effectively collaborate and communicate together. Where innovative examples of good practice have been developed, an ability to extend the programme is currently hampered by funding structures and requirements which do not ‘fit’ this programme, and a lack of engagement on the part of employers despite our best efforts.&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nuggestions\n of innovative practice that should be funded in the future \ninclude\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork-related learning can be more effective than simple work experience (which can often be not much more than photocopying). Staff involvement with young people through literacy programmes such as Words for Work has also been effective. Training staff so they can better provide mentoring to young people is important. &#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScenario-based approaches to enable \n&#xa0;\n14-19 year olds to access ‘real life’ situations in authentic work care settings are effective…The emphasis is on \n&#xa0;\ncombining \n&#xa0;\npractical skills alongside academic knowledge. At the same \ntime ensuring young\n people have a well defined route through which they can be encouraged to explore the wide variety of employment opportunities the company offers. \n&#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPre-employment training for apprentices ie a week’s course before the apprentice is chosen which focuses on understanding the company and its values, presentation skills etc.&#xa0; We have found the drop-out from apprenticeships has fallen substantially since adopting this approach. &#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe often talk about young people \nin deficit terms. \nPerhaps rather than having low aspirations, life has taught many to have low \nexpectations\n, and it is this that guides their behaviour. A successful approach must work with the entirety of the young person’s experience, accept the impact which this has on the most marginalised and seek to equip young people with the skills and resilient self-beliefs to exert control over their lives in order to override the negative effects of risk factors in their family, environment and personal history.\n \nUnless people believe they can produce the desired effects by their actions, they have little incentive to act or persevere in the face of difficulties. Evidence suggests that a more structured system with guaranteed outcomes following successful completion of certain ‘staging posts’ (such as within the German model) give a greater scope for young people to develop a positive sense of self and are empowered to achieve their own successes in the future. A structured approach works well for those young people who wish to follow a professional route (GCSEs – A levels – degree), so why not build in more structure to alternative routes? We need to get better at developing a sense of p\nersonal agency and self-belief \namong whose life experiences have negatively affected their expectations and beliefs. \nA\nchieving this for the most vulnerable and marginalised of our youth, who are most likely to be unemployed, and potentially be drawn into other activities which negatively affect them, their families and their communities requires a greater level of investment by highly skilled professionals. We also believe that the swiftest means to develop helpful beliefs and ‘workplace’ skills is achieved through socialisation in the work context and supported by mentoring and social support.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3              Targeted Provision&#xa0;\n3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is an immediate conflict of purpose with ESF funding arrangements and the needs of NEET young people with exceptional complex needs.  The funding structure of ESF grant is typically: Start, On Course and Progression.  Agencies in receipt of funding are driven by the targets of the required number of ‘learners’ to start the course, sustain attendance and achieve whatever progression is stipulated.  This structure could not be a worse fit for young people with complex needs, especially young people with behavioural emotional and social difficulties. &#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvision should be targeted at specific wards and neighbourhoods that are NEET ‘hotspots’ and where there is a culture of inter-generational worklessness. \n&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBroader target groups include:&#xa0;This approach will require greater use of specialist providers with a track record. However, it will also be crucial to combine specialist expertise with holistic support. This cohort requires a higher level of investment in time and money, as problems are deep rooted. A significant proportion of NEET young people have some form of learning disability.&#xa0;3.4\n              \nFor 14-16 year olds, \nprovision should be targeted at y\noung people identified by the Risk Of NEET Indicator as requiring support to sustain engagement in statutory education and progression Post 16\n.  \nFor 16 – 18 (24) year olds, all interventions should be individualised and ‘spot purchasing’ should be used \nas a mechanism to achieve this.\n&#xa0;\n3.5              A ‘black box’ approach for 16-24 year olds would be helpful, but is currently difficult as the system is not transparent due to the range of conflicting EFA / SFA eligibility criteria, including age and particular benefit received. This prevents providers from simply identifying need and allocating funding to address it; it also represents a further barrier to widespread partnership working and collaboration.&#xa0;\n4              Unknown NEETS&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nData sharing issues do not assist with engaging with and providing effective services to unknown NEETS. Multiple contract holders work to both SFA and DWP have no inter-connectivity to pool data on where NEET unknowns are; there are also problems with DWP contract-holders sharing ‘DWP’ data with BCC.\n&#xa0;\n4.2              There is a need for greater resources and better systems to identify, track and analyse Not Known NEETs. Resource limitations are now limiting the capacity for collaboration around unknown NEETS – local voluntary organisations would benefit from joint working with the Connexions Service but neither side currently has resources to do this.&#xa0;\n4.3   \n              \nA significant proportion of unknown NEETS are young offenders, who have a statutory obligation to attend the Youth Offending Teams for their Court Order. Yet no funded proposal has yet included targeting an element of EU funding to engage them in education, training or employment before their Order ends and they become Not Known NEETs again. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Roll on – roll off’ provision throughout the year to engage young people would be more effective than them having to wait for specific enrolment points in the year.&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviders need to factor-in the volatility of young people with complex needs – breaks in attendance, volatility, resistant or challenging behaviour – in order to improve likelihood of longer-term impact.\n&#xa0;5              Improved Pathways&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviders need to be responsible for ensuring their focus is on what is best for the young person; the young person is not there to help them achieve their targets. Young people will not be aware of whether they fit the criteria for particular NEET provision. They will not know before starting whether this contracted provision is the best one for them because they won’t be clear on what contracted targets and milestones are, and could get caught out that they don’t know what counts as a ‘progression’. These matters are often not clear for referral staff either, and so they are wary of “trapping” a young person into a provision that is not best for them because of contract requirements.\n&#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a gap in ensuring that young people have access to the range of pathways and the qualifications and competencies required for growth sectors. A system-wide approach is required to:&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nThe local \nDWP Innovation Fund project (\nthe \nAdvance Programme) \nrepresents an effective\n \nmeans of\n creating pathways from school to training to employment\n,\n and \nof \nlinking to \nthe \nprivate sector.\n \nHowever, \nrestrictions set by DWP prevent \nit achieving its maximum impact; for example\n Level 2 \nqualifications are \nnot funded for 18-24 year olds.\n This is \nhighlighted\n as\n a\n \nparticular \nproblem by disability specialists\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4              Changes to FE funding strategy, funding and commissioning practice would help improve pathways. Current barriers include:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nFor some young people in Birmingham, Future Jobs Fund’s provision of 6-month minimum-wage\n&#xa0;\nfull time job\ns\n represented an effective model across varying skills, abilities and experience. Evaluation showed that key success factors were: regular visits by a dedicated officer who supported both employee and employer to address issues earlier on; wraparound support for the most vulnerable during the first months of employment; enhanced job search for those exit\ning\n the programme; community and voluntary sector job provision (especially \nfor young people lacking confidence or experience).\n&#xa0;\n6              Improved transitions&#xa0;\n6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy does very funding stream think 12 weeks is sufficient to resolve a young      person’s ETE status, when 10 years in school hasn’t provided them with literacy &amp; numeracy skills? &#xa0;\n6.2&#xa0; \n      \nFuture funding should reflect the fact that the developmental journey towards employment is crucial to the final outcome, and should recognise the value of \nbespoke\n support in building trust, confidence and employability in order to equip them for employment. There should be allowance built in to commission ‘alternative provision’ for young people with particular barriers.\n&#xa0;6.3\n&#xa0; \n      \nWe must improve understanding &amp; awareness of young people &amp; parents with regard to opportunities and pathways towards them; even where appropriate services exist, people do not always know how to access them.&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0; \n      There needs to be an i\nmprovement in data tracking from Post 16 provision into employment or self-employment, HE \nor benefits\n \n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0; \n      We need better work experience options linked to better quality careers advice in schools and more offers of work experience from employers. &#xa0;\n6.6\n&#xa0; \n      Funding for \nthe \nmanagement of work experience placements\n would improve situation \n–eg VCS preparing young people for placements, then working with soc\nial\n enterprise\n &amp; SME employers\n&#xa0;\n6.7              Some transitions may feel impossible to young people from families who are very insular; many young people will not travel off their estate. One local initiative is  facilitating a peer network of parents to provide support and inspiration to parents in guiding their children. &#xa0;6.8\n     \nImprove funding and support for enterprise\n as a \nviable \ntransition\n&#xa0;\n7              Role of Schools&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThose at high risk of becoming NEET are often the ones for whom the traditional school structure and approach didn’t work and where they disengaged from school. In spite of this, schools have limited resources to work with pupils on employability development\n&#xa0;\n7.2               EU funding should be available to supplement school funding, to ensure that if school breaks down for a young person the right type of alternative can be found up to the school leaving age, working with the young person around next steps and supporting their progression onto to Post 16 options.  This alternative provision, which could be EU funded, would offer a different holistic approach, developing an innovative curriculum to raise aspirations, breed success and re-engage young people successfully; it could include a combination of work experience / taster opportunities with employers to give a better understanding of the work place, alongside more social activity designed to develop confidence, life skills, team work and participation.&#xa0;\n7.3      \nCareers education, information advice and guidance in schools is patchy and variable in quality.\n&#xa0;\n7.4       Local authorities, LEPS and other bodies have a good understanding of the local labour market and skills needs, but this often doesn’t trickle down to schools and their young people&#xa0;\n8              Delivery of the EU Youth Guarantee - how would / should that operate in our city?&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nThere is already the September Guarantee offer of ETE for Post 16’s. The challenge is to provide an offer for those that do not see the academic route of Further Education as a way forward but instead want a job. \n&#xa0;\n8.2              Trial a Youth Guarantee in defined areas of the city: holistic approach so no young person falls through the net between school and employment; led by local community-led development projects. Fully integrated local partnerships are key, and should be part of growing the economy so there are jobs; will also help ensure continuity after funding programmes shift (eg EU).&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \n‘Traineeships’ could have been part of the solution and created the option to increase the capacity of \nyoung people\n being offered Training and Development in the workplace. If these had a potential route way into Employment we might have got buy\n-\nin from many of the currently marginalised NEET and Not Knowns. However with no real training allowance being offered and no expectations that the \nyoung people\n will be offered anything at the end apart from a reference and maybe an interview, this won’t attract the\nse\n \nyoung people.\n \nW\ne need to be creative in finding an offer they will engage with\n.\n&#xa0;\n9              Opportunities for Graduates&#xa0;9.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork with employers to increase the availability of Internship and work experience opportunities.&#xa0;\n9.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelop\n a Work Experience Portal to capture and promote local vacancies.\n&#xa0;\n9.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDestination Measures for Universities to be published and strategic discussions with Universities to improve employment destinations for graduates&#xa0;\n10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOpportunities for enterprise support&#xa0;10.1\n              \nFunding to pump-prime support for business and schools to develop sustainable \n    \npartnerships and develop an enterprise culture in schools and educational providers. This may include:\n&#xa0;\n10.2              Birmingham’s Youth Offending Service has trialled successful enterprise initiatives which engaged their cohort well, by challenging their thinking and raising their aspirations.  The pilot had an effect on young people becoming more entrepreneurial in their outlook and more motivated to achieve, even where they did not set up set up their own businesses.&#xa0;11.              Reducing JSA Youth Claimant Register&#xa0;\n11.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExpansion of the Young Talent for Business programme of wage subsidies for employers to recruit young people\n&#xa0;\n11.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntensive support and mentoring for young people wishing to start their own business&#xa0;\n12              Employer engagement&#xa0;\n12.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen providers win EU bids, they state they have links with major employers, but it is often not evident that these links come to fruition in apprenticeship and job opportunities. When bids are assessed, the employer links should be verified and what likelihood is of job opportunities being offered within the Contract Period. To ensure good quality progression of route ways into employment, could employers themselves bid for ESF funding to enable them to provide the wrap around support needed and employment preparation courses for the vulnerable NEET cohort? If this helps generate employers to offer employment to those from the vulnerable groups, then this would be money well spent because final progression outcome would be committed to in the bid and quality progression into sustainable ETE is assured. Short term funding and constant turnover of Providers winning the ESF Contract would be a stumbling block to good employer engagement.\n&#xa0;\n12.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to increasing apprenticeships and work experience opportunities, employer engagement would improve:&#xa0;\n12.3\n              \nEven where multiple specialist agencies are involved in delivery of EU provision, there needs to be some co-ordination of employer liaison, to avoid counter-productive duplication and complication.\n&#xa0;\n13              Delivery of the EU Youth Guarantee&#xa0;\n13.1              More use should be made of EU provision to enable young people to undertake transnational work experience and learning, in order to raise aspirations, develop skills and build confidence&#xa0;\n13.2\n              \nA training allowance (with conditions) should be re-introduced; this would be more acceptable to employers and parents than a bursary.
