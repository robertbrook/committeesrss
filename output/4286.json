"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the NFU&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently.a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\narmers need \nwater to grow our food. Farmers rely on rainfall, public supply and abstraction from rivers and aquifers. Agriculture accounts for only 1% of total water abstracted nationally. Abstracted water is particularly important to the high value fruit and vegetable sector. \nE.g.\n in the East of England, irrigated crops support a food and farming sector that provides 50,000 jobs and contributes £3 billion to the annual economy. \nF\narmers and growers are already taking steps to improve water efficiency through on-farm storage, actively engaging in water abstractor groups, improving irrigation efficiency and installing rainwater harvesting.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFertiliser is an essential input ensuring that the productivity of crops is optimised. Phosphate and potash are both in finite supply in the long-term and whilst nitrogen can be manufactured, the process requires natural gas which in turn exposes the industry to fluctuations in supply and price in addition to the environmental and energy security impacts. Agriculture has reduced consumption of manufactured fertiliser in the last 20-30 years and farmers are recycling nutrients from both the agriculture sector and wider industry. The British Survey of Fertiliser Practices shows the declining trend in fertiliser nutrient applications between 1990 and 2012 with nitrogen applications in England and Wales down by 30%, phosphate applications down by 57% and potash down by 55%. Farmers are also improving use of organic fertiliser sources such as manures, biosolids, composts and digestates as alternative sources of nutrients and organic matter. Further skills and technology which optimise fertiliser usage, will help the industry to continue to improve nutrient use efficiency and sustainable cycling of nutrients, while ensuring that productivity is maintained or improved.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe British farming industry is therefore acutely aware of the need to have a durable plan for \nenergy security, yet the sector also has the potential to be a net exporter of energy. This is based upon a wide range of renewables including wind, solar and \nbioenergy (transport biofuels, biogas from anaerobic digestion of manures and crops, and biomass from wood, straw and perennial energy crops). The NFU strongly endorses land-based renewable energy which supports profitable agriculture, for example farmers own\ning\n their own renewable energy assets or otherwise benefit\ning\n from harnessing renewable energy resources. There are numerous opportunities to closely integrate renewables with both food production and the provision of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.\nThe relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security.&#xa0;This can only deliver to its full potential if agricultural policy and regulation is working towards the same goals. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability, can contribute to increased resilience.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planning.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new markets&#xa0;\nhttp://www.nfuonline.com/careers/training-skills/future-of-farming-response/\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Ways of increasing self-sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitoring performance and ensuring efficiency gains - \nbenchmarking data shows that by bringing the bottom 25% of farms in the UK up to the technical efficiency performance of the average, dairy output would increase by 9%,. Similarly, increasing the average to the top 25% would mean an extra 34% output.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConfidence - \nthe NFU believes that if dairy farmers had the confidence to invest (we suggest that on average farmers should be investing 3.5ppl per year in infrastructure) then improvements to efficiency and increasing output can be achieved.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInternational competitiveness – essential to\n improve the margins on the farm and will encourage processors to invest in British milk fields.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuilding trust within the supply chain - identified as the most significant factor in the fresh produce sector, this could be addressed by retailers and processors supporting producers with clear and transparent pricing arrangements, longer term contracts, responsible promotional activities and support of British produce through in-store and online campaigns.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment departments facilitating growth of agriculture e.g. through planning decisions that recognise the need to produce more food; access to seasonal labour through managed agricultural workers schemes; decisions on plant protection product authorisations are based on practical, scientific evidence.\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeadership and communication - it is important that Defra, AHDB and research organisations invest in and communicate research on sound farm management and new farming techniques. Similarly improving cow and bull genetics via genomic evaluation and further advances in feed conversion rates should be considered research priorities.\n&#xa0;Conclusions&#xa0;&#xa0;\n10\nth\n December 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n The Future of Food And Farming, Government Office for Science, 2011\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-food-project-conclusions\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-government-report\n \n \nForesight Internation\nal Dimensions of Climate Change, 2011.\n \nInternational threats and opportunities of climate change to the UK\n.
