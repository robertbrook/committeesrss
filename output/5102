[normal] 
[normal]welcomes the opportunity to 
[normal]respond to the House of Commons Select Committee inquiry on the UK’s Development Work in the Middle East. SACH 
[normal]is an international, non-g
[normal]overnmental, non-political, 
[normal]non-profit
[normal] organization founded in 
[normal]1996 in
[normal] Holon, Israel 
[normal]at the Wolfson Medical 
[normal]Centre
[normal] (
[normal]WMC) with the mission of improving the quality of 
[normal]paediatric
[normal] cardiac care for children from low to lower-middle income countries suffering from rheumatic and congenital heart disease and creating 
[normal]centres
[normal] of com
[normal]petence in these countries. 
[normal]SACH is fully dedicated to the idea that every child deserves the best medical treatment available, regardless of the child's nationality, religion, race, gender or financial situation. 
[normal]Due to the fact that over 50% of the child
[normal]ren, who receive cardiac care from SACH, reside in the West Bank and Gaza, it is of significance for SACH
[normal] to respond to this inquiry.
