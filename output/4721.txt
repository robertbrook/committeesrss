[[[The importance of the Select Committee Process &amp; The Wright Reforms]]]“Any member of a select committee whose cumulative attendance during a Session is below 60% should be automatically discharged at the end of that Session” &#xa0;

[[[Attendance generally above 60%]]]

[[[Legitimate Absence]]]

[[[Recommended Penalty System as a form of incentive to attend]]]MPs enter Parliament to make a difference or to scrutinise the government; if they are prevented from doing this then they will look to eradicate any behaviour that leads to this; this will surely mean more MPs feeling incentivised to either attend all possible select committee meetings or contributing via post-meeting reports in their absence.&#xa0;
