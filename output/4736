defaultHouse of Lords European Union Sub-Committee B (internal Market, Infrastructure and Employment)default: defaultEU action to tackle youth unemploymentdefault&#xa0;
defaultIntroduction
default and Context
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the course of their inquiry 
defaultthe 
defaultSub-Committee received oral evidence on Monday 4
defaultth
default 
defaultNovember from three academic re
defaultsearchers and commentators
default: Professor Sue Maguire, Dr Paul Copeland
default and myself.
default  This note 
defaultsets out
default the more important points covered in 
defaultmy
default oral evidence
default.
default  A supplementary paper, prepared at the Sub-Committee’s request, offers some examples of current good practice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default Sub-Committee’s investigations 
defaultfollow
default 
defaultthe announcement of the European Youth Guarantee and the establishment of the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI).  The Youth Guarantee is a formal pledge that young people (up t
defaulto age 25) should receive a good-
defaultquality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period 
defaultof four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  The YEI is a
defaultn EU
default funding initiative established to support the Guarantee
default: initially, in February 2013, 
defaultsix billion euro was pledged for that purpose; this was extended in July with an additional two million euro commitment for countries with a youth unemployment rate above 25%.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Youth Guarantee is a recommendation, with member countries given the opportunity to 
defaulttailor
default their activities to national, regional and local circumstances.  
defaultIn responding
default to a request for information in advance of my appearance before the Sub-Committee, a DWP Information Officer e-mailed: 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have not made a formal response. As I'm sure you're aware, the Youth Guarantee is a non-binding EU recommendation so we are not obliged to implement it.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe implemented the Youth Contract in April 2012, almost a year before the Youth Guarantee recommendation was agreed. The Youth Contract broadly meets the underlying aims of the Youth Guarantee and we will be reporting how the Youth Contract fits with these aims in more detail as requested by the European Commission by the end of the year. Our position on the Youth Guarantee is that this would be inappropriate for the UK. Over 80 per cent of young people flow off Jobseekers' Allowance within 6 months in the UK, so a four month guarantee would incur high deadweight losses (we'd spend money offering the guarantee on lots of people who would have got a job anyway) and wouldn't be cost effective.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis 
defaultclearly
default suggests limited enthusiasm for the idea within UK Government.
default&#xa0;
defaultDefinitions and Recording
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is understandable that the Sub-Committee has put considerable efforts into gaining a better appreciation of the terminology in use (‘youth unemployment’, ‘worklessness’, ‘NEETS’
default)
default.  The comm
defaultents offered by Professor Macgui
defaultre and 
defaultDr Copeland to the first question 
defaultasked at the oral session 
defaultoffer
defaulted
default a most useful elaboration here.  Broadly we can comment on statistics taken from the quarterly 
defaultLabour Force Survey (which includes reports on the number of 16-24 year old unemployed) and a claimant count (based on young people receiving Job Seekers Allowance). 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy
default view is that you must define the problem before you can offer a critique and evaluation of current solutions
default.  Only then
default 
defaultcan you identify
default the most appropriate metrics. 
defaultThere is a muddled and confused agenda with a multitude of schemes, often sounding the same, but with different intentions and aimed at different target populations.   
defaultIt is important to distinguish between: initiatives that are designed to reduce youth unemployment (or worklessness); schemes that are designed to give young people the opportunity to develop work-related skills (
default‘welfare to work’ intended to 
defaultincrease 
defaultan individual’s
default short and long-term prospects for employability)
default; schemes that are designed to develop work-force skills that underpin international competitiveness (irrespective of the short-term impact on employ
defaultment).  The key distinction is ‘
defaultskills or employment?
default’
default   ‘Apprenticeship’ offers a good example
default of the ambiguity
default that can arise
default: is the current advocacy of apprenticeships intended to improve workforce skills or to reduce the number of workless young people?  If the former
default,
default the emphasis would be on the quality and the reputation of 
defaultapprenticeship programmes; if the latter
default,
default the emphasis would be on 
defaultthe 
defaultsheer numbers of participants.  
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch discussions are more than semantic.  To reiterate: it is impossible to determine the most useful metrics without first de
defaultciding your
default underlying intention. Here the Local Government Association (
defaultin 
defaulta publication in support of their most impressive
default ‘Hidden Talents’ 
defaultproject
default) commented that one of the problems arose because of the number of different Government
default 
defaultdepartment involved
default.  “Services are largely funded through 
defaultthree Government Departments
default. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) funds employment programmes
default – primarily the Work Programme….
default The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) funds further and higher education and post-18 skills training, while the Department for Education (DfE) funds education and training for the 16-19s. DfE funding for 16-19 Apprentices (and the forthcoming Traineeships) is administered through the BIS Skills Funding Agency”
default.  They 
defaultargued
default that 
defaultthis led to “no common concept of ‘success’ to measure” and that “the information provided does not let others derive a common measure” and concluded
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recommend that central government departments should adopt a common framework for providing information on their programmes and that Local Authorities should use a Young Person’s Scorecard to scrutinise the extent of central government funded provision and its performance for their young residents
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultDefining the 
defaultproblem
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default dominant problem should be 
defaultseen to 
defaultbe 
defaultthat
default of youth unemployment.  Ther
defaulte
default are simply far too many young people out of work.  Figures released in October 2013 show that youth unemployment is static at the 20% mark. There are now just under one million unemployed 16-24 year olds.  This figure (958,000) was down by a 
defaultmere 1000 on the previous quarter with male unemployment increasing marginally.  Moreover, such figures understate the extent of the problem
default.
default  For example in her oral evidence Professor Maguire 
defaultdrew attention to the high numbers of workless young women who did not feature in the labour statistics.
default There seems 
defaultto be 
defaultlittle 
defaultshort-term
default 
defaultprospect of sustained improvement. Indeed, the Work Foundation has argued that, since the start of the recession, the UK has experienced the fastest rise in youth unemployment of any of the Group of Eight (G8) countries
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven this perspective the 
defaultYouth unemployment level
default published on a quarterly 
defaultbasis that gives figures for the number of unemployed 16-24 year old
default should be regarded as the key target.  It does not re
defaultcord participation on schemes (
defaultfor example apprenticeships) but is unambiguous and focuses on what matters most to young peop
defaultle and their families.  It has the additional advantage that it allow
defaults
default international comparisons – NEETs by contrast is a definition that receives 
defaultparticular 
defaultattention in the UK
default alone
default.
default  If this 
defaultfocus on the 
defaultYouth unemployment level
default is a
defaultccepted 
defaultGovernment 
defaultreporting for the EU Youth Guarantee implementation plan should be presented accordingly.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe underlying causes
default&#xa0;
defaultThere 
defaultis inevitably a range
default of perspectives
default on the underlying causes of the crisis
default, and hence the solutions.
default  Some would argue that what is required is a more efficient job market and more effective job matchin
defaultg to clear the market.  Others argue t
defaulthat young people themselves are contributing to the problem by displaying a negative attitude and unwillingness to acquire the skills that employers value.  
defaultThese perspectives should be rejected.  Far more important 
defaultis
default the effect of
default major structural 
defaultchanges
default in the labour market.  
defaultThe shifting patterns caused by 
defaultglobal 
defaultcompetition
default mean
defaults
default that there are insufficient
default, low skill,
default entry-level jobs for young people.  
defaultThe following illustration may assist.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the 1930s in Norwich, the major employment centre in Norfolk
default, 
default25% of boys and 33% of girls leaving elementary schools found employment in boot and shoe factories.  Another 14% of girls found employment in the cracker and chocolate factories.  These jobs have disappeared.  Start
default-
defaultrite, the well-regarded manufacturer of children
default’
defaults shoes, was a major employer in the city.  Currently the firm manufactures in 
defaultthe Far East, 
defaultSpain and Portugal
default. I
defaultn a recent prominent feature in the local newspaper the managing director indicated that
default, although wages in the Far East were rising, production would only come back to Britain “if there are enough skilled workers to do it”
default.  In the 1980s the major service industry employer, Norwich Union, was 
defaultoften 
defaultcited in 
defaultarticles on the
default ‘demographic time-bomb’ (a term used to describe what was seen at the time as worrying population trends) as likely to employ all the available school-leavers in the city.  Now the local headlines are of 2000 young people without work and this has lead to 
defaultthe creation of 
defaulta propaganda campaign, Norwich for Jobs, which only serves to mask the underlying problem of 
defaultinsufficient
default 
defaultentry-level 
defaultjobs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis dea
defaultr
defaultth of jobs for young peo
defaultp
defaultle ranks
default as
default 
defaultone of the most compelling 
defaultsocial 
defaultproblem
defaults of our time.  People learn their skills at work
default and develop through working
default.  
defaultTraining
default schemes delivered by third party providers cannot offer an acceptable 
defaultsubstitute
default, 
defaulthowever well designed
default.  
defaultPublic pronouncements and surveys continually emphasise that school-leavers need leadership, team-working and communication skills.  This is no doubt true.  However the best way in which such skills are developed is
default through experience in the work
defaultplace with the guidance of a committed boss who is willing to spare the time to give immediate guidance and on-going feedback.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultToo many schemes and over-promotion
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is against this background that the 
defaulteffectiveness of the 
defaultcurrent cocktail of schemes and programmes must be consid
defaulte
defaultred.  
defaultGenerally s
defaultuch programmes can be described as ‘Active labour market policies (ALMPs)’.  These can address the supply side (training etc.), the demand side (e.g. incentives for employers to recruit particular workers) and job matching (e.g. careers guidance)
default. 
default  The templates designed by the 
defaultEU 
defaultCommission for Youth Guarantee implementation plans 
defaultare designed to
default allow the different emphasis 
defaultin member states to be identified.
default 
default However, 
defaultimplementation 
defaultof 
defaultschemes
default, 
defaulttakes place at the micro-level: the level of the firm. 
defaultThe
default decision on how, when and where to invest in skills development inside a company is a third-order decision. First-order decisions relate to the choice of product market and competitive strategy. Once these strategies have been established, they have an impact on second-order decisions, which concern the way in which work is organised and jobs are designed. There is nothing that 
defaultany government can do to make skills 
defaultdevelopment
default become a first-order decision. No amount of exhortation will persuade employers to do something they do not see as being in their interest.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor
default decades
default, 
defaultUK 
defaultskills 
defaultpolicies have been 
defaultformulated with
defaultout
default serious debate at a political level
default. 
defaultThere
default has been a voluntarist approach: an attempt to secure tripartite (government, employers and workforce representatives) support for policy initiatives. 
defaultUnfortunate unintended consequences 
defaulthave been the 
defaultcontinual
default search for ‘the solution’ and heavy
default 
defaultpromotion
default o
defaultf
default the latest scheme or programme. 
defaultThere have been seemingly endless launches and conferences – what can be described as continuous hortatory activity. 
defaultThere has been initiative fatigue.  
defaultConsiderable confusion arises from this proliferation of schemes, many of which have similar style or names.  
defaultMany conscientious training managers will try to avoid being involved or engaged since 
defaultno one
default else in the
defaultir
default organisation is interested and they know that their tenure will outlast today’s initiative.
default  On occasions 
defaultthe over-selling and over-promotion 
defaulttakes a comical turn
default.  
defaultA 2013
default edition of the BIS FE
default 
default&amp;
default 
defaultSkills newsletter used the term 
defaultcelebrate
default or 
defaultcelebrating ni
defaultne times 
defaulti
defaultn 
defaultclaiming success for 
defaulta 
defaultlatest
default array
default of schemes
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn her 
defaultrecent evidence to the 
defaultWork and Pensions Committee of the House of Commons (30th October) a CBI spokesperson stated that a mapping exercise they 
defaulthad conducted identified 48 schemes that could help an employer take on or train a young unemployed person.  The Local Government 
defaultAssociation
default 
defaultin the 
defaultfirst of 
defaultits
default 
defaultHidden Talents Report
defaults
default 
defaultidentified 35 different programmes involving 16-24 year olds 
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs 
defaultwas
default noted in the opening section of this document, the Government has identified the Youth Contract as the mechanism used to meet the 
defaultrequirements
default of the EU Youth Guarantee.  This particular scheme illustrates and 
defaultemphasises
default many of the inherent problems in this 
defaultinitiative-led 
defaultapproach. 
defaultThe Youth Contract was l
defaulta
defaultunched in April 2012 and described as a package of schemes aimed at helping young people into sustained employment, combining existing schemes with new ones
default.  
defaultIn July 2013 
defaultofficial
default figures revealed that it had the added wage incentive element had been paid out for 
defaultjust 
default4
default,
default690 young people out of a potential of 160
default,
default000.  At the same time it was announced that the Cabinet Office would conduct a cross-government review into schemes designed to help for 18-24 year olds.   There has been little debate on the reasons for this slow start, but the 
defaultYouth Contract
default was promoted at

default&#xa0;
defaultApprenticeships: definitions and numbers 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently much of the emphasis (the hortatory activity) is focused on apprenticeships the new ‘silver bullet’ of skills training.  The potential contribution from apprenticeships is considerable: a sustained expansion of well-struct
defaultured apprenticeship programmes w
defaultould make a thoroughly worthwhile contribution
default to the national scene
default. However, discussions are characterised by 
defaultboth 
defaultan underestimation of the extent of shift required to make apprenticeships effective and an overestimation of the extent of their potential contribution. They will only be effective as part of a well-considered and well-resourced wider framework for skills development in the UK. Given the present approach, we can anticipate another policy failure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe interest of young people in apprenticeships is beyond dispute, but apprenticeship schemes are shamelessly oversold. The National Apprenticeship Service has reported that, for the year 2012, there were 1,127,000 apprenticeship applications submitted online for 106,510 places. There is no official statement as to whether this is a good thing (indicating the popularity of the idea) or a bad thing (young people desperate to get opportunities).  However hortatory campaigning on apprenticeships produces a greater demand for places rather than an increase in supply.  Applications for a well-structured apprenticeship programme exceed the number of places by a ratio of ten to one.  More young people end up disappointed.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, although apprenticeships are a ‘good thing’, they are not necessarily what they appear to be. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn November 2012 the Entrepreneur Doug Richard presented his Richard Review on apprenticeships. Building on a recent Business and Innovation Select Committee report, he effectively destroyed the notion that apprenticeships are the easy solution to the problem of 
defaultworklessness
default.  His first recommendation was that apprenticeships should be redefined: “There has been a drift towards calling many things apprenticeships which, in fact, are not… not all instances of training on a job are apprenticeships. Apprenticeships require a new job role, a role that is new to the individual and requires them to learn a substantial amount before they can do that job effectively. An apprenticeship without a job is a form of vocational training. An apprenticeship in an old job is on-the-job training. There must be a job and the job role must be new”.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter extended deliberation the Government has finally published its response to the Richard Review.  This took the form of an implementation plan published on 28th October
default 2013
default.  The purpose of an
default apprenticeship was defined as “
defaultto train those aged 16 and above to achieve the Apprenticeship standard as set by employers to enable them to per
defaultform a skilled role effectively
default”
default.
default The main effect of the 
defaultimplementation
default plan will be to allow, indeed encourage, employers to describe almost any training scheme as an ‘apprenticeship’.  The precision demanded by the Richard Review has been rejected; the term apprentice has now irrevocably lost its traditional meaning.  It will longer describe an arrangement where a young person enters into a formal agreement and spends time working under experienced supervisors to acquired transferrable skills.  The popular conception of an apprenticeship is an intensive and extended vocational training that provides career opportunities for the less academically gifted.  Today’s apprenticeships are a framework for work-based learning, used as the basis for paying training providers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy formulating its new policy in these terms 
defaultall prospect of creating a vocational pathway of equal currency to the educational one 
defaulthas 
defaultbeen
default abandoned. An inevitable conclusion is that there will now be a huge emphasis on producing and promoting numbers of apprenticeship places 
defaulthowever loosely defined. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps the saddest reflection on the current training and skills debate is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Government’s October 2013 implementation plan has attracted so little public attention or political debate.  In 
defaultpractice
default 
defaultendorsing routine training
default could 
defaultprove to be
default one of the most profound changes in skills 
defaultpolicy
default for a decade.  It has neither appeared in the news nor been featured in the more serious newspapers.
default  
defaultIn this
default complex 
defaultand nuanced 
defaultarea, with continuing changing 
defaultdefinitions, 
defaultinter
defaulte
defaultst fatigue as well as initiative fatigue is evident.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAn alternative approach
default&#xa0;defaultThe dominant problem has been defined above as the need to reduce the 20%
default 
defaultunemployment rate for 16-24 years olds and it has been 
defaultargued 
defaultthat ‘employability skills’ are best (and in some cases only) learned in the workplace.  If this is accepted the stark truth is that the current cocktail of policies will not be effective.  More radical thinking is need and a new approach required.  
defaultHere I draw on more detailed analysis and arguments presented in my TJ (Training Journal) White Paper 
defaultTraining 
defaultand skills in crisis
default. 
defaultThe
default 
defaultapproach 
defaultproposed 
defaulthas
default four 
defaultkey 
defaultelements:
default a change in the Companies Act; a new 
defaultrole
default for the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES); 
defaulta key 
defaultplace
default in co-ordination and 
defaultdelivery 
defaultfor 
defaultlocal authorities; development of an agreed charter to protect young 
defaultjob seekers
default.  
defaultEach
default of these four is considered in turn below.
default&#xa0;
defaultA change in the Companies Act 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe argument presented more fully in the TJ White Paper is that larger employers should accept obligations for skills development. 
defaultIt is only within this framework that initiatives will receive appropriate and consistent support. 
defaultWhat is proposed therefore is that corporate law, and in particular the Companies Act, should be reviewed to introduce more specific obligations for workforce development, including obligations that reflect wider societal needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch a recommendation would necessarily involve the introduction of new reporting arrangements. There will, of course, be considerable objections but it is now time to review such radical options. Before siren voices are raised, it should be noted that such a revision has taken place in the UK in the last decade – but that it passed almost unnoticed
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs is well known, the Companies Act is the primary source of UK company law and, at its simplest, sets the framework for the objective of increasing member (shareholder) value. The Companies Act 2006 offered the first major legislative update since 1985. Far and away the greatest controversy concerned Section 172 (1), which widened the responsibilities of directors and required them to act in a way that “would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole
default”
default, and in doing so have regard (amongst other matters) to:
default&#xa0;
default(a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
default(b) the interests of the company's employees
default(c) the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
default(d) the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
default(e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
default(f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company.”
default&#xa0;
defaultMost of the debate when the new Act was introduced concentrated on corporate social responsibility – the green agenda (sub-clause d). There was little discussion on the 
defaulthuman resource 
defaultmanagement and development implications in sub-clause b.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile this was taking place, the 
defaulthuman resource
default profession was engaged in a parallel discussion with government on statutory requirements to report on what could be 
defaultcalled ‘people measures’. This was, like so many topics in the area, a complex and carefully nuanced subject and is discussed in detail in a recent book by Andrew Mayo, a professor at Middlesex University Business School
default.
default 
defaultHis stark concl
defaultusion is that such initiatives ‘
defaultseem to have petered out
default’
default. A taskforce was set up by the then Department of Trade and Industry in 2003; this reported to government (the Kingsmill Report). However, the recommendations were never incorporated into a formal Operating and Financial Review in legislation.
default   The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development has recently launched a joint project, with other professional bodies, 
defaultValuing
default 
defaultyour talent, 
defaultwhich 
defaultmay well
default 
defaultoffer some perspectives in this area
default&#xa0;
defaultA redefined role for UKCES
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Commission for Employment and Skills 
defaultwas created in 2008 as a
default publicly funded, industry led organisation providing strategic leadership on skills and employment issues in the UK. 
defaultIt is the central voice on skills policy in the country
default. The quality of its analysis is excellent; its reports are comprehensive, well written and concentrate on important, current issues
default;
default staff are capable and committed. Inevitably, the UKCES is stronger on diagnosis and analysis than it is on prescription. Unfortunately, 
defaultthe organisation 
defaultappears to have positioned itself as a firm
default 
defaultadvocate
default 
defaultof the latest scheme, whatever its merits; 
defaultobjectivity departs in a flurry of over-promotion and over-selling.
default&#xa0;
defaultApprenticeships 
defaultoffer a good
default example. There is an evident need to adopt a critical review of the progress of this initiative: to offer a serious review of the balance between numbers and quality; to monitor potential abuse from private sector providers who focus on numbers
default alone
default. The role of the UKCES needs to change so it can undertake such reviews.
default&#xa0;
defaultA good model of what is required is the role played by the Office of Budget Responsibility. This body was created in 2010 to provide independent and authoritative analysis of the UK’s public finances. It is one of a growing number of official independent fiscal watchdogs around the world. It produces forecasts, judges progress towards targets, assesses the long-term sustainability of public finances and scrutinises the costing of budget measures.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe case for independent scrutiny of skills training and welfare-to-work initiatives is powerful. The formulation and promotion of initiatives is a political activity 
defaultthat should be 
defaultundertaken by the government of the day
default, for which it alone should be accountable
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDevolution of responsibility to Local Government
default&#xa0;defaultThe work of the Local Government Association 
default(LGA) 
defaultexpressed through its 
defaultHidden Talents 
defaultresearch programme 
defaultwas
default commended earlier in this document.  
defaultIn February 2013
default the 
defaultLGA produced
default a report in 
defaultthis series in 
defaultwhich it argued that a local approach to tackling long-term youth unemployment could see the number of young 
defaultpeople out of work cut by 20 per cent in three years
default 
default.
default  The report
default argued that personalised local approaches are most effective in reducing the number of young people out of work and training, but that 
defaultnational funding, performance and procurement systems driven by Whitehall undermine such schemes
default. The analysis presented of current efforts to tackle youth unemployment identified an overly complicated system, with 33 different national schemes that span 13 different age boundaries at a cost of £15bn a year
default.
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe report argued that councils and their partners will be better able to spot and offer early help to young people struggling at school, train young people in skills to take local jobs in local labour markets, help improve the performance of the Work Programme for hardest-to-reach young people, and target job subsidies to local businesses offering the best opportunities for young people.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis report makes eminent sense. If there is one theme running throughout this paper it is that a proliferation of schemes causes confusion. Competing schemes, however well meant, do not assist and enhanced and empowered local government could play the central role in coordinating and promoting the response to youth unemployment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultA charter to protect young job-seekers
default&#xa0;
defaultThe existence of a large pool of young unemployed people means that the balance of power in the labour market has moved firmly towards the employer and away from the employee.  
defaultThere has
default,
default for example, been a focus on zero hour contracts where the employee is committed by contract but promised no regular hours of work.  A recent survey 
defaultundertaken by the CIPD 
defaultsuggested that more than a
default 
defaultmillion British workers could be employed on this bas
defaultis
default; such contracts are far more prevalent than had been thought
default.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have been well-substantiated evidence of welfare to work schemes. A prominent incident concern
defaulted
default the use of unpaid stewards at the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. A newspaper reported that 30 ‘customers’ of the 
defaultgovernment’s work programme 
defaultwere given training placements with Close Protection UK and promised paid work at the Olympics – but for their 
defaultwork 
defaultat the jubilee celebration
defaults
default they were paid nothing. Having arrived in the capital on Sunday morning, all of them were told to sleep under London
default Bridge
default 
default.
default  
defaultIn 
defaultSeptember
default 2013 the 
defaultFE (Further Education) 
defaultmagazine 
defaultuncovered an advertisement on the National apprenticeship Service (NAS) website which required trainees to work 
defaultfor a ‘
defaultmaximum of 39 hours a week
default’
default unpaid. 
default 
defaultThe advertisement
default, which had been
default placed by a
default well-known
default automotive parts and spares group, was immediately withdrawn. The following month 
defaultFE News
default identified
default ‘hundreds of employers’ advertising jobs on the NAS website at below the 
defaultlegally binding 
defaultminimum wage.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch incidents represent only a small proportion of the whole.  However t
defaulthere is 
defaulta 
defaultstrong case for some sort of protection and the 
defaultdevelopment
default of a charter is proposed.  One of the Sub-Committee’s questions, which was not addressed at the oral session
default,
default was: 
default“Do you think that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are consulted to a satisfactory degree…
default” 
defaultWhatever the views on the broader question, the development of a charter is an area where young people could helpfully and usefully be engaged.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultConcluding comments
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Government’s lack of enthusiasm for the idea of the European Youth Guarantee has been noted.  To what extent this reflects underlying Euro-scepticism and to what extent this reflects unease 
defaultover 
defaultthe approach adopted is unclear.  Putting forward 
defaultonly 
defaultthe Youth 
defaultContract
default, one of the least successful of the recent plethora of initiatives, as the mechanism for satisfying the EU recommendation is 
defaultdifficult
default to understand.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll t
defaulthis is unfortunate.  The European Youth Guarantee should be seen as an opportunity not an imposition.  There is almost universal agreement on the chronic nature of the problem of youth unemployment; it is hard to see how the current policy framework, with its uncertain positioning and over-promotion of apprenticeships, will deliver a sustained improvement.  The request that all member states should present detailed plans on the design and implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes could offer a valuable opportunity for developing and sharing good practice and for honest reporting in this most difficult area.
