[[[Written evidence from London Councils (PHE001]]]

[[[6]]]

[[[)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I note that your Committee is shortly to scrutinise Public Health England and wanted to take this opportunity to make some brief comments on London Councils’  experience of working with them in London.&#xa0;It is still early days for the new health structures, including Public Health England, and it is clear that they are still in the process of settling all their ways of&#xa0; working and clarifying their role and programmes.&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;London Councils has, however, welcomed the active engagement of Public Health England (London Region) in establishing with local authorities and other health partners some pan-London governance structures across health and care.&#xa0; They are key partners on the London Health Board and in the London Health Chief Officers’ Group, and have provided invaluable expertise and support to early joint work between boroughs, for example on HIV prevention and sexual health commissioning.&#xa0; Strong personal relationships have been established and provide a sound foundation to build upon.&#xa0;Public Health England has already demonstrated its commitment to engage positively with and support Directors of Public Health and their teams in local authorities.&#xa0; This support has also helpfully been made available to chief executives and other senior directors as they have worked through local transition issues.&#xa0;Beyond the issue of transition, London local government has welcomed the clear enthusiasm of PHE for seeking to realise the potential of public health integration with councils in order to secure stronger outcomes for local communities. London’s local authorities are determined to use public health integration as a way of making better places to live and work and PHE’s understanding of, and commitment to this agenda has been welcome.&#xa0;Some of the current challenges that local authorities in London will be looking for Public Health England to play a role in resolving include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Alongside this, we will welcome them continuing to be an active voice in prompting consideration of public health issues and how they can be addressed through both the health agenda and more widely, to help increase independence and opportunity for all members of our communities. &#xa0;I hope these comments will be helpful to your deliberations.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
