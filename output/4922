[normal]INTRODUCTION[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LEGAL STATUS OF THE CHARTER[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]THE POLAND-UK PROTOCOL[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“It will be clear the UK Protocol does not in any way constitute an ‘opt-out’ in the sense of trying to disapply certain rights to UK citizens.  That would be neither necessary nor desirable given that the UK fully accepts the rights reaffirmed in the Charter.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Although the Protocol is in terms that are specific to the United Kingdom and Poland, it does no more than set out some of the implications of the way in which EU law gives effect to the Charter.  So every proposition in the Charter, although it only refers to the United Kingdom and Poland, is equally true for every other Member State.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As such, the Protocol may be not only of comfort but of practical use to any party seeking to avoid an expansive interpretation of the Charter. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]COMPETENCE CREEP?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]        
[normal]Application to national rules[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“the rubric, ‘implementing Union law’, is to be interpreted broadly and, in effect, means whenever a member state is acting ‘within the material scope of EU law’”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is well es
[normal]tablished that a State acts
[normal] within the scope of EU law, in particular, when availing itself of one of the permitted derogations
[normal] from 
[normal]freedoms
[normal] such as the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services.  There have been pre-Charter cases in which the general principle of fundamental rights 
[normal]was 
[normal]given a remark
[normal]ably wide application under that
[normal] doctrine.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter must .. be complied with where national legislation falls within the scope of European Union law”,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]noting at para 23 that the provisions of the Charter “
[normal]are not to extend in any way the competences of the European Union as defined in the Treaties
[normal]” and that the Charter “
[normal]does not extend the field of application of European Union law beyond the powers of the European Union or establish any new power or task for the European Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties
[normal]”. 
[normal] The United Kingdom did not intervene in the case, as it could have done had it wished to join 
[normal]the Commission and 
[normal]five other Member States
[normal] in contesting th
[normal]e
[normal] application of the Charter
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Title IV rights[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“In particular and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.”

[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]The duty of national courts to set aside even national primary legislation that contravenes EU Treaty law or the general principles of law has been clear for longer still: see, e.g., Case 106/77 
[normal]Simmenthal 
[normal][1978] ECR 629, which inspired the 
[normal]Factortame 
[normal](Spanish Fishermen) litigation in the late 1980s.

[normal], Opinion of 30 September 2010, para 172.  Sharpston AG’s suggestion, that the application of EU fundamental rights should be dependent solely on the existence of exclusive or shared EU competence, whether or not exercised, was not taken up by the Court.
