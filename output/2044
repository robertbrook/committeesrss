default1.
default              
defaultThe Ramblers is a charity which seeks (among other things) to promote walking, both as a recreation and as the most sustainable form of transport. We also seek to promote the health, recreation and environmental benefits of walking, especially by protecting and extending the network of public paths and access in town and countryside, through lobbying, campaigning and voluntary practical work, and, since April 2012, through our partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, in which we run the Walking for Health project, delivering strategic guidance for the England-wide health walks programme and providing schemes 
defaultwith
default such support and free resources as training, insurance, and national promotion. (The local schemes are run by a variety of organisations including councils, the NHS, charities and voluntary groups.) 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultIn addition to supporting Walking for Health walks, we organise 45,000 led walks per year. 12,000 volunteers lead the walks; about 300,000 people take part in them. We have been organising these led walks since our formation in 1935.

defaultWe are submitting this statement to the Joint Committee to emphasise our support for the work and recommendations of the Natural England Stakeholder Working Group, and our desire to see the rights of way clauses included in the present Bill.

default              
defaultWe are in no doubt that Parliamentary time should be afforded to reforming rights of way legislation because the present system is not operating with the speed and efficiency 
defaultneeded to ensure that all rights of way are properly recorded on definitive maps
default by the “cut-off date” introduced by the Countryside and Right of Way Act 2000
default.  It is in the public interest that rights of way should be effectively managed, by which we mean administered, recorded, maintained and kept free from obstruction,
default 
defaultnot least
default because of the well documented health and economic benefits which accrue from their existence. By ‘health benefits’, we refer to, for example, the fact that brisk walking improves circulation and the performance of the heart and lungs.  Walking can lower blood-pressure; it can reduce risk of stroke, and of heart disease, the UK’s biggest killer. It can improve control of blood sugar in type-two diabetes; it has an important role in cardiac rehabilitation.  And walking promotes mental health and well-being, and improves self-perception and self-esteem and mood; it has the potential to be as effective as anti depressants or psychotherapy in treating depression.   Widespread take-up could massively lighten the economic burden caused by physical inactivity (in 2009 each Primary Care Trust spent an average of £5m on dealing with its consequences).  By  ‘economic benefits’, we mean, for example, the 6.14 billion pounds which walkers spend annually in the English countryside, the income in excess of 2 billion pounds which they generate, and the 245,000 full-time jobs which they support.  Walking tourism in rural and coastal Wales is estimated to contribute over £550million to the economy.

default              
defaultThe clauses in the present Bill derive directly from the work of the ‘Natural England Stakeholder Working Group on Unrecorded Public Rights of Way’.  
defaultThe genesis of the Group, its work and its recommendations are set out in detail in the document ‘Stepping Forward’, which can be viewed on the Natural England website
default. 
default  
defaultThe recommendations, first made to Government in 2010, represent a consensus reached by representatives of all sectors with an interest in rights of way (landowners and land managers, users (including the Ramblers) and local authorities.  It is a package of measures which must be taken as a whole: to take particular recommendations in isolation, or to introduce additional measures on which there is no agreement, will be to risk the 
defaultbreak up
default of the consensus.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultThe recommendations of the Group are wide-ranging and complex and will need to be introduced by means of primary and secondary legislation and guidance.  Because of the need to amend existing primary legislation there is no option but to opt for new primary legislation, and the SWG will continue to work with 
defaultDefra
default and Natural England on these reforms both during the passage of the present Bill through Parliament, and beyond.  The legislation is complex and work continues on the drafting of individual clauses and the Schedule to ensure that it properly represents the views of the SWG.

defaultThe Ramblers commends the inclusion of the rights of way clauses in the draft Deregulation Bill: it is essential that reforms are introduced as soon as possible because of the cut-off date.  In the mean time, the Ramblers will continue to work with the SWG and 
defaultDefra
default on the wider SWG recommendations to ensure improvements in the administration and management of public rights of way.
