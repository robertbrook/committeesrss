defaultThe Independent of

default reported that David Parker
default of the Met Office’s 
defaultHadley Centre 
defaultforecast that “
defaultBritish children could have only virtual experience of snow. Via the internet, they might wonder at polar scenes - or eventually "feel" virtual cold.

defaultthat

defaultIn 
default2007, a

defaultusing their new modeling system

default“these are very strong statements about what will happen over the next 10 years.”

defaultPhysics Nobel Prize Winner Richard Feynman’s inaugural lecture at Caltech in 1974 “Cargo cult science”
default provides a useful concept.  If we were dealing with real science which hypothesizes then tests the hypothesis against reality, the abysmal record of the models in projecting/predicting/forecasting 
default(
defaultor whatever word 
defaultone cares 
defaultto choose
default)
default would have led to chucking them out
default 
defaultand going back to the hypothesis drawing board. 
default The 
defaultMet Office would be eating humble pie for the aforementioned misforecast (and perhaps also for recent seasonal 
defaultmis
defaultforecasts
default).  But no, it is telling us the temperature pause is a temporary phenomena and normal warming will be continued soon in line with its 
default(CO2 
defaultd
defaultriven
default)
default models. We
default are dealing with politicized and too often fanciful climate science whose models have in many
default 
defaultmind
defaults
default become a pseudo reality – climate models are real cargo cult science.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT commented
default in a seminar he gave in the House of Commons last year
default “Climate science is immature.  It cannot forecast the past, let alone the future”.  And he commented of the Fifth Assessment Report
default:-
default&#xa0;
default“I think that 
defaultthe latest IPCC report
default has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.
default&#xa0;
default They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…”

defaultThis study…is clearly a subversion of the scientific method. To state that that climate science is being stretched is quite an understatement. There is absolutely no multi-decadal prediction skill on the spatial scales presented in this study.
defaultThe scientists who present the viewpoint of skillful multi-decadal regional predictions to policymakers are deliberately and dishonestly misinforming the public and policymakers.default

defaultting on, 16/11, wattsupwiththat and Wikipedia cargo cult science.  Feynman commented:-
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIn the 
defaultSouth Seas
default there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultFeynman cautioned that to avoid becoming cargo cult scientists, researchers must avoid fooling themselves, be willing to question and doubt
default&#xa0;
defaulttheir own theories and their own results, and investigate possible flaws in a theory or an experiment. He recommended that researchers adopt an unusually high level of honesty
default&#xa0;
defaultwhich is rarely encountered in everyday life
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultAt a more modest scale, but apparently using similar models, the Met Office mis-forecast a “barbecue summer” for the washout in 2009; “milder-than-average winter” for 2010/11 through which we shivered; and a “drier-than-average” spring and early summer just before one of the wettest summers on record.
