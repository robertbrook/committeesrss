[normal]The CCC took no notice of the inaccuracy of the climate models
[normal] in AR5
[normal], which I set out in 2.2. of my main submission.  
[normal]The Independent of 
[normal]20/3/00
[normal] reported that David Parker
[normal] of the Met Office’s 
[normal]Hadley Centre 
[normal]forecast that “
[normal]British children could have only virtual experience of snow. Via the internet, they might wonder at polar scenes - or eventually "feel" virtual cold.
[normal]  This forecast was linked with that of 
[normal]Dr David Vine
[normal]r of 
[normal]the Climatic R
[normal]esearch 
[normal]U
[normal]nit of the 
[normal]University
[normal] of 
[normal]East Anglia
[normal], 
[normal]that 
[normal]within a few years winter snowfall will become "
[normal]a very rare and exciting event" - 
[normal]"Children just ar
[normal]en't going to know what snow is.
[normal]"
[normal]  
[normal]In 
[normal]2007, a
[normal] team of climate scientists from the Met Office wrote a paper “
[normal]Improved Surface Temperature Prediction for the Coming Decade from a Global Climate Model
[normal]” 
[normal]using their new modeling system 
[normal]which forecast
[normal]:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Vicky Pope
[normal] of the Met Office
[normal] gave a talk on these predictions, 
[normal]stating t
[normal]hat
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“these are very strong statements about what will happen over the next 10 years.”
[normal]  
[normal]These predictions are wrong - there has been no warming at all since 2004; 
[normal]none 
[normal]of the years since 2009
[normal] h
[normal]ave broken the record of 1998 according to HADCRUT3 data
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Physics Nobel Prize Winner Richard Feynman’s inaugural lecture at Caltech in 1974 “Cargo cult science”
[normal] provides a useful concept.  If we were dealing with real science which hypothesizes then tests the hypothesis against reality, the abysmal record of the models in projecting/predicting/forecasting 
[normal](
[normal]or whatever word 
[normal]one cares 
[normal]to choose
[normal])
[normal] would have led to chucking them out
[normal] 
[normal]and going back to the hypothesis drawing board. 
[normal] The 
[normal]Met Office would be eating humble pie for the aforementioned misforecast (and perhaps also for recent seasonal 
[normal]mis
[normal]forecasts
[normal]).  But no, it is telling us the temperature pause is a temporary phenomena and normal warming will be continued soon in line with its 
[normal](CO2 
[normal]d
[normal]riven
[normal])
[normal] models. We
[normal] are dealing with politicized and too often fanciful climate science whose models have in many
[normal] 
[normal]mind
[normal]s
[normal] become a pseudo reality – climate models are real cargo cult science.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT commented
[normal] in a seminar he gave in the House of Commons last year
[normal] “Climate science is immature.  It cannot forecast the past, let alone the future”.  And he commented of the Fifth Assessment Report
[normal]:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I think that 
[normal]the latest IPCC report
[normal] has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…”
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] (and Met Office’s and IPCC’s)

[normal] The Met Office produced UK Climate Projections 2009 which purports to project “how the 
[normal]UK
[normal] climate may change for the 30 year period from 2010-2099 at a resolution of 25km.”

[normal], 
[normal]commented:-
[normal]This study…is clearly a subversion of the scientific method. To state that that climate science is being stretched is quite an understatement. There is absolutely no multi-decadal prediction skill on the spatial scales presented in this study.
[normal]The scientists who present the viewpoint of skillful multi-decadal regional predictions to policymakers are deliberately and dishonestly misinforming the public and policymakers.[bold]

[normal] 
[normal]See blog, A view of science worth reflec
[normal]ting on, 16/11, wattsupwiththat and Wikipedia cargo cult science.  Feynman commented:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]In the 
[normal]South Seas
[normal] there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Feynman cautioned that to avoid becoming cargo cult scientists, researchers must avoid fooling themselves, be willing to question and doubt
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]their own theories and their own results, and investigate possible flaws in a theory or an experiment. He recommended that researchers adopt an unusually high level of honesty
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]which is rarely encountered in everyday life
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]At a more modest scale, but apparently using similar models, the Met Office mis-forecast a “barbecue summer” for the washout in 2009; “milder-than-average winter” for 2010/11 through which we shivered; and a “drier-than-average” spring and early summer just before one of the wettest summers on record.
