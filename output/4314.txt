[[[Barbara Slater]]], Director of Sport, BBC, 

[[[Simon Green]]], Head, BT Sport, 

[[[Dan Brooke]]], Chief Marketing and Communications Manager, Channel 4, and 

[[[Andy Cairns]]], Executive Editor, Sky Sports News, BskyB, gave evidence.&#xa0;

[[[Q1 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Good morning. This is the second session of the Committee’s inquiry into women and sport. Our first panel represents the broadcasters and I would like to welcome Barbara Slater, Director of Sport for the BBC; Simon Green, Head of BT Sport; Dan Brooke from Channel 4; and Andy Cairns, the Executive Editor for Sky Sports News.              Could you begin by telling us approximately how many hours of women’s sport you cover and how does that compare with the total sports coverage on each of your channels? Who would like to start?

[[[Simon Green]]]: I will start. We have only been going for a fairly short period of time, about four months so far. However, we anticipate showing a total of about 9,000 hours of live sport for the year, of which we think about 1,000 hours will be women’s sport.

[[[Chair:]]] The total was how much? I missed that.

[[[Simon Green]]]: About 9,000 hours of live sport.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: We have added up all our long-form hours and that is approaching a total of 1,000 hours of women’s sports coverage a year. It might be worth a further breakdown between network hours and Red Button hours. The significant year-on-year variation: if we take a pattern over four years, network hours can range from 320 to 600, depending on whether we have a major event like a Commonwealth Games or an Olympics, but, including our Red Button hours, it is about 1,000.In terms of that as a percentage, we are aware of the WSFF’s 5% figure of media coverage of women’s sport. We did a detailed analysis taking the end of the Beijing Games to the beginning of the London 2012 Games so we could have a good cross-section over a number of years, and we are at about 20% women’s sport coverage over those four years.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: The picture from Sky Sports is pretty similar. The trend is very much upwards. In 2008 our figures were 716 hours. This includes mixed-gender sports where women and men would be competing together, such as show jumping for example. For the current year it is 1,821 hours of coverage, including mixed-gender sports. That also includes some repeats. It is difficult to measure, because a lot of the sports we will show on demand or as repeats if they are from overseas or at the wrong time of the day or night. But the trend is very much upwards. The sports vary and we are looking to increase our coverage over the next few years as well.We also cover women’s sporting issues with our Sportswomen programme on Sky Sports News. I am a sports journalist on Sky Sports News so that is of interest to me. The Sportswomen programme will look at various issues and we look at women’s sports stories as well throughout the year, not just on the Sportswomen programme.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: Last year we covered 600 hours of sports. That is entirely across parasport, which is where the majority of our focus is. Obviously last year the key part of that was the Paralympics, but also horse racing. Within parasport, approximately half our coverage of the sporting events was of women’s events. In parasport there is a very even gender balance between sports participated in by men and by women.&#xa0;

[[[Q2 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Steve Rotheram:]]] I wonder if any of your individual organisations have done any analysis on the audience profile: the demographic—who watches women’s sport and, in particular, how many men watch it—and what sorts of age groups would you break the audience down into?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: If we look at sport audiences generally, what we are seeing in terms of the BBC’s coverage is a gender split of roughly 54% male viewers and 46% women. That is for all sport.              If we look at women’s sports specifically, we see quite a variation sport on sport. For example, we covered the Women’s European Football Championships extensively this summer and the gender split there was probably one of our most extreme. We had a 70% male audience and a 30% female audience. We do see that kind of split for some sports. Rugby league and golf would be similar: we would see a predominantly male audience.              There are some sports where we would see a higher female audience. For example, something like our Sports Personality of the Year, something like the London Marathon, we would see a skew towards a female audience. Where we tend to see audiences very evenly split are events like Wimbledon, so major events. For our coverage of the Olympics or Wimbledon we would see an audience very evenly split between men and women.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: From the Sky Sports perspective, the splits are quite similar to the BBC’s. Probably more men watch women’s sports, funnily enough. In golf, for the Evian Masters and Solheim Cup the split was 70% men and 30% women, which reflects the audiences that we get for male sport as well. Women audiences are higher for the younger sports such as netball. More women than men watch netball.

[[[Simon Green]]]: For BT, again we do not have a huge amount of data. We are able to split out our audiences so far by gender. We are about 77% male compared with 23% female. For our women’s sport it is similar to the BBC and Sky. The information that we have for our WTA tennis, for example, is that we are 75% men and 25% women. So the split is pretty even across our women’s and men’s sports.You also asked about the age demographic. The audience is mostly 18 to 35-year-olds.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: For us it is a mixed picture, depending on the sport. Interestingly, for the Paralympics the audience was 55% women and 45% men across the event, and that did not vary significantly depending on whether it was a women’s or a men’s event that was being broadcast. With horse racing it is a slightly different picture. It is more male focused with about a 60/40 split in favour of a male audience.&#xa0;

[[[Q3 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Steve Rotheram:]]] It seems to be that the sport audience is very similar, no matter if they are watching men’s football or women’s football or men’s or women’s sport. Does that mean that there is further work to be done? Obviously proportionally there are fewer women watching. How do you capture that audience?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: That is not the case with parasport. Parasport is predominantly watched by women.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: The same with the Olympics or the Commonwealth Games and Wimbledon. For events, particularly the Olympics sports, so athletics, we would see a 50/50 split between male and female audiences. In some ways it very much depends on the sport.&#xa0;

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] My question is for Andy Cairns. You will recall the two football pundits that made the derogatory comments about the assistant linesman. Has that had any impact or effect on viewing figures or people’s attitude to women’s sport? The reason I ask you is that very recently a sports columnist in one of the major newspapers in Scotland made a comment about women’s football and it went down really badly. He almost lost his job, given the reaction from women in particular, and he had to make a grovelling apology. So did the comments the two pundits made have an impact on your coverage of sport or viewing figures?

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I do not know that it had a direct impact on viewing figures but that incident was dealt with. It totally goes against the culture at Sky Sports. It is not something that I recognise. That was absolutely an exception. Women are treated equally at Sky Sports. In Sky Sports News, women make up 30% of the workforce. They hold senior positions. That was an exception to the culture that we have there. On screen you will see that we use women reporters, presenters and pundits now, even internationals—Sue Smith, Rachel Yankey—to comment on the men’s game as well on occasion. Attitudes continue to change, evolve and progress.&#xa0;

[[[Q4 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] To follow on from Steve’s question, there seems to be a bit of a mixed bag in terms of the sports that women are watching, but is there a trend with your younger viewers to there being a higher proportion of women than among older viewers? For instance, my mum would never watch any sport on TV in a million years and I am guessing that older generations of women are less likely to watch sport than younger generations of women. Are we heading in the right direction in terms of your younger audiences? Do you have a breakdown in those sorts of figures?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: We are not necessarily seeing a pattern. If we have looked at age, it very much depends on the individual sport rather than a gender breakdown. It tends to be both young women and young men who might be coming to different sports. It very much depends on the individual sport and those figures can vary accordingly.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: Netball attracts a younger audience for us than, say, golf and tennis would. It is 46% women watching tennis, and again the audience profile is younger. We also aim programmes at young kids. We have a programme on Saturday morning called Game Changers, which is aimed at kids eight to 13, to try to get them interested in a whole variety of sports, sports they may not have thought of trying.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q5 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] I was not really talking about the age profile of certain sports and the viewing public. For instance golf might be viewed generally by an older audience, but, in terms of the younger people who are watching golf, is there a higher proportion of women than in an older generation of golf watchers? Have you done any analysis of that sort?

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I do not have those. Perhaps we can dig into that and get a report back to you.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: With parasport I would say gender differences are not significantly different across the different age bands. Having said that, as a broadcaster, part of our wide-ranging remit is to appeal to younger people. Across the breadth of what Channel 4 does, we are very popular with young people and that is very much reflected in the audiences we get in particular for parasport.&#xa0;

[[[Q6 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] Moving on, do you think the media should have a responsibility to encourage greater participation for women in sport and, if so, what?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I think the answer to that is yes. We certainly see that showcasing the best sports action, creating role models, heroes and heroines, is absolutely critical. We did some audience research during the Olympics and we know that 25% of those who responded said they were encouraged to take part in sport to a greater extent following the Games than before.Making sport aspirational—the coverage itself, of course, especially those really big moments—I know that we and others too have some specific initiatives aimed at encouraging participation. We launched the Get Inspired campaign in August of this year and that is a partnership model. We recognise that there are many, many brilliant activities out there organised by governing bodies and other organisations. Our aim is to create a destination, a web interface that can create links to those existing activities. So we are running the Get Inspired campaign through all our output—all our programmes end with that; we have some partnerships with CBBC and the Blue Peter badge is part of that—doing what we can do, which is to use our audience reach and impact to provide links to encourage people to find out more and find out where they can participate in sport.So both in what we do, in terms of showcasing and making sport aspirational as well as specific initiatives such as Get Inspired, we absolutely are committed to encouraging people to participate in sport.&#xa0;

[[[Q7 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] I am aware of the BBC and Sky encouraging sport at grass roots—apologies to Channel 4 and BT Sport if you are doing it as well, but I am not aware of it and perhaps you will want to comment on that—but how successful have those schemes been that you have been running?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: The Get Inspired scheme was launched only in August 2013. We know we have already had about 2.5 million people come and access information from that site. What we do not yet know is how many of those have gone into the gym and hopefully that is something that we will be tracking. I do think that trying to provide that link and using the BBC’s reach to allow people access to the information—we have an activity finder; partnerships with governing bodies—is what we think is a simple but effective way of encouraging participation.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: For the Olympic year Sky Sports ran a piece every Saturday morning called Get Involved, which was about introduction to a different sport. This has been around for 18 months. We looked at 65 different sports, whether you were new to them or you wanted to get back to them—perhaps you would like to get back into netball, for example—and we worked with the governing bodies on those so that they knew that these pieces, these stories, were going out on Sky Sports. Then they would tell their clubs and associations to be prepared for inquiries. We know that some weeks there would be a 50% increase in inquiries about getting involved with those sports.Is it a responsibility for us? It is certainly something that we think is the right thing to do. We believe in sport; we are passionate about it. We want people to enjoy sport and what we do on screen reflects that. What we do off screen as well is really important there. Sky Sports’ Living for Sport is a scheme that involves thousands of secondary schools across the country. We put a mentor into the schools and they work with the kids. The Sky Sports brand is very powerful. It does have an impact. Jessica Ennis-Hill is one of the ambassadors for Living for Sport. She has a huge impact. When we have run a promo featuring Jessica for Living for Sport we know the interest in getting involved is huge.Sky Ride is a big cycling initiative that has been going for several years now. That has had a huge impact. We work with the council, close up a city centre on a Sunday and you can cycle safely, freely, as a family and by bicycle see a city or a town that you may not have seen properly before. We know that has had a huge impact. Since 2009, 345,000 women have taken to cycling because of this. It is a powerful story.&#xa0;

[[[Q8 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] Given obviously that BT Sport is a fairly new channel but potentially a very large player, is this something that BT will be looking to do as well?

[[[Simon Green]]]: We are trying to weave as many women into the sport coverage that we are doing at the moment. We have initiatives such as the BT Action Women in Sport award that we have recently launched. For example, our Saturday morning sports panel show presented by Tim Lovejoy, will always have a woman on the panel. The show has been going since the week we launched so it has done 16 weeks. It has always had a woman on the panel and there are activities that they bring in to our studio. We have a studio area where we can demonstrate sports in a fun and interactive way and it has generated interest in those sports because of the way that they have been demonstrated.              We have launched the Clare Balding Show. Clare is quite adamant that she wants to push the interests of women in sport and we have given her the opportunity to have her own show on the channel. She has done 11 shows to date. There has been a woman in every guest line-up that she has had, and they have been able to bring their stories to her show. So there are things that BT is starting to evolve into that means that women will be involved in the fabric of what we do.              Many of our presenters across our other sports are women as well. Our main continuity announcer, the promo voice for BT Sport, is a woman. We are always looking to introduce women to the coverage of sport on BT in a way that means that we can then develop those initiatives, such as the BT Action Woman in Sport initiative.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I would like to add a mention about the Inspire programme. This is not only an initiative we are supporting across the web and much of our programming but we have a dedicated programme. It is a magazine format and it is very much intended to throw a spotlight on some people’s really inspirational stories: about why they have participated in sport; how they benefit from that and what it means to them. We think shining a spotlight on that feature content is an incredibly important way of inspiring people to find out more. So we have introduced the Inspire programme, presented by Gabby Logan, which is very much focused in that space.&#xa0;

[[[Q9 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] Given that even in men’s sports a lot of sports find it difficult to compete with the football Premier League for sponsorship and media coverage, how much of a challenge is it to get people interested in watching women’s sport? Do we need to give it an extra helping hand in terms of media coverage and sponsorship? For instance BBC3 is showing their women’s football, but do we need to put the odd game on BBC1 to showcase it and to grab that audience that just happens to be on BBC1 rather than flicking through for women’s football?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: We have shown women’s football across, I think, all our channels. We have had some qualifying matches and we now cover the women’s FA Cup Final live—it was one of our showcase events over the weekend—as well as the commitment to the European Football Championships last summer. I think we should exploit our different channels depending on the profile and the audience interest. We do think there is a great value with BBC3. We think it is a fantastic channel—an opportunity for women’s football—very much playing to a younger audience: you could say the audience of the future in terms of the demographic of BBC3. We are really pleased that they are going to take the highlights of the Women’s Super League at an earlier, 7 pm slot, which I think is fantastic.              It goes beyond long-form coverage. One of the other things that is really important is telling the stories and features that build the characters in sport and encourage audiences to follow. One of the areas where we at the BBC have seen the biggest step change since the London 2012 Games is in the reporting of women’s sports’ stories across all our platforms. That is very important in building the back stories, to create the interest and the focus.              To give you an example from times when we do not even have the rights, we had the England women’s netball team come and visit the Salford site. Within a two-hour window we were able to have that team appear across a whole raft of different outputs. That might include BBC Breakfast. It would include the news channel. It would include Radio 5 Live. It would include Radio 2 and Woman’s Hour. It would include the CBBC Newsround programmes. If you total up those audiences, we reckon that within that two-hour window the women’s netball team was introduced to an audience of in excess 20 million.              The other thing that was incredibly valuable was that it was not just a traditional sports audience. It was reaching out into general programming. I would point to somebody like Sally Nugent on BBC Breakfast and just say what a fantastic job they have done in building the characters and personalities, which I think drives interest into the long-form coverage.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: One of the important things to remember is that there are obviously different categories. There are some sports that are only played by women and at the other end of the scale there are sports—horse racing for example—where men and women compete in the same event on a completely equal basis, and it is mixed with parasport. With parasport you get dedicated women’s events; you get dedicated men’s events. But they are shown both in the real world and on television completely side by side and, indeed, there are some individual sports within parasport—such as boccia, or, interestingly, wheelchair rugby—where men and women also compete in the same event on an equal basis.              Our experience is that when there is as much as integration as possible, that is to the benefit of the thing that might otherwise get a smaller audience. I spend a lot of time with people in the Paralympics movement and I think they would say that the single biggest thing that they have ever done is to ally themselves with the Olympics. So the popularity of the Paralympics is very closely related to the fact that they are attached to something that is bigger and more well-known. Over time perhaps they will have parity, and we are closer to that at the moment. I would say in those circles there is more debate about whether the two events should be completely integrated as opposed to being contiguous, as opposed to the opposite happening.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: A couple of points I would like to bring in from Sky’s perspective as a subscription channel. We have a duty to all our subscribers, which makes it sometimes easier for us to show sports, such as netball, that may be of minority interest. We have invested in netball. We show the Netball Superleague and we covered the England women’s team. Netball is following a similar journey to women’s cricket where the money that Sky have invested with the ECB, the ECB then invest in all forms of the game, including women’s cricket. We have seen improvements in the quality and the standard of the women’s cricket team, as we are seeing with the netball team now, so much so that I am delighted that Barbara’s people are giving them so much air time because that is great for us. Thank you.              It just shows how these sports can evolve with the right investment and support and with the right backing from all of us.&#xa0;

[[[Q10 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] I am sorry I missed the very beginning of the evidence. I ought to refer people to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.              Reading the submissions that you have made and listening to your evidence today, it is like a master class in politically correct, tokenistic, box-ticking competition really. “We are more politically correct than they are. We tick more boxes than they do and we have more tokenism on our channels than they have on theirs.” It is rather nauseating. I would really rather get down to a bit of nitty-gritty. For example, do audiences for sport increase overall and among women if you have female presenters? Could you try to give us some evidence and some figures and things like that?              

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I do not have those figures.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I do not have any evidence.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q11 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] You do not know. Exactly. That just goes to highlight my original assertion that all of this stuff is all tokenism and box-ticking. BT Sport: “We always make sure we have a female presenter on our panel”. You were singing it from the rooftops. You have absolutely no idea whether it makes any difference to whether more women watch the programme as a result. You have no idea whether or not it increases the audience for sport more generally. You are simply doing it for one reason only: to be able to come here and say, “We have managed to tick this particular box”. It is nothing to do with increasing women’s participation in sport or anything like that, is it? It is just tokenism.

[[[Simon Green]]]: On the issue of BT Sport and the female participants on panels and so on, it makes for a richer television experience.&#xa0;

[[[Q12 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] How do you know if you do not know if more people are watching it or if it appeals to more people? How do you know? That is just an assertion.

[[[Simon Green]]]: What does make a great television experience is a very subjective issue.

[[[Philip Davies: ]]]Exactly.

[[[Simon Green]]]: People on this panel have been involved in television production for a very long time. Making good television is what they are all about. Often putting a woman on a panel does make a difference in terms of how an audience will react to a show. It does enrich the value of that show and that is why it is done.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q13 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] What I think enriches a show is putting the best people on. I could not care whether it is all women; whether it is all men; whether it is half women or half men—just having the best, most knowledgeable people who can give the best insight. So why do we have to have in BT, “We’ve got to have one woman”? What on earth is all that about?

[[[Simon Green]]]: There is no “got to have”.

[[[Philip Davies:]]] You just said that, “We make sure that we always have at least one woman”.

[[[Simon Green]]]: I did not use the word “got”. It is just that the shows’ producers want to make the best television they can. It is their objective choice to make a mix and that makes for better television in the show producers’ opinion. It is simply about making television as good as can be done.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q14 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] Barbara, you are anxious to come in and tell us how not politically correct the BBC is.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I was going to say that we appoint our presenters absolutely, I believe, on merit. I think we have some fantastic women presenters who have long-standing careers, genuine expertise, and they are there to enhance the credibility of what we do. We have Gary Lineker. We have Sue Barker. We have Gabby Logan. We have Clare Balding. We have Hazel Irvine. We have Suzi Perry now doing Formula One. We have a new sports correspondent, Natalie Pirks. They are there on merit.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q15 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] You say that now, as I am putting this challenge to you, but in your written evidence, in your connecting with the audience, there is no mention of merit. Your written submission says, “We believe it is important to offer a diverse mix of on-air presenters, pundits and reporters to make our coverage more inclusive and better connect with audiences”. There is no mention of merit or anything like that. You are saying now something completely different from what is in your written submission.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: No. I think what we want is a diverse mix of presenters and we want them there on merit. I think we have a responsibility to grow, nurture and develop a diverse mix of talent and I think that is what we are doing. We use a variety of programmes to do that. For someone to get experience—say a Sue Barker or a Clare Balding—that is not something that you do in just a couple of years. That is something that takes 20 years. That is what we need to be doing now for our future generations of sports presenters. I do not think it is about tokenism. I do not. I think it is about the inclusivity of our coverage, that we should have a good mix of representation in those that present the sport. First and foremost, it is about expertise and knowledge of that sport.&#xa0;

[[[Q16 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] Andy, you just said a few minutes ago that you had absolutely no idea whether or not having women presenters increased your audiences, either among women specifically or overall. Yet in your written submission to this Committee you put, “Having female presenters on Sportswomen as part of the team telling the story is an important aspect in making all sport relevant and more engaging to female viewers”.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: Well, it is.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q17 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] You have just said to me you have absolutely no idea whether or not it is more engaging to female viewers. Which is it?

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: The Sportswomen programme is a programme that aggregates stories about women; looks at stories from a different angle. We need to keep refreshing the way we look at sport and there are women’s angles on sport that perhaps were not being covered elsewhere. Last week we looked at the issues facing Muslim women getting into sport, a really interesting piece. Sportswomen is presented by women. More importantly and broader than that, women make up 30% of our audience—and they go to football matches and cricket matches and they play sport—and it is quite right that they are reflected in our presenter line-up. On Sky Sports News our presenters are all experienced, qualified journalists and they are there on merit.&#xa0;

[[[Q18 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] So your assertion in here, you do not know if it is true. But do you not think there is a bit of a slightly patronising attitude developing here, which is that male viewers want to watch male presenters, but if we want to get more female viewers the way to do it is to get more female presenters? What I am trying to get to the bottom of—which none of you appears to have done at the moment—is what evidence do you have that the only way or the best or most successful way of getting more female viewers is to have female presenters. If the evidence is there that is great, let’s go with it. But at the moment you have all been startlingly silent on any evidence that that is the case.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: I cannot speak for everybody but I think methodologically that would be an extraordinarily difficult thing to get to the bottom of. I guess what people are saying is—and certainly it is our feeling—that you pick the best people to do the job to appeal to a wide range of different audiences, and some of those are men and some of those are women and some of them have other characteristics that make them different from other people in other ways. But I think it would be extraordinarily difficult from a research perspective to answer that question.&#xa0;

[[[Q19 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] Why is it so difficult? The great thing about TV is they are always boasting about their viewing figures. So I do not see why it is so difficult to say, “The viewing figures when we had all male presenters was X; the viewing figures when we had all female presenters was Y”. BT Sport were proudly telling us how many male viewers they had; how many female viewers. It seems to me that the TV industry is particularly well-placed to be able to say what difference having different genders makes to the viewing figures. At the moment we have all these pages of politically correct claptrap in here, but you have presented absolutely no evidence so far that anything that you are doing is making any difference whatsoever to women either watching sport or participating in sport.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: I think it is the sheer number of variables that exist within that equation. Our gut instinct would be that it is the sport—the competitors in that sport and the level of competitiveness of it—that is probably going to be the biggest driver of who watches it, much less so, I suspect, than whatever we might think about our very talented presenter-teams and the way in which the bits in between the sport is presented.&#xa0;

[[[Q20 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] Have Channel 4 made a conscious effort to have as many female presenters as possible on Chanel 4 racing?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: We have made an attempt to have the best possible people in the presenting team.&#xa0;

[[[Q21 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] They just happen to be women. So when you put in your submission about “led by Clare Balding, the current presenting team consists of a number of female in-vision presenters including Alice Plunkett, Emma Spencer and Tanya Stevenson”, they just happen to be women and you have not made a conscious effort to include more women.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: That is right. The Committee is looking at this question through a particular prism and inevitably we have constructed our answers, which are based on reality, through that prism. Stepping back, that is not the central prism through which we choose a presenter line-up.&#xa0;

[[[Q22 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Philip Davies:]]] Can I ask you all to go away and make some effort to see what impact having different presenters has on the viewing figures of different sports and overall? All these female presenters that you are talking about, they may be brilliant and it may well be that they do increase the viewing figure. I do not know. What I am rather shocked by is that you do not know. So would you make an effort to go away and try to do some research—whether it is quantitative or qualitative; whether it is your viewing figures—as to what impact having female presenters or male presenters has on viewing figures for sport overall and among female viewers? Would you all commit to at least making some effort to do that?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: Yes

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: Yes

[[[Simon Green]]]: Yes

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Absolutely.

[[[Philip Davies:]]] Thank you.&#xa0;

[[[Q23 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] Can I just ask a follow-up question? I think you have had a fairly tough line of questioning from Mr Davies, but would you say it is quite difficult to see the qualitative impact of bringing more women into sports media in the short to medium term? It might be that what you are doing now is seen as a very long-term aim of gaining audience and gaining participation.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I am not sure I understand the question.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: No.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q24 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] It is very easy to look at your viewing figures and say, “We have brought two women on to this panel and viewing figures have not changed”. Is bringing women on to TV shows with an idea of encouraging higher participation levels of women in sport seen as a long-term ambition rather than just a simple short-term gain? I think the difficulty in going away and doing research on whether or not you have grown your female audience, just by having women presenters, is probably very short-term thinking rather than long-term thinking. Surely it is about the relevance of women within sport. The more women that you have on your panels who know a lot about sport, surely, the more likely that other women are going to want to participate. Is that not what it is about?

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: We are a subscription channel so viewing figures are not the be-all and end-all for us. It is about: are we satisfying our subscription base? Women should be part of the sporting fabric. They should be part of our programme. They are part of the people who play it, watch it and go to see it live. Yes, they should be part of the presenting team, part of the reporting team and part of the production team as well.              Longer-term we are looking to help change the perception, as the Committee recognised, that women were not accepted as easily before in sport. If you look at some of the national newspapers, you will rarely see a by-line by a woman on a sporting story and rarely do you see stories about women in national newspapers. So, yes, we do see that this hopefully will be a long-term benefit. Women make up a huge number of our subscribers. We have a duty by them as well.&#xa0;

[[[Q25 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Leech:]]] So it is not about tokenism. It is about market manipulation and long-term growing of audience and participation. It is a deliberate attempt to make women think that sport is for women.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Yes. I think it is about making sport aspirational for men and women. Some of the fantastic talent that we are seeing on the BBC is about an investment that was made a significant time ago. You said it: it is about sport being the very fabric of what we do and women have a place in that. Therefore, I think it is perfectly natural, given that we are 50% of the population, that we should be represented in terms of sports presenting as much as in anything else, particularly when women absolutely have the credibility, the talent, the experience and the knowledge to do that.&#xa0;

[[[Q26 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] There is no doubt in my mind that the quality and range of coverage for women’s sport has come on in leaps and bounds in the last 10 years. That brings its own problems in terms of competitiveness and sports rights and the cost of dealing with that. Has that become a hindrance, the cost of some of the women’s events? I am thinking of the golf championships and things like that. Is that an issue that you are facing in terms of, as things improve, it becomes more competitive to try to show the best of the sports?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Yes. I think the reality is that there is probably no broadcaster that is going to have every sport because they are competitively sought. For example, we have made an investment in women’s football. I know BT have as well. Sky has made an investment in netball and owns the rights for netball. We own the rights for women’s football. Inevitably it is going to be that different broadcasters are going to specialise within different sports as they compete within a sports-rights market.&#xa0;

[[[Q27 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] To a lesser extent for the BBC but perhaps for the others, in terms of advertising revenues and issues around women’s competitions, do you notice any difference there? Has that improved? Is it harder to get advertising around women’s events?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: Because gender is not a key denominator for the sports we do, that is hard to answer directly. We certainly have no difficulty getting advertisers into parasport or horse racing. It is worth remembering that the vast majority of advertising revenue is traded in a rather different way than an advertiser saying, “I want to be in that particular programme” because 80% of it is done at the start of the year based on your share of the market. Nevertheless, particularly with sponsorship for broadcast coverage, certainly parasport has the very significant support of BT and Sainsbury’s, and in horse racing there is a lot of interest from bookmakers. Were we to be broadcasting women-only sport, I would imagine that there would be demand from particular brands to want to be involved in those events.&#xa0;

[[[Q28 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] What I am getting at is that you do not see it as a barrier. As Barbara said, 50% of the population is female. Do you think that retailers and advertisers are very keen to get to that proportion of the population?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: Our advertisers are equally interested in all our programming. But as I said earlier, we have only been on air for a very short period of time and we have not been able to differentiate an audience difference in terms of male/female for our female sports and our male sports so we are selling the same to those sports.&#xa0;

[[[Q29 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] Coming to you, Andy, I think what Sky has done with cycling and netball has been fantastic. Have you any other objectives in terms of dealing with other sports in a similar way? One of things you have done is help those sports re-look at themselves and make a better offer of their sport.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: One of the key things—this ties in with your earlier question—is women’s cricket and the growth in that. Our partnership with the ECB has really helped women’s cricket grow dramatically over recent years. Audience figures: we had a reach of 1.6 million this year. It has grown considerably since 2010, which we are chuffed about. But again, this will help us. If the sport becomes better, as the ECB are able to invest more in the development of the women playing cricket, so the sport becomes more compelling as a spectacle on TV, so the audience figure will go up; so the interest from sponsors and advertising and our revenues from those will go up. So the more we can be invested in this cycle of a good partnership with a governing body to help them raise the standard and make the sport more spectacular and more compelling, so the more people watch and more people perhaps then get inspired to play.&#xa0;

[[[Q30 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] Have any of the others thought about what Sky are doing with those particular sports. I know Channel 4 is obviously involved with disability sport and it will be great if strides come forward from that.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I do think working with the governing bodies and striking up a really good partnership is very important. I think to create a virtuous cycle as you were talking about, you want the top-quality sport; you want full stadia; you want a fantastic atmosphere; you want a sense of occasion. You want people who watch that to want to come back and watch it again. So I think there is a very important role in working with the governing bodies. To give you an example, the women’s FA Cup final traditionally was on a Monday and bound to be relatively restricted in terms of the audience. So we said to the FA, “Let’s work together. Let’s find a date where we can showcase that event at the weekend”. So it took place on a Sunday. With a break in the schedule we were able to devote the entire programming for the day to that event. That is one example of working together. There are others, too. I think we can make an impact, but it is about quality; it is about a sense of occasion; it is about atmosphere; full stadia; and characters and personalities that people want to watch.&#xa0;

[[[Q31 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] Obviously the Olympics and Paralympics were very successful. We have the Commonwealth Games next year. Are you concerned about where sport fits in the agenda? It is great while we have all the big events, but how do you see sport’s profile developing in a wider context and how can that help in terms of women’s involvement as well?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Next year promises to be a fantastic year with the Winter Olympics as well of course. Many of the medal contenders for those games are going to be women athletes. Another fantastic opportunity. When they come I believe the Commonwealth Games will capture everyone’s imagination, just as London did. In some ways it is a springboard. I think London 2012 was a springboard. I think the Commonwealth Games will be another. Let’s not forget there are the Rio Olympic Games just a couple of years after that. There is a cycle of major events. I think they are fantastic for raising the profile, particularly, of our individual athletes. At the moment that is where we are seeing some of our sportswomen particularly excelling, across the athletics. Cycling is another fantastic sport, and rowing. There are some just fantastic athletes who I think can be wonderful role models for youngsters coming through.&#xa0;

[[[Mr Sutcliffe:]]] The context of what we are trying to achieve is to increase the number of women playing sport. One of the big problem areas is the drop-off rate of girls at 16 who suddenly decide that sport is not cool and they want to do other things. How do you think the media can help in trying to prolong the involvement of people at that age? What can we do about the issues that the girls face surrounding that? Have any of you thought about that? Have you had a look at that as an area where some work can be done in programming?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I think it is about making sport aspirational. One of the comments that struck me very much at the time of the Olympics was when Jess Ennis won gold. She talked about having watched Denise Lewis in the 2000 Sydney Games and how she had seen that and that had been a fantastic inspiration for her. 12 years later, there she is: the poster girl of the Games fulfilling her dreams. Who knows in 2024—and it probably is that kind of time span—let’s hope lots of British medallists on podiums at those Games will look back and say, “London 2012 gave me the inspiration to participate”. I do think it is about women’s sport being aspirational for young girls. Many, many organisations have a part to play in that: absolutely the broadcast media, but I think the media more broadly as well.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: For us in Sky Sports News as well, these are stories that we cover regularly. What are the issues? What are the barriers for women continuing in sport? We have to challenge the governing bodies and the people who run these sports to find out why there is this drop-off. Also, as Barbara says, telling inspirational stories of fantastic athletes who our viewers can identify with and see that they can achieve, they can get something out of sport.              As you say, Jess is a great example and she believes in the power of sport. She is an ambassador for Living for Sport. Her ambition for that was not just to promote elite sport and other elite athletes; she wanted to get women and girls who were perhaps dropouts. People quite close to her, who she knew when she was growing up in Sheffield, have dropped out of sport. She feels they have missed out on a lot. So people like Jess have a powerful role to play in this and we can help to give them a platform.

[[[Simon Green]]]: Another example is the BBC’s coverage of the Olympics last year, which included women’s football and the knock-on consequences that has had into the WSL for us and our coverage of the WSL this year. The ratings on that particular event were higher than the WSL was last year. I believe a lot of that is because of the effort that was made at the Olympics by the BBC for women’s football.&#xa0;

[[[Q32 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Just on the tick box thing about women’s sport. Is it coincidental that the vast majority of women presenters, pundits and so on, are all very young, attractive people with one or two exceptions? If you look at their male counterparts they are all middle, mature, fat and bald, like the rest of us. If we look at the newspapers today, we very seldom see Clare Balding in the back pages but suddenly she in the front pages today because she has lost some weight. Is that intentional to get the young, attractive female pundits? If we look at the McCririck test, as I call it, he claims that he lost his job because Channel 4 wanted to bring in young female presenters. So there is a feeling out there that if you are over 30 in the sports pundit game then you are finished.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I do not think that is case, Mr Sheridan. The reality is there is not a tradition or a talent pool of experienced women sports journalists. It is a relatively new career. There are still issues, there are still problems. We work quite a lot with the National Council for the Training of Journalists about the courses that are accredited to sports journalists in particular. Only 18% of this year’s sports students are women. So there is not a pool and there has not been a tradition. It is increasing, and we know it is increasing, but there are still issues in getting these people to come through.&#xa0;

[[[Q33 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Can I ask you to hazard a guess, Andy, what is the average age of the female pundits in Sky Sports?

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I do not know the average age, but it would range from mid-20s to mid-40s.

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] BBC?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I would point to our main line up.

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Channel Four?

[[[Dan ]]]

[[[Brooke:]]] I could not give you the exact figure but we can certainly get it to you. Certainly, in terms of our presenter line up for parasport and for horse racing, I do not recognise that characterisation. There is quite a wide range of different people with a different mix of characteristics across the presenting line up of both sports.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Nor would I across our frontline female lead presenters. I really stand by that they are there on merit, on authority, on credibility and on a long track record of excellence in sports broadcasting.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q34 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] BT Sport are relatively new, are they not?

[[[Simon Green]]]: We have hired female or male presenters on their editorial ability, first and foremost.&#xa0;

[[[Q35 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Can I move on to the sponsorship in sports? Joanne Herbertson suggests that there is very little prize or sponsorship money in sport, and even cricket teams and football teams and the football leagues do not receive trophies. She puts it down to the fact that there is very little media coverage for women’s sport. Is that true, people winning games, teams winning games in football and cricket and not even receiving trophies, while their male counterparts are?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: That is not true in horseracing, as I said at the start. The participation of men and women is entirely equal. If a female jockey or a female trainer wins the race the rewards are the same.

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] No, I am talking about football and cricket.

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: I am not in a position to comment on that sport.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I cannot think of an event where we have had winner and they have gone up for the presentation and there has not been a trophy to be presented with, without being flippant on that.&#xa0;

[[[Q36 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Take Chrissie Wellington, she believes that women’s sport offers special benefits to potential sponsors. She is suggesting that there is an under-exploited area that we should be exploiting even more. What kind of advertisers or sponsors would come in and cover women’s sport? What products, for instance?

[[[Simon Green]]]: You would have to speak to the products and companies associated with whatever products they are interested in getting exposure for.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q37 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Sell me women’s sport then.

[[[Simon Green]]]: I am not here to sell women’s sport.&#xa0;

[[[Q38 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] If you are looking for a sponsor for women’s sport, who would you go to? What sort of range of companies or organisations would you go to?

[[[Simon Green]]]: If you are looking for exposure—

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] If it was male sport, would it be a beer company or something like that?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: Certainly, if we at Channel Four were doing it, we would probably not be primarily focusing on the sport, we would be focusing on what the audience for the sport is going to be. I think on balance that is what advertisers would do. There is a mix of genders in the sports that we do broadcast. One can see that BT and Sainsbury’s—the sponsors of parasport—are trying to appeal to a significant wide range of the population, and that represents the audience that watches the events.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: If we take the 2012 Olympics, and many of the successful athletes coming to those games—men or women—I would argue that all of our fantastic medallists are attractive to sponsors. That is less to do with gender but much more to do with perhaps the individual’s success and the profile of the individual sport. Across a whole range of sports, if you look within the sports themselves, you see a remarkable degree of gender equality. I do not think anybody would say, if you look back perhaps at an Olympic Games or a World Athletic Championships, that a female gold medallist is seen as anything as other than equal to a male gold medallist. I do feel across a raft of sports there is genuine gender equality in the kudos and the celebration of those athletes.&#xa0;

[[[Q39 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] In genuine ignorance, who is the current sponsor of England Women’s Football team or the England Football Team?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Is it Vauxhall? I am probably not allowed to say on the BBC.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I think it is bundled, is it not? With women’s sport, the more compelling it makes itself as a spectacle, the more exciting it is, the higher the quality, then the more attractive it will become as in any sport. People will not sponsor bad men’s sport. They will sponsor good women’s sport, if it is good sport, if it is attractive, if it is compelling, if the people playing it are compelling, if the people playing it are highly skilled, highly motivated, highly driven. That is where women’s sport will need to go and most sports are driving to get there to attract sponsorship.&#xa0;

[[[Q40 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Steve Rotheram:]]] Is that a real problem? I have had somebody check the home pages of each of your organisations, the sports pages, and it is primarily male-dominated. Over 90%. There are very, very few tags on to women’s sport. So if we are trying to raise the profile—

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: On the website?

[[[Steve Rotheram:]]] On your home pages.

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: I think on our home page there should be a big blurb about the Sportswoman of the Year Awards, which are on Thursday. That should be in the top right-hand corner. The other thing is there is less women’s sport around. The reality is that the  sporting diary today is dominated by football today. There is a huge programme of football fixtures tonight.&#xa0;

[[[Q41 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Steve Rotheram:]]] Therefore, is that not part of the problem that women’s sport is always going to be relegated because you are always going to have Premier League football?

[[[Simon Green]]]: We have a section on the website dedicated to women in sport. We have done since the day we launched. Going back to the sponsors, Nivea is a sponsor of the men’s England football team. I believe Continental Tyres is a sponsor though the FA for women’s football. So there are a range of sponsors who get involved in women’s sport and men’s sport that cut across both.

[[[Chair:]]] I have to disappear for a short time so I am going to ask Gerry Sutcliffe to take the chair in my absence.&#xa0;Mr Whittingdale leaves the Committee and Mr Sutcliffe takes the Chair.&#xa0;

[[[Q42 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] Can I ask you all whether you agree with a very simple assertion that there is no real evidence that women particularly want to watch women only sport, women, like men, want to watch good sport? Would that be a fair, relatively—to my colleague—uncontroversial statement?

[[[Dan Brooke]]]: Based on the sports that we broadcast, I would say that is true.&#xa0;

[[[Q43 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] Issues around participation and funding of grassroots stuff have been alluded to, and a lot of the funding comes from broadcast rights. I wonder whether some of the responsibility for the lack of women’s sport on television lies with the failure of some of the governing bodies to come and bang on your doors. For example, my mate Barry Hearn somehow managed to persuade Sky that live fishing was a broadcastable sport. I suspect there was not much polling evidence to back that up when Barry came banging on the door, but being a very charismatic, dogged and determined guy, Barry persuaded you that it was worth a crack. You gave it a crack and it seemed to do rather well. You have done the same at Sky with the netball. Can I ask you, what was the motivation to try the netball?

[[[Andy ]]]

[[[Cairns]]]: Several things. As a go ahead governing body we tried to see how it would work. They were very keen to listen to us about how to put on this spectacle to make it television friendly and to make sure that it looked like a proper event, with a packed arena and good camera angles that made it television friendly and more compelling to watch, a better experience for the viewer. They also have a very good team now and the series against Australia was great viewing. They were willing to listen to us about how to schedule, when and where to play the games and worked closely with us on those things.&#xa0;

[[[Q44 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] That is a very interesting answer. Can I ask all of you, in the light of that sort of example, have other governing bodies started to approach you saying, “What do we need to do to engage with you, to change what we are doing to make us an attractive proposition”?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I think there are many governing bodies that we would work with, particularly across the Olympic sport family, where we would not see any significant difference in the gender treatment of different athletes. Let me pick an example of a sport: triathlon or rowing. You look at the success of our women rowers. I am now talking from a broadcast and media point of view. Athletics would be another example. So there are many individual sports where I would say this is less of an issue.I think within some of the team sports there is a perception of perhaps a greater gap. Certainly in terms of football, we looked at 2012; we saw the fantastic success, 80,000 packing the Olympic Stadium for the final. Football felt a sport on the cusp of mainstream, which is one of the reasons why we have been so keen to get behind it and see what is possible. For example, I would particularly mention the European Football Championships. We knew it was in Sweden. We knew that was a country that was going to embrace it with full stadia and we tried to give it the “sense of occasion” treatment. For example, we ran a comprehensive trails campaign that was very, very deliberately focused on the team, the players and their skills. That reached 75% of all adults. So, as a broadcaster, we are trying to find moments that we can support and get behind, to push and make progress in terms of the audience appeal of those sports.You need to do that with the governing bodies but you also need to do it with a sufficient quality of sport and also everything that goes with that. In particular, I would say full stadia, great atmosphere. There is nothing worse, both in male and female sport, than empty stadia. If a crowd cannot be motivated to go and watch then I am not sure it is the place for network television.&#xa0;

[[[Q45 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] I want to probe that with one sport that you are very committed to on the BBC, which caused me to stay up far too late last night watching the highlights from York, and that is the snooker. I declare an interest in this. I go to the World Final every year. I love it. We have met at the Snooker Award Ceremony at the Dorchester a couple of times. The audience figure for snooker, there is quite a high proportion of women, a lot of elderly women—

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Yes, there is.

[[[Conor Burns:]]] Actually, Lady Thatcher used to watch the World Finals. A lot of women watch snooker. Obviously you have a female front person a lot of the time now. For example, I went up to Accrington to see the new snooker academy they are doing, where they are doing the interactive thing with both literacy and numeracy. Ofsted have said that that is having a tangible improvement in outcomes. The girls participate in that academy as much as the boys do and enjoy it as much as the boys do, and we are going to have the first south coast based snooker academy at the Bourne Academy School in my constituency launched by Steve Davis this coming February. When you look at something like snooker, you have a high female audience but it is almost exclusively male-dominated apart from the lead presenter. How do you look to change that?

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: In terms of male-dominated, do you mean in terms of the presentation team or the sport itself?

[[[Conor Burns:]]] The sport itself is, but women—

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: I was going to say, I think that is around the quality of competition. In comparison with the men’s game the women’s game is still limited in terms of the number of participants and, therefore, I think in terms of the perception about the quality of that competition. But it does not mean there cannot be progress made. It does not mean that there might not be opportunities in the future. I think if there were the calibre of female player and the intensity of competition that we see with the men’s game, absolutely we might see that shift.              We have covered women’s snooker as part of our snooker coverage in the past, but I do not think there is the depth and strength of competition yet to necessarily merit a major investment in women’s snooker. Interestingly, darts where there are some parallels, we will be covering the women’s darts final live for the first time this year. Those are conversations that we would have.              In terms of the presentation line up, yes, we are very proud to have Hazel front that coverage up. But if you look at the team of commentators and pundits, they are players who have played at the highest level, former world champions and so on. It comes back to the point that we were making earlier around credibility, authority and knowledge. I think it is fair to say that, at the moment, snooker is dominated by male players and former male players.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q46 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] Perhaps when we get to Sheffield this year, we could bring some young ladies from the Bourne Academy and some young ladies from the Accrington Academy and we could have them play during one of the breaks.

[[[Barbara Slater]]]: Yes, it is a deal.

[[[Conor Burns:]]] Excellent.

[[[Chair:]]] Anybody else? All right, I think we have reached the end of this session. Thank you very much for the evidence that you gave. Thank you.&#xa0;Witnesses: 

[[[Andrew Longmore]]], Sports Journalist, Sunday Times, and 

[[[Sarah Juggins]]], Treasurer, Sports Journalists’ Association, gave evidence.&#xa0;

[[[Q47 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] We start the second evidence session with evidence from Andrew Longmore, who is a sports journalist at the Sunday Times and Sarah Juggins, who is the Treasurer of the Sports Journalists’ Association. Good morning to you, and welcome.              We have just dealt with the broadcast media in terms of some of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach to encourage women’s sport. A general question from me would be how do you see women’s sport being covered by the print media? Do you think it has improved or is it worse? What are the issues affecting women’s sport and the print media? Andrew, we will start with you.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Yes, I think it has improved hugely. That is partly on our side of the fence but also partly because we are gifted with a golden generation of British women athletes, and they deserve all the coverage they get. I hope we have done our bit on the Sunday Times. We have our Sunday Times Sports Women of the Year Awards. The 26th edition is this Thursday. We started that in 1988 and kept going with it. We also backed that up with our coverage in the paper and I think we set a lead in that.              The coverage of women’s sport, I think the 2012 Olympics was almost a turning point there. There were 10 women gold medallists. You cannot ignore them if you wanted to and they were also superb role models as well. So I do think that the coverage of women’s sport, particularly in the minority sports, has hugely improved over the last 10 years.&#xa0;

[[[Q48 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Yours is a good example. The Sunday Times is excellent in terms of coverage of women’s sport, but I am thinking more of the tabloids. As we said earlier, it is dominated by Premier League football and women’s sport perhaps does not get a look in as do other sports. What do you think can be done to improve that?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Shall I dive in there? I would like to say something. As you know, the Sports Journalists’ Association represent all print and broadcast journalists. So, in answer to your previous question, I would slightly disagree with Andrew, in that in some areas coverage has improved a lot and I think in some areas it is improving but at a slightly slower rate. The reasons for that are probably driven by audiences rather than particularly any reluctance on the part of the papers or the journalists to cover female sport.If you look at the coverage, if you take the traditional big three sports, male-dominated, football, rugby and cricket, men have a huge leap on women because they have been playing it for such a long time at such an exposed level. I know there have been female football teams and cricket teams for a long time but, if you look at the Premier League, top level cricket and top level rugby, men have a big leap on women. So coverage in those areas is not so great.But then I totally agree with Andrew that in the minority sports you are looking at quite a lot of parity in coverage. If you look at cycling, Laura Trott is as likely to get coverage as Jason Kenny. Katherine Grainger got an awful lot more coverage than a lot of male rowers, so I think in some areas, yes, you see a good increase and I think in other areas it is slowly turning around, but it is turning around.&#xa0;

[[[Q49 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Sarah, my research notes tell me there is something like 700 members of your organisation, 10% of which are women. Around half of these work in PR and other fields. How many female frontline sport journalists are there?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: They are dreadful figures, between 4% and 5%. So half of a half we are looking at.

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] So 4% or 5% of 700 people?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: So, yes, it is not good.&#xa0;

[[[Q50 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Is there anything they are doing positively to try to—

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Again, it is coming down to a slow turnaround. You are seeing more females realising that they can go into sports journalism. You are seeing younger journalists coming in who are female. There are different mediums now. You have web-based publications, a plethora of magazines and different outlets that are also covering a wider range of sports. So you will probably see that increase continuing but they are not great figures certainly.&#xa0;

[[[Q51 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] There seems to be a progress from male sportspeople, when they have finished their career they then move into punditry or newspapers, and that is not the case with women. Is there a deliberate sort of glass ceiling there or is it not attractive enough for young former female athletes to follow into sports journalism?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Like I said, the SJA covers the whole gamut of sports journalists and broadcasters. If you look at TV—and I know you have just had an hour with TV—a lot of those journalists are ex-performers who were at the very top. For example, Denise Lewis, Gabby Logan and Hazel Irvine all played sport and they have all then taken their expertise forward.              I really cannot answer your question. I do not know why they do not come into the industry, whether it is they have reached the end of their participating career and decide to move on to something completely different. Obviously there are always family commitments coming at the end of a sports career. Perhaps it is that. I am afraid I cannot give you an answer on that.&#xa0;

[[[Q52 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] I would surmise that the print industry has the same equal opportunities as everyone else in terms of legislation and so on. s that the case? In advertising for journalists do they say, “Must be male, must be female”?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Not at all. No. If you look at another area of journalism, if you look at the fashion industry, you would probably find people arguing the reverse. That is a hugely female-dominated sphere of journalism and perhaps there are some young lads who are thinking the same thing.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: To put in almost a little aside here. My wife works at Southampton Solent University, the inner city university at Southampton, and I was looking at their graduation figures the other day. They have a very strong media department and they have a sports journalism course that had one girl writer out of 30, and in fashion I think there was something like 68 boys to two girls. I do not know why that should be. There is this perception that if you go into sport that is a male thing and fashion is a female thing. How one breaks that down, I do not know. But those are just the figures for this year.&#xa0;

[[[Q53 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] The figures for females in journalism are pretty poor. What are the figures for management in journalism, female management?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: We have one chief sports editor, Alison Kervin.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Yes, one sports editor on the Mail on Sunday.

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Sorry, what paper is she?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Mail on Sunday.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Certainly on the sub-editing side it is not very much, I do not think. My sports editor who I am standing in for here is a male. So it is slow progress, but I think—&#xa0;

[[[Q54 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Are there any plans or a strategy to change that?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: From the Sports Journalists’ Association’s point of view, there are a couple of audiences that we are trying to target to get more involved with our organisation, which is a very small chink into the whole of changing perceptions. Yes, we are trying to get more females on to the committee so that other journalists can see that they are taken seriously within this industry. Certainly, with the master classes that we run, we try to persuade young aspiring journalists, male and female, to come along to those. In no way, shape or form is there a, “No, females not allowed”. It is more, “Come on, give it a go”. But we are probably talking about careers advice and stuff like that, if we are completely honest. There is a perception and it is not being changed at the lower levels. That would be my take on it anyway.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: I would also say if any young sports journalists come in front of me I generally say to them, “Don’t just do football”. A lot of them are just, “Football, football, football. That is what I do. That is what I am interested in”. I have covered 28 different sports of various sorts through 20, 30 years in the business. I think people ought to be looking at a wider brief than just football because that is a difficult one to break down. That is always my advice to any sports journalist who comes in. I think we have to broaden the brief as well. It is also a contracting industry in the frontline and it is hard to get any job on a national newspaper in the sports department at the moment. It is a difficult time to be breaking in, whoever you are.&#xa0;

[[[Q55 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] The whole tenor of the conversation has been through the approach that this is something that we necessarily must change. Could I make a controversial suggestion? Bournemouth University and the Arts University Bournemouth are in my constituency. The Arts University offers a very flamboyant, creative sort of degree, and we have a very good costume design degree there. When I visit there 95% of the students enrolled on that degree course are women, 5% or so are men. When I go and look at the media school at Bournemouth University, which is again very well renowned, I think I only know one girl in the current year studying sports journalism. Is that not just perhaps in the nature of the way we are created?

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Quite possibly, yes. We have some very good women’s sports journalists now. It is in the SJA report here that 40 years ago Julie Walsh had a chair hurled at her when she deigned to report a first division football match. Now there are some superb women reporters.The perception used to be that if you had a woman sportswriter she should write about women’s sport. I hope we are breaking that down as well. I think that is happening. It used to be, “Here is the women’s perspective on football” or whatever it is. I hope that attitude is vanishing a bit. Yes, I agree with you on that. I do not quite see why there should be this push.&#xa0;

[[[Q56 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] As we were talking about in the last session, if the governing bodies are successful in working with the broadcasters to get more women-only events broadcast and out there, and the quality of what is out there improves, the male sportswriters and broadcasters will be compelled to cover it because there is more of it.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Yes.

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Absolutely.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q57 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Conor Burns:]]] You would not necessarily have more coverage if there were more female journalists and the quality remained as it is.

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: No. I do not think for a second that we think that. I am totally happy reading a report by Oliver Holt, Henry Winter or Alison Kervin on an event. It is the information that you want, not who wrote it and what their gender is. The important thing that we are all trying to do is trying to get more coverage of the very good performances by the women.I was just going to step back again. We are saying: is it inbred in people? I think it is almost the nurturing process because how many girls at school are actively encouraged to think about sports journalism? I am coming from the stance that for 10 years I was a sports director at an all-girls school. It is so difficult to get kids, firstly, motivated to take part in sport and, secondly, to keep them in sport when they have so many other things going on. Even the very best sports performers at the age of 13 and 14, the minute that they are thinking about their GCSEs, their love lives, their work commitments outside of school, all that sort of thing, sport just moves down the pecking order. An aspirational girl probably is not going to immediately think, “Oh sports journalism that is what I want to do”.              

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Your point is a good point because it has been a dilemma for women’s sport for a very long time, which is do you try to take on men’s sport—I am particularly talking about the major sports—or do you try to develop your own women’s sport separately? In football and cricket now there are extremely successful programmes in the FA and the ECB, which are providing extra funding. We have seen vast improvements in the performance of the England football team, the England cricket team—the women’s cricket team I am talking about—and the rugby team as well because they have been brought into the fold, if I can use that word. Premier League clubs are being encouraged to have their own women’s clubs as well.Of course in that you are saying, “You are going to be just part of a much bigger organisation”. A sport I would like to look at is something like netball, which is essentially a women-only sport. That has been fantastically successful in its development of the super league and things. As you were saying, do you try to go your own way with women’s snooker, have a women’s snooker tournament, or do you try to say, “Well, if there is a player good enough, why can she not play in the world championships?” They certainly had that debate in America and I think we are still in a sense having it here.&#xa0;

[[[Q58 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] I want to pick up on the netball point, because netball is a good example of a sport that went out of its way to sell itself to the media through Sky but also from the stories behind what was going on within netball. Do you think many other sports should be trying to do that as well, given that the motivation that we are all trying to achieve is greater participation by women and girls in sports and greater coverage of women’s sport?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Yes. We have already heard of the people who are members of the SJA. A lot of those are PR people and their role should be getting stories out of those sports so that the papers want to publish. The young golfer Charley Hull is a story, so then she gets the coverage. Kate Walsh at the Olympics played on with a broken jaw—that is a story. Then the women’s hockey coverage during the Olympics, if I was a male hockey player I would be fed up because they did not get anywhere near as much coverage. It is the PR machines; it is getting the stories out there.&#xa0;

[[[Q59 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] So you believe more could be done and you think the governing bodies should do more?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: I absolutely think governing bodies should be doing more to get their stories out there, yes.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Yes. Then one of the problems is if you are like me covering quite a wide brief you have 25 different sports or 20 different sports and you virtually have to go to each one and push and try to find the story for each one. That is my job. That is what I am supposed to do. But sometimes you do think, “My goodness, you have a story in there you have not been telling me about”. It is hard because in some of the smaller sports they do not have the funding to be able to have a full-time press person to ring you up. I do not know whether it is possible to have an overall one. The British Olympic Association do it sometimes in the lead up to games. They are very good. But sometimes you think, “My goodness, what a good story that is, but I have had to really push and dig” and sometimes you think, “Just give me a call”. I am there and they can do that. So I do think there is that.              Your question about netball, yes, they have done well with it. If you look at the England Netball website, it is bright, it is sassy. They have this wonderful thing, “Forget the Mac, netball is back” so just little things. There are some nice photographs there and some good images. From quite a slow start with the Super League in 2004, 2005, they have built it up. They have national television coverage now. Then the standard improves, then you beat Australia, then you are beginning to get really good coverage. So I do think now particularly—Sarah’s point—the success, it does not matter where it comes from, if it is successful it is covered. That has been a huge leap forward.&#xa0;

[[[Q60 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] Australia is a big sporting country. What is the ratio of female journalists for instance in Australia compared with the UK? Do you have any idea what it is?

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: There is Chloe somebody who writes as the full-time cricket correspondent for one of the major Australian papers. She has been for a while and she is hugely respected. Roy Hodgson gave a press conference the other day and I would say the coverage of women reporters was distressingly small. But Australia, if you are asking whether they are further down the line—

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] I am just interested—

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: But to have a full-time cricket correspondent is—

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: Yes, that is unusual.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: —unusual, and we have certainly never had a chief sportswriter.

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: I was just going to say, in terms of coverage, I went to New Zealand a couple of years ago and the back pages were full of the New Zealand netball team. Obviously, on all of our back pages the first story would be either football or cricket, depending on the season; male. In New Zealand, in particular, there is quite a lot of parity between the female major sports and the male major sports in terms of coverage. Anecdotally, in Australia, some female performances have dropped slightly, hence the coverage has dropped. That is the thing about the print journalism. I listened in when you were talking to the broadcasters. I think broadcasters possibly, by their very nature, can play more of an interactive role with the audience and have more impact. I think we are very reactive to what is happening. I do not know if you agree with that, but my perception is we react to the stories whereas broadcasters can sometimes use their visual power to make the stories and increase participation that way.&#xa0;

[[[Q61 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Sheridan:]]] You may have heard in the previous session we asked the question about the two football pundits on Sky Sports. There is a school of thought that they were just unlucky, in the sense that they were caught and that kind of behaviour and language is commonplace among journalists. Can you give us a flavour, for instance, in newspaper offices, how women are treated? If you come in on a Monday morning and start talking about a football game, are you taken seriously?

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: You are looking at me, aren’t you?

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: You go, I will listen.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: No, I would say not. I would say not. “Wear a cap and swear a lot” that is the advice Sue Mott received from Julie Walsh.

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: That is 40 years ago, though.

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: That is a while ago, I think. No, I do not think so because of Charlotte Dujardin, because of the three women’s gold medals in rowing, because of the hugely impressive generation of women athletes that we have. I will get pulled up on this but if you say, “He played like an old woman”, I do not know, does that—

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: It is either ageist or sexist, isn’t it?

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: Yes. But it is changing; I think the two you are referring to is unusual behaviour because there are quite a lot also in television who are producers and things.

[[[Sarah Juggins]]]: I can add to that because I joined the Sports Journalists’ Association three years ago and I must admit I expected to walk into a room full of—sorry—fusty old men who would not take a female seriously at all. I found nothing but respect and taking a woman’s authority on sport as much as a man’s. We have Janine Self on the committee who is a respected female football journalist. I think it is a dying breed, the people who are still misogynistic about female sports reporters.I also worked at the Olympics where we had a room full of journalists. For a start the split was pretty much 50/50 in terms of male and females and, again, there was as much respect for the female reporters and journalists as there was for the males. So I think that is a rare case. Obviously sometimes people do have a bit of banter and obviously if they do get caught out that is pretty unlucky, but I think people are becoming more aware and it is dying out.&#xa0;

[[[Q62 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Andrew, we talked about the Sunday Times taking the lead in the area of covering women’s sport. Was that a commercial decision or were there any other factors at play? Was it a deliberate commercial decision to do that, or what was the motivation behind it?

[[[Andrew Longmore]]]: That is a very good question. It was 1988 when we started the awards, and I do think—I do not want to get pious about this—there is a commitment to women’s sport that we have always had because it makes the paper more balanced. If you are not writing about women’s sport you are cutting off a huge number of exceptional stories. There was that, but there was a feeling that it just made us a better sport section. Commercially I am not sure whether it adds vast numbers of readers to the paper but I think it brings a huge amount of goodwill in sport, particularly in some of the minority sports. In rowing, for example, which I have covered now for quite a long time, I am accepted there, they will help me out.I was speaking to an agent yesterday and she said, “You are ahead of the game. That is where people go to if they want to put a feature in”. So commercially, I do not know whether it helps with advertising or not. I cannot answer that. But I think we have just made the decision and it is a commitment. It is a commitment; there is no doubt about it. Particularly now where sport sections have had to cut back and you have five pages of football, seven sometimes, rugby, then you have the Ashes and the space is going, going, “Can you rope off that bit for a downhill mountain biker?” My sports editor is sitting there and he will say, “Yes, we will do that and we will run it”. Incidentally, the piece on the downhill mountain biker, Rachel Atherton, who is part of an extraordinary family, was the most read online piece of that week. There are a lot of mountain bikers out there and you are hoping that they will think this is a good thing.

[[[Chair:]]] I think it is a good thing. Anybody else? We have come to the end. Thank you very much for evidence today.&#xa0;&#xa0;              Oral evidence: Women and Sport, HC [809]                            5
