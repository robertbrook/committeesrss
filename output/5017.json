"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nChristopher Salmon\n, \nPolice and Crime Commissioner for \nDyfed-Powys\n [PCC Progress 09]\n1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area;1.1 \nPreventing crime is the first priority of the Police and Crime Plan.  We are working with other Police and Crime Commissioners, Welsh Government, Probation, Local Authorities, voluntary organisations and businesses to this end.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 The effectiveness Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) on reducing crime will be decided by voters \ni\nn May 2016.  Delivering on this requires attention to the context in which crime occurs – “the wider social mission” of crime reduction, to use a recent phrase.  That does not mean the police have to do it all.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 PCCs commissioning powers allow the police to focus on policing and other experts to help prevent crime, tackle offending, encourage reporting, protect the vulnerable, address mental health and substance misuse issues and reduce anti-social behaviour. \n&#xa0;\n1.4 In Dyfed-Powys we are emphasising neighbourhood policing, improving public access and confidence in police services.  This requires services that are more public focussed, responsive, cost effective and professional.\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nWe have (1) brought forward the recruitment of 30 officers as a result of better management; (2) reduced the cost of the three top salaries (Chief Constable, Chief Finance Officer and Chief of Staff) from £420,000 to £330,000; (3) responded to public demand with “when we’re in, we’re open” (this mean\ns\n rural stations are more accessible); \nand \n(4) introduced a Commissioner\n’\ns Fund that puts money at the disposal of frontline officers for crime reduction in their neighbourhoods.  We have reviewed our use of cautions with external input and an assurance panel.\n&#xa0;\n1.6 Commissioning will begin in earnest in 2014/15.  We have appointed a Director of Commissioning, responsible for community safety, local justice, and victims\n’\n services.  This post will be responsible for building capacity and working with voluntary organisations in areas such as, restorative justice, domestic and sexual violence, and antisocial behaviour reduction.  We have piloted the use of mediation and intend to expand this and other innovative crime prevention services such as mentoring, education, counselling and youth interventions.\n&#xa0;\n1.7 \nCovering\n the most rural \npolice force\n in England and Wales, local accountability allows us to respond to local need in a thoughtful and flexible way.  Geography is a huge challenge.  We are developing relationships with local universities to enhance our evidence base and polic\ny\n making to meet that challenge.\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account;2.1 \nTo allow the \nDyfed-Powys \nPolice and Crime Commissioner and the Chief Constable to exercise their roles in a transparent\n and aligned\n manner a Policing Board has been e\nstablish\ned.  Th\ne\n Board consists of \nthe PCC, his D\neputy, the Chief Constable and Chief Finance Officer \nwho \nmeet on a weekly basis\n.\n \nA\nn extended Board meeting\n is held\n once a month\n.\n This extended Board is a critical element in the \nCommissioner’s\n scrutiny role. \n \nIt enables early identification of core issues and tracks progress against the priorities contained within the Police and Crime Plan\n.\n \n \nThe monthly meetings are open and available for the public to attend.  The terms of reference and working arrangements for the Board are outlined in \na\n \nPolicing Board Charter\n and are available on our website.\n  Weekly meetings \nfocus\n \non core issues effecting policing and crime, whereas monthly meetings are \ncentred \non a predetermined Police and Crime Plan priority.  The minutes of all Policing Board meetings are published on the O\nffice of the \nP\nolice and \nC\nrime \nC\nommissioner’s (OPCC)\n website.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 The Commissioner holds informal Personal Development Reviews (PDR) with the Chief Constable\n (CC)\n. These meetings feed into the formal annual PDR\n. \n \nThe annual PDR holds the Chief Constable to account for his performance against set criteria, identifies the key challenges for the year ahead and agrees the \nkey performance indicators\n for the next PDR.\n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account;3.1 \nThe relationship between the PCC and the Panel is developing well. As awareness and acceptance of the separate and distinct roles of the \nPCC\n and Police and Crime Panel develop, so too does the relationship\n between the two bodies\n.  The Panel were able to offer some constructive observations in relation to the development of the Police and Crime Plan and accepted the proposed budget and precept proposals in 2012.  \nThe panel also considered the recommendations of the PCC in appointing his Deputy (after an open selection and appointment process) and Chief of Staff. The Panel interviewed both appointees robustly before confirming the appointments. The Panel has been equally robust in reviewing the Commissioner’s reports to them and in \nquestioning the information contained within those reports.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nThe Panel will \nbe informed of the budget considerations \nand proposed precept \nat the earliest given opportunity\n.  \nHowever\n, given that the government’s \nAutumn statement is not expected until the 5\nth\n December and the Policing Settlement until the 18\nth\n December, \nlegislative constraints mean that this allows limited time for in-depth Panel considerations.\n \n \nHowever\n,\n to facilitate matters, a\n meeting has been arranged for the Panel to consider matters relating to the budget in early January, in advance of the meeting where they will be asked to formally consider the Commissioner’s precept proposal.\n4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011;4.1 \nWithin Dyfed-Powys the Stage 2 transfer plan is being approached as a step in a joint pr\nogramme of reform in the organisation\n. This approach has been branded the ‘Public First’ change programme. The aim is to redesign services to ensure they are value for money, flexible and responsive to community needs.  Success will require a cultural as well as an organisational change. The focus is to ensure that front line policing services are prioritised in the light of the fina\nncial challenges posed by the Comprehensive Spending Review.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nUnder the proposal submitted to the Home Secretary all operational and operational support police staff will be transferred to the employment of the Chief Constable at midnight on 31st March 2014. This means that 792 members of staff\n, based on current staffing levels \nwill transfer to the employment of the Chief Constable.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nThe PCC is in the process of employing a Director of Resources who will be responsible for all business support staff. \n \nThe Director of Resources and business support staff, totalling 219\n (based on current staffing levels)\n, will remain employed by the Commissioner but answerable to the Chief Constable for the timeliness, quantity and quality of services he requires. They will also deliver support to the Commissioner and commissioned services. This is intended to be an interim arrangement that will not last beyond September 2015. \n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nDuring this transitional period, in accordance with the provisions of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, the opportunity to enter into agreements with other policing bodies and local partners to support front-end service delivery will be explored and taken forward. \n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nInnovation will be key to \nthe successful delivery of ‘Pub\nl\nic First’\n. The PCC\n and CC are \nconfident that this phased approach will deliver the best structure for Dyfed-Powys and will provide adequate, appropriate and agile support services. Discussions for implementing such arrangements are beginning now but will not be concluded for transfer by the 31 March 2014.  All final transfers to the Chief Constable and/or other local partners will take place no later than September 2015\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 At the time of writing this submission, the Dyfed-Powys Stage 2 proposal is being considered by the Home Secretary.\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of commissioners in budget and precept setting;5.1 \nWithin Dyfed-Powys precept setting arrangements have been simplified\n \nunder the leadership of the PCC.\n \nT\nhe \nconsultation process \nhas \nalso \nbeen \nwidened, allow\ning\n for faster decision making that has ultimately resulted \nin lower \nprecept increases\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nDuring \nhis\n first year in office\n,\n \nthe Commissioner\n had little time to \nmake budget and precept decisions.  Decision making for the second year of \nbudget and \nprecept setting \nhas been more strategically and operationally focused\n. \n \nThe Commissioner has to manage a predicted overall budget decrease of £9\n \nmillion over the next four years. \nThere is therefore a strategic balance to be struck between cost reduction, precept setting and safeguarding operational policing. \n \nThe Commissioner has committed to protecting Community policing and to minimising precept rises.\n \n \nWhilst no final decision can be taken until we receive our budget settlement from the Home Office\n the \nCommissioner has indicated that the \nprecept \nfor 2015\n \nwill \nrise\n by \nno more than \n3.1%, in comparison to 3.9% in 2013/14, and 5% under the Police Authority in 2012/13.  \nThe Commissioner’s \nintention is to keep future rises \nin line\n with inflation.\n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nIn terms of budget setting the Chief Constable has been tasked with outlining organisational requirements moving forward.  There \nare \nalso\n occasional\n away day\ns\n \nled by the Commissioner and \nattended by the most senior staff and police officers from both the Force and OPCC.  Th\nese\n provide further discussion on what is needed and what can be delivered within the current budget constraints.  \nThey\n also provide an opportunity to discuss \ninvestment priorities that will effect \nlonger term budgetary decisions\n.\n \n6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities;6.1 \nFor police \nand crime priorities\n \nto be delivered, buy\n-\nin is needed across criminal justice agencies.  \nThis has been achieved within Dyfed-Powys by ensuring that the PCC has representation on appropriate Boards.  Whilst it has taken some time for some agencies\n’\n to \nadapt to\n PCCs, we now have local representation on the All Wales Criminal Justice Board, the Local Criminal Justice Board, the \nArea Planning Boards, Local Service Boards and Community Safety Partnerships.  This has given the opportunity to not only drive forward delivery of police and crime priorities, but also ensure that partner agencies priorities are aligned and complement service delivery across \norganisations\n.\n  Such partnerships allow for mutual problem solving \nsuch as \nmaking better use of resources \nthrough \ncommissioning, or joint collaboration\n, \nthereby resulting in services being delivered smarter and \nin a way that is \nmore accessible to users.   \nWe \nare exploring ways in which the Dr\nug Intervention Programme\n can be\nst be delivered\n.  This will result in the availability of drug rehabilitation treatment being widened by pooling monies available and sharing \ncontract administration costs.  We are also exploring opportunities with our Local Authorities \nto\n establish \njoint front counter services.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nKey to promoting \nPolice \nand \nCrime Plan \npriorities \nis \nestablishing effective working relationships with other agencies on a person to person basis.  This approach has facilitated enhanced working with the private and third sector\n agencies\n that have skills and experience to deliver local priorities more efficiently and at a reduced price. \nThis will be a key part of the ‘Public First’ initiative.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nIn an area such as Wales where many agencies that have a responsibility \nfor preventing crime and promoting safety are devolved, PCCs act as the link between national, regional and local\n policy\n.  It is essential that effective relationships are maintained with both central and devolved administrations.\n  To facilitate this regular meetings are held with \nthe \nSecretary of States (Wales)\n, \nHome Office\n, and \nboth the Health\n,\n and \nLocal Government and Government Business\n \nWelsh \nMinisters.\n&#xa0;\n6.4 \nThe PCC will\n work with other commissioning bodies such as the Community Rehabilitation Companies (under \nthe \nTransforming \nRehabilitation agenda).  This will promote local priorities to all those that are co\nnsidering bidding for this work\n.  It \nalso facilitates \nfuture discussion for possible co-commissioning of services.\n&#xa0;\n6.5 \nWe have held regular surgeries and events over 2012/13.  This will be widened into a ser\nies of local listening days.  This involves holding a \nnumber of days \nlocated \nthroughout the \nforce \narea during the year.  Each day \nfeature\ns\n public surgeries with private appointments for individuals and small groups.  The day also involve\ns\n visits to schools, community groups, organisations and police stations.  These engagement opportunities have mutual benefits to all involved.  The Commissioner promote\ns\n his local priorities\n and\n individuals, groups and organisations are given the opportunity to influence decision making.\n&#xa0;\n6.6 \nOur office has a strong social media presence on \nFacebook\n, \nand Twitter\n.  We also send out regular e-newsletters to those who have subscribed for updates via our website\n, informing them of what the Commissioner has achieved during the previous quarter\n.\n7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProgress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policing organisations and partners7.1 \nDyfed-Powys is currently engaged in a number of collaboration agreements both with neighbouring forces and with a Local Authority.  The agreements entered into by the Police Authority have continued under the leadership of PCCs in Wales.  \nExpanded collaboration is a stated aim of the Police and Crime Plan and the Chief Constable’s PDR process.\n&#xa0;\n7.2 Joint \nscrutiny \narrangements \nof current \ncollaboration\n agreements\n are currently being established\n albeit later than the PCC would have liked\n.  The forum that will be used to facilitate this will be the All Wales Policing Group which consists of the four Welsh Chief Constables and PCCs.  A draft memorandum of understanding to facilitate this has been drafted by the Dyfed-Powys PCC and circulated for \nagreement \nto the Welsh Commissioners and Chief Constables\n.  \nJoint scrutiny arrangements are expected to \nproceed on a more formal basis \nat the All Wales Policing Group scheduled for January 2014. \n&#xa0;\n7.3 \nWelsh Chief Constables with the consent of their PCCs have recently met to discuss further collaboration opportunities.  These discussions have identified a number of possible areas for future collaboration.  These will now be explored in further depth to determine their feasibility.\n  The PCC supports this and would like it expanded.\n&#xa0;\n7.4 \nUnder the initiative of ‘Public First’ we \nare \nscoping opportunities to collaborate with other public services and private and third sector organisations.  The PCCs view is that the Police need to concentrate on policing.  Other opportunities need to be explored to ascertain who can best deliver other services.\n&#xa0;\n7.5 The Commissioner and his Deputy h\nold regular\n meetings with the Chief Executives and Leaders of the four Unitary Authorities contained within the Force area. These meetings have focused upon collaborative opportunities. We are currently \nscoping\n potential projects \nthat allow \nshared back office functions, shared estates and multi-agency team approaches.\n8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransparency of and reporting by commissioners to date.&#xa0;\n8.1 \nIn a recent (November 2013) survey undertaken by CoPACC (Compares Police and Crime Commissioners), the \nOPCC\n Dyfed-Powys was rated in the top three of \nOPCCs\n in the country\n, and the most transparent in Wales\n.  \n8.2 There is a \npresumption in favour of transparency.  \nThis incorporates conforming with legislation requirement\ns\n in respect of publishing information\n and more\n.  I\nt also relates to the way in which that information is published.  It needs to be accessible in a format that is easy for the user to access, analyse, understand, and use.  It is these principles that we have applied to our approach to ensuring transparency within \nPolice and Crime Commissioner\n’\ns Office in \nDyfed-Powys, and one that we are promoting within the police service.\n  Our approach is being continuously reviewed to build on the good work that has already been established.\n9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeclaration of interests9.1 \nThe \nCommissioner’s\n and \nDeputy Commissioner’s\n declaration of interest can be accessed \nvia the links provided\n.\n  They have no interests of relevance to this submission.\n&#xa0;\nChristopher Salmon, Police and Crime Commissioner for Dyfed-Powys\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
