"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the National Housing Federation&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nWe support the \nconcept of \nUniversal Credit and \nits \npotential \nto\n ensur\ne\n that people are better off in work by reducing benefit withdrawal rates. \nHowever, \nthe \nNational Housing \nFederation has several concerns \nregarding the reforms\n, primarily because households do not have a genuine choice to have the housing element of \nU\nniversa\nl \nC\nredit paid directly to their landlord. Many tenants would elect to do this to avoid going into \narrears\n. We are also concerned that the \ncumulative impact of \nbenefit cuts \nmeans that households \nincreasingly \ncannot afford \nto \ncover the most basic costs of \nfeeding their family\n, \nkeeping their home warm\n and paying their rent at the same time\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nOur response focuses on the case for abolishing the social \nsector \nsize criteria\n.\n \nOur recent ComRes poll shows that public opinion is shifting against the social \nsec\ntor \nsize criteria with 59% in support of Bedroom Tax repeal, up from 51% in April\n. In addition, 87% agree that those who need a spare room for sick or disabled family members should be exempt from the policy. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nWe also outline a number of \nmeasures tha\nt \nw\nould \nensure the \nroll out of Universal Credit \nreduces the risk of tenants going into \ndebt \nand protects social \nlandlord\ns’ revenue streams\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nTo ensure we have information on the\n long-term\n impact of \nthe Government’s welfare reforms\n, the Federation \nhas \ncommissioned Ipsos MORI to survey housing associations in autumn 2013 with a large scale tenants’ survey in \nearly \n2014. \nWe would be happy to share the \nresults with the Committee in due course. \n&#xa0;\n2              The best way to get the housing benefit bill down&#xa0;2.1\n              \nThe \nrise in the housing benefit bill\n in recent years\n is a result of higher unemployment, stagnating \nlow \nwages and rising rent levels in the private rented sector. The consequence is that, of every £1 of government expenditure on housing, 95p is spent on housin\ng benefit and only 5p on building new homes\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nRecommendation: the \nmost effective way of redressing the balance and reducing the housing benefit bill is \nto \nbuild more affordable homes. Government investment in new affordable homes not only helps tackl\ne\n \nour growing housing crisis, but also has a fundamental role to play in:\n \n&#xa0;\n3              Impact of welfare reform on rent arrears and empty homes&#xa0;3.1\n              \nIn \nautumn\n 2012, 84% of housing associations believed that their rent arrears would increase \nas a direct result of \nthe \nwelfare changes\n (taking into account direct payments, \nthe social size criteria and the benefit\n cap)\n. The average increase \nin arrears \nexpected was 51%\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nAt the end of 2012, \nhousing association arrears stood at 5.1% (£572m)\n. If a 51% increase in arrears was realised\n across the sector\n, actual arrears levels would rise to 7.7% (totalling £865m).\n \nThis loss in revenue translates into a loss of financial capacity within housing associations to manage and maintain their properties\n; \ndeliver wider community services and build new homes. If all these losses were \ndiverted away from \nfinancing new homes, the country would see 17,480 less affordable homes built in a year. \nAny impact \non h\nouse b\nuilding \nmay be more \nlikely to\n \nbe felt \nin the next Spending Review period, as 61% of associations\n \ndid not think welfare reform \nwould m\nake it harder\n to deliver on their commitments under the existing Affordable Homes Programme\n. Though 26% say it \nwould to \na fair amount or great deal\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThe impact on tenants and communities would also be significant. For individual working-age tenants on housing be\nnefit, th\ne predicted \nimpact \nwould mean outstanding arrears increasing by £250 (up from £492) to £743 on average\n by year end\n. \nPolicis\n, in a separate study for the Federation, \nfound that \n50% of social housing tenants were not confident they would be able to keep up rental payments with a switch to monthly payments in arrears within a Universal Credit. \nPolicis \nidentified \nfamilies with children, \nthose who \njuggled their finances through \nweekl\ny cash budgeting and were already under financial stress\n as most at risk in this move\n. \nPolicis \nalso \nfound that \n32% of social housing tenants had problematic credit use and it was amongst this group that rent arrears were already concentrated\n and risks to b\ne foun\nd\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nRecommendation: \nthat households are given a genuine choice to have their \nhousing element of Universal Credit \npaid direct to their landlord\n given the level of risk to rent arrears\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nRecommendation: \nw\ne \nwelcome the measures the DWP are trialling in the North West pathfinder areas to identify tenants who are vulnerable and at risk of arrears who will \nhave \nthe opportunity to have direct payments to their landlords\n. However, \nwe \nrecommend that the DWP\n \naccept \nindividual referrals \nfrom housing associations as to whom should be placed\n on \ndirect payments from the outset\n,\n or when fall\ning\n into rent arrears\n before the arrears trigger comes into play and gives effect to this\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nI\nn autumn 2012, \n82% of associations expected the social \nsector \nsize criteria to result in a fall of rental income. Our snapshot survey of \n51\n associations suggests this has been born out, as by the end of June 2013, 71% of them were reporting that their rent arrears levels\n had gone up\n. \nT\nhis took place when Universal Credit had reached only a handful of tenants in the North West so could not be said to be a contributing factor. \nIn \nthe first three months to the end of June\n: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nThe \nfirst three months \ndoes not necessarily \nindicat\ne \nwhat might happen \nover \nthe \nlonger-\nt\nerm\n. \nSome households \nmay \nget deeper \ninto arrears as they find it difficult to make up the shortfall in their rent week after week, or because D\niscretionary Housing Payments \n(DHP) \nawarded for a short time c\nome \nto an end. Some households may find ways of meeting the extra call on their budgets, by cutting back on expenditure, or boosting their income, for example by taking in lodgers or increasing the number of hours they work. \nHowever\n, no\nt all\n of these options a\nre \nopen to \nevery household. \nT\nhe Local Government Association \nhas found that\n people’s ability to move or find work to mitigate the impact of welfare reform is constrained by local housing and job markets\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nThe impact on rent arrears may be limited by \npeople \ndownsizing\n, but landlords will suffer \na loss in \nrental income \nwhilst they wait for \nnew tenants \nto move in\nto empty properties. O\nn \naverage\n -\n before the social \nsector \nsize criteria came in\n -\n \nproperties remain\ned\n vacant for 14 \nd\nays\n. \nHowever, \nsome landlords are reporting that they \nare finding it difficult to \nle\nt\n larger family homes due to the social \nsector \nsize criteria\n,\n resulting not only in an extended \nperiod of \nrental \nincome \nloss\n, \nbut also a waste of a home that a family \nw\nould welcome. \n&#xa0;\n4              Impact of welfare reform on housing associations’ costs&#xa0;4.1\n              \nHousing associations are changing their rent collection and arrears management systems in the face of welfare reform and providing additional support for tenants\n. Both have \na cost. In autumn 2012\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nF\nor the 60 \nlargest associations (representing 49\n% \nof properties in the sector) the average predicted additional spend up to 2013 was £193,000\n. This is\n expected to rise to over £456,000 \nin \n2013-14. This suggests for just the largest associations taken together\n,\n \nthere \nwill be around\n £30 million \nof \nadditional costs in \nthe first year\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nS\nome of the costs of investing in new management systems and ways of working will be \ngreater\n \nin the earlier years. \nA\nssociations \nmay\n \nalso \nadjust the\nir\n expenditure plans upwards as the i\nmpact of the \nsocial \nsector \nsize criteria \nand new payment arrangements via Universal Credit unfold. \nWhile\n it is not possible to predict how \nthis will \npan out\n, \nit \nis safe to\n say \nthat this will take resources away from services and new homes delivery as illus\ntrated above in connection with increasing rent arrears levels.  \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nRecommendation: \nDWP agrees to\n \ndata sharing arrangements \nf\nor the housing association sector to ensure that arrangements are put in place to \nreduce fraud, errors and administrative costs.\n \nFor example\n, to ensure the \nDWP \nhas \ntimely \ninformation on changes in rent levels and that associations have information on who is moving onto Universal Credit and in and out of direct payment to their landlord\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nRecommendation: that the DWP work\ns\n in p\nartnership with housing associations, as well as local authorities, \nto put\n in place local support service frameworks to ensure claimants have ready access to financial inclusion and other services to support them through their claim \nas\n needed.  \n&#xa0;\n5              Supported housing&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nThe \nUniversal Credit rules and payment model is unsuitable for people living in short\n-\nterm supported housing\n,\n such as a homeless hostels\n. The \nGovernment is to make proposals for alternative arrangements for exempted \nsupported housing\n,\n having\n stress\ned \nit is not a cost \ncutting exercise. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nRecommendation: the \nsupported housing \ndefinition \nmust be fit for purpose to ensure that the right people are exempted from claiming housing costs through Universal Credit and directed towards the al\nternative system.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n3\n              \nRecommendation: any new system for determining support for housing costs for people in supported housing \nshould \nretain the principle of nationally set \nentitlement and be piloted\n.\n&#xa0;\n6              Impact of the social sector size criteria on people’s wellbeing and public services&#xa0;6.1\n              \nOn average, t\nhe social \nsector \nsize criteria will reduce the housing benefit payments of 660,000 people by \n£728 per year\n. \nMany\n individuals are\n already\n reporting that they are finding it extremely hard to cope with \nthe \ne\nffects\n. In their survey of\n social housing tenants in 2012\n Policis found:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nHaving to make up the social \nsector \nsize criteria shortfall in the rent and make contributions to council tax will add to financial pressures\n on\n households\n. Th\nis \nwill take \nits \ntoll on \npeople\n’s wellbeing \nand \ncould \nlead \nto greater demands on public services\n \nas \npeople\n: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nAn estimated\n 100,000 \nBritish \nhouseholds \nliving in social \nhousing \nwith aids and adaptations are also\n \naffected by the \nsocial \nsector \nsize criteria\n. It is likely that many of \nthem \nwould seek their re-provision if they had to mo\nve\n. Sometimes it will be possib\nle to move existing adaptation\ns. O\nn other occasions new ones will need to be specified and fitted to match the design of the new home. In either scenario there are costs involved \nincluding\n assessments by occupational therapists\n,\n the labour for removing or fitting the \naids and adaptatio\nns\n and \nthe costs of the equipment. Existing adaptations may become redundant \nif \nit is not appropriate for them to be moved, or left for the incoming tenant. This represents a waste of historical investment and an environmental cost. The costs of re-providi\nng aids and adaptations represents an extra demand on the disabled facility grant (DFG) budgets of local authorities who have duties to assess the needs of disabled people and to meet the costs of appropriate facilities irrespective of their tenure\n. \nThe a\nverage DFG award is £6,500\n. \nIn turn, this puts pressure on central government which allocates funding to local authorities for DFG. \nH\nousing associations \naim\n to offer people a move to a home which has been built, or already adapted for \ntheir \nneeds. However, because of the limited supply of smaller properties this is far from possible in many cases. \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nThe cost to the tax\n-\npa\ny\ner is not the only factor to consider. \nMany households affected will find it\n difficult to find a suitable property to move to, or may face additional stresses in trying to co-ordinate moving with the successful and timely re-provision of aids and adaptions. \nMany will have to choose\n between \nmaking up\n the shortfall in their rent\n whi\nch would\n \nreduce their weekly household budget\n, \nand\n moving to a less suitable property \nwhich would put\n limitations on going about their daily lives. \n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nGovernment spokespeople repeatedly refer to DHPs as ameliorating the effect of changes to housing bene\nfit, including the social \nsector \nsize criteria\n. D\nuring the passage of the Welfare Reform Act, Lord Freud allocated an additional £30 million to DHP for 2013/14 because of the \nsocial \nsector \nsize criteria\n,\n aimed at disabled people living in significantly adapted properties and foster carers. \nThe Government \nalso \nallocated an additional £35 million in year for 2013/14 to ameliorate the impact of the \nsocial \nsector \nsize criteria\n. \nThis is \npart of a wider allocat\nion for 2013/14 which is now up to £190 million against allocations for previous years of £20m. \nThough this falls well short of the £480 million savings \nin the first year \nthe DWP predicts tenants affected by the social \nsector \nsize criteria will make up in \nrental payments\n, it \nis still an additional cost to the tax payer. \nIn addition, \nan administrative error in the allocations to Scotland has resulted in the Government spending a further £800,000\n. \n&#xa0;\n6.6\n              \nIt is entirely possible that the Government will continue to allocate further funds to the DHP \npot \nas the \nimpacts unfold\n. However, individual household\ns\n can\nnot\n rely on DHP payments \nand \nlocal authorities have to make very difficult decisions on how to ratio\nn their pot \nover the\n year\n \nacross \npeople\n in \nproperties owned by private landlords, local authorities and housing associations. Federation research shows that only 21% of local authority DHP awards from April 2013 to end of June 2013 were for six months or \nlonger\n.\n&#xa0;\n7              Does the social sector size criteria meet its own policy objectives?&#xa0;\nImpact on savings7.1\n              \nThe Government claims that the social \nsector \nsize criteria will \nsave\n \nthe tax\n-\npayer \n£480 million\n \nin its first year\n.\n \nWhether or not this is realised depends on the extent to which people downsize into the more expensive private rented sector and who subsequently moves into their \nvacated \nhome. \nRiverside, Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and Wigan and \nLeigh Housing\n,\n with support fr\nom the Centre for Housing Policy University of York\n,\n have run their own data through the DWP’s \ncost \nimpact model and this suggests that the savings may be considerably less than \na\nssumed \nby the DWP. \nTheir modelling is based \non their \nobserved level of moves \nby tenants affected by the social \nsector \nsize criteria into the private rented sector\n. \nAnal\nysis from the Federation shows \nthat\n families under-occupying two bedroom homes who move to a one-bed flat in the private rented sector would end up claiming an aver\nage of £1,500 more per year in housing benefit – even though they’ll be living in smaller properties\n.\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe Government’s projected savings also \nfail to take into \naccount \nthe \nsubsequent\n costs to public services \nand the \ncosts incurred by landlords \nas \nexplored above\n. \n&#xa0;\nImpact on overcrowding and best use of stock&#xa0;7.3\n              \nThe social \nsector \nsize criteria \nis not a\nn effective\n way of tackling overcrowding given the geographical mismatch between households who are under-occupying and high levels of overcrowding\n. It is also not a good way of making the best use of \nthe \naffordable housing \nstock \ngiven the limited opportunities for people to move to smaller properties\n within the sector. \nFor example, a\nnalysis from the Federation shows: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n              \nRecommendation: the Government should \nrepeal\n the social \nsector \nsize criteria.  \n \n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.housing.org.uk/media/press-releases/majority-of-public-believe-bedroom-tax-should-be-abandoned\n \n I\nPPR, Backing ‘benefits to bricks’: our big cities need deal-wheeling housing powers, May 2013\n National Housing Federation submission to the Spen\nding Review 2015/16 available @ \nwww.housing.org.uk\n Impact of Welfare Reform on housing associations-2012 baseline report for the National Housing Federation, Ipsos MORI and University of Cambridge, 2013 Ipsos MORI\n 2012 Global Accounts of Housing Associations\n Ibid\n Quoted in Ibid\n Optimising welfare reform outcomes for social housing tenants-understanding the financial management issues for different tenants groups, Policis for the National Housing Federation, 2012.
