There may be other i\ndeas across all media that should be given a go too”.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“The hard question for the corporation is why in a digital age it should have the whole pie to itself forever – when doing something different m\night be better for the public good”.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nOfcom Communications Market Report 2013, figure 2.36 and 2.37 \n \nBBC audience research available at \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/consult/purpose_remits/audience_research.pdf\n \n BBC Trust service licence reviews of BBC One, Two and\n Four in \n2010 research showed \nthe \ngap \nbetween the\n audience expectation\n about\n and \nthe \nreality \nof\n distinctive programming as\n being \n \n-16\n (for BBC One)\n,  – 15\n (for BBC Two)\n \nand \n -8\n (BBC Four)\n. \nNB BBC Three was not reviewed as part of this assessment. \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/service_\nreviews/one_two_four/tv_services_interim.pdf\n \nSubsequent research commissioned for the BBC Trust showed continuing disparity \nhttp://d\nownloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/ara2011_12/distinctiveness.pdf\n \n   \nBBC Trust review of BBC One and BBC Two service licences (2010): \n“The clearest message audiences are sending us is that they want a more distinctive \nBBC One and BBC Two. The most significant gap between audience expectations and actual performance of BBC One and BBC Two arises in relation to their provision of programmes which ‘have lots of fresh and new ideas’\n.” \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“We believe BBC management should look\n to increase the variety and range of pre-watershed programming on BBC One in order to ensure the channel makes a greater contribution to delivering the BBC’s public purposes by being more distinctive in peak time”\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“The value for money of BBC One and BBC T\nwo could be improved by better meeting audiences’ expectations for more distinctive programming” \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“We expect to see tangible and measurable actions that aim to address audience expectations better. We will monitor the outcomes of these actions primarily th\nrough tracking whether audience perception that BBC One is delivering fresh and new ideas is improving”.\nPutting Quality First, Dec 2010, the Trust concluded: “\nwe would expect to see signs of improvement in audience perceptions by the end of 2011 and [we] \nwill consider at that point whether we need to ask for further action from the Executive to address audience concerns\n”\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Trust also said that ‘\ndistinctiveness is even more important in areas where there is a greater range of commercial competition… progr\namme and content commissioners should seek out distinctiveness – not just potential popularity\n”\nLord Patten, July 2011: “\nan important part of the BBC’s role is to take creative risks… and produce distinctive content that the market cannot\n”\nDavid Liddiment,\n June 2012: “\nWe will continue to press BBC One to ‘take creative risks and innovate’ and to ‘regularly broadcast programmes of large scale and ambition’ in line with its service licence commitments\n”\nJune 2012 the Trust assessed delivery against the service\n licence review requirements, and concluded that BBC’s One requirement to become more distinctive was simply ‘\nongoing\n’ \nLord Patten, Jan 2012: “\nFor several years now the Trust has been encouraging the BBC to be more 'distinctive' in its programming, partic\nularly on the big mainstream television services. That means tapping into the spirit of the outsider, the interrogator of received wisdom. Another way of putting this is: we should be prepared to live more dangerously\n”\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2013/tony-hall-vision.html\n \n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/strategic_review/interim_conc\nlusions.pdf\n http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/service_reviews/service_reviews_progress.pdf\n http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/howwework/accountability/audienceinformation/\n \nVarious, most recently including Tony H\nall article in the Financial Times, October 16 2013 ‘The BBC is a cornerstone of Britain’s creative industries’\n “Yentob predicts end of in-house quotas”, \n24 August 2013, Broadcast\n \nOffice for National Statistics\n \n58% of the public pick the BBC as the \none source they trust the most, followed by ITV on 14%.\n \nShare of references is Ofcom’s bespoke cross-media metric for measuring news consumption \n \nRoger Mosey article in The Times, 8 November 2013\n"
