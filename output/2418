default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default1) Executive Summarydefault&#xa0;
defaultCaerphilly County Borough Council consider the reform to welfare as a key priority and has developed a number of projects and activities providing support across a range of services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA brief description of activities that directly impact on tenants in bo
defaultth council properties and the private rented sector is provided. Some of the activities are at an early stage so their impact is difficult to assess, however, analysis of the support being carried out with council tenants affected by the social sector size
default criteria is indicating some positive outcomes which may be beneficial to share with other local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Authority has significant concerns about the on-going impacts of the reform and draw attention to the anticipated implications on the deliver
defaulty of its services.
default&#xa0;
default2) IntroductiondefaultCaerphilly County Borough Council (CCBC) is the 5
defaultth
default largest local authority in Wales with a growing population of around 178,800. 
defaultThe latest figures (April 2012-March 2013) indicate that the proportion of economically a
defaultctive people in the county borough is slightly above the Wales average but significantly lower than the GB average (Caerphilly 74.3%, Wales 73.8%, GB 77.1%). The proportion of people in the county borough claiming JSA is significantly higher than average (
defaultCaerphilly 4.7%, Wales 3.7%, GB 3.3%). Levels of deprivation in the county borough are higher than the Wales average over a range of indicators.
defaultThe wide-ranging changes introduced by the U.K. government to the welfare system have been seen as a priority b
defaulty CCBC from a very early stage. In response to the introduction of the Welfare Reform Act and Local Government Finance Bill, CCBC established a Welfare Reform Programme Board in July 2012. A core project delivery team is comprised of officers from all key 
defaultservice areas, including Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefits Section, Housing, Community Regeneration, Social Services, Supporting People, Customer Services, Education/Children and Young People Partnership.
defaultThe overall aim of the Programme is to ensur
defaulte that the Local Authority and its residents are adequately prepared for the impact of the Welfare Reform Act and the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. 
default&#xa0;
default2) defaultCaerphilly County Borough Council response to the welfare reformdefaultThe Programme Board has overseen the d
defaultevelopment of a number of projects and initiatives to support residents with the changes, details of some of these activities are outlined below;
default2.1 Social Sector Size Criteriadefault&#xa0;
defaultIn February 2012, local tenants voted for CCBC to remain as landlord for the 
defaultborough housing stock. The council currently manages 13,382 tenancies in 10,908 properties.
defaultThe latest data indicates that of the 2,741 social housing tenants in Caerphilly Borough affected by the social sector size criteria, 80% (2181) are council 
defaulttenants. Of these 78% are under occupying by one bedroom and the remaining 22% by two or more bedrooms.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn response to the Social Sector Size Criteria the authority c
defaultonsidered the most effective way of engaging with tenants who would be vulnerable to the 
defaultchanges. Based on knowledge of the tenants and experiences of staff it was considered that face-to-face contact was the most appropriate means of offering support. In September 2012 two
default Tenancy Support Officers (TSO) were appointed with an additional two b
defaulteing appointed in April 2013. The TSOs visit 
defaultcouncil tenants affected by the change and provide face-to-face assistance in the form of advice, signposting, referral and practical support.   
defaultThe tenants receive a wide spectrum of advice and support to help
default reduce monthly outgoings and to lessen the impact of loss of income experienced by the introduction of the 
defaultSocial Sector Size Criteria
default. The support also includes signposting and referral relevant to each tenant’s circumstances and includes:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe activities of the TSO’s will also be evaluated as part of the Universal Credit Local Authority Led Pilot that CCBC is running in partnership with DWP. The key impacts of the TSO visits has been three-fold; 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the TSO posts are only temporary and the need for additional follow- up visits has been identified. In the evolution of our activities it is emerging that achieving sustainable solutions may only be feasible in the long term with continuity defaultof support via repeat visits, which generate a significant resource issuedefault. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSupportdefault will also need to be extended to public and private sector tenants with the other welfare changes, which will in turn create additional pressure on existing budgetsdefault.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe local authority views budgeting and debt management as a major issue, especially with the introduction of Universal Credit. Providing independent financial advice and support will be essential to enable claimants to mana
defaultge their monthly income. 
defaultThe capacity to be able to manage budgets and debt has been seen by the local authority Rents Department as a key issue in supporting tenants to maintain their tenancy. Working in partnership with CAB, the 
defaultRents Department fund dedicated debt and budgeting clinics for tenants who are identified as being in debt and requiring support. The clinics are held in local council offices and generally have had a high attendance rate. Appointments are managed by the T
defaultSO’s with reminders being sent to the tenant, via text, the day before.  However, demand has increased to such an extent that bookings are now being made 6-8 weeks in advance and this is having an impact on attendance rates and the capacity of CAB to conti
defaultnue providing the level of support required at the current funding level.
default&#xa0;
defaultCCBC has recognised the need for a holistic approach to housing provision and supports the development of a vibrant private rented sector. A smal
defaultl-scale pilot has been developed in partnership with the Wales Co-operative Centre to target those private rented sector tenants who receive housing benefit 
defaultpayments by cheque (25) or whose payments are made direct to the landlord (500). The aim of the pil
defaultot is to develop and test a profiling/support assessment to identify the tenants support needs and signpost or refer them to the relevant service. The pilot will promote the use of Credit Union accounts to tenants who are financially excluded. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe result
defaults of this pilot are being collated but i
defaultnitial responses from a small number (&lt;40) of the participants indicate that significant numbers of participants require: 
defaulthousing advice, help with UC and benefits, require budgeting skills and support with mental he
defaultalth, physical health and learning difficulties.  It is also apparent that significant numbers require assistance with computer skills and IT access, had no broadband access and used prepayment meters for gas and electricity services. Many had also 
defaultused ov
defaulterdrafts, borrowed from family, applied for social funding and/or used ‘cash converter’ services to borrow money.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.3.1 Housing PathwaysdefaultCCBC has taken a proactive approach to early intervention in preventing hom
defaultelessness and has developed a ‘Housing Pathways’ project to ease the pressure on the council housing stock. A series of surgeries are held on a weekly basis around the borough for residents who may be at risk of becoming homeless.  Support is provided in i
defaultdentifying sources of funding  (eg DHP) which will assist in helping those at risk of becoming homeless. During the first 6 weeks of the project, 93 residents sought support resulting in 25 being housed in the private rented sector before they presented as
default homeless. Monitoring of the service is on-going.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.2 Social LettingdefaultThe local authority is also working with the owners of empty properties in the private sector to bring them back into use. There are approximately 900 properties across the borough 
defaultwhich are empty or under-used. The local authority is currently developing a business case to deliver a service as a ‘social letting agency’ on behalf of the owners. Grants may be provided to bring the properties up to standard and the local authority coul
defaultd manage the properties on the owners behalf. Engagement with tenants through this process could provide the opportunity to access additional support if identified (eg debt/financial advice). The local authority also propose to develop an  advice service f
defaultor private landlords which would provide independent guidance on a range of issues.
default2.4 Benefit CapdefaultIn Caerphilly, the latest information indicates that less than 50 households are in receipt of housing benefit and affected by the Benefit Cap. It is propos
defaulted to contact those affected, generally via the landlords’ tenancy support officers or a member of our housing department with the aim of offering effective support and guidance.
defaultAn information sharing agreement between housing benefit and social service d
defaultepartments has enabled the identification of vulnerable households who may require additional support due to the Benefit Cap and the Social Sector Size Criteria. The monitoring of the outcome of this agreement is on-going. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1 Generaldefault&#xa0;
defaultLocal Authorities are considered by its residents as the first point of contact for support across a range of service areas. The Welfare Reform is introducing changes that will have an impact and demand on services of a
default volume and nature that the Authority will not be resourced to support. The introduction of the reform is set against a general picture of cost saving and funding reduction which is increasing pressure on already stretched resources. The key impacts of the
default reforms are highlighted below;
default&#xa0;
default3.2 Funding &amp; Income Streamsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe nature and extent of the impact of the welfare changes will probably result in sustainable solutions not being able to be achieved for all in the short/medium term. The uncertainty of the l
defaultevel of funding beyond 2014/15 is therefore a significant concern. Specific concerns are highlighted below;
default&#xa0;
default3.2.1 Council Tax Reduction Scheme (CTRS)default – the Welsh Government has introduced an all Wales scheme and has funded the shortfall for 2013/14. There
default is still uncertainty regarding the funding for future years coupled with a lack of information on the medium term proposals for the scheme. As a background to this there is also uncertainty as to whether future funding for administration of the scheme wil
defaultl match the actual costs of administration. Currently over 26% of households in CCBC are in receipt of CTRS.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.2 Local Housing Allowance (LHA) default- The freezing of the LHA rates for the period 1
defaultst
default April 2012 to 31
defaultst
default March 2013 and the rates being up-rated 
defaulton an annual basis based upon CPI have resulted in a reduction of LHA in real terms. These changes mean that LHA rates no longer reflect local market rental and this may cause a widening of the gap between LHA rates and local private rental rates in the me
defaultdium/long term. Approximately 24% of the CCBC caseload for housing benefits is LHA related.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.3 The Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP)default - is a key aspect of financial support provided to residents. The DHP is used as a short term emergency measure to engage with residents to enable identification of what additional (financial and non-financial) support is needed to allow the resident to l
defaultive more independently. 
defaultIt is fundamental that when a DHP is awarded a sustainable longer term solution is found. It is imperative that claimants engage with appropriate support, that financial advice can be provided and if necessary, affordable accommodat
defaultion is sourced. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year CCBC made 
default284 awards with a total grant of just under £75k. This year to the end of August 820 awards have been made using half of the £292k allocated for this financial year. It is anticipated that there may well be an increase
default in the number of applications/awards during the remainder of the year, coupled with an increased pressure to permit an extension of current awards. This will be closely monitored over the next few months to establish what budget pressures this may create.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.4 Other funding sourcesdefault - Funding for other programmes which provide wider support to residents (eg Supporting People, Communities First) is also uncertain in the short/medium term.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.3 Council Housing Tenanciesdefault&#xa0;
defaultCaerphilly Council acknowledges th
defaulte extensive studies and implications of direct payments planned with the introduction of Universal Credit and shares concerns that rent arrears will increase as a result of direct payments to tenants. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe direct payment of housing costs will present a ne
defaultw financial management challenge for many tenants especially those who do not currently have a bank account or who have additional support needs. As well as financial inclusion issues, the introduction of Universal Credit will also highlight digital exclus
defaultion issues for many households who do not have access to the internet, or who do not have the digital or literacy skills required to utilise an on-line system. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite the work being done by the TSO’s (see 2.1 above) an increase in rent arrears has been 
defaultexperienced due to the implementation of the social sector size criteria and it is anticipated this will increase further under Universal Credit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.4 Housing Allocations Policydefault&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of the Social Sector Size Criteria, coupled with the introduction of Universal Credit, has forced changes to the allocation of council properties to those who are hom
defaulteless or at risk of becoming homeless. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is already an existing shortage of one and two bedroom properties within the authority and the forced push to downsize has resulted in less suitable emergency accommodation for vulnerable tenants. As a result,
default tenants are being placed in properties that they are under-occupying which exacerbates their existing problems.  The lack of suitable accommodation and the additional fees in the private rented sector (months rent in advance, bonds and agency fees) has al
defaultready resulted in an increase of placements in B&amp;Bs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe removal of payment direct to landlords under Universal Credit is likely to diminish the availability of properties in the private rented sector for residents who are claiming benefits. This in turn will increase the cost and subsequent pressure to the 
defaultlocal authority.
