"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Sir David Omand GCB [CT 06]&#xa0;Any review of the Pursue strand of the UK Counter-Terrorism strate\ngy CONTEST should start with\n \nthe \nunderlying logic\n of the strategy: the application of risk management t\no achieve the \naim\n of the strategy, maintaining conditions of normality.\n&#xa0;\nIt is important \nin assessing the \npast and current \neffectiveness of Pursue \nto see\n \nit as a means of managing\n,\n \nnot eliminati\nng\n,\n the\n risk\n \nfrom terrorism\n.  \nElimination of risk from terrorism, and \nfrom \nAQ associated groups speci\nfically, \nis most unlikely to be \nfeasible\n \nover the next 5 years (CONTEST originally had a \ntimespan\n of five years, that has been extended twice after review by successive governments)\n.  And attempts to achieve the\n \nabsolute \naim \nof eliminating terrorism \nwould undoubtedly have highly undesirable side effects on the liberties and freedoms and respect for human rights that we rightly prize as British values.\n&#xa0;\nIn constructing \nthe \nCONTEST \nstrategy \nafter\n \n9/11\n,\n w\ne saw the overall level of risk faced by the \npublic\n from \ninternational \nterrorism as the product of a number of factors: \n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0; \nthe likelihood of attack (to be reduced \nboth \nby the \nimmediate \nPursuit \ncampaign to uncover and disrupt\n terrorist networks \nwith a doubling of the capacity of the Security Service supported in increases in police and other intelligence effort, \nand by the \nlonger term \nPrevent campaign aimed at countering the radicalization of another generation of young violent extremists\n at home and abroad\n)\n;\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0; \nthe \nlevel of \nvulnerability of the nation to terrorism (to be reduced by the Protect campaign \nimproving security for\n aviation and the travelling public, crowded spaces and the critical national infrastructure)\n;\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0; \nthe \nsize of \nimpact of an attack\n,\n should (when) terrorists \nmanage to penetrate\n our \ndefences\n,\n \ntogether with\n the duration of the ensuing disruption to normal life (to be reduced by the Prepare campaign t\nhrough\n improv\ning\n emergency services \nand first responders \ncapability and build\ning\n resilience so as to enable the nation to bounce back \nas quickly as possible \nafter attack).  \n&#xa0;\nIt takes \na balance of \ninvestment in all 4 Ps\n \n(Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare) \nmaterially \nto \nreduce the \noverall \nrisk, and although Pursue is fundamental it is a part of a larger strategy (with interaction between the Ps, for example \ntaking care that\n over-vigorous Pursuit activities overseas \ndo\n not \nprejudice the efforts of Prevent in our towns and cities).\n \n&#xa0;\nThat \nunderlying \nrisk management logic remains\n,\n has stood the test of time\n and should be re-endorsed\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhen I \ndecided to launch\n work to construct CONTEST in October 2002 we \nwere unsure\n what should be the \nultimate \naim to which all those involved in \nthe UK \ncounter-terrorism\n effort\n, directly and indirectly, should bend their ef\nforts.  For the United States, \nsuffering from the aftermath of 9/11\n,\n the \noverriding \ngoal was \nto defeat terrorism and \n&#xa0;\n“use every tool available to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy their capacity to conduct acts of terror. The final element to the Defeat goal is an aggressive, offensive strategy to eliminate capabilities that allow terrorists to exist and operate - attacking their sanctuaries; leadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and finances”.\n  \n&#xa0;\nAfter much debate, we concluded\n on the other hand\n that\n whilst sharing that absolute determination to protect\n the public, for the UK the\n appropriate strategy should start from denying the terrori\nsts that which they most sought, namely the creation of conditions of insecurity and fear amongst the public.  The strategic aim of CONTEST \n– to reduce the risk in order to be able to maintain normality - \nhas remained \nconstant\n since then\n,\n \nfrom its acceptance as gove\nrnment strategy in 2003 to date\n. Formally: \n&#xa0;\n“The aim of CONTEST is to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.”\n&#xa0;\nThe caveats \n‘freely’ and ‘with confidence’ \nthat we added \nare, however, \nvery important \nespecially \nwhen it comes to the Pursue strand.\n  \n&#xa0;\nBy \n‘\nfreely\n’\n should mean\n without having to sacrifice the values and liberties of a free democratic society. \n \nFurther tuning of counter-terrorism powers in the light of experience and of shifts in the modus operandi of terrorist groups must be expected, such as has already happened with TPIMS, \nstop and search powers and reducing the length of time for which people can be held before charge for terrorist offences to 14 days.  But further \nchanges \nshould be at the margins, since the fundamental approach to \nUK \nCT legislation is sound in relation to the likely \ntrajectory of the threat over the next few years.\n  Improved miniaturisation and reliability of the relevant technologies may, however, make it \neasier\n remotely to monitor the whereabouts \nand communications \nof \ntagged convicted terrorist \noffenders \nreleased \non licence in the community\n, an issue that will increase in salience as more of those guilty of terrorism related offences come to the end of their terms of imprisonment.  \n \n&#xa0;\nThe caveat ‘with confidence’\n is also important.\n \nWe can see the nation enjoying national security when there is maintenance of trust in the ability of the authorities to enable normal life to continue, \nthat is, with \nan absence of fear of attack, with \nmarkets stable, inward investment\n flourishing\n, international travel safeguarded, overseas visitors a\nrriving and welcomed and so on.\n  \n&#xa0;\nBy th\ne\n fundamental standard \nof that aim the CONTEST strategy is\n succeed\ning\n, as was well demonstrated by the safe\n and secure\n Olympic Games last year\n.  \nI see no reason to \nalter the aim\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe success of Pursue (and equivalent efforts by allies \nand partners overseas) has been\n \nnot \nonly in disrupting networks in the UK and their links overseas (including a significant number of major plots that have been well reported\n in the media\n), but also making it much harder \nfor violent jihadists \nto operate in the UK without detection.  The effect has, as the Committee\n has recognised, been a\n shift \nin the UK \nfrom large-scale plots that require long term planning, organisation (including support from trained jihadists overseas) and finance \nto smaller, cruder local attacks.  \n \n&#xa0;\nIt should be b\norne in mind, however, that such a\n \nmutation\n \nin the threat \ncould quickly reverse if the pressure was taken off, and if jihadists were to regain the initiativ\ne in havens overseas such as \nYemen\n,\n and as \nal-\nShaba\nab\n threatens in\n Somalia.  \nThe \nAQ \nprinter cartridge plot \nout of Yemen \nuncovered at Luton airport showed how terrorists far afield can threaten our security.\n  It must also be remembered that an increased threat of individual acts of violence increases the \ndifficulty of the \ndemands on the intelligence and security services to forestall attacks whilst still avoiding oppressive and counter-productive surveillance of the community\n as a whole\n.  And as the aftermath of the Woolwich murder showed the authorities also need to be able to stifle provocations from the extreme right that could threaten to undermine harmony in our town and cities.. \n&#xa0;\nSuch developments in the terrorist threat will intensify the tension between nations that unilaterally defend their interests with military means - including by targeted killing and in \nfuture by offensive use of \ncyberspace – and those who seek collective security\n under international human\n rights \nlaw\n.  A current example is the use of international humanitarian law to justify \nlethal \nUS armed \nUAV\n attacks \noutside a recognised battle-space \non those regarded by their past \nor current \nhostile \nterrorist activity\n as having foregone their non-combatant immunity.  Other nations such as the UK will be seeking to defend themselves within the different legal construct of international human rights law, authorising lethal force only when hostile intent is actually being shown. We will see more examples of overlapping legal regimes operating in a single geographical space as nations try to protect their interests against terrorist and criminal movements in ungoverned spaces overseas. \nThe Committee will, I am sure, consider the ethically ambiguous position of the British public\n that has\n benefitted in that respect from the US armed UAV \nprogramme \nthat has removed several leading ter\nro\nrists who had been associated with plans to attack the UK and UK interests, measures that would not \nlegally \nbe permitted to the UK\n under the \noverseas part of the \nPursue strategy\n.\n&#xa0;\nTerrorists will also adapt \ntheir methods \nto minimise the risk of failure\n.  In\n the future the biggest change in the conflict environment may well be in cyberspace\n,\n given our increasing dependence on cyber systems and the connectivity provided already by 8 billion users of mobile devices\n,\n and this may \nmake it more likely that \nviolence\n is expressed against us \nfrom a safe distance lowering the risks to the attackers and lowering their threshold of violence.\n&#xa0;\nApplying the principle of \nsubsidiarity\n, security issues that can be handled locally should be: there is no need for the concept of national security to become unnecessarily centralised. \n \nPersonal security, in the sense of absence of fear in one’s home or workplace or when travelling, has traditionally been seen as a matter for local police services.  \nThese services, for example, play an important part in everyday preventive policing \nrelevant to the success of both\n the Pursue and \nthe Prevent stra\nnds,\n something that needs to be recognised by the new Policing and Crime Commissioners\n at a time when policing resources are under huge strain\n.  \n&#xa0;\nEspecially since 9/11\n, however, it has become increasingly clear that important aspects of personal security are now national policy issues, because they have international roots in the activities of terrorists\n that see themselves as sharing a global religious ideology.\n \n  T\nhere is \nthus \na continuing need for a \nstrong \nnational counter-terrorism strategy to direct and align efforts supported by effective \nnational \nintelligence and police capability\n working in harmony.\n  The recent transfer of policy responsibility for the subject of serious and organised crime within the Home Office to OSCT to sit alongside counter-terrorism policy is prudent, given that we may see increasing overlap, or at least links, between criminal and terrorist gangs and that will include issues such as countering terrorist financing and terrorist access to cyber hacking capabilities.\n  \nOne consequence of the spread of cyber attack capabilities is that no longer can the \ninternational community impose sanctions (such as the UN sanctions on Iran) and not expect the nation concerned to fight back with cyber means either directly or by proxies.  Another is that commercial companies overseas will find themselves the subject of cyber \nor other form of \nattack (for example after an environmental disaster or simply because they represent Western \n‘Crusader’ \ncapitalism).  It will be important that OSCT, with the agencies involved, look\ns\n broadly at how such hostile long term developments can be countered under a future Pursue strategy.\n&#xa0;\nDoes that also argue for transferring the responsibility for police leadership in counter-terrorism from the Metropolitan Police Service (the Met) to the National Crime Agency\n (NCA)\n?  \nOne of the great successes of the last decade for the UK has been the partnership between the police service and the intelligence and security community\n, and their relationship with the Crown Prosecution Service, something \nwith which that most nations struggle\n.  This \nfortunate position \nrests on established relations of trust between \ndifferent \norganisations that have, rightly, different powers\n,\n mandates\n and cultures\n.  That cooperation has been successfully tested in circumstances of terrorist attack and attempted attack\n, and in the successful conviction of terrorists in the Courts\n.  Of course, the present arrangements involving the Security Service and the Met and the other police services in England and Wales and Scotland are not the only possible ones\n, nor necessarily\n the most economical.  But they have evolved under fire and I would be very cautious about seeking to replace them with a theoretical structure that might look tidier on paper, such as giving the lead to the NCA, until we have seen both a significant diminution in the thre\nat and \nan NCA that has established itself firmly as being on the top of its game in relation to serious organised criminality. \n \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, given the serious counter-terrorist effort still required in the UK, I would see great advantage in an all party statement from \nthe Committee\n that the NCA \nshould\n be given at least 5 years to bed down before the topic of counter-terrorism \nresponsibility \nis reconsidered.  What would erode unity of purpose and divert valuable nervous energy from the Pursue CT mission would be for officers on all sides to feel uncertain about the structure and their place in it over the next few years.\n&#xa0;\nThe purpose of Pursue is to stop terrorist attacks in this country and against our interest overseas. This means detecting and investigating threats at the earliest possible stage\n and \ndisrupting terrorist activity before it can endanger the public and, wherever possible, prosecuting those responsible. \n The key to Pursue therefore is pre-emptive intelligence, soundly assessed.\n&#xa0;\nSuch intelligence can come from three sources: \nvolunteered from the community; accessed from intelligence sources, including traditional and new \nsecret sources\n (such as social media intelligence)\n; and acquired from overseas liaisons.  Although intelligence oversight is the province of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, the Home Affairs Committee may wish to reaffirm the importance of all three of the\nse\n avenues for accessing pre-emptive intelligence to allow terrorists to be identified, networks and attacks to be disrupted and those responsible for criminal acts brought to justice.  \n&#xa0;\nLooking ahead, it will be essential to an effective Pursuit campaign for the authorities to be able to continue to access and \nanalyse\n \nstored \ncommunications meta-data and thus \nuncover \nthe communications of terrorist suspects and their \nbackers and \nfinanciers\n, even when these are hidden in the \nvast global volumes of the \ninternet.  Following the \ncontroversy over revelations by\n Mr Snowden of details of the capabilities of the US and UK intelligence communities to achieve precisely that there is the danger that \nwell-meaning but \nexaggerated \nconcerns over privacy\n, international information sharing\n \nand the effectiveness of oversight will hinder \nthe \nfuture ability to track terrorists\n at home at abroad.  T\nhe Pursue effort\n would be seriously undermined by misguided efforts to rush in new European or national regulation\n or by failure by Parliament to keep up to date UK legislation on internet communications data\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is likewise\n important to Pursue that the \ndetailed \nsources \nand methods \nof intelligence \nwork \nand \nof \ninvestigations \nby police and Security Service do not become known to the terrorists themselves\n thus making their ambitions to harm us much easier to achieve\n.\n  The proceedings of relevant criminal and civil cases have already revealed much of how the security authorities operate, and \njudicial proceedings in this country \n- civil as well as criminal - \nmust be such as to be able to handle sensitive and secret material to \npre\nserve the interests of national security \nwhilst dispensing\n justice.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe spread of existing \nand developing \ntechnology will create dangers, for example with ever more sophisticated IEDs drawing on mobile phone and shaped charge technology, improvised communications networks being used by terrorists (as seen in the Mumbai attack), and improvised weapons systems where current conflicts already provide a reservoir of weapons, including surface to air missile systems as well as a training and hardening experience for British jihadists who are likely to seek to import their new skills into domestic ter\nr\norism. The protection of UK and Western interests overseas\n,\n such as in aviation, oil and extractive industries\n,\n may well be\ncome\n more difficult, as was seen in the attack earlier this year by a 30 strong armed AQIM jihadist group on the BP/Statoil natural gas facility\n at\n \nIn \nAmenas\n \nin south eastern Algeria\n near the Libyan border\n. \n&#xa0;\nAnother long term factor that should be considered when examining the future of the Pursue strand is that m\nost of the additional global population growth \nthat \nexperts predict\n \nwill end up in the overcrowded urban littoral of developing \nnations\n.  The capacity of these urban \nmega-cities\n will be greatly exceeded in terms of security, governance, and basic utilities such as water and sanitation. In the \nvast slums of \ncoastal urban sprawl will hide terrorists, religious fanatics, and violent criminal and pirate gangs with international connections to the West\n including in the UK\n.  Safeguarding \nUK and \nWestern interests and citizens, and when necessary organising rescue and evacuation\n,\n is likely to be a preoccupation of military \nand security \nplanners.  \n&#xa0;\nWhat will be very different \nin future \nis that all of these many hundreds of millions of people living on the margin will nevertheless be electronically interconnected by their mobile devices\n,\n \nexposed to ideologies hostile to us \nand aware of global events as they happen.  The implications \nfor counter-terrorism strategy and the Pursuit of ter\nr\norists \nwill be profound\n.\n \n There should therefore be no let up in the \nwork by HMG to co-operate\n with governments overseas and international organisations to improve global responses to terrorism at source whenever it appears.\n&#xa0;\nIt is the international dimension of our major security risks that drives the need for a redefinition of national security. \nThe increased vulnerability of advanced cyber-networked societies and reliance upon complex just in time global l\nogistic networks and\n product sourcing widens the boundary of everyday security.   Interdependent markets, global travel patterns and labour migration interacting with transnational terrorism and piracy all \ninternationalise\n domestic security concerns.  \nSuccess in counter-terrorism \ntherefore \ndepends on inte\nrnational collaboration\n including with countries whose legal outlook and respect for human rights differ from our own\n. \n That should not stop us standing up for our values, whilst\n \nencouraging and \nsupporting \nkey \npartners\n \nto \nbuild up \ntheir capacity to investigate and prosecute terrorists overseas\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProfessor Sir David \nOmand\n GCB\nWar Studies Department King’s College London\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;\n George W.
