"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSICPA UK\n [TOB\n19\n]\n&#xa0;\n1.    \nI am writing to you in order to contribute to the evidence which you are considering in the course of your inquiry into tobacco smuggling and the trade in illicit tobacco. In this letter we \nseek\n to explain\n how the \nUK\n \ncould make progress in combating the illicit trade in tobacco products and increase tax revenues\n \nthrough\n the application of the latest secure tracking and tracing technology. \n We stand ready to p\nrovide additional information as\n required.\n&#xa0;\nOur expertise                                     &#xa0;\n2.    \nSICPA is\n the\n leading\n internationa\nl provider of security inks to c\nentral banks and high security printers for the production of bank notes\n. SICPA is also a\n \nmajor independent supplier to governments of secure track and trace systems which can be used for supply chain control\n supporting the collection of excise and other taxes. \nThe compan\ny’\ns \nS\nICPATRACE\n® \nplatform is the basis for a number of successful national systems\n \nwhich have significantly raised tax revenues and reduced levels of fraud. Systems \ncovering a range of products \nhave been \nimplemented in a diverse rang\ne of countries across the globe \nincluding e.g. \nTurkey\n (since 2007\n),\n \nBrazil\n (since 200\n8)\n, the states of \nCalifornia\n and \nMassachusetts\n. \nCurrently \nalmost 8\n0bn \nunits of product\n are being marked \nand controlled \nby our systems annually. \nIn consequence\n the company has extensive firsthand experience \nof the daily problems faced by g\novernments and enforcement agencies \nin their efforts to combat the \nillici\nt trade in tobacco products and\n to \nmaximise t\nax revenue\n collected\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.    \nSince its inception and initial deployment the S\nICPATRACE\n®\n platform has been continually developed in order to broaden the range of solutions available\n \nto our government clients. Attention has also been given to ensuring\n minimal \ninterference with the activities of\n manufacturers and other stakeholders\n and \nto \nassure a level\n playing field for large and small manufacturers alike\n. The latest innovations and developments take full account of the requirements of the W\norld \nH\nealth \nO\nrganisation’s\n F\nramework \nC\nonvention on \nT\nobacco \nC\nontrol \n(WHO FCTC) \nincluding the provisions of the\n Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco products (IPT) \nadopted in late 2012 in Seoul and \nwhich re\nquires\n the introduction of a global tracking and tracing regime as a means of combating the illicit trade.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK&#xa0;\n4.    \nNo single system is likely to be able to completely\n eliminate the illicit trade in the \nUK\n given\n its\n different component parts, but \nSICPA believes that implementation of a\n \nGovernment controlled independent system exploiting secure authentication and tracing and tracking functionality \nw\nould have significant\n positive impact and should be part of a comprehensive approach.\n  \n&#xa0;\nIn summary t\nhis positive impact would result from:\n&#xa0;\nWhat is a secure track and trace system?&#xa0;5.    \nA secure track and trace system \nbegins by securely marking a unit of product (e.g. a pack of cigarettes) and\n assigning \nto \nit a unique identity which is stored in a government owned and controlled database\n.\n This can be done in such a way as to provide a \nfully reliable \ntest of authenticity and to be information rich (linked to data about e.g. product \ntype\n, time and place of manufacture, intended market of sale\n et al\n). The unique identity \nand the database are \nthe building block\ns\n of a tracking capability which allows the unit to be followed throughout the supply chain -\n if required \nup \nto \nthe point of sale to the consumer. \n \nThey also provide\n the means to tra\nce backwards \nin real-time \nto point of origin\n/manufacture\n \netc\n.\n \nat anytime during the product lifecycle.\n \nA properly secure system is essential to meet the challenge of ever more sophisticated organised crime groups.&#xa0;\nThe key components&#xa0;6.    \nThe \nquality of the marking system is key. \nMarks that are properly secure and well-designed\n to meet the needs of the different stakeholders\n, such as those recommended by SICPA, \nare easy to use, \nmake counterfeiting virtually impossible\n and provide information that enables enforcement\n. \nWe assess that the current \nUK\n protection system (which \nwe understand \ncombines a\nn easy-to-copy black ink \n‘\nUK\n tax paid’ mark combined with a material\n-based\n feature on the tear tape) to be \nrelatively \nweak. \nMoreover \nillicit cigarettes in \nh\nigh quality counterf\neited packaging are\n difficult \nfor enforcers \nto identify in real-time and need to be verified by manufacturers\n,\n which \ncan cause\n inconvenience and delay\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.    \nSICPA \nrecommends \na \nmulti-layered approach combining material-based security features (security inks which are both visible and invisible)\n,\n IT security features (2D secure matrix, visible and/or invisible)\n and \nforensic features.  \nSecure o\nvert features can be seen by consumers thus encouraging good citizenship; additional semi-covert features can be made available to e.g. retailers so they can protect themselves from unscrupulous suppliers; covert features can be verified by enforcers using bespoke checking equipment and used as evidence.\n&#xa0;\n8.    \nBoth domestically produced \n(including for export if required) \nand imported product can be marked\n,\n but by definition it is only possible to mark product which is produced in a\n declared/leg\nitimate manufacturing facility\n and/or\n legitimately imported\n. This does not mean (as some manuf\nacturers might claim) that the\n \nimplementation of such a system ha\ns \nno impact on the black and grey\n markets\n (where product moves between illegitimate and legitimate channels)\n. Illegal product (i.e. produced illegally such as ‘illicit whites’ or illegal by \nvirtue of being non-tax paid) would be\n immediately identifiable\n to all stakeholders\n by the absence of the appropriate secure mark. \nChecks by enforcers \n(linked back in real-time to the national database\n and able to share with and interact with other government databases\n) \nproduce data not only to answer the question ‘\nis this genuine or not\n?\n’ but \nto \nother \nenquiries such as\n ‘\nI\ns this supposed to be coming here\n?’\n \nand\n \n‘W\nhat\n tax\n has \nbeen paid\n?\n’\n \n \n&#xa0;\nBusiness intelligence&#xa0;9.    \nTechniques for e\nxploit\ning data are progressing every day\n and\n,\n as more data is collected over-time\n,\n become ever more powerful\n. Data analysis and automated comparison of different data sets can identify patterns and anomalies which allow enforcers to make interventions against targets that would otherwise not have been spotted\n and to identify changes in criminal behaviours. It also allows performance management of enforcer interventions (e.g. by locality or type) \nclarifying \nwhich \ninterventions \nworked best.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nInternational agreements&#xa0;10.    \nThe \nUK\n was an adopting party to the Protocol of the WHO \nFCTC\n to \n‘\nEliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco \nP\nroducts\n’\n in \nSeoul\n in November 2012. \nAs on so many topics where the \nUK\n has taken the lead, what the \nUK\n does in relation to the Protocol will be watched by other countries and followed by them.\n Much of the \nUK\n’s problem has its origin overseas\n (‘upstream’)\n and proper implementation in these countries would positively impact on the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\n11.    \nThe Protocol recognises the crucial \nglobal \ndimension of the illicit trade in tobacco products\n and the need to ensure international co-operation and joint working\n. Among the measures agreed is\n,\n in\n A\nrticle 8 of the Protocol\n,\n \nthe requirement to implement national track and trace systems which are globally inter-operable. The Protocol foresees a five year period after coming into force for compliant national systems to be in place. \nIn order to maximise value for money and longevity it \nis import\nant that any system foreseen in the \nUK\n take\ns\n full account of the \nprovisions\n of the Protocol\n, which includes the requirement that any system be \nfully controlled by government and independent of the tobacco manufacturers.\n \n&#xa0;\n12.    \nHaving followed the process of negotiation with care and adapted our R\nesearch\n and D\nevelopment\n programme to take account of it, we are conscious that i\nmplementing the spirit as well as the letter of the Protocol in an efficient way will not be a straight forward exercise e.g. it requires accurate aggregation (linking \na \nsingle unit to higher level packaging i\n.\ne\n.\n a pack of cigarettes to \nits carton\n, and a carton\n to its mastercase et al\n) which requires high-level technical and engineering expertise as well as advanced IT\n. In this area, as in others, SICPA is a patent holder.\n \n&#xa0;\nCommon approaches between Ireland and UK&#xa0;\n13.    \nThe Committee has specifically noted its interest in the interrelationship between \nIreland\n and the \nUK\n. \nIreland\n currently has a\n tax stamp \ncontaining security features \nbut no track and trace functionality. We believe \nthat in the absence of a decision in the \nUK\n to follow suit, \nthe implementation of standardised packaging in \nIreland\n is likely to have little short term impact\n \nin the \nUK\n.\n Irish tax pa\nid product (in contras\nt to tax paid product in some other EU countries) is at least as expensive as \nUK\n tax paid product and not attractive to illicit traders. It is possible that implementation of standardised packages may encourage a ris\ne in counterfeit product which imitates the standardised packs but this is likely to be essentially an Irish problem. These packs could be traded in \nNorth\nern\n Ireland\n and other parts of the \nUK\n, but they would be clearly identifiable as non-UK tax paid. In the longer term and in view of proximity, current smuggling routes and the WHO FCTC IPT requirements\n,\n there would however be advantage in ensuring joint or fully compatible implementati\non of compliant control systems in \nIreland\n and the \nUK\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of interests&#xa0;\n14.    \nSICPA is a private\nly owned\n company\n with its HQ in \nLausanne\n, \nSwitzerland\n and subsidiaries/joint ventures in 30 countries including the \nUK\n.
