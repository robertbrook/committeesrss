"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Summary &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInsurers are reporting an increase in non-standard medical reports for low value personal injury claims, leading to unnecessary costs and pressure on premiums Government can quickly help to reduce pressure on claims costs and premiums by setting medical reporting fees in the Civil Procedure Rules &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Raising the Small Claims Track limit is vital in helping to combat fraudulent personal injury claims and helping to reduce premiums further&#xa0;Predictable damages can support an increase in the Small Claims Track limit  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnder the current system, the medico-legal report will often provide little value assistance in determining the claim &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCash inducements must be banned for all stakeholders to help combat frivolous and exaggerated claims &#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe ABI is working with the claimant community to help provide access to fraud data &#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe current law on third party personal injury fraud inhibits insurers’ ability to combat exaggerated claims &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5\n&#xa0;\n \n The agreement allows for two rates of payment: Rate B is the standard rate; and Rate A is a discounted rate that factors in early payment (within 90 days). It is estimated by Medical Reporting Organisations (MROs) that around 75% of all medical reports pr\nepared in RTA and EL/PL cases valued at up to £15,000 are obtained via MROs who are signatories to the Agreement.\n \nhttp://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/other/third_party_capture.pdf\n&#xa0;\n See Lor\nd Justice Jackson’s Preliminary Report Ch. 27  \n"
