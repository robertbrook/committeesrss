"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Home Office [PCC Progress 0\n1\n]\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur reforms are \nworking\n.  We have put policing back in the hands of the public through directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners.  We have empowered local communities through our detailed crime maps and the success of Police.UK.  We have given Chief Constables greater operational independence by scrapping national targets.  We have improved productivity by scrapping\n centrally \nimposed \npaperwork\n.  We are shining a stronger light on police performance by making the Inspectorate of Constabulary more independent.  We are improving policing skills and the evidence base for what works through the new College of Policing.  We have made sure we reward skills\n,\n not just time served\n,\n through the Winsor reforms to pay and conditions.   We have established the National Crime Agency to lead the fight against serious and organised crime. We have delivered all of this whilst reducing budgets and cutting crime to the lowest levels since \nthe Crime Survey\n \nwas launched in 1981\n.\n \nPCCs represent one\n important\n aspect of \nthese\n ambitious reforms. \n&#xa0;The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area;&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is \nimperative under the new model that\n \nthe performance of \neach force is independent\nly assessed\n and the public have the information they need to hold their PCC and force to account\n.\n \nT\nhat is why \nthis Government\n ha\ns\n strengthened the independence of HMIC, \nwh\nich\n \nnow report\ns\n directly to Parliament\n and\n,\n \nfor the first time\n,\n is run by a Chief Inspector who has not served as a police officer. It is also \nwhy the Inspectorate will be \ndeveloping proposals that will allow members of the public to see – from a small number of easy-to-understand categories – whether their local force is performing well or badly when it comes to cutting crime and providing value for money.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGreater transparency in policing for the public \nwill continue to be \naided by \npolice.uk\n. \n \nSince its launch nearly three years ago, it has attracted 634 million hits from 58 million visits. And that demand has continued – the latest figures show an average of more than 8.8 million hits from 471,000 visits per month.\n \nCrime maps let people see what crime takes place where they live, how much of it is detected, what happens when the perpetrator is identified – and they let people compare how crime is dealt with locally compared to nearby communities.\n \n \nIt has recently been re-launched to \nsimplify the design, making it easier for the public to find the information they want. \n \nUsers can also now set up their own personalised crime maps which they can share with others, and register for email alerts informing them when crime data for their area is updated. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs t\nhe Home Secretary made clear during her “\nPCCs One Year On – Warts and All\n” speech at Policy Exchange on 7 November\n,\n the success of PCCs should be assessed against three criteria: \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe issue of holding Chief Constables to account is considered under the second specific item of your review, but it is important to note the success of PCCs in the first two tests that are set out above, namely on \nvisibility and on \ndriving innovation.\n&#xa0;\nVisibility&#xa0;6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPCCs have brought openness and transparency to their scrutiny role, in contrast to the invisible and unaccountable police authorities.  In Avon and Somerset, the PCC and the C\nhief \nC\nonstable\n have hosted joint community meetings, broadcasting the event live, and taking questions by email and Twitter\n,\n \nand in \n Sussex and Surrey\n PCCs\n webcast their monthly performance meetings with the Chief Constable.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is clear that this approach is bearing fruit.  Only seven per cent of people knew that they could go to their police authorities with concerns about policing and crime in their area.  \nIn contrast, 7 in 10 people know about police and crime commissioner\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic correspondence \nto\n \nPCCs has also increased markedly compared to that received by Police Authorities\n, with some PCCs’ offices reporting a 50 fold increase. \n \nSuch an increase is significant, showing that having strong local lead\ner\ns is bringing the public into the debates on how their local force is run. \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPCCs are also taking a local and active approach to ensuring the police are accessible to the public they serve.  In London, \nthe Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPA\nC\n)\n has set out a plan for increasing officer numbers while selling underused parts of the policing estate and replacing 65 front counters with 115 new contact points in libraries, supermarkets, hospitals and a post office.\n&#xa0;\n10.\n \nIn Kent, the PCC has rolled out a fleet of ‘Mobile Police Contact Points’ that will make 360 visits to 180 locations in the county each month.\n&#xa0;\n This allows members of the public in rural areas to report a crime or anti-social behaviour\n;\n meet their local PCSOs\n,\n \nand discuss any local policing issues or concerns they have.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n \nIn Dyfed-Powys, the PCC has worked with the Chief Constable to ensure all D\nyfed-\nP\nowys \nP\nolice\n \nstations now operate on a “\nwhen we’re in, we’re open\n” principle, reopening front desks. \n&#xa0;\nInnovation&#xa0;12.\n \nP\nCCs\n have spearheaded local innovation,\n they are\n harness\ning\n technology\n and\n increas\ning\n local capability and capacity\n to tackle crime\n.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n \nIn Cambridgeshire, the P\nCC\n launched a system to enable Neighbourhood Watch to become even more active in making communities safer.\n&#xa0;\n Neighbourhood Alert is \na \nlive \nsystem that\n allows messages to be targeted at street level to \nemail \nsubscribers.\n&#xa0;\n Neighbourhood Alert allows Neighbourhood Watch and the police to talk directly to the people th\ney need to, when they need to.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14.\n \nPCCs have \nalso \nmade use of the opportunities afforded by new technologies to tackle crime.  In Cheshire, the PCC has launched a mobile app that allows users to report drink drivers or incidents of domestic abuse straight to the Constabulary.  \n&#xa0;\n15.\n \nThe Gloucestershire PCC has helped to fund an innovative new mobile phone app that can be used to safely provide information on gang activity in Gloucester, allowing young people to talk directly to a multi-agency project team, who will provide support.\n&#xa0;\nPrioritising the front line&#xa0;16.\n \nAcross the country, PCCs are working to \nensure policing on the front line is \nprioritised\n. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n \nIn London, the Metropolitan Police is \ncurrently undertaking a comprehensive recruitment programme, aimed at recruiting 5000 new officers by 2015. \n&#xa0;\n18.\n \nIn Bedfordshire, in addition to plans for 80 new officers, the PCC has been working to deliver more policing volunteers and greater diversity in the force.  Volunteer applications from people from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds have gone up by a third since last November\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n19.\n \nIn Sussex, the PCC opened recruitment for 80 new police constables and 30 PCSOs. \n \nIn addition, 32 civilian response investigator roles have been created in order to release warranted officers onto the front line.  The PCC has also set out her plans to recruit 120 new Specials in 2014, \nwhile in Devon and Cornwall there are plans for 200 extra Specials.\n&#xa0;\n20.\n \nPCCs are visible and are engaging with the public, they are driving innovation and they are prioritising front line policing to ensure effective policing in each force area.\n&#xa0;\nThe role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account;&#xa0;\n21.\n \nSection 17 of the \nPolicing \nProtoc\no\nl\n Order 2011\n sets out the powers and duties held by PCCs to hold their Chief Constable to account.\n T\nhe relationship between the PCC and their Chief Constable should be constructive, but that does not mean they should always agree. Indeed, in holding Chiefs to account PCCs\n \nmust\n challenge, question and probe.\n \nT\nhe Protocol sets out\n that public accountability for the delivery and performance of policing is passed to the PCC \non behalf of the electorate\n. The PCC is accountable to the electorate, the Chief Constable to the PCC.\n&#xa0;\n22.\n \nThere are many examples of PCCs \npublically and robustly holding their Chief Constables to account\n. For instance\n,\n \nin February 2013\n, Kent PCC \nAnn Barnes, \nc\nall\ned\n in HMIC \nover her\n \nconcern\ns\n \nabout\n \npolice crime recording. \nThe \nresulting \nreport, published in June\n,\n showed that “\nappreciably more\n” needed to be done to ensure the people of Kent could have confidence in their recorded crime figures. The PCC \nwas outspoken following the findings of the report and challenged her force to improve, \nand \nMs Barnes has invited HMIC back to Kent to follow up their June report and indicate what progress has been made.\n \nThis demonstrates the power \nand level of scrutiny \na PCC can bring to bear on matters of absolutely central importance to issues such as confidence in the local police force.\n&#xa0;\n23.\n \nThis Committee has previously looked at the powers of PCCs to remove their Chief Constables\n and the\n Government ha\ns\n recently responded to that report.\n We have made clear that\n there are appropriate safeguards in place regarding the removal of Chief Constables, and that the Police and Crime Panels who scrutinise these decisions have the appropriate powers.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n \nU\nltimately\n,\n \nPCCs\n are public bodies\n.  I\nn exercising all their powers they must act reasonably and proportionately\n,\n and \nthey \nbenefit from statutory monitoring officers to advise them on these legal issues. As Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector recently stated in a speech on this issue: \nThe statutory scheme of local accountability established in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 is, on its face and, I believe, in its substance, a coherent and rational one.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n \nIt is for Police and Crime Panels, \nthe public and\n,\n if needed\n,\n the Courts\n,\n to decide \nwhether the\n powers of dismissal \nhave been used appropriately\n. \n \nIt is right that t\nhe \nability \nto appoint and to fire Chief Constables\n \nis defined\n in statute and exercised by the individual elected by the public to hold the Chief Constable to account\n. Th\ne\n power\n,\n and the willingness of PCCs to consider its use, forms a crucial element of how PCCs can hold their Chiefs to account\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n26.\n \nThere are many examples\n, un\nreported in the national media\n,\n of \nhow \nPCCs \nare \nholding Chiefs to account\n locally\n. For instance in Hampshire\n, Simon\n Hayes holds \na series of \n‘\nCOMPASS \nmeetings\n’\n \n(Commissioner’s Performance, Accountability, Scrutiny and Strategy meeting)\n. These\n \nbi-monthly meetings \nhave cover\ned\n a wide range of topics, \nwith \nm\nembers of the public invited to submit questions\n.\n \nF\nrom December\n,\n these will be public events held at various locations throughout the area to allow as many people as possible to attend\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n27.\n \nAlong similar line\ns,\n \nthe\n \nSussex PCC ha\ns started to\n \nstream\n meetings, such as \nher monthly \nPerformance and Accountability meetings\n with the Chief Constable\n, live over the web, making the process of scrut\niny transparent and accessible. \n&#xa0;\n28.\n \nIn London\n,\n the\n MOPAC Challenge is the principal mechanism through which \nMOPAC \nholds the Commissioner and his top team to account. \n Each month, t\nhe Mayor and the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime\n \nare joined by a board of representatives to help hold the Met Police commissioner to account and review issues across the criminal justice system. \nE\nxperts in the field are invited to explore different themes from across the spectrum of crime prevention, policing, and the re-entry of offenders into society.\n T\nhese meetings are held in public and broadcast live from City Hall. \n \nAll reports that go to the MOPAC Challenge and a transcript of proceedings are made available. \n \nThe meetings are also streamed on the web.\n&#xa0;\n29.\n \nPCCs have a clearly defined role in holding their Chief Constable to account, and there is strong evidence that they are taking this role seriously.\n&#xa0;The role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account;&#xa0;30.\n \nPolice and crime panels (PCPs) perform a scrutiny function for PCCs, providing both support and challenge to PCCs on the exercise of their functions, and acting as a critical friend.\n \nAs set out in the Policing Protocol Order 2011, the role of the Panel as underpinned in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act is to \nprovide: \nchecks and balances in relation to the performance of the PCC. The Panel does not scrutinise the Chief Constable – it scrutinises the PCC‘s exercise of their statutory functions\n. \n&#xa0;\n31.\n \nThe roles and responsibilities of th\no\nse \nin the new policing landscape are not only set out clearly in the Act\n and\n in the Protocol but also \nin the Accountability System Statement for Policing and Crime Reduction.\n This document also sets out other key responsibilities within the system, such as the role of the Home Office.\n&#xa0;\n32.\n \nPanels focus their attention on key strategic actions and decisions taken by the Commissioner including whether they have achieved the objectives set out in their Police and Crime Plan and Annual Report, and consulted appropriately with the public.\n&#xa0;\n33.\n \nTransparency \nis \nkey. Panels meet in public to ensur\ne\n information is available to the electorate so that they can hold their respective PCCs to account for their decisions. \n&#xa0;\n34.\n \nThe Home Office is confident that PCPs have the powers they need to hold Commissioners to account. \nThe powers and responsibilities of PCPs are set out in sections 28 to 30 and 32 to 33 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, and there is further relevant provision in Schedules 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 to the Act.\n \n&#xa0;\n35.\n \nPCPs also have the power to veto (with a two-thirds majority) the PCC’s proposed policing precept and the appointment of a chief constable.\n&#xa0;\n36.\n \nT\nhe Home Office produced guidance setting out all of the \ns\necondary \nl\negislation \nthat applies to PCPs and has issued guidance to sit alongside that legislation.\n The Local Government Association, in Association with the Centre for Public Scrutiny, have also produced guidance on the role and composition of PCPs.\n&#xa0;\n37.\n \nThe Panels have an important role to play in this process, and their powers are\n well defined and\n significant. \n&#xa0;\nThe division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011;&#xa0;38.\n \nGovernment’s \nintention has always been to give as much flexibility locally as possible. We have not wanted to unnecessarily influence or undermine local discussions and\n,\n as such\n,\n&#xa0;\nthe Government has been consistent in our view that initial plans for staff transfers under Stage 2 were decisions for PCCs and Chiefs to take locally. \nTo assist PCCs and Chiefs in drawing up these plans we \nset\n out three key principles \nand reiterated the policy intention behind stage 2.\n \nThe \nthree principles \nwe set out were\n:\n&#xa0;\n39.\n \nWe also specified that \nStage 2 \nplans should not jeopardise the implementation of the policing plan, or the strategic duties of the force. We were clear that the intention of the Government and of Parliament in making the Chief Constable an employer – which was that operational staff, as a minimum, should transfer to \nthe Chief Constable – is a key consideration and one which Stage 2 plans needed to take into account. \n&#xa0;\n40.\n \nWe are clear that, within the parameters set out by the above principles, it is right to offer PCCs and Chiefs the local flexibility to organise their staffing arrangements to best meet their local needs. Stage 2 plans have now been submitted and considered by the trade union organisations. As of 9 December 2013, the Home Secretary has approved the \nmajority of \nplans from PCCs and \nthe Department is\n in the process of reviewing the remainder. There is sufficient time to ensure that all transition plans will be in place in time for a smooth transfer of staff in time for the next financial year. \n&#xa0;\n41.\n \nWe have set out that an integrated Scheme of Governance should be prepared by the PCC, in consultation with the Chief Constable. The revised Financial Management Code of Practice provides clarity around the financial governance arrangements within the police in England and Wales. It sets out specifically the key elements of what should be included in an integrated Scheme. \n&#xa0;\n42.\n \nThe Stage 2 staff transfer scheme acknowledges the important divide between operat\nional policing and the role of\n&#xa0;\nthe PCC, whilst also allowing for variation to meet local needs. \n&#xa0;The role of commissioners in budget and precept setting;&#xa0;43.\n \nThe Home Secretary has protected the police from further Departmental budget reductions during the 2010 Spending Review period. In addition to excluding the police from any reductions relating to the 2011 announcement on pay restraint the Government decided to also protect the police from reductions announced to the Home Office budget in the Autumn Statement 2012. The Home Office is currently considering the implications of the latest Autumn Statement for the police alongside all Home Office budgets in the round. However, there is no question that the police will still have the resources to do their important work.\n&#xa0;\n44.\n \nThese are, undoubtedly, tough economic times, but over the past three years we have seen forces rising to the challenge and meeting local community needs and cutting crime whilst managing these difficult budgetary issues. \n&#xa0;\n45.\n \nPCCs have a vital role to play in this area but, again, it is not for \nGovernment \nto assess their relative success. HMIC review the success of forces and it is their \nPolicing in Austerity \nreport (July 2013)\n \nthat provides the evidence that forces are \nrising to the challenge\n \nand have plans in place to meet the financial challenge. The Report found that police forces are delivering savings whilst maintaining and improving services for the public: crime is falling; the proportion of officers on the \nfrontline is increasing \n(from 88.9% in March 2010 to 90.6% in March 2013) \nand victim satisfaction is up\n (84.6% of victims were satisfied with their overall experience in March 2013, compared to 82.2% in March 2010)\n.  \n&#xa0;\n46.\n \nPCCs are driving efficiencies across their forces. We have seen PCCs exploring partnerships with private companies, and focusing on better use of technology. In some instances we have seen old and costly \nbuildings\n being \nvacated\n \nin favour of co-locati\non between\n local fire services,\n police forces and/ or L\nocal Government,\n leading to a more effective, joined up, and efficient service.\n The HMIC Report shows there are opportunities to go even further through greater collaboration and improved digital working. The Government is supporting the police to do this, including by creating a £50 million\n a year\n \ninnovation fund \nfrom 2014/15 as well as a precursor fund of \n£20 million this year to\n enable them to press ahead with transformation in their forces.\n \n&#xa0;\n47.\n \nPCCs are driving efficiencies locally to \nmaintain effective policing.\n&#xa0;\nThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities;&#xa0;48.\n \nPromoting local policing needs is a central function of a PCC\n. PCCs are locally accountable, they have a duty to consult when drafting the Police and Crime Plan for their local area, including consulting victims of crime. \nReviewing the Police and Crime Plans highlights many common issues that affect communities throughout England and Wales, but many of these issues present differently in different locations\n, from sparsely populated \nrural communities to demographically diverse urban areas\n. \nThe role of PCCs is to ensure that the needs of their local communities are met\n.\n \nPCCs are engag\ning\n \nin innovative ways \nwith their communities\n to identify and promote\n local priorities. \n&#xa0;\n49.\n \nA number of PCCs have driven forward initiatives to tackle rural crime.  North Wales PCC \nWinston \nRoddick\n has \nestablished a plan that\n includes a Rural Crime Team of officers, police community support officers (PCSOs) and special constables\n. The teams\n provide a vital link between rural communit\nies and North \nWales Police, focu\nsing\n on issues such as theft of farming equipment and livestock. \n&#xa0;\n50.\n \nIn Suffolk, the PCC has introduced a dedicated team of Special Constables to work with Safer Neighbourhoods teams to tackle offenders who target farms and rural communities, as well as rural crime police officers who will focus on hare coursing.\n&#xa0;\n51.\n \nThames Valley PCC\n,\n Anthony Stansfeld\n,\n has also prioritised rural crime, with the introduction of the ‘Country Watch’ messaging system.  So far over 7,500 people have signed up to the system to receive crime alerts, witness appeals, galleries of wanted criminals or suspects, information on community groups, events or meetings and details of operational or proactive work going on in their area by email, text or telephone. \n&#xa0;\n52.\n \nIn Staffordshire, the PCC has \nintroduced\n \n‘Cars Behind Bars’ to address the problem of uninsured motorists across Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent.  The \nscheme uses automatic number plate recognition to identify uninsured vehicles, with over 700 vehicles seized in four months.\n&#xa0;\n53.\n \nPCCs are also addressing some of the challenges of policing in urban areas, including addressing the challenges posed by a vibrant night-time economy.  \nIn Northumbria, following the rape of a teenage girl, the PCC worked with partners to introduce vulnerability awareness training for all door staff working in the night time economy.  This \nhas been \nincorporated into the current mandatory Security Industry Authority developed training modules for door supervisors\n and is being delivered nationwide\n.\n&#xa0;\n54.\n \nIn Merseyside, Jane Kennedy has worked to increase the diversity of Merseyside Police, with a positive action Leadership Programme aimed at increasing recruitment of under-represented groups to the special constabulary and regular police force\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n55.\n \nEnsuring forces concentrate on local priorities is a \nkey\n challenge for PCCs\n \nan\nd those who do not sufficiently tackle local issues \nwill\n \nbe held to account at the ballot box.\n&#xa0;\nProgress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policing organisations and partners; &#xa0;\n56.\n \nSection 10 of t\nhe Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 placed a new duty on Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables to collaborate where it is in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.\n \n&#xa0;\n57.\n \nC\nhief Constables are also under a duty to have regard to the Strategic Policing Requirement, which \nsets out in statute the need for collective capabilities to meet national threats. \n&#xa0;\n58.\n \nPCCs are taking this task seriously and \nin their July 2013 publication \nPolicing in Austerity: Rising to the Challenge\n, HMIC said that “\nFollowing their election in November 2012, many PCCs have galvanised the agenda in their area or region, providing fresh impetus to collaboration\n.”\n&#xa0;\n59.\n \nWarwickshire and \nWest Mercia represent a good example\n of \nwhere the PCCs are playing an important part in leading \ncollaboration\n and ensuring momentum is maintained, all with the aim of ensuring savings are made and more resources are focused on the frontline\n.\n This \nimportant\n initiative, through which\n functions below Deputy Chief Constable in\n \nWarwickshire and West Mercia are now joint ones for the two forces\n,\n has achieved significant savings. According to \nHMIC\n, this alliance will allow \nWarwickshire and West Mercia\n \nto achieve 75 per cent and 94 per cent of their respective Spending Review savings by 2014/15.\n&#xa0;\n60.\n \nPCCs in the East Midlands (Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire) commissioned HMIC to conduct a review of their collaboration arrangements, which reported in October 2013. This commission demonstrates the willingness of PCCs to apply a high level of scrutiny and challenge ensuring value for money is achieved.\n&#xa0;\n61.\n \nIn stark contrast to \npolice authorities\n,\n \nPCCs are \nalready \nlooking \nbeyond the traditional options for reform \nand \nexploring what more ambitious, innovative and transformational options exist to make savings and improve services. Many are turning their attention to those outside the immediate policing family including\n other emergency services.  There is already innovative work taking place between PCCs, fire authorities and ambulance trusts and it’s clear that where the emergency services collaborate they can deliver efficiencies.\n&#xa0;\n62.\n \nIn Hampshire, the fire service, police force and the county council are joining up corporate services and expect to save around £4 million a year.  In Merseyside, the PCC, Jane Kennedy, signed the contract for the building work to begin on a joint police and fire command and control centre.  Matthew Grove, the PCC in Humberside, has made clear that he wants to see long term savings delivered from emergency services collaboration and is now working with the fire authority to achieve significant savings by developing a joint vehicle and equipment workshop.\n&#xa0;\n63.\n \nIn Surr\ney, the PCC and Chief Constable\n are leading the way with a full programme of collaboration between the police, fire and south east coast ambulance.  The collaboration will see the three services join forces to find ways of streamlining operations, sharing more premises and delivering joint safety campaigns, as well as looking to link up with Sussex’s emergency services.\n&#xa0;\n64.\n \nI\nn Northamptonshire, the Police and Crime Commissioner, with the support of the County Council, is \nleading work for\n \nmuch closer collaborative working between fire and police.\n&#xa0;\n65.\n \nGovernment supports this collaboration. As previously set out at Spending Round 2013, the Home Secretary agreed to establish a Police Innovation Fund from 2014/15 worth £50m per annum. The Police Innovation Fund has as one of its core objectives to incentivise collaboration and transformation and enable forces and PCCs to invest in innovative approaches with the potential to improve policing and deliver further efficiencies in the future. To enable PCCs to press ahead now with this transformational work, an additional £20m has been made available in this financial year as a Precursor Innovation Fund.\n&#xa0;\n66.\n \nCollaboration is an important method of increasing both the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, and we have seen examples of PCCs driving this important work.\n&#xa0;\nTransparency of and reporting by commissioners to date;&#xa0;\n67.\n \nThe Government expects high standards of transparency and has set out the information that PCCs must publish to support the public in effectively holding them to account. The requirements to publish this information are set out in the Elected Local Bodies Specified Information Order 2011.\n \n&#xa0;\n68.\n \nPCCs \nare \nalso \nlegally required\n \nto publish \na \nregister of interests, including every pecuniary interest or other paid interest; budgets; contracts and tenders; senior salaries; expenses; and key decisions.  \nThe role of Police and Crime Commissioner\ns\n is clearly set out in legislation and supporting statutory documents such as the Policing Protocol.  Expenses claimed by PCCs are reimbursement for costs incurred whilst undertaking these duties. By publically setting rates and requiring full publication of expenses quarterly the Government is ensuring PCCs will be fair and transparent in claiming expenses.\n&#xa0;\n69.\n \nThe local electorate will judge whether PCCs are making best use of public money and hold them to account at the ballot box.\n&#xa0;\n70.\n \nThe PCC must also publish an annual report which will set out performance against spending and provide the platform on which the police and crime panel can seek to challenge and support the PCC in developing their police and crime plan.\n&#xa0;\n71.\n \nIt is not \nt\nhe\n Government\n’s role\n \nto monitor compliance.  \nIt is for \nthe Chief Executive, \nas monitoring officer\n,\n to ensure that the PCC has complied with all legal duties.\n&#xa0;\n72.\n \nIn addition t\nhe \nP\nolice and \nC\nrime \nP\nanel is responsible for scrutinising the PCC\ns actions,\n which \nallows them to use their powers to examine \ntheir compliance with statutory duties.\n They themselves have powers as set out in the P\nolice Reform and Social Responsibility \nAct\n 2011\n to require information from the PCC, including requiring the PCC to attend to give evidence. \nT\nhe PCC as a public body is \nultimately \naccountable to the courts for meeting their statutory duties\n.\n&#xa0;\n73.\n \nOf equal significance is the \nPCC\n’s status\n \nas an elected body,\n accountable to the public at the ballot box\n. A\ns we have seen in a range of cases\n in the last year, the \nElected Local Bodies Specified \nInformation Order \n2011 \nis being used extensively by the media and the public, including this Committee to provide detailed \nscrutiny\n on what PCCs are spending.  The work of this committee is testament to the scrutiny applied to the use of public money in the new policing governance model; this is in stark contrast to the invisible and opaque world of \np\nolice \na\nuthorities. \n&#xa0;\n74.\n \nPCCs work in the full glare of public scrutiny, legislation clearly sets out the information they are required to publish and, ultimately PCCs can be held to account by the electorate.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\n75.\n \nPCCs have been in place a little over 12 months. In that short time they have become increasingly visible, actively seeking to engage with the public. They have set budgets and established Police and Crime Plans. They have introduced innovative policies to tackle local problems, and have publically held their Chief Constables to account.\n They have sought to introduce collaboration with other forces and with other providers, and they have driven efficiencies. \nL\nocal innovation backed by full public accountability is driving modern policing.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHome Office\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/117474/policing-protocol-order.pdf\n (paragraph 14 refers)\n Exercise of these scrutiny powers\n includes the following minimum steps:\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/hmcic-tom-winsor-john-harris-memorial-lecture.pdf\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accountability-system-statement-for-policing-and-crime-reduction\n These sections of the PRSR Act 2011 give PCPs strong powers to: \n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/117478/pcp-secondary-legislation.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=8f16dd65-7fde-4792-8578-fa955263931e&amp;groupId=10180\n \nUnder this Order, PCCs are required to publish the following information on their expenditure:\n&#xa0;\n"
