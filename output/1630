defaultIntroductiondefault2.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar and silica sand industries. With the recent addition of The British 
defaultPrecast Concrete Federation (BPCF) and the British Association of Reinforcement (BAR), it has a growing membership of 450 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membership is made up of the vast majority of independent SME companies 
defaultthroughout the UK, as well as the 9 major international and global companies. It covers 100% of GB cement production, 90% of aggregates production and 95% of asphalt and ready-mixed concrete production and 70% of precast concrete production. Each year the 
defaultindustry supplies £9 billion of materials and services to the £120 billion construction and other sectors. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is also one of the largest manufacturing sectors
default. 
default2.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis respons

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? default3.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default There are two potential CCS techniques that could be applic
defaultable for capturing CO
default2
default from cement manufacture: Post-Combustion Capture and Oxy-Combustion Capture. Pre-Combustion capture is disregarded on the basis that it would only address the fuel part of the CO
default2
default emission (only ~40% of the total emission from cement manufacture comes from fuel burning).
default3.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultPost combustion capture is an ‘end-of-pipe’ technology that has the advantage of being able to be retrofitted to existing plant if space allows.
default3.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultIt works by ‘scr
defaultubbing’ the exhaust gases with a solvent (most likely an amine), the solvent is then regenerated using steam and the high concentration CO
default2
default gas is compressed for transport. 
defaultThese technologies also have significant electricity
default 
defaultdemands. These demands are so 
defaultsignificant that additional power and steam requirements
default 
defaultwould probably need to
default be supplied by the addition of a
default Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant.
default3.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe key constraints for this option are: 
defaultSulphur dioxide (
defaultSO
default2
default)
default, 
defaultOxides of Nitr
defaulto
defaultgen (
defaultNOx
default)
default in the flue gas (potential interference with the 
defaultCO
default2
default 
defaultabsorption
default by the amine
default); space for the capture and compression equipment; availability of steam for amine regeneration. 
default3.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultAll the major technical issues could, potentially, be addressed using existing 
defaulttechnology but the main barrier to its application is the cost 
defaultof deploying these technologies.
default3.6.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe cost per tonne of CO
default2
default emissions avoided is substantially higher than using oxy-combustion, mainly due to the large capital costs of the Combined Heat and Power plant and the flue gas desulphurization, (FGD) plant.
default3.7.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultOxy-combustion CO
default2
default-capture is at an earlier stage of developme
defaultnt than post-combustion and its use would require the fundamental re-design of a cement plant.
default3.8.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultMany technical issues centre on burning the raw materials in an oxygen rich environment either in the 
defaultkiln 
defaultprecalciner or potentially in the kiln itself. Resear
defaultch on this and how product formation may be affected by high CO
default2
default concentrations is also needed.
default3.9.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultHowever, the predicted cost per tonne of CO
default2
default emissions avoided is about 40% of that for post-combustion capture.  
default3.10.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOther technologies such as 
defaultalgal biomass seq
defaultuestration
default are believed to have been investigated but the commercial viability is not expected ahead of the post-combustion and oxy-fuel technologies
default. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s defaultexpectations reasonable in this regard?default4.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Government is ambitious with its rhetoric around carbon capture but very unambitious with its support for the delivery of CCS, particularly in industry.
default4.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClimate change is very important to the cement industry 
defaultfor two key reasons; firstly, cement production releases carbon dioxide; and secondly, cement concrete products are needed to mitigate against climate change by producing thermally efficient high mass buildings and because cement concrete products will hel
defaultp society adapt to the effects of global warming e.g. drainage and flood defence.
default As such society will always need to consume cement and concrete. It is therefore important that the cement industry addresses its CO
default2
default footprint. MPA Cement is the 
defaultfirst 
defaultnatio
defaultnal cement association to outline its contribution to society’s decarbonation pathway to 2050.
default 
default4.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK cement industry has published its ‘Greenhouse gas strategy to 2050’
default. Outlining an ambitious target of -81%  GHG emissions  by 2050, against 1990, (the 
defaultKyoto Protocol baseline year), the UK cement industry has set out for the first time the actions they, and others, need to take to exceed the UK Government’s own -80% aim. Government support to assist and accelerate the delivery of this strategy is noticea
defaultbly absent and without such support the maximum ambition of an 81% decarbonisation of UK cement production by 2050 may not be delivered.
default The UK cement industry roadmap demonstrates that without CCS the decarbonisation by 2050 
defaultof 
default62%
default is all that could be po
defaultssible
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?default5.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK is already lagging behind other countries so the prospect of the UK being an ex
defaultporter of CCS technology in for example the cement industry is slim. The bulk of the research into CCS in the cement industry is taking place in Germany and due to 
defaultfinancial support from the Norwegian Government the Norwegians will have the first CCS pilot
default plant in the European cement industry
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? default6.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default defaultThe technical 
defaultchallenges of CCS in the cement are not insurmountable but the financial barriers are considerable.
default6.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default defaultExhaust gas from a cement kiln contains about 25% CO
default2
default – appreciably higher than in coal fired power generation (about 14%).  Although the concentration of 
defaultCO
default2
default in the exhaust gas makes cement CO
default2
default capture an attractive proposition when compared to power generation, economies of scale make it more expensive. A single 2GW coal fired power station emits approximately the same amount of CO
default2
default as the whole of the UK 
defaultcement industry.
default6.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default IEA GHG
default 
defaulthave estimated that a post-combustion capture fitted cement plant could cost around €558m (more than twice the cost of a non-CCS equivalent) but providing a potential emissions avoided efficiency  of 77%. An equivalent output oxy
default-combustion plant, however, could cost €327m (25% more expensive than the non-CCS plant) but at an emissions avoided rate of 52%.
default6.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultOperational costs are potentially considerable too; they double for the post-combustion option and increase by 25% for oxy-co
defaultmbustion compared to non-CCS plant.
default6.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultAlthough these costs make the oxy-combustion plant comparatively attractive it must be noted that oxy-combustion is at a much earlier stage of development compared to post combustion and for cement making it would radic
defaultally change the design and operation of the kiln.
default6.6.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
default              
defaultThe work of the British Geological Survey has improved the knowledge of potential storage sites around the UK but regulatory controls and legal liabilities are at the early stages of development. It is un
defaultlikely that the cement industry will get too involved in storage sites and will look to third parties for the development of this important part of the CCS chain.
default6.7.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe volumes of CO
default2
default generated by individual cement installations are too small to warrant dedicated pipelines connected to either potential off-shore or on-shore storage sites. Consequently, a strategic CO
default2
default pipeline infrastructure is needed for high volume emitters in the po
defaultwer generation sector with connection nodes for smaller industrial emitters. Such a project 
defaulthas to be centrally funded by Government
default. Until a strategic infrastructure pipeline network is in place this represents a significant barrier to CCS deployment in t
defaulthe non-generation sectors. 
default6.8.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Finally, industrial processes are much more vulnerable to the economic cycle than power generators that have a captive non-mobile market in the domestic sector where they are able to pass on the cost of CCS to the consumer with
defaultout much risk. Industrial operator output is influenced by the economic cycle, for example the UK cement market it around 35% lower than pre-recession levels and the sector does not have the ability to pass on the cost of CCS to its consumers. 
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre there adefaultny safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe? default7.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMPA does not envisage that the safety issues associated with carbon cap
defaultture in the cement industry would be any greater than in any other industrial or power CCS project. 
default7.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The UK has a good record of regulating industrial processes and CCS should be no different
default, although effort might be needed to gain public acceptance of C
defaultCS.
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? default8.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultAs outlined earlier the Norwegian Government has part funded a cement pilot plant in Brevik, Norway. The UK Government has been slow to develop industrial CCS in the UK and appears to have a preference for carrying out studies and holding workshops instead
default of formulating 
defaulta funding programme to 
defaultfacilitate
default the development 
defaultof industrial CCS in the UK.
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?default9.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultGovernment is correct to focus its early effort
defaults on the power generation sector but 
default defaultclusters of CCS that involve industry will only exist if we maintain our manufacturing industries in the UK and the Government support the crucial infrastructure development.
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCould the successful development of CCS impdefaultrove international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?default10.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK must play its part in addressing climate change 
defaultbut should not place costs on energy consumers that are not faced by competing nations. The power generation sector will pass on the costs of CCS to consumers, including its industrial consumers that are most vulnerable (in terms of carbon leakage) to the 
defaultprice increases. 
default&#xa0;default 
default10.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK CCS programme has to ensure that industrial consumers are shielded from the costs of CCS in power generation in the transition to a low carbon economy.
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives aredefault available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?default&#xa0;default11.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn its 2050 roadmap the UK cement industry has highlighted the importance of CCS. Even with 100% biomass fuels the UK cement industry will be a considerable CO
default2
default emitter because 60% of the total emission is 
default‘
defaultprocess emission
default’
default which is the CO
default2
default driven off from the 
defaultcalcium
default carbonate (CaCO
default3
default) 
defaultin the ‘calcination’ process to produce cement clinker.
default So without some method of capturing and utilising or storing this CO2 the industry will remain a significant emitter.
default11.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultf the UK fails or delays its CCS programme then other nations will take the initiative. Already, other European nations are better placed than the UK to decarbonise their cement production and if the UK is left behind we could in the future see the UK impo
defaultrting the essential ingredient it requires for concrete production, with the consequential job losses, reduced security of supply and increased transport emissions.
