[normal]Table 1 ‘Fundamental Weaknesses’ in the earlier HS2 economic appraisals[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Issue raised by Castles and Parish for 51M[bold]Has the identified issue been addressed in the updated economic case?[bold]Inappropriate do minimum
[normal]Yes – updated to take into account substantial commitments to enhance existing rail network
[normal]Inconsistent ‘base case’ used in HS2 and alternatives
[normal]Yes
[normal] – the same base case used throughout 
[normal]Alternatives not considered fully
[normal]Yes, multiple variants considered by Atkins and compared with HS2 using the same models and economic appraisal techniques
[normal]Out of date assumption on income elasticity of demand
[normal]Yes, updated
[normal]Use of over-long appraisal period 
[normal]Judgment call. The appraisal period used is consistent with HM Treasury Green Book guidance but with demand growth cut off three years after project opening. How can this be over-long?
[normal]Over-statement of crowding benefits
[normal]Yes, t
[normal]rain lengthening investments included in revised base case
[normal]Doubts over validity of reliability benefits
[normal]Yes. A lot of new evidence provided on the extent of train punctuality and its relationship with the intensity of network use
[normal]Incorrect value of time that does not reflect the productive use of time while travelling
[normal]Yes. Value of business time revised downwards sharply and shown to be consistent with preparedness to pay research that reflects the ability to work while travelling by train
[normal]Subsidy increase across the network unquantified
[normal]Yes and now evident that the operating cost of the network (and hence subsidy) is lower with HS2 than without it
[normal]Risk and uncertainty not taken into account
[normal]Yes, full probabilistic analysis of BCRs and in treatment of costs
[normal]High dependency on long term benefits
[normal]No. This is an inescapable feature of long term investments

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“While the [upgrade] packages are likely to be relatively future proof in relation to 
[normal]downside
[normal] risks (where lower demand can be accommodated through reduced crowding and de-scoping of some interventions), there is likely to be 
[normal]less scope to address higher demand growth
[normal], or continued growth beyond the ‘cap year’ (i.e. 2036). Given that, even on the basis of current demand forecasts, peak crowding levels are high, increases in demand would probably require additional capacity to be found.
[normal]There is scope within the existing packages, particularly for MML, ECML and Cross Country, to provide 
[normal]some
[normal] extra capacity through train lengthening but there is more limited scope to increase capacity through frequency enhancements without further considerable infrastructure investments. Discussions in 
[normal]this study did not identify any obvious further infrastructure investments which were likely to boost capacity and offer value for money
[normal].”

[normal]the commuter lines of
[normal] the West Coast Main Line so that 
[normal](i) 
[normal]the rebuilding of Euston can take place with less disruption and at lower overall cost
[normal] (ii) the economics of Crossrail can be improved (iii) better value can be obtained from the Old Oak Common interchange (iv) new possibilities for locating the Crossrail depot can be explored (v)the scope for regeneration at Old Oak Common can be increased.
