defaultTable 1 ‘Fundamental Weaknesses’ in the earlier HS2 economic appraisalsdefault&#xa0;defaultIssue raised by Castles and Parish for 51MdefaultHas the identified issue been addressed in the updated economic case?defaultInappropriate do minimum
defaultYes – updated to take into account substantial commitments to enhance existing rail network
defaultInconsistent ‘base case’ used in HS2 and alternatives
defaultYes
default – the same base case used throughout 
defaultAlternatives not considered fully
defaultYes, multiple variants considered by Atkins and compared with HS2 using the same models and economic appraisal techniques
defaultOut of date assumption on income elasticity of demand
defaultYes, updated
defaultUse of over-long appraisal period 
defaultJudgment call. The appraisal period used is consistent with HM Treasury Green Book guidance but with demand growth cut off three years after project opening. How can this be over-long?
defaultOver-statement of crowding benefits
defaultYes, t
defaultrain lengthening investments included in revised base case
defaultDoubts over validity of reliability benefits
defaultYes. A lot of new evidence provided on the extent of train punctuality and its relationship with the intensity of network use
defaultIncorrect value of time that does not reflect the productive use of time while travelling
defaultYes. Value of business time revised downwards sharply and shown to be consistent with preparedness to pay research that reflects the ability to work while travelling by train
defaultSubsidy increase across the network unquantified
defaultYes and now evident that the operating cost of the network (and hence subsidy) is lower with HS2 than without it
defaultRisk and uncertainty not taken into account
defaultYes, full probabilistic analysis of BCRs and in treatment of costs
defaultHigh dependency on long term benefits
defaultNo. This is an inescapable feature of long term investments

default“While the [upgrade] packages are likely to be relatively future proof in relation to 
defaultdownside
default risks (where lower demand can be accommodated through reduced crowding and de-scoping of some interventions), there is likely to be 
defaultless scope to address higher demand growth
default, or continued growth beyond the ‘cap year’ (i.e. 2036). Given that, even on the basis of current demand forecasts, peak crowding levels are high, increases in demand would probably require additional capacity to be found.
defaultThere is scope within the existing packages, particularly for MML, ECML and Cross Country, to provide 
defaultsome
default extra capacity through train lengthening but there is more limited scope to increase capacity through frequency enhancements without further considerable infrastructure investments. Discussions in 
defaultthis study did not identify any obvious further infrastructure investments which were likely to boost capacity and offer value for money
