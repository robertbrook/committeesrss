BRC29
[normal]Written Evidence Submitted by David Hodson (Senior)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I have the online recording of the House of Commons Communities and
[normal]Local Government hearing on building regulations applying to electrical installations
[normal]and repairs in dwellings, that was held on 2nd 
[normal]September, and am writing to
[normal]comment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am 64 years old and am currently working as a self employed electrician. I 
[normal]served my electrical/electronics apprenticeship in the Royal Corps of Signals
[normal]and have had a career in electronics ever since.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I semi reti
[normal]red in January 2010 but decided that I needed to carry on working until
[normal]at least I was 65. My chosen path was as an electrician. It turned out to be quite
[normal]an ordeal having to go back to college (albeit by correspondence
[normal]) and having to learn
[normal]all the regulat
[normal]ions that go with working with electricity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Having succeeded in gaining the relevant
[normal] qualifications
[normal] by September 2010, I had
[normal]then to join a 'competent
[normal] persons' scheme' in order to work on 'notifiable' 
[normal]installations. But which one? This was a question a
[normal]sked by one of the select 
[normal]committee members and none of the four in the 'dock' seemed to be able to 
[normal]give a straight answer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As an outsider and very ignorant of the industry, I chose NAPIT. It could well have
[normal]been any other but their fees seemed to be mi
[normal]d-range.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The choice should not have been there. There should be only one scheme that 
[normal]promotes the raising of standards by those working in the industry at the same
[normal]time raising the general awareness of the public and one 'flag' under which we all sail.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I get most of my work by advertising in the local press. I do subscribe to other marketing
[normal]websites (both of which were mentioned in committee) but these bring in very little work.
[normal]So I always ask my customers why they chose my ad over the others and it's 
[normal]usually
[normal]because it stands out. Nothing to do with part P, NAPIT or NICEIC. The public just
[normal]do not know. They all know about CORGI though and GasSafe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I don't really care what the flag is. Electric Safe or Electrical Safety. But there should only
[normal]be one.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please bang their heads together and make them work together, although I think they 
[normal]will try to put as many obstacles
[normal] in the way as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A very easy solution is to put the control into the Local Authority Building Control, just 
[normal]as we have done for 
[normal]personal licences in the liquor trade, and issue a similar licence to
[normal]operate. No licence, no work.
