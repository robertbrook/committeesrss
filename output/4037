[normal]Community Payback[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In relation to your questions about Serco’s contract to deliver the Community Payback Scheme in London we can confirm that Serco’s performance has been improving month on month since the contract began in October. They are now meeting most of the key targets and out-performing the national average for Probation Trusts on key measures such as enforcement, successful completions and commencement within 7 days.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Serco report their performance to the Department monthly and are held to account during regular contract review meetings. The Community Payback contract with Serco is not a Payment by Results contract and therefore specific data related to the contract and reconviction rates are not collected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, you might find the following information about the performance of London Probation Trust useful. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]London Probation Trust achieved a Level 3 overall rating (“Good Performance”) in the Probation Trust Rating System in 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Local Adult Reoffending Rate, corresponding to periods between January 2010 and March 2013, has been lower than predicted for each period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The most recent annual figures for 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 show an actual rate of reoffending of 
[normal]7.74%[bold] against a predicted rate of reoffending of 
[normal]8.64%.[bold] The predicted rate is the proportion of offenders the Department would expect to re-offend given the known characteristics of the offenders in the snapshot and re-offending rates in the baseline period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The latest published proven re-offending figures for London probation trust show a one year re-offending rate of 32.7% for those starting a court order in 2011; this was significantly lower than the predicted rate of 34.4%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The re-offending rates based on the local adult measure are considerably lower than the headline proven re-offending rates as they use a much shorter follow up period of three months compared to the full 12 months used by the headline re-offending measure.
[normal] 
[normal]The local adult re-offending measure is a performance indicator for Trusts and takes a snapshot of offenders under Probation Service supervision every three months and looks at their re-offending over a three month follow-up period, whereas
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the proven re-offending statistics look at re-offending over a 12 month follow-up period for offenders starting a court order.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Information on performance during the current financial year (2013/14) is scheduled for publication in July 2014 and therefore can only be released externally once this publication has occurred.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is in line with NOMS’ data release principles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Programme Costs, Establishing the National Probation Service and future Contract Management[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Rehabilitation Programme has brought together staff from different teams across the Department to deliver the reforms set out in the Transforming Rehabilitation Strategy. The Programme is a good example of how the skills, experience and knowledge of different teams across the Department can be brought together to deliver a complex programme and can be allocated to ensure a priority policy area is successfully and safely delivered. The cost of the Programme is being met from the Department's current budget. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In relation to your questions about the projected running costs of the National Probation Service and the future costs for managing contracts, as was covered at the session on 26 November the Department are currently going through the allocations process for the next financial year. However, we anticipate that the running costs of the NPS will be c. 400m per annum. The costs to NOMS of managing future contracts will be cost neutral. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Estates[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We can confirm that the current annual budget for properties that make up the public probation estate is £91.8m (including depreciation). When the new Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) and National Probation Service (NPS) are created, staff will all remain in the properties within which they currently work. It is expected that in many cases this will mean properties are shared between the NPS and CRCs. As now, properties will remain the responsibility of MoJ Estate Directorate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the longer term, future arrangements will depend on the operating models of the future CRC owners as selected through the competition, and because of the exact cost of exiting properties is currently unknown.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Furthermore, the exact detail of how property will be offered to the CRCs through the competition is still being determined and therefore, for commercial reasons, we are unable to release figures relating to the Department ceasing to use them. We anticipate that, to aid transition, CRCs will be provided with (and be required to pay for) space in the existing MoJ probation properties until the end of December 2015. The charge will cover all day to day property running costs, such as rent, utilities, Facilities Management services and also property ownership costs incurred by MoJ, such as maintenance, insurance and depreciation and that these arrangements will be incorporated into the contract with the new owners of the CRCs following competition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Resettlement Services[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As you are aware, in support of the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms, NOMS is realigning the prison estate, designating a small number of resettlement prisons for each CRC area, which will release the vast majority of offenders to that area. CRCs will work in resettlement prisons in their Contract Package Area (CPA), delivering a resettlement service for every offender before release (including for offenders who will be managed by the NPS). This will provide them with the opportunity to engage with the offenders they will manage before release, both in the course of providing the resettlement service and to provide additional “through the gate” rehabilitation support to those offenders if they wish to do so. Prisons will facilitate this engagement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a consequence of the way that prisons are allocated their budgets and are able to allocate some of their resources autonomously, a central figure covering the cost of resettlement services across the prison estate is not held. Prisons currently hold a number of contracts which cover resettlement services that in the future will be provided by CRCs. The current contracts are for a variety of geographical areas, lengths and services and therefore do not necessarily reflect the resettlement services that will be provided under the new system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Voluntary Redundancy[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As was discussed during the meeting last Tuesday, as a consequence of there not being full endorsement of the Staff Transfer and Protection Agreement we were unable to offer the element of the deal to harmonise the terms for Voluntary Redundancy for staff at 67.5 weeks (honouring the terms in place for a trust which has a scheme in place which exceed this). Furthermore, we were willing to write the agreement on enhanced Voluntary Redundancy terms into the commercial contracts as part of the share sale. However, Voluntary Redundancy terms are a matter which require collective agreement and without this it is not possible to provide the enhanced Voluntary Redundancy terms we had initially planned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, the Ministry of Justice has budgeted for the funding of any redundancy package should this position change. These costs will be met within the context of the MoJ commitment to deliver annual savings of over £2 billion by 2014/15.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The amount the redundancy scheme will ultimately cost depends on the staffing profiles of Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) once ownership of them has passed to the private or voluntary providers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Projected profiles will be set out in the potential providers’ bids and a cost attached to them. They will be refined between then and award of contract.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The staffing profiles need to reflect the way in which bidders intend to deliver rehabilitation services in each CRC, and to release the amount of funding set aside for the redundancy scheme now may well adversely affect the Department’s bargaining position during contractual negotiations by giving potential providers a misleading indication of the number of redundancies the Department anticipates CRCs will make, for this reason we are unable to provide you with the figure at this time. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Trust Transition Costs[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Programme has allocated up to 3.9m in 13/14 and 1.25m in 14/15 to fund additional costs incurred by Trusts in undertaking essential transition activity, the Department has agreed to meet all reasonable costs in order to support Trusts to prepare for the move to the new system. Where a Trust is projecting an under spend for 13/14 we expect transition costs to be met initially from that under spend, and we currently anticipate that we will not use the majority of the money we have allocated for this purpose. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ICT[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Department’s current ICT infrastructure will be modified to support the sharing of information with a number of different providers, taking into account the data requirements to deliver the service, and any data security implications. National Delius (nDelius) will be used as the case management tool by the NPS. It is intended that this application will be used as the central repository for information about all offenders who will be subject to supervision in the community. CRCs will therefore be required to keep the nDelius database updated and work is underway to establish the dataset that all providers will be required to maintain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prison NOMIS is the central data repository for all offenders in custody. Changes are also being made to this application, such as enabling licences and top-up supervision to be allocated to a CRC as well as the NPS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NPS and prison service providers will use OASys as its risk assessment and sentence planning tool. CRCs will be responsible for carrying out their own risk assessments and planning and can use their own tool or OASys, which will be made available to them. There will be limited changes to the OASys application, mainly to ensure information is captured within the basic custody screening as well as to make any changes that are required as a result of new legislation, and which support a more efficient and user-friendly tool.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given that we will be engaging the services of external providers to make some of these changes we are unable, due to some of the commercial sensitivities, currently to provide you with the costs associated with these changes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Potential wider impacts of the extension of statutory supervision [bold]We have published an assessment of the costs and impacts of our intended legislation alongside the Offender Rehabilitation Bill. This Assessment can be found here: 
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/199804/offender-rehabilitation-bill-impact-assessment.pdf
[normal]We have estimated that there could be a cost of around £25m per year associated with breach of licence and supervision conditions for short sentenced offenders. There may be an additional burden to the police from extending supervision in the community to offenders released from custodial sentences of less than 12 months, as police time will be needed to deal with offenders who fail to comply with the conditions of supervision. Our initial estimate is that this could cost up to £5m per year. The Impact Assessment also contains an assessment of extending drug testing to Class B drugs and requiring offenders to attend drug treatment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope that this information will be useful to you and your Committee colleagues in further understanding some of the details of the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme.
