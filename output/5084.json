"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by\n \nthe Alliance for Middle East Peace\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary:\n              \nThe \nAlliance\n for Middle East Peace\n (ALLMEP)\n, a \nUnited States\n charitable organization, comprised of grassroots peacebuilding\n nongovernmental organizations\n \n(\nNGOs\n)\n in \nIsrael\n and the \nPalestinian\n \nTerritories\n, urges this Committee to: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nALLMEP also\n urges\n:\n&#xa0;\n \nand stands ready to assist the Committee to these ends.\nWritten Evidence Submitted by the Alliance for Middle East Peace&#xa0;\nTo the International Development Committee\n:\n1) \n              \n              \nThank you for the opportunity to present evidence regarding Britain’s spending in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  This is an important inquiry at a pivotal moment in the quest for a final status agreement, hopefully resolving decades of confl\nict in the region.  The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) lauds the Committee for its effort; seeks to encourage the Committee to recommend dramatically enhanced funding for people-to-people (P2P) projects in the region that demonstrably lay the grou\nndwork for any sustainable peace; and encourages visits of high-level officials to those projects at the earliest \npossible \ntime. \n2) \n              \n              \nIt is our understanding that the goal of the British government is a “prosperous Middle East with a sovereign and viable \nPalestinian State living in peace alongside a secure \nIsrael\n…” and that “\nr\nesolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a \nUK\n priority.”  To this end, the \nUK\n expends approximately \n£\n90 million annually (approximately \nUS\n \n$\n54.6 million) in \nIsrael\n and the Palesti\nnian territories, with the vast majority (\n£\n86 million) dedicated to \nPalestine\n economic development through the Department for International Development (DfID)\n.  N\none \nof these funds support\n \npeople-to-people\n \nactivities\n, \nand o\nnly \n£\n4 million (US $6 million) \ngoes\n to both Israel and the Palestinian territories through the \ninterdepartmental \nConflict Pool.  Although the majority of the Conflict Pool\n funds\n go to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs, only one of the thirteen projects currently\n being\n funded (\nALLMEP member \nP\neres Center/Palestinian Red Crescent) brings Israelis and Palestinians together in cooperative activities.\n It is this disparity that ALLMEP seeks to address.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3)\n              \n              \nALLMEP recommends:\n&#xa0;\nThe Alliance for Middle East Peace\n4\n) \n              \n              \nThe \nAlliance\n for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP), a \nUnited States\n charitable organization, is a grassroots consortium of some 80 NGOs conducting \npeople-to-people (\nP2P\n)\n coexistence, reconciliation, and cooperative activities among Israelis and Palestinians, Arab\ns and Jews in the region.\n \n \nServing thousands of Israelis and Palestinians, these organizations daily lay the foundation for \nany \nsustainable peace in the region, striving through their programs both to solve intractable problems and to produce the behaviora\nl shifts essential to attitudinal change.  Their work is critical, \nyet\n \ndramatically under-resourced.  ALLMEP's mission is to foster its members' efforts and efficacy by working, primarily in the United States, to increase funding and support for these proj\nects from the public and private sectors and to raise the successful profile of peacebuilding activities both as an essential ingredient of the peace process and as a counterpoint to violence and conflict.\n \n T\noday, this robust, growing coalition is connecti\nng true peacebuilders to the policymakers, to the public, and to the press. \n5\n) \n              \n              \nThrough an annual \nUS\n Congressional appropriation – ALLMEP's signature accomplishment to date – \nmore than $60 million in United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding expressly for people-to-people peacebuilding programs has flowed to the region. \n \nNot only is ALLMEP the \nonly\n advocate for this crucial US funding, but we have become the acknowledged “go-to” resource for both USAID and our members regarding this critical “track II diplomacy.”  \n6\n) \n              \n              \nALLMEP is currently seeking to initiat\ne\n an even more potent mechanism for dramat\nically enhanced funding for \npeople-to-people\n \nactivities: an \nInternational Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace.  Building on the enormous success of the annual \nUS\n Congressional appropriation, ALLMEP has, for some time, been in negotiation\n \nwith the Israeli go\nvernment and Palestinian Authority, the US Administration and Congress, the United Nations, the European Union, and numerous Arab governments as well as potential private donors\n for the creation of the International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace\n.  \nThe\n proposed International Fund would be modeled on the\n \nhugely-successful \nInternational Fund for Ireland\n, founded in 1986, which\n provided billions\n of dollars\n to people-to-people \npeacebuilding efforts in \nNorthern Ireland.  W\nith the resumption of peace talks \nlast summer, the proposed Fund has garnered significant traction:  we expect introduction of a bipartisan authorizing bill in the US Congress within weeks.  T\nhe Fund i\ns integral to and intertwined with the success of \n“\ntrack I\n”\n diplomatic efforts, permittin\ng a dramatic scaling up of successful P2P programs/efforts.  \nUS \n$200 million is the Year I target\n, with \n$50 million to come from the \nUS\n.  To the extent that the \nCommons Select \nCommittee is investigating whether the modest influx of British Conflict Pool Fu\nnds (only minimally committe\nd to P2P work) is sufficient, ALLMEP\n respectfully submit\ns\n that the Committee consider \nBritain’s \nactive participation in this proposed International Fund.\n&#xa0;\nThe significance of \npeople-to-people (P2P)\n \nprojects\n7\n) \n              \n              \nS\nince 2004, with\n ALLMEP’s energetic advocacy\n, the US Congress has provided funding through its foreign assistance program\n for worldwide “people-to-people reconciliation programs which bring together individuals of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds from\n areas of strife and war…\n \n[including] such programs in the Middle East.”\n  \nTo date, these USAID Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) \nf\nunds have\n provided direct support through competitive grants for innovative people-to-people conflict mitigation and re\nconciliation programs in at least 36 countries, including those in the \nMiddle \nEast\n.  So su\nccessful have these grants been\n that\n,\n since \nFY \n2008\n,\n a dedicated component of the global fund has been reserved for programs in Israel and the Palestinian \nterritories\n,\n thus ensuring key funding for Middle East projects vital to stabilizing the region, while preserving funding for other conflict areas.  \nSince FY 2010, Congress has provided \nUS \n$10 million annually \n(\n£\n6 million) to this end.\n \n \nUSAID manages the Middle East \nreconciliation grant program through its Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM). \n \nNGOs apply directly to USAID for grants and USAID distributes the funds through a competitive process.  These grants\n “\nprovide opportunities for adversaries to com\ne together to address issues, reconcile differences, and gain understanding and mutual trust by working toward common goals.”\n \n8\n) \n              \n              \nALLMEP m\nember organizations\n, competitors for and recipients of the USAID CMM grants\n, \nare on the front lines of the \nMiddle\n East\n conflict.  \nThese organizations turn the challenges of daily life into opportunities for cooperation and\n,\n in so doing\n,\n lay the groundwork for \nany\n sustainable peace\n. \n \nEvery day, they \ntackle the spectrum of challenges and opportunities inherent in the r\negion, \nengaging thousands of people on the ground in cooperative projects, breaking down barriers and stereotypes, \nand \nchanging attitudes, while at the same time building trust and laying a foundation for lasting peace. \n \nThese\n \nprograms provide respect and \ndignity, hope and understanding, cooperation and reconciliation – elements often missing in conflict situations, but without which, resolution is impossible. \n \nIn the ebb and flow of diplomacy, the ups and downs of the peace pro\ncess, these NGOs are a consta\nnt: \n they are on the ground modeling what Israeli and Palestinian politicians in the area have failed to achieve – tangible, concrete examples of what peace can look like. \n \n9\n) \n              \n              \nAs examples:  These groups help Jewish settlers and their Palestinian neighbo\nrs open constructive interfaith dialogue; they engage Israelis and Palestinians who have lost loved ones in the conflict to talk about non-violence; they create soccer and basketball leagues \nengaging\n \ntens of thousands of kids, who learn teamwork and cooper\nation with new friends from the “other side\n”\n;\n \nthey pair Israeli and Palestinian villages to share environmental resou\nr\nces, since water knows no borders; \nthey bring together Israelis and Palestinians to cooperate in medicine, business, and education; they expose Israelis and Arabs to positive and human images of one another through TV shows and films; and they mobilize hundreds of thousands to call on their\n leaders to work toward a two-state solution. \n10\n) \n              \nThese actions confirm that peace is no mirage, but an achievable reality. \n When the peace process reaches closure – and it must\n \n–\n \nit will be these programs that have laid the groundwork and planted the se\neds necessary to support a successful outcome.  \n&#xa0;Evidence of Success\n1\n1\n) \n              \nIn fact:  these programs work.  Rigorous analyses and evaluation by USAID conclusively demo\nnstrate greater trust; enhanced coo\nperation; increased “conflict resolution values”; \ndecreased aggression and loneliness; and mitigation of hazardous environmental and health conditions between project participants from opposing sides of the conflict.\n \n \nAn in-progress, comprehensive evaluation of the Reconciliation Program by USAID is expec\nted to provide even more data upon completion later this year.\n1\n2\n) \n              \nNot only is there empirical data to validate the success of people-to-people programs, but participants themselves are acutely aware of the tremendous benefits that are realized through funding of \npeople-to-people \nNGOs:  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThese personalized accounts – and there are countless more – of successful people-to-people reconciliation efforts made possible through CMM grants underscore the critical need for funding to ensure that\n the progress of peace continues, including through the British Conflict Pool.\n1\n3\n) \n              \nThis “track \nII \ndiplomacy” is a critical foreign policy tool in addressing the \nMiddle East\n conflict.  Without building grassroots support for peace, as these projects do, political peace agreements in the \nMiddle East\n may never arrive and cannot endure.  Thus, bolstering nascent peace agreements through people-to-people efforts is critical to lo\nng-term stability, democracy and growth in the region.  It will be these programs that will enable the success of any diplomatic solution. \n \n1\n4\n) \n              \nIn addition, \nthese P2P projects give the often-silent two-thirds majorities on both sides\n,\n who support a two-s\ntate solution in poll after poll\n,\n tangible ways to work toward that better tomorrow.  T\nhey prove “there is a partner.” \nThese \npeople-to-people\n programs\n bolster diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establ\nishing grounds for cooperation and existence and building grassroots constituencies for peace on both sides\n. &#xa0;That groundwork must be laid \nfirst\n, to hasten an agreement and to give it the best possible chance of success.  \nProjects underway at this very mom\nent confirm that these people can successfully work together across borders and conflict lines, developing true professional and personal relationships. Ultimately, the programs provide a mechanism for people on both sides to overcome stereotypes and accep\nt each other’s right to live in peace.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion\n1\n5\n) \n              \nThere can be little doubt that \npeople-to-people\n \nprograms have \nbroad, \npositive\n \nimplications for long\n-\nterm stability and a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.  The United States investment, although substantial, is not sufficient; \na similar\n commitment to such programs through the British Conflict Pool – and ultimately through an Intern\national Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace – is essential.   \nAdditionally, NGOs like those supported by USAID – those engaged in P2P programming – should be supported by the \nentirety of funds in the \nConflict Pool.  \nALLMEP urges British officials to visit t\nhese hopeful and inspiring programs, and stands ready to assist the Committee in any way possible.  Thank you for this opportunity.\n              \n              \n              \n- \n9\n -\nwww.allmep.org\n Data provided by\n Foreign Minister for the Middle East, 25\nth\n November 2013.\n \n G\niven our lack of expertise\n,\n ALLMEP offers no evidence regarding the administration of the Conflict\n Pool overall\n.  Our testimony will imply that the\nr\ne are additional and different NGOs – those directly engaged in P2P work by contrast to protest and campaigns – that would benefit from\n these funds. Similarly, we cannot comment on the experience of NGOs endeavoring to access British government funds:  our expertise there lies with the US government. \n Neil A.
