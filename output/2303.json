"&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Local Government Association (LGA)&#xa0;About the Local Government Association&#xa0;\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work \nwith councils to support, promote and improve local government.\n&#xa0;\nWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and\n set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.\n&#xa0;\nThe LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the\n public sector.\n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to the Education Select Committee\n’s inquiry into the Department for Educations proposed reforms to the regulation of children’s homes.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nResidential children’s homes are an \nimportant and necessary part of our care system\n; for some children it will be the placement which best meets their needs.\n \nHowever, \nit \nis clear that reform is needed in order to \nimprove the system for the children who rely on them\n. \nThis requires all parts o\nf the system to work more effectively, including councils and providers. It is important to note that while regulatory change can have some positive impact, it can only achieve so much; there are a wider set of issues that must a\nlso be considered\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nTh\ne market for children’s homes is complex.  It has been shaped over decades by historic factors and must also be viewed in the context of the wider system for children in care. There is mixed private, charitable and local authority provision with significan\nt clustering of homes in certain geographic areas. There needs to be a better balance of provision in order to meet the needs of children and yo\nung people across the country. \nCouncils have a key role in making this happen, through more effective commission\ning, working with each other and providers to shape the market\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nIn recognition of this, t\nhe LGA commissioned \nthe Office for Public Management (OPM) t\no carry out an action research project with ten local authorities and providers, looking at how to \nachieve more effective strategic commissioning of children’s homes.\n \nThe research focused on three aspects of commissioning: needs analysis; matching needs and supply; and quality assurance and monitoring.\n The final report, available \non the L\nGA’s website, \nmakes \nr\necommendations for improvement\n and highlights a number of practic\nal\n examples\n.\n&#xa0;\nLocation of children\n’s placements\n and \nof children’s \nhome\ns\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nThere are a number of changes\n proposed by the Department for Education\n which the LGA welcomes and considers would make a\n positive impact on the system.  These include\n the new duty on children’s homes to notify the authority for the area where they are located every time a child is admitted to a placement and when they are di\nscharged.  It is important that councils know which looked after children are living in homes in their area, in order \n \nthat they can effectively discharge their safeguarding duties and understand the impact on other local services.  \n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n              \nThe lack of this i\nnformation can be a source of frustration and concern for some ‘area’ authorities.  Although the council-to-council notification system should address this, as noted in the consultation document emergency placements sometimes leads to delay. Placing a para\nllel duty on children’s homes \nwould\n therefore provide an additional safety net.  \n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n              \nAlthough we recognise that the system of \n‘\nplacing\n’\n authorities notifying area authorities \nneeds to be improved\n, we are concerned that the proposed change to require \nthem\n to consult with ‘area’ councils before making a placement could be fraught with difficulties. For example, consultation implies joint agreement on a placement decision; there is potential for a situation to occur whereby the ‘area’ authority believes that\n the placement should\n not\n go ahead, but the placing authority disagrees and makes it anyway. It is not clear how this would be resolved. \n&#xa0;\n7\n.\n              \nIn addition, \nwe are concerned that \nthere could be scope for ‘area’ authorities to be legally challenged by provide\nrs\n, based on the advice and information they provide to ‘placing’ authorities\n. How to achieve the objective of ensuring children are placed in appropriate areas and with access to other relevant local services \ntherefore \nneeds further consideration\n.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.\n              \nCou\nncils have safeguarding responsibilities for all children in their area, even if they are not the corporate parent\n and \nt\nhere are concerns about \ntheir \nlack of control over independent providers establishing homes in their area.  This has contributed to the \ngeographical clustering of homes, which means that supply of children’s homes is distorted and does not reflect demand across the country. This in turn contributes to \nthe \nnumbers of \nchildren placed \nout of\n their local\n area.  \n&#xa0;\n9\n.\n              \nSuch clustering also places significant burdens on other local services in those areas, for example schools or child and adolescent mental health provision.  The \nsiting\n of many children’s homes in a small area can also itself have an impact on the safety o\nf the children.  We therefore welcome the Department’s attempt to address this.  \n&#xa0;\n10\n.\n              \nAlthough it is not possible to deem an area ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’, due to the complex factors at play and how those change over time, we do agree that a responsibility on h\nomes to carry out an annual risk assessment and to do this in conjunction with relevant local services is sensible.  In addition, the assessment of risk should be accompanied by a plan setting out how those risks will be mitigated.  No area is risk free\n fo\nr vulnerable children\n; setting out how those risks will \nbe \nhandled is as important as identifying them.  \n&#xa0;\n11\n.\n              \nFollowing consultation with the police and children’\ns\n services, p\nroviders should be required to provide both elements to \nOfsted\n and to the \nLocal \nSafeguarding Children Board\n (LSCB)\n for the area where the home is located. If the exercise is to have any meaning, \nOfsted\n must have sufficient power to refuse registration or to de-register homes where the risks cannot be sufficiently mitigated.  LSCBs sho\nuld also have the power to make a submission to \nOfsted\n on the appropriateness of the risk assessment and the measures proposed to mitigate any risks based on their local knowledge; \nOfsted\n should have a duty to have regard to such a submission. It is possib\nle that local services may consider that the provider has not sufficiently addressed a risk and it is important that \nOfsted\n has all the relevant information to come to an informed decision. \n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n              \nAs noted in the introduction to this submission, the challenge of ensuring a better match between provision and the needs of children across the country requires more than just regulatory change.  Councils and providers must work closely together, with cou\nncils giving a clear picture of need to give providers confidence to invest and providers giving a clearer picture of what services they are delivering. \n&#xa0;\nStatements of Purpose\n&#xa0;\n1\n3\n.\n              \nThe action research that the LGA commissioned OPM to carry out on the comm\nissioning of children’s homes \nidentified\n that \nbetter\n matching of needs with supply could help to reduce placement breakdown. \nCouncils\n would generally welcome \na \ndeeper understanding of the services available across the existing children’s residential home m\narket. A common language to describe offers would help\n. C\noncerns were raised throughout the research (including from providers) that inflated claims about services mean inappropriate placements are made and needs cannot be fulfilled. \n&#xa0;\n1\n4\n.\n              \nNearly all parti\ncipants said more specialist provision is needed nationally and locally as \ncouncils\n are struggling to match the most complex needs with supply. They also report that the number of children with multiple complex needs is increasing. \nCouncils\n seek ‘specialis\nt’ and ‘therapeutic’ placements but\n,\n across the board (providers included)\n,\n said there is insufficient understanding amongst local authority commissioners and their partners about what this means in practice and insufficient evidence about what works and f\nor whom. \n&#xa0;\n1\n5\n.\n              \nIn some authorities direct conversations between social work teams and commissioners have helped build \na \ndeeper shared understanding of \nthe offer from \nprovider\ns\n. Providers can also do more to articulate the services they offer and to demonstrate the staff and skills available to deliver services. The impact of a misjudged or ineffectual placement is so significant (for that individual child or young person and ot\nhers in the home, including staff) that there may \nbe \njustification for more formal requirements around ethical advertising. The sector needs to more clearly define ‘specialist’ and ‘therapeutic’ care and promote the use of common language (amongst commissi\noners and providers) to describe different type\ns\n of provision.\n \nOne of the recommendations of the report was that there is a tightening of children’s homes’ formal statement of purpose.\n&#xa0;\nWorkforce \n&#xa0;\n1\n6\n.\n              \nThe people who work in children’s homes are vitally im\nportant to the experience of the children \nand young people living there. \nThe action research that the LGA commissioned OPM to carry out found that workforce development merits further attention. Children’s homes are receiving children and young people with\n increasingly high level or complex needs; strategies for skills development and to avoid burn out could help in matching needs with supply in the medium to long term. \n&#xa0;\n1\n7\n.\n              \nChildren’s home staff and managers in both \ncouncil\n and independent provision \nsaid\n \nthey are struggling to meet the needs of increasingly complex and challenging children and young people placed in their care. The skills, knowledge and experience of the children’s home workforce is clearly linked to the range and quality services availabl\ne and the extent to which a provider can deliver effectively against an offer to commissioners. \n&#xa0;\n1\n8\n.\n              \nLocal authorities who took part in the research are concerned about burn-out and loss of experienced staff from children’s homes as pressure on the \nfrontline increases. Ofsted is clear that home managers are one of the most important factors in determining the quality of care delivered, so this should be of great concern. Whilst the work at national level will help build a picture of current workforce\n qualifications, capabilities and skills gaps, local authorities want to find ways to encourage peer support, the sharing of effective practice and career progression.\n&#xa0;\n1\n9\n.\n              \nIn requiring all care staff \nto\n achieve the minimum necessary qualification within t\nwo years of starting employment, t\nhere could be a risk that existing experienced employees without the necessary qualification might be reluctant to take the steps to acquire a new qualification and leave. The regulation should be sensitive about this so t\nhat levels of experience can be shown to be equivalent to the relevant qualification. This might require a more elaborate assessment process however which may increase the costs to home operators and therefore to councils as commissioners. The qualificatio\nn process will inevitably take people out of work for periods which may lead to staffing over-stretch; again, the system needs to be sensitive and flexible to cope with realities on the ground.\n&#xa0;\n20\n.\n              \nWe agree with \nthe proposal that from 2018 requirement for\n candidates for registered manager posts to have achieved the necessary management qualification prior to appointment,\n but since it is widely acknowledged that the managerial position is vital for quality assurance we would query why this would be delayed \nbeyond the 2017 date for more junior staff.\n&#xa0;\n21\n.\n              \nWe agree with\n p\nroposals\n&#xa0;\nthat\n&#xa0;\nhomes should only be able to operate for as shortest time as possible without a registered manager (or locum) being appointed and \nOfsted\n being informed; \nmoreover, new homes shoul\nd not be able to open without a registered manager identified as part of the registration process.  \n&#xa0;\n22\n.\n              \nAll regulations of this sort are bound to increase the costs of commissioning a service but it is widely agreed that the quality of these vital servic\nes needs to improve. It will be important to improve the accuracy of cost estimates for these requirements and to monitor actual costs carefully so that resources can be properly \nchannelled\n to meet these new national requirements.\n&#xa0;\nChildren who go missing\n&#xa0;\n2\n3\n.\n              \nProtecting children is one of the most important things\n that councils do and t\nhe evidence has become increasingly clear that going missing can be an indicator of something affecting the safety and wellbeing of children. In particular, the link between\n going missing and the risk of child sexual exploitation is now widely accepted. Other agencies, in particular the police, but also health services and voluntary organisations\n,\n have an important role to play and it is essential that all have processes in p\nlace to work together in instances where children go missing.  \n&#xa0;\n2\n4\n.\n              \nThe LGA welcomes the streamlining of \nthe\n statutory guidance, to ensure that it is clear and easy to use for all those involved and does not inc\nlude unnecessary prescription. \nThis flexibil\nity is essential, in order that agencies can take the most appropriate action based on existing local services and arrangements.  \n&#xa0;\n2\n5\n.\n              \nWe welcome \nthe proposed \nrequirements on children’s homes to have policies on preventing children going missing, although\n it is important that there is flexibility as to the content, so that local service provision and arrangeme\nnts can be suitably reflected. \nLocal authorities have safeguarding responsibilities for children who are placed in their area by other authorities an\nd we would therefore support the policies being agreed with the local authority in the area where the home is located\n as well as the police\n. Given the multi-agency nature of the issue, the Local Safeguarding Children Board would appear to be the sensible p\nlace for policies to be discussed and agreed. This would also help to ensure a consistent approach across a local area.\n&#xa0;\n2\n6\n.\n              \nWhen there is concern due to a child going missing, consideration needs to be given to whether the placement is the right one and w\nhether the placement can be provided in such a way that the child becomes more settled.\n&#xa0;\nA formal review of the care plan takes place if a whole new set of needs are identified; therefore, the proposed duty on the registered person of a children’s home to f\normally request a review of the child’s care plan in cases where children are persistently missing from placement\n \ncould be disproportionate\n in some instances. \nFor example, it might be that the residential staff need advice on how best to care for a young p\nerson with particular needs. \n&#xa0;\n2\n7\n.\n              \nThe ‘plan’ (residential care) might be the right ‘plan’ but it might be the wrong placement; a review would not necessarily be called because a placement changes.\n&#xa0;\n Alternative, more proportionate options could include the registered manager having the powe\nr to ask for a meeting with the social worker and others involved in delivering the care plan to consider the issue of the young person being missing from home, or the power to request a formal response from the local authority setting out what action is b\neing taken and why as a result of the concern being raised.  This would enable the action to be tailored to the specific problem, whether a formal review, a meeting between professionals, or advice provided to staff. \n&#xa0;\n2\n8\n.\n              \nFurthermore, we believe that the \nproposal that a review meeting should be convened in circumstances where any or all of the area authority, registered manager of a children’s home or fostering service, foster \ncarer\n, parent\n&#xa0;\nrequest that a review is needed, in response to concerns that a ch\nild is at risk\n, i\nntroduces unnecessary prescription and runs counter to the principle in the Munro review\n,\n to increase professionalism and \nuse of \nprofessional judgement.  \n&#xa0;\nRemoving references to child prostitution from legislation\n&#xa0;\n2\n9\n.\n              \nWe strongly support\n \nthe removal of \nreferences to prostitution and replacing these with the term sexual exploitation. Using the term prostitution indicates that children have a choice or that they are consenting to their own abuse.  It belies the fact that exploitation is a s\nerious form of abuse and a crime.  \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=a20bf422-5640-43cc-afc6-7ab6ca3a59ec&amp;groupId=10180\n"
