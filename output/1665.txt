[[[Executive Summary]]]BDR Thermea Group was delighted to see publication of the Heat Strategy by DECC which sets out how heating in the UK could be decarbonised by 2050. We believe that the potential benefits to the low carbon economy and UK economic competitiveness from successful implementation are significant.Through our well-known brands such as Baxi, Potterton and Heatrae, BDR Thermea employ over 1,500 people in the UK.BDR Thermea supports the decarbonisation of UK heating. However the way in which it is achieved must recognise and address the unique features of the UK market. A bespoke approach that plays to consumer preferences, our national infrastructure assets and the strengths of the existing heating sector is required. We are investing in the technologies that could enable such a transformation including, Heat Recovery, Micro-Combined Heat and Power, Gas Heat Pumps, Solar Heating and Electric Heat Pumps.It is vital to ensure implementation of the Heat Strategy supports the manufacturing sector and drives innovation and employment growth in the UK alongside decarbonisation and bill reductions.GHPs are an established technology in Europe but RHI support on par with other renewable heating technologies is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK. RHI support would allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy and enable prompt decarbonisation and renewable gains even if gas utilisation persists.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Most “hard to treat homes” will not meet the energy efficiency criteria to qualify for the RHI scheme and Building regulations only capture those properties undergoing renovation. An additional barrier is that consumers are reluctant to pay for advice such as Green Deal assessments as energy efficiency is perceived as allow priority expenditure. Most owners do not qualify for assistance under ECO. &#xa0;

[[[Micro combined heat and power (mCHP)]]] units produce both heat and electricity. The electricity is generated in the home thus avoiding the transmission losses that result from centralised generation. See paragraph 10 for further information.

[[[Hybrids]]] present are a suitable retrofit for a large number of homes – see paragraph 11.  

[[[Gas heat pumps]]] (GHP) can readily address the needs of the retrofit environment and achieve rapid efficiency and decarbonisation gains without infrastructure changes or loss of comfort see paragraph 12 and 13 for more information. GHPs are a heating technology that can readily contribute to the attainment of binding renewable targets but RHI support on par with other renewable heating technologies, is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK. RHI support would allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy and enable prompt decarbonisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisation persists.&#xa0;

Except solar thermal which uses a 1,200kWh typical annual yield.

[[[&#xa0;]]]No comment&#xa0;&#xa0;GHPs are the only key renewable heating solution currently not supported under the RHI.  The European Commission decision on establishing guidelines on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps confirms that GHPs are a renewable solution, on par with electricity driven heat pumps. Support is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK and address existing market distortion in the heat pump sector. RHI support would also allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy - one of the two scenarios of DECC’s Heat Strategy foresees that GHPs will be the dominant heating solution in the UK from 2025 onwards - and enable prompt decarbonisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisation persists.&#xa0;
