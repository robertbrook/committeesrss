[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is clear that many of the other world economies are protecting or increasing their investment in research for just such reasons.
[normal] [bold] Major international businesses have to date invested in UK research because it is recognised as amongst the best in the world. However, other countries are becoming increasingly competitive and UK industry now has more choice than ever before.  Many Gover
[normal]nments, for example Singapore and Germany, are investing heavily to develop their research capability and provide attractive incentives for Companies to move their R&amp;D efforts.  It should 
[normal]be noted that much of this investment is based on a long-term nation
[normal]al ‘vision’ that stretches well beyond a ten-year horizon.
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome the 
[normal]steps taken by
[normal] 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment on
[normal] UK r
[normal]esearch and development funding
[normal] 
[normal]to link 
[normal]industry sector
[normal] strategy
[normal] and 
[normal]academic collaboration
[normal] to support for research and technology
[normal]. This creates cohe
[normal]rence and also supports 
[normal]bridging
[normal] the gap between research and bringing innovation to market
[normal] in
[normal] particular in growth industries
[normal].
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]recent 
[normal]announcement of the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) 
[normal]is an example 
[normal]of how 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment investment
[normal] support
[normal]s
[normal] a strategy for growth
[normal]. Government worked with industry in 
[normal]the Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP) 
[normal]to 
[normal]set out a national ‘vision’ and 
[normal]define the strategy for 
[normal]securing 
[normal]long-term success 
[normal]of the industry. Both sides entered into 
[normal]a
[normal] multi-year commitment to co-invest
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which provides essential continuity, and to do so at research and
[normal] technology 
[normal]funding 
[normal]levels
[normal] which 
[normal]will enable 
[normal]UK’s 
[normal]aerospace 
[normal]research
[normal], 
[normal]advanced manufacturing 
[normal]and future products 
[normal]to remain 
[normal]world leading
[normal].
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In this context 
[normal]we recognise that 
[normal]through 
[normal]the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) 
[normal]the 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment has developed efficient mechanisms for supporting joint collaborative research with universities. 
[normal]The scope of funding avai
[normal]lable through the TSB should be looked at in the context
[normal] of pulling through 
[normal]early stage research to validated technology.
[normal] We believe that the funding available to the TSB is too low to deliver all the early opportunities created in the UK.
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further, 
[normal]we believe that 
[normal]EPSRC remains an effective body for funding 
[normal]research at univ
[normal]ersities. While there is some merit in 
[normal]recent calls for streamlining the research councils, we are concerned that this should not lead to over-rationalisation
[normal] into a single research council. S
[normal]uch a step would hurt diversity of research amon
[normal]g 
[normal]various industri
[normal]es and hinder the adaptation of the individual council to the major drivers in the different research arenas.
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the National Audit Office (NAO) report notes, the
[normal]se
[normal] funds are managed through a number of government departments that are not always well coordinated. 
[normal]Establishment of a government focal point would be a starting point to provide a stronger UK presence and influence at European level.
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Universities are disinclined to pursue European funds because of the relatively unattractive overhead recovery structure of the grants. They need mechanisms by which the UK funding bodies can 
[normal]incentivise
[normal] and support participation in EU programmes, thus rec
[normal]overing more of the 
[normal]U
[normal]K taxpayers' contribution.
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The regional agenda of funding collaborative 
[normal]R&amp;D
[normal] appears to have been lost with the disbanding of the regional development agencies (RDAs), making it much harder to get SMEs involved. 
[normal]A strong basis for 
[normal]economic growth is rooted in a sound understanding of a locality’s economic advantage
[normal] and how R&amp;D funding affects it.
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We look forward to more information on how the new LEPs will be able to support larger businesses in the UK. We remain sceptical that the 
[normal]granularity of the LEPs is too fine to be effective in coordinating university activity to support local needs. Most LEPs will contain only one (many none) first class, research intensive university. The granularity of the 39 LEPs means that aligning multi
[normal]ple agencies across multiple universities to address major technical challenges will be no small 
[normal]task. It is essential that Government retain an oversight capability to avoid duplication of activity and missed opportunity.
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]No matter how 
[normal]‘
[normal]locality
[normal]’
[normal] is defin
[normal]ed; individual universities, industries, regions and even countries must target
[normal] those areas of technology
[normal] or expertise
[normal] where a leading position 
[normal]exists, or where
[normal] emerging 
[normal]technologies
[normal] 
[normal]in which
[normal] the UK has the business infrastructure and skill-base to 
[normal]become
[normal] 
[normal]world leading
[normal] exist. 
[normal]This implies focus on those institutions with a proven track record of excellence and delivering impact.  It also means that some difficult decisions must be taken to 
[normal]not
[normal] support some activities in the ‘locality’, however defined.
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]looking at universities, w
[normal]e 
[normal]acknowledge the difficulty of
[normal] map
[normal]ping
[normal] excellent research to most sectors of the Industrial Strategy, and maps based on academic classifications may not do 
[normal]justice to centres that excel in
[normal] 
[normal]applied research
[normal] in particular
[normal].  Whilst 
[normal]we can offer no simple 
[normal]solution
[normal], there is extensive knowledge 
[normal]in major industries 
[normal]of those with whom successful collaborations are underway– this is likely to be a good proxy for those centres that carry out 
[normal]work having a tangible
[normal] 
[normal]impact on business. I
[normal]t is
[normal] highly unlikely that successful 
[normal]businesses
[normal] will 
[normal]engage long-term with
[normal] organisation
[normal]s that fail to deliver results.
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We would welcome 
[normal]discussion on
[normal] additional metrics that recognise successful university-business interaction, and link continued funding aimed
[normal] at UK growth to those metrics.  
[normal]W
[normal]e make it clear that we do not advocate that current, traditional measures of researc
[normal]h
[normal] excellence be simply replaced, and t
[normal]here is no question that the quality of research and training in the UK must remain internationally
[normal] competitive.
[normal]  
[normal]However, i
[normal]t should be recognised that the traditional outcomes of research are not the only measure of success, especially when considering exploitation for the benefit of the UK.  We have yet to see how the ‘Impact metric’ introduced for 
[normal]the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF)
[normal] will affect the outcome.  In calling for Universities to help “write the plan” for investing ESI funds, there 
[normal]is
[normal] a risk that they will do so to support (only) 
[normal]more
[normal] traditional measures.
[normal]10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, we should not o
[normal]verlook the potential synergies between sectors.  It is quite likely that 
[normal]for example
[normal] Aerospace and Automotive will draw on similar skills and capabilities.  In examining heat maps and other indicators of expertise, where we see overlaps in 
[normal]capability
[normal], opp
[normal]ortunities to more effectively channel R&amp;D funds may become apparent.
