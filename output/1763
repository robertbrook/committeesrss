default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is clear that many of the other world economies are protecting or increasing their investment in research for just such reasons.
default default Major international businesses have to date invested in UK research because it is recognised as amongst the best in the world. However, other countries are becoming increasingly competitive and UK industry now has more choice than ever before.  Many Gover
defaultnments, for example Singapore and Germany, are investing heavily to develop their research capability and provide attractive incentives for Companies to move their R&amp;D efforts.  It should 
defaultbe noted that much of this investment is based on a long-term nation
defaultal ‘vision’ that stretches well beyond a ten-year horizon.
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome the 
defaultsteps taken by

defaultg
defaultovernment on
default UK r
defaultesearch and development funding
default 
defaultto link 
defaultindustry sector
default strategy
default and 
defaultacademic collaboration
default to support for research and technology
default. This creates cohe
defaultrence and also supports 
defaultbridging
default the gap between research and bringing innovation to market
default in
default particular in growth industries
default.
default5.3

defaultThe 
defaultrecent 
defaultannouncement of the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) 
defaultis an example 
defaultof how 
defaultg

default. Government worked with industry in 
defaultthe Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP) 
defaultto 
defaultset out a national ‘vision’ and 
defaultdefine the strategy for 
defaultsecuring 
defaultlong-term success 
defaultof the industry. Both sides entered into 
defaulta
default multi-year commitment to co-invest
default,
default 
defaultwhich provides essential continuity, and to do so at research and

default which 
defaultwill enable 
defaultUK’s

defaultresearch

defaultadvanced manufacturing 
defaultand future products 
defaultto remain

default.
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn this context 
defaultwe recognise that 
defaultthrough 
defaultthe Technology Strategy Board (TSB) 
defaultthe 
defaultg
defaultovernment has developed efficient mechanisms for supporting joint collaborative research with universities. 
defaultThe scope of funding avai
defaultlable through the TSB should be looked at in the context
default of pulling through 
defaultearly stage research to validated technology.
default We believe that the funding available to the TSB is too low to deliver all the early opportunities created in the UK.
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther, 
defaultwe believe that 
defaultEPSRC remains an effective body for funding 
defaultresearch at univ
defaultersities. While there is some merit in 
defaultrecent calls for streamlining the research councils, we are concerned that this should not lead to over-rationalisation
default into a single research council. S
defaultuch a step would hurt diversity of research amon
defaultg 
defaultvarious industri
defaultes and hinder the adaptation of the individual council to the major drivers in the different research arenas.
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the National Audit Office (NAO) report notes, the
defaultse
default funds are managed through a number of government departments that are not always well coordinated. 
defaultEstablishment of a government focal point would be a starting point to provide a stronger UK presence and influence at European level.
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities are disinclined to pursue European funds because of the relatively unattractive overhead recovery structure of the grants. They need mechanisms by which the UK funding bodies can 
defaultincentivise
default and support participation in EU programmes, thus rec
defaultovering more of the 
defaultU
defaultK taxpayers' contribution.
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe regional agenda of funding collaborative 
defaultR&amp;D
default appears to have been lost with the disbanding of the regional development agencies (RDAs), making it much harder to get SMEs involved. 
defaultA strong basis for 
defaulteconomic growth is rooted in a sound understanding of a locality’s economic advantage
default and how R&amp;D funding affects it.
default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe look forward to more information on how the new LEPs will be able to support larger businesses in the UK. We remain sceptical that the 
defaultgranularity of the LEPs is too fine to be effective in coordinating university activity to support local needs. Most LEPs will contain only one (many none) first class, research intensive university. The granularity of the 39 LEPs means that aligning multi
defaultple agencies across multiple universities to address major technical challenges will be no small 
defaulttask. It is essential that Government retain an oversight capability to avoid duplication of activity and missed opportunity.
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNo matter how 
default‘
defaultlocality
default’
default is defin
defaulted; individual universities, industries, regions and even countries must target
default those areas of technology
default or expertise
default where a leading position 
defaultexists, or where
default emerging 
defaulttechnologies
default 
defaultin which
default the UK has the business infrastructure and skill-base to 
defaultbecome
default 
defaultworld leading
default exist. 
defaultThis implies focus on those institutions with a proven track record of excellence and delivering impact.  It also means that some difficult decisions must be taken to 
defaultnot
default support some activities in the ‘locality’, however defined.
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultlooking at universities, w
defaulte 
defaultacknowledge the difficulty of
default map
defaultping
default excellent research to most sectors of the Industrial Strategy, and maps based on academic classifications may not do 
defaultjustice to centres that excel in
default 
defaultapplied research
default in particular
default.  Whilst 
defaultwe can offer no simple 
defaultsolution
default, there is extensive knowledge 
defaultin major industries 
defaultof those with whom successful collaborations are underway– this is likely to be a good proxy for those centres that carry out 
defaultwork having a tangible
default 
defaultimpact on business. I
defaultt is
default highly unlikely that successful 
defaultbusinesses
default will 
defaultengage long-term with
default organisation
defaults that fail to deliver results.
default9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would welcome 
defaultdiscussion on
default additional metrics that recognise successful university-business interaction, and link continued funding aimed
default at UK growth to those metrics.  
defaultW
defaulte make it clear that we do not advocate that current, traditional measures of researc
defaulth
default excellence be simply replaced, and t
defaulthere is no question that the quality of research and training in the UK must remain internationally
default competitive.
default  
defaultHowever, i
defaultt should be recognised that the traditional outcomes of research are not the only measure of success, especially when considering exploitation for the benefit of the UK.  We have yet to see how the ‘Impact metric’ introduced for 
defaultthe 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF)
default will affect the outcome.  In calling for Universities to help “write the plan” for investing ESI funds, there 
defaultis
default a risk that they will do so to support (only) 
defaultmore
default traditional measures.
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, we should not o
defaultverlook the potential synergies between sectors.  It is quite likely that 
defaultfor example
default Aerospace and Automotive will draw on similar skills and capabilities.  In examining heat maps and other indicators of expertise, where we see overlaps in 
defaultcapability
default, opp
defaultortunities to more effectively channel R&amp;D funds may become apparent.
