[[[Call for Evidence on EU action to tackle youth unemployment ]]]&#xa0;The 

[[[Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at Middlesex University]]] is the UK partner in a new research project, funded by the EU Framework 7 programme, to investigate early school leaving across nine partner countries.  

[[[RESL.eu]]] (Reducing Early School Leaving in Europe) runs from 2013-2018 and has the following objectives:&#xa0;&#xa0;Further information of the project are available on the SPRC websitehttp://sprc.info/reducing-early-school-leaving-in-europe/and on the official RESL.eu website:  https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/resl-eu/&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Preliminary work and emerging findings]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]To date the SPRC has collected evidence from stake holders at local, national and at EU level on a range of initiatives to tackle 

[[[youth unemployment]]] across England.  In addition, we are investigating how EU initiatives may be shaping national and local policies in the English context. &#xa0;In the next phase of the study we will be working closely with schools to collect both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interviews and focus groups) on young people’s aspirations and expectations around schooling, training and employment as well as their involvement in specific programmes and initiatives. &#xa0;Thus, although we have limited evidence to share with the select committee at this time, over the next few years, for example a first project paper with preliminary findings on 31 January 2014.  In subsequent years we will have rich data addressing these important issues.&#xa0;21 October 2013 &#xa0;
