defaultOver the past decade, Carplus has played an active role in the introduction

default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently, insufficient account is taken of the

defaultdifferent 
defaultpassenger groups
default. As a result
default,
default some of the services provided by voluntary sector

defaultCommunity car clubs

default are also a response by people to lack of services. “Shared mobility” can also help to provide affordable transport in communities where there is limited Public Transport provision. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the main challenges in providing isolated communities 
defaultwith 
defaultbus and rail services is that there is often insufficient demand to facilitate commercially sustainable services. Services which are not commercially sustainable require subsidy from the public purse to continue to operate and this is often impractical in 
defaulta period of economic austerity. 
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere communities are not well served by public transport they tend to be heavily dependent on private car ownership and use. The provision of other options can help visitors and local people to make wider use of public transport. Where there are adequate 
defaultservices using other modes at the start and end of the trip, rather than relying on cars for the whole journey, the use of cars can be reduced. This is exemplified in the approach of the Lake District National Park which is trialing car clubs and other mod
defaultes at rail stations as a way of reducing car use in the national park using its 
defaultGo Lakes
default brand.
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCar clubs can play an important role in isolated communities by providing convenient and affordable access to a car without the need to own one. After initial p
defaulteriod investment car clubs can usually operate on a financially sustainable basis because members pay an appropriate amount for the cost of their use and can often save money compared to the cost of private car ownership.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to effectively address the needs of passengers in isolated communities Community Transport services tend require regular funding su
defaultpport from public sector authorities to meet their client’s needs. We believe there is a need to develop a diversity of provision meeting the needs of different client groups. 
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere car clubs have been established and continue to operate, they require kic
defaultk start funding and little or no ongoing support. They meet a range of different but complementary needs – helping households to “downsize” car ownership and providing an alternative for people who mainly use public transport, cycle or walk. 
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCar clubs can
default also support community transport by facilitating additional voluntary drivers for community car schemes. We have identified in Cornwall a need for drivers willing to volunteer but without a suitable vehicle. With access to pay

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCar 
defaultclubs can provide a cost effective and financially sustainable alternative to dependency on taxis, DRT services and private car ownership and use in isolated communities.
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere it is not possible or feasible to provide any other public transport service, w
defaulte think car clubs provide an option not to own a car in areas where cars are sometimes the only way to undertake some activities.
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCommunities of a size sufficient to support a financially sustainable car club should not have to rely on taxi and DRT service
defaults. Through the Transport Scotland 
defaultDeveloping Car Clubs in Scotland 
defaultprogramme, Carplus has provided technical and financial assistance to support a number of community-run car clubs in isolated rural communities. For example the DCCS programme funded the de
defaultvelopment of a community-run car club in Fintry, Stirlingshire, a community located 17 miles from Stirling and 18 miles from Glasgow. This car club provides two pay-as-you-drive cars which can be booked on-line or over the phone and which provide a conveni
defaultent and cost effective alternative to private car ownership and use. As one local resident puts it: 
default“With no Public transport in Fintry, residents have had a high dependency on cars. We kept one car, sold our second and both my husband and I joined the ca
defaultr club. This has been ideal for our needs. We’ve saved considerable sums on the costs of maintaining and insuring another vehicle .The car club offers us a choice of car size to suit need and preference. Being car club members 
defaultdiscourages lazy unnecessary 
defaultcar use and therefore benefits users and the environment”.
default Kayt Howell, car club member FEET car club, Fintry, Stirlingshire.

default&#xa0; 
defaultHere are some more examples of the benefits of developing car clubs in small towns and rural communities in member’s own words:
default“I
default am the only driver in my family and there are two members who require care support daily. They live in opposite directions from my home 18 and 22 miles apart, so having access to a motor vehicle is essential. As a pensioner I have to watch the cost of pro
defaultviding this support and the car club car gave me the means to provide the service. The peace of mind knowing that in an emergency I can still be mobile is difficult to put into words.” 
defaultStuart MacVicar, car club member LEAP Car Club, Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshi
defaultre.
default"Westwheels cars have enabled me to take up to four children away on school trips which I would be struggling to achieve in this area where there's limited public transport. Because of WestWheels, we do not need to keep a car on the mainland which mean
defaults our costs are reduced. I think the Car Club is a good asset to our area.”
default Sue Holland, island resident and WestWheels car club member, Mallaig the Highlands.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe main services for clients who need access to a range of community and social services will require revenue funding from several public sources. Shared mobility services - such as car clubs and shared bikes - once established, require little or no ongoi
defaultng funding support. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCar clubs are a valuable asset to meeting mobility needs in rural communities. However, they will only work in certain areas and need to be integrated well with public transport (if it exists) and to complement community transport serv
defaultices.
default6.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe would commend the funding programme provided by Transport Scotland to develop car clubs. It uses Carplus Trust – a specialist charity - to evaluate bids and manage the funding. It can offer advice and kick start funding of 
defaultup to 
default£60,000 per commun
defaultity to establish a car club. This can then provide a platform for 
defaulta 
defaultself-financing scheme to develop.
