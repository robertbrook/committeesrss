[normal]Further [bold]written evidence[bold] from[bold] the [bold]Local Government Ombudsman[bold] [PHS0051][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]In our previous submissions we focussed upon the three main drivers for reform of the complaints and ombudsman systems- a better service for the public; better value for money; and better for local and Parliamentary accountability.
[normal]We have identified eight principles that 
[normal]reflect the needs of the public when they 
[normal]are 
[normal]seeking an independent review of their complaint, individual redress and systemic improvement
[normal]:
[normal]We have developed a number of proposals that we believe meet those principles and would deliver a better service, better value for money and better accountability. We hope that the Committee will find these proposals helpful
[normal] in
[normal] informing their future recommendations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle [bold]1[bold]- Increase public awareness and access[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]n essential pre-requisite is effective access to justice and right to redress for the public. In our previous submissions we highlighted the complexities that are inherent in the ‘complaints maze’. The vast array of routes that the pubic need to navigate when public services let them down means that redress is too often inaccessible.  The following reforms would demystify and simplify access to the ombudsman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As has been the case in Wales, a single portal for complaints about public services could be more effectively promoted and make it easier for people to find their way to the Ombudsman. As with Complaints Wales this could be delivered by a Public Service Ombudsman for England to ensure its independence from government and service providers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Citizens should have direct access to the Ombudsman service whilst still being able to seek support from their councillor, MP or other advocate. This is particularly important for the most vulnerable complainants who wish to remain private.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A statutory requirement for all providers to signpost to the ombudsman, as is the case in the financial and legal sectors, would ensure that the public are aware of their right to complain when services fail and they are not satisfied with local complaints handling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The public should have the right to a route to redress. Statutory eligibility requirements for bringing a complaint to the Ombudsman would enable the right of all users of public services to seek redress. They should be focussed upon securing the delivery of a free, informal ombudsman service that does not require legal representation.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]These statutory requirements could be underpinned by more detailed scheme rules published by the Board of the Ombudsman’s Office. These rules would set out in a transparent and accessible way how the ombudsman scheme would operate and 
[normal]how 
[normal]the ombudsman’s office would determine whether to investigate an issue. Such scheme rules would allow the Ombudsman to respond rapidly to changing models of service delivery without needing to seek legislative change to meet the needs of the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle [bold]2[bold]- Seamless service[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Complaints about public services are not confined to administrative or other sector boundaries.
[normal] 
[normal]The delivery model
[normal]s
[normal] for public services 
[normal]and the exercise of statutory duties and functions continues to change.
[normal] A wider range of providers, including the private and third sectors, now deliver services 
[normal]in fulfilment of the statutory duties of 
[normal]public bodies. An increasing number of people are receiving public services through multi-agency arrangements. 
[normal]The administration of services which have been the responsibility of central government departments, such as welfare benefits and health care are also now being devolved to local authorities. This devolved system includes new bodies to support 
[normal]local accountability and 
[normal]complaints handling, such as Healthwatch
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The public should not have to make complex determinations about who is 
[normal]accountable for 
[normal]delivering their service
[normal], and therefore liable for redress,
[normal] 
[normal]and which Ombudsman can help them when those services
[normal] fail.
[normal] The proposals we make below have the aim of providing users of all public services in England with a seamless
[normal], consistent and comprehensive
[normal] ombudsman service.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A
[normal] single Public Services Ombudsman
[normal] 
[normal]Service 
[normal]for England 
[normal]c
[normal]ould provide people in England with 
[normal]a unified, consistent and comprehensive service which avoids the current systemic confusion.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]People who complain to an Ombudsman need to understand the handling process and what outcome they can expect.  This requires openness and transparency about the service. The creation of a
[normal]ny new unified service 
[normal]would require a common business model, performance indicators and quality standards to provide public assurance and understanding.  This could build on the existing experience and expertise of sector specific Ombudsman, for example for local government, social care, 
[normal]and 
[normal]health.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle 3- [bold]Maximise k[bold]nowledge and expertise[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The value of an independent and impartial investigation by the Ombudsman should not be underestimated.  This is equally valuable in highlighting when no fault has occurred as it is in determining fault and injustice which require remedy.  Complainants need to be satisfied that investigations are conducted fairly based on relevant evidence and with a thorough understanding of the proper application of the relevant law, statutory guidance, policy and best 
[normal]practice.
[normal] 
[normal] Any 
[normal]ombudsmen scheme
[normal] needs to 
[normal]demonstrate expertise 
[normal]in their areas of jurisdiction t
[normal]o ensure accurate decision making that users of the service can trust.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A single public services ombudsman would inevitably have jurisdiction over a wide range of public services. It will be essential for building trust in the quality of decision making that the ombudsman service can demonstrate expertise in those different areas. 
[normal]E
[normal]mploying lead ombudsmen for different sectors would help to build that trust and would ensure that any new Ombudsman could draw upon the expertise that exists in c
[normal]urrent schemes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle 4- Authority to remedy injustice and require service improvement[bold]&#xa0;[bold]If complaints cannot be addressed by the local provider, the public want to know that their complaint will
[normal] be investigated by somebody
[normal] with the authority to 
[normal]put things right.  
[normal]The strength of an Ombudsman approach is the 
[normal]authority to
[normal] remedy both the injustice caused to individuals by the actions of public services and to tackle the wider injustices that may occur by requiring service improvements. The current public service ombudsmen all have differ
[normal]ing
[normal] powers to aid them in meeting these objectives
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Clarification of enforcement powers could be achieved as follows: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Under the current system public bodies usually comply with ombudsmen recommendations.  The sovereignty of the legislature to make decisions concerning policy and the use of public money has
[normal] however
[normal] been maintained. 
[normal]Both LGO and PHSO report in excess of 99% compliance
[normal]. As changes in service delivery bring more independent bodies into jurisdiction, for example all registered social care providers which have been in the jurisdiction of LGO since 2010, the Ombudsman must maintain appropriate authority to achieve compliance.  This would be strengthened by 
[normal]discretion to seek judicial enforcement of recommendations. However, this power should be subject to an affirmative instrument before it comes into effect.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In the regulatory landscape of public services, proper arrangements need to be in place to provide a route to redress for individual complaints or groups of complainants.  This is not the role of the regulator
[normal]y
[normal] body
[normal] which has responsibility and authority to ensure systemic change in line with regulatory standards. The ombudsman will however consider compliance with regulatory standards in determining a complaint. The ombudsman and the regulator need to work together to share intelligence, learn from complaints and bring about improvement action.  The LGO works closely with appropriate regulators for social care and education to achieve this.   A duty on the ombudsman to refer concerns to the relevant regulator with a similar duty on the regulator to follow up would strengthen this relationship and provide further public assurance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle 5- Strong local complaint handling with independent oversight[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Members of the public want their complaints resolved as quickly as possible by the body concerned.  Referral to the 
[normal]o
[normal]mbudsm
[normal]a
[normal]n 
[normal]is a final stage and should only be necessary when local routes for redress have been exhausted. 
[normal]The ombudsman sits at the apex of the system, not only to provide independent and robust oversight when local complaints handling fails, but 
[normal]also to
[normal] ensure that bodies take responsibility and accountability for their own performance and for resolving complaints. 
[normal]The role of the ombudsman must also be to 
[normal]encourage robust
[normal] and effective
[normal] local complaint handling. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LGO has for nearly 40 years provided informal guidance, advice and training for local councils in support of local complaints handling.  
[normal]In his evidence to the Committee, the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman highlighted his work in setting common standards for complaints handling through a Complaints Standards Authority.
[normal] A statutory duty for 
[normal]a 
[normal]Public
[normal] Services Ombudsman for England
[normal] 
[normal]would be the appropriate way to formalise and strengthen this role.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In the Scottish model, Audit Scotland has the role to audit compliance with the standards set by the Complaint Standards Authority. We consider that an arrangement of this nature helps to prevent confusion between the role of an ombudsman and the role of a regulator.
[normal] We would recommend that a similar approach is taken in England with relevant regulators such as the National Audit Office and the Care Quality Commission being responsible for auditing compliance with complaint standards set by a Public Services Ombudsman for England.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Principle 6- Value for money[bold]&#xa0;[bold]An ombudsman service must be free of charge to the complainant. 
[normal]As with any publically funded service, a Public Service Ombudsman for England
[normal] should provide value for money. 
[normal]Where a service is publically funded through taxation it follows that the relevant ombudsman scheme should also be publically funded.  However where bodies in jurisdiction are not publically funded 
[normal]they should not be funded by the tax payer.  
[normal]As is usually the case with ombudsman schemes serving the private sector, a 
[normal]Public Services Ombudsman for England should have powers to recover the costs of investigating complaints about non-public bodies from the providers themselves. This could be done by using 
[normal]either a sector wide levy, a case fee for each complaint handled about a provider or a combination of both.
[normal] This would reduce the burden on the public purse and help to ensure that all providers are accountable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle 7- Independent [bold]corporate[bold] governance[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The public expect 
[normal]an ombudsman scheme
[normal] to be 
[normal]i
[normal]ndependent of the body complained about.
[normal] This is best delivered by a governance structure that can hold the service to account for its performance in an effective and robust manner without fear of being fettered by government or other bodies in jurisdiction. The proposals we make below are informed by recent reviews of our own governance by an External Evaluation and by Robert Gordon. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Good governance and accountability comes from strong, independent voices providing challenge and scrutiny.
[normal] This can be best achieved by
[normal] a
[normal]n independent
[normal] 
[normal]Board for Public Service Complaints charged with establishing and overseeing
[normal] a
[normal] Public Service Ombudsman Service
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal]The Board could in turn be accountable to Parliament through a 
[normal]designated
[normal] Committee
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The proposed Board for Public Service Complaints 
[normal]c
[normal]ould be responsible for appointing 
[normal]a Chief Ombudsman
[normal],
[normal] in whose authority complaints would be investigated and decided
[normal],
[normal] to run the Ombudsman Service. The Board would be responsible for managing the performance of the Chief Ombudsman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Principle 8- Increase scrutiny &amp; accountability of services locally &amp; [bold]centrally[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Public services should be accountable to the people that use them as this is the most effective way of ensuring that those services are respons
[normal]ive
[normal] to the needs of their users. Whilst the public have increasing choice about the services they use democratically elected representatives, locally and nationally,
[normal] have an important role to play in ensuring accountability.
[normal] Reform of the ombudsman landscape provides an opportunity to enhance scrutiny of public services and make more effective use of complaints in
[normal] 
[normal]a consumer democracy. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently some local authorities do consider our recommendations in full council and we consider that this scrutiny aid
[normal]s
[normal] local accountability and helps to ensure that services are accountable to the public through locally elected members. However, this approach is not consistent across local government and so we would recommend including a statutory requirement for local authorities to consider the findings of the Ombudsman in full council.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For other bodies in the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction there 
[normal]should be
[normal] a similar 
[normal]statutory 
[normal]requirement for the Board of that body to consider findings from the Ombudsman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The findings of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Ombudsman 
[normal]provide important public information which should be used more effectively to support local authority scrutiny 
[normal]and Parliamentary
[normal] scrutiny of public services. 
[normal]T
[normal]he lessons from complaints provide 
[normal]local scrutiny committees and Parliamentary 
[normal]Select Committees w
[normal]ith a valuable evidence base 
[normal]with which to hold public services to account.
[normal] 
[normal]A strengthening of 
[normal]the 
[normal]scrutiny 
[normal]relationship 
[normal]between the
[normal] Ombudsman
[normal], local councils 
[normal]and Parliament
[normal] would be welcome.
