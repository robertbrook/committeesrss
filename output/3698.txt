[[[&#xa0;]]]As a present complainant, I am currently awaiting the result of a Review by the LGO's new Assessment team of their decision not to pass on my Complaint (and similar complaints by others) against a council to the LGO's Investigation team.&#xa0;This perspective will, I hope, be useful  As the Review result is not yet known, my comments cannot be unduly influenced by an adverse decision. Secondly, the July 2012 Report summary says: "During this period of change it is essential that the LGO keeps a close eye on the effects of the changes on those using its services and on its staff."  As this Enquiry is reviewing these LGO changes, comments by someone currently "using its services", will be relevant,  l hope.&#xa0;As the committee  does not examine details of individual cases, I shall avoid these as much as possible. I am an historian and a retired lecturer in business management and public administration. l was one of 18 or 19 individuals (not an organisation, and otherwise unknown to each other) who submitted similar  but separate complaints to the London Borough of Barnet about serious maladministration in the decision-making processes that led to approval of an application to enclose a five-ward multicultural area within an Eruv religious boundary. The council  rejected the complaints and advised each person about the Ombudsman service.&#xa0;I have linked my remarks below to recent and present Enquiries into the LGO&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The new Assessment Unit structure is placing too much (almost unaccountable) power in the hands of individuals. Their brief is to filter OUT (not filter in). Success is measured by the proportion of cases rejected at this first stage (as the LGO's statistics and commentaries show).&#xa0;Many cases must have been unreasonably rejected. I myself would have given up at this early stage if it had not been for a number of exceptional factors: the mass of hard evidence of maladministration available in the form of Planning Committee papers; F.o.l. access to objections submitted to the council; the availability on-line of a film of the Planning Committee meeting (filming permitted by the council);  the repetition of unmistakable maladministration in a neighboring similar Eruv application three weeks later.&#xa0;As a former journalist (newspaper reporter) as well as a retired lecturer in public administration, I was also in a position to understand that comments by members of the public as they left the council meeting- "It's a done deal!"; "A travesty!"- were justified.&#xa0;Sustained by these factors, and also by the knowledge that other (well-qualified) residents were similarly indignant at Barnet Council's maladministration, I have been able to persist despite the Assessment Unit's negative targets. Many other complainants will not have been so fortunate.

[[[igator" allocated to my case. I am calling him "M" the first lett]]]

[[[er of his surname):]]] &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"M" insisted that he alone was dealing with my case, and this was emphasised by several other staff in Coventry and at Millbank, London, to whom I spoke from time to time. "M" appeared to claim ownership of the case, and clearly objected when (unusually) one person on the staff passed on to him a substantiated criticism I made. "M" would perhaps claim he was exercising legitimate "independent judgment" -however ill-informed that might be. I was able, probably because ofmy past journalistic experience, to persist in contacting other people, but many complainants would hesitate to do this and would accept rejection of their viable case at a very early stage.&#xa0;&#xa0;Both of these standard filtering-out grounds were combined by "M" as his reason for rejecting what was potentially a major case of maladministration by a council, with indisputable evidence in the council's own published documents. I would ask to what extent, if any, he was required, as an "investigator" in the Assessment Unit, to examine the actual evidence? Is it simply a tick-box approach: finding, metaphorically or actually, a box to tick, and then moving on to the next case?(See also: LGO’s Progress Report, 1 Oct 2013: “We have introduced a clear template for our decision statements… format clearly identifies the evidence and any other consideration that we have relied on in reaching a decision.” Does that template support over-rapid “filtering” of cases?)&#xa0;&#xa0;I received a standard letter from Dr. Jane Martin, Ombudsman, inviting me to an advisory Forum in Coventry, to include members of the public who had used the service in the last six months.&#xa0;Interested persons had to send "a short statement, of no more than 500 words, explaining why you would like to be involved and details of any other relevant experience you have... Decisions on who will be appointed to the forum will be based solely upon the statement".&#xa0;I did not respond because it seemed to me to be an inappropriate invitation. People who were critical of the service might clearly wish to attend- but the choice of participants would be, it seems, in the hands of the organisation they wished to criticise. A more informative and open method might be a questionnaire sent after completion of each case: whether rejected or supported by the LGO.&#xa0;&#xa0;These goals will only be realisable if the summary statements are produced with demonstrable integrity and understanding.              "M" produced an unbalanced "final decision statement", as follows:&#xa0;&#xa0;11 November 2013
