default1.1
default              
defaultWith a membership of over 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and nurse cadets, 
defaultthe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world. RCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promo
defaulttes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the Government, the UK parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe RCN welco
defaultmes the opportunity to submit evidence to the
default Health Committee’s annual inquiry in to
default 
defaultpublic expenditure in the NHS. The RCN has responded to
default the elements of the terms of reference as
default posed by the Committee which it feels qualified to comment on.

default              
defaultThe RCN accepts that the NHS needs to make financial efficiency savings due to the current economic climate. However, in far too many cases, as we have highlighted in previous submissions to the Committee, NHS bodies are making short term cuts to services 
defaultand personnel rather than well thought through, genuine efficiency savings. 
defaultThese cuts will, and are, inevitably affecting the quality of patient care. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe RCN’s 
defaultFrontline First 
defaultcampaign collects and publishes data on cuts to NHS personnel and specif
defaultically nursing posts. The campaign calls for our members on the ground to tell us where they are seeing cuts to posts, where waste is eviden
defaultt
default and where innovations are developed. This information is the
defaultn
default robustly verified and analysed before it is publishe
defaultd. More recently the campaign has developed to use the Government’s own workforce figures. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultAccording to the most recent data (for July 2013), the qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting workforce lost 3,859 FTE roles (6,468 headcount) since 
defaultMay 2010, a decrease of 1.2 per cent.
default&#xa0;
defaultSupport to doctors and nursing staff, including roles such as health care assistants and assistant practitioners, has also decreased by a similar proportion, with 2,719 full time posts lost (7,058 headcount).
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultAlt
defaulthough the aggregated qualified nursing, midwifery and health visiting workforce has decreased over the last three years, the picture is more complex than this. Workforce numbers for both qualified midwives and qualified health visitors have actually increa
defaultsed. The midwifery workforce has increased by 1,311 FTE roles since May 2010, and the health visiting workforce has increased by 700 FTE roles.
default These figures, however, blur the effect of cuts to the nursing workforce.
default If these figures are removed from the 
defaultaggregated data, it indicates a
default&#xa0;
defaulttrue fall of 5,870 FTE nurse roles (or 7,578 headcount) since May 2010
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultAlthough the nursing workforce has decreased overall, posts have been lost from different services at varying rates. The RCN is extremely concerne
defaultd that the areas which have seen the greatest proportional workforce losses are also those where investment is urgently needed.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultIn mental health services, the workforce has seen a decrease of nearly 2,000 full time nursing staff since 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is de
defaultspite years of rising demand for mental health care. In England, 48,631 people were detained in hospital for assessment and/or treatment of 
defaulta 
defaultmental disorder under the Mental Health Act in 2011/2012, and a further 4,220 
defaultpatients were subject to community t
defaultreatment orders (CTOs) – a 5
default per cent
default increase in detentions and 10
default per cent
default increase in CTOs compared to the previous year. Mental health services are now showing increasing levels of strain, with evidence suggesting 
defaultthat 
defaultat least 1,711 mental health beds
default (9 per
default 
defaultcent of the total) were closed between April 2011 and August 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe learning disability nursing workforce has also seen significant long term decline, with 800 full time roles lost since 2010, a fall of around 15 per cent.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultAfter a decade of
default workforce expansion, peaking in 2009-2010,
default the 
defaultcommunity
default nursing workforce has in 
defaultthe last three years seen a fall of 1,744 full time roles, or 3.6 per cent of the workforce.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite rhetoric of a shift from acute to community models of care, the proporti
defaulton of nurses working in community services has changed very little, from 14.3
default per cent
default of the total nursing workforce in 2002, to 15.1 per cent in 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultLosses have been particularly acute in the district nursing workforce, which has been declining year on
default year for the last decade, with 1,312 full time posts lost since 2010 (a 17 per cent decrease).
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultIn addition to those posts lost so far, the RCN’s 2012 report on the community nursing workforce identified that services would suffer disproportionately 
defaultmore from an ag
defaulte
defaulting nursing workforce.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the community workforce, 38 per cent of nurses were found to be aged 50 and over, compared to 23.6 per cent of the acute, 
defaultolder people
default and general nursing workforce.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith 59.2 per cent of the community nursing work
defaultforce aged 45 and over, a large proportion will reach 
defaultretirement age
default in the next decade
default, compounding the urgent need to build the community w
defaultorkforce capacity in the future
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThe RCN is 
defaultalso 
defaultaware
default, through intelligence and information gathered,
default of many NHS trusts which have instigated recruitment freezes and 
defaultdelete 
defaultvacancies so that they can reduce their wage bill through 
default‘
defaultnatural wastage
default’ and avoid making direct job cuts
default.
default This obviously has a negative effect on the level of service that can be 
defaultprovided. 
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultNursing posts are also being downbanded, 
defaultwhere nursing staff are having to accept the reg
defaultra
defaultding of their jobs. It is also where 
defaultexperienced qualified nursing posts 
defaultare replaced 
defaultwith those of a lower band or unregistered health care assista
defaultnts. The RCN has repeatedly drawn attention to these issues and the risk to patient safety they represent. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default              
defaultNurse staffing levels and skill mix have a direct impact on the health outcomes that can be achieved. 
defaultThe Government should mandate the use of
default staffing levels tools
default which allow for local flexibility and variability
default. In too many cases we are seeing patients suffer because of inadequate nurse staffing levels. In 
defaultseveral
default recent 
defaultGovernment commissioned reports this correlation 
defaultbetween nurse staffing
default levels and patient outcomes has been 
defaultidentified; most recently by Sir Bruce Keogh in his review of 14 NHS trust with above average outliers in mortality rates
default. These trusts were put under ‘special measures’ with all of them undertaking urgent reviews of t
defaultheir nurse staffing levels. 
defaultIt is clear that these strains have been brought about by financial constraint. 
defaultStaffing levels and skill mix must be planned and based on a sound clinical rationale, not budget availability.
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default              
defaultThere is now an overwhelming e
defaultvidence base for the use of mandatory safe staffing levels; it is now time to act on this evidence.

default4.0default              defaultEffectiveness of the mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in the NHS.default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultNHS England is currently reviewing the funding 
defaultallocation formula that is used to allocate funds to CCGs across England
default.The proposed revisions to the allocation formula mean that there will be no weighting for levels of deprivation in local areas, or which have poor health outcomes. Instead, the new a
defaultllocation formula will be based on the predicted demand for health
default 
defaultcare for the population as a whole. Some of the biggest losers in terms of NHS funding cover the same areas of the country where we have the highest incidences of chronic and long-term illn
defaultess.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultResearch published by the HSJ and the University of Liverpool on 7th October 2013 shows that, under the new proposed formula
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultThe RCN is committed to reducing inequalities in access to health care. The 
defaultRCN
default believes that the funding allocation should continue to have a
default 
defaultmixed 
defaultsystem of weighting to reflect levels of deprivation 
defaultand also the age of populations 
defaultin local areas, or which have poor health outcomes.  
default&#xa0;
default5.0default              defaultProspects for the long-term viability of NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts. default&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultThe NHS continues t
defaulto face one of the most significant financial challenges in its history. The anticipated continuation 
defaultand increase 
defaultof costs saving measures within the NHS beyond 2014/15 will inevitably result in even further pressures on the delivery of services. The RCN h
defaultas consistently highlighted that current funding is unlikely to meet the costs of the rising health demand.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultDespite the stated intentions of politicians, health experts and NHS mangers to move services from acute hospitals into the community, both to 
defaultreduce costs and to have more person-centred care, the RCN on the whole has found very little clear evidence of this shift actually happening on the ground. 
defaultMoving care away from secondary settings in to the community must be seen as key to achieving meani
defaultngful efficiencies and service redesign. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultThe RCN believes that NHS organisations need to work together to provide real service transformation that brings care closer to home and integrates care around the patient. This can result in efficiency savings and benefit patients, but will require co-ope
defaultration between trusts and investment in the short-term.

default6.0default              defaultThe impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savingsdefault&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultThe King’s Fund reports
default that l
defaultocal authority spending on social care has fallen for four years in succession, and fewer people are using publicly funded care than ever before. With 87 per cent of local authorities setting their eligibility criteria at substantial or higher, it h
defaultas become much harder for people 
defaultto access care
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultR
defaulteducing the spending on social care  will inevitably 
defaultlead to an increase in need and also the further complication of individuals requiring care. The NHS and nursing staff, both in acute and communit
defaulty settings, are then required to fill the growing gaps in social care provision for patients with increasingly complex conditions.

default  
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultReadmissions
default,
default or the so-called ‘revolving door’
default,
default are a result of insufficient support in social care or community settings. Nursing staff
default frequently
default experience the frustratio
defaultn of seeing a healthy patient discharged into community care, only to see them 
defaultreadmitted into acute setting
defaults
default weeks down the line owing to the absence of appropriate community care.  
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultThe Care Quality Commission’s 
defaultThe state of health and adult social 
defaultcare in England: an overview of key themes in care in 2011/12
default found that 
defaultif discharge arrangements and planning for discharge are not sufficient, there is an increased risk of emergency readmission,
default the national average for emergency readmissions within 0-
default7 days of discharge that required at least an overnight stay was 2.5 per cent, but this increased to  3.8 per cent
default 
defaultfor emergency readmissions within 8-30 days, where external factors were more likely to contribute to the readmission.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultA recent report 
defaultfrom the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation illustrated what we are hearing from our members. It showed that the number of elderly patients who have been readmitted following early discharge has risen from 3,658 in 2001/2 to 6,810 in 2010/11, a rise of 6
default9 per cent. The report also showed that the situation had worsened in the last three years
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default              
defaultDelayed discharge figures can be used to quantify the levels of pick up by the NHS of social care needs.  On any one day a significant number of patients (ap
defaultprox
defaultimately
default 4,000 in England), mostly over the age of 75, are being cared for on an acute ward in hospital when they could be cared for in the community.  In 60
default per cent
default of these 
defaultcases it is
default caused by social services failing to meet their responsibilities
default;
default 
default they are either not assessing the patient for community care or cannot provide the care the patient needs to be able to leave the acute care setting
default.
default&#xa0;default7.0default              defaultThe impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the defaultadditional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budgetdefault&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultThe additional funding taken from the NHS budget - £1 billion a year by 2014 - is intended to be used for partnership working between the NHS and social care
default providers
default, to 
defaultallow for more people to be cared for in the community.  However, this funding is not ring-fenced and the RCN is concerned that this money is not being spent directly on this. The King’s Fund
default shares this concern
default and reports that t
defaulthe transfer of NHS resourc
defaultes is helping, but not always in the way intended – 
defaultto 
defaultprovid
defaulte
default additional capacity for care. Of the money allocated from the NHS to promote joint 
defaultworking this year, 32 per cent (£253 million) is being used to offset cuts 
defaultto
default loca
defaultl
default authority 
defaultservices and to 
defaulthelp meet demographic pressures.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultUsing the NHS budget to bail out social care goes against the Government's pledge to ring-fence and protect NHS spending. Without ensuring that these funds are spent on providing social care services, the NHS is still
default faced with filling the gaps in social care provision with all its associated costs and problems described above
default,
default but with £1 billion less funding.
default&#xa0;
default8.0default              defaultProgress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care servicesdefault&#xa0;default8.1
default              
defaultIntegra
defaulttion of health and social care services is not only seen as providing patients with
default timely access to seamless care, but also a way of eliminating costly duplication of services and ensuring patients are given the care 
defaultthey need in the right setting.
default Howeve
defaultr, integration of health and social care services in England is still very much piece meal an
defaultd individually programme based.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultWhile there are many excellent examples of integrated care delivery across the country, including specific teams, projects an
defaultd processes, many of which are led or designed by nurses, there is a wide variation.
default Some examples have been enabled by the development of NHS Care Trusts, integrated or pooled budgets, and the Department of Health’s Health and Social Care Integration Pro
defaultgramme (HSCIP)
default. However, there have been inconsistencies in policy and project implementation with no significant learning mechanisms in place or application of best practice.
default We hope that the Government programme of integration ‘Pioneers’ is successful i
defaultn developing a tangible way forward in this area. 
default&#xa0;
default8.3
default              
defaultFunding issues also impact on the ability to integrate services, as RCN members are increasingly informing us, multi-disciplinary teams are being left short of critical impact from social workers and 
defaultother disciplines owing to budgetary cuts.  This means that patients with complex needs are not benefiting from crucial multi-disciplinary 
defaultservices
default, which look at their needs
default holistically
default and aim to ensure that their patient journey is smooth.
default     
default&#xa0;
default8.4
default              
defaultD
defaultespite the notable effort of nursing and other care professionals, the structures, processes and systems in place have not consistently been designed around the service 
defaultuser to allow integrated care. 
defaultIf integrated care is to become a system-wide reality, t
defaulthen consistent political
default focus and leadership at local 
defaultand national levels are needed to ensure appropriate mechanisms, including funding,
default are in place
default 
defaultenable 
defaultthe delivery of joined up care at all levels
