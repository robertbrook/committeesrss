[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.              The purpose of our submission is to persuade Parliament to include in the forthcoming Deregulation Bill two clauses that would, if enacted, prevent the use of the country’s green lanes by recreational motor vehicles. The result would be to end the significant and well-documented damage to green lanes caused by such vehicles. Green lanes would be made safe for walkers, horse-riders and pedal-cyclists to use, in peace and quiet. &#xa0;2.              The proposed clauses to be included in the Bill are:&#xa0;

[[[1.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognized as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be reclassified as Restricted Byways]]]&#xa0;3.              The reason for proposing this clause is based on two important distinctions: (1) The difference between “sealed” and “unsealed” ways. Green lanes are to all intents and purposes “unsealed” i.e. they are not sealed with tarmac or concrete. (2) The difference between, on the hand, the ordinary roads network, i.e. the sealed tarmacadamed motor roads and, on the other hand, the unsealed tracks – the green lanes – that pass through the countryside.&#xa0;

[[[When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.]]]&#xa0;4.              The reason for proposing this clause is to overcome a serious problem with the procedures for imposing Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) – the legal entities that prohibit non-essential motor vehicles from using green lanes. Currently, no matter how compelling and how popular – e.g. demonstrated by large number of signatures to a petition – may be a request from the public to the local authority for the imposition of a TRO, the Authority can flatly turn down that request. There are no grounds for appeal against that decision.&#xa0;5.              We strongly support the formal submissions made regarding the Deregulation Bill by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Movement, the Green Lanes Protection Group, the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
