default2. Summarydefault&#xa0;defaultA summary of the challenges facing defaultpassenger transport in isolated communities defaultdrawing on points made defaultin this submission is given defaultbelowdefault-default default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3. defaultContext / Backgrounddefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultThe Chair of the Committee, Louise Ellman MP, has 
defaultsaid :-
default “People from different communities across the UK should have access to adequate transport services. We will be looking at how best to meet the needs of passengers in isolated communities, including rural areas, island communities, and suburban or urban areas with poor transport connections”.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultIn August 2006 TWNW published 
defaultits 
defaultstudy of Rural Transport Funding. We believe the Committee may find it helpful to visit 
default this as it complements much of our submission.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultRising relative prosperity and consequential increased car ownership post World War II created a Rural Transport Problem which by the time of the 
defaultBeeching
default 
default rail closures was beginning to stir the Nation’s conscience.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 T
defaulthe then Government responded by creating a committee chaired by Prof
defaultessor
default Jack 
default which found that public transport in rural areas was essentially 
defaultunremunerative
default and thus, in today’s terms, non-commercial and proposed providing a subsidy in the form of a rebate of the tax paid by the operators in providing rural services 
default. It also discovered that the suggestion most frequently made to them of Minibuses providing rural services was “by no means a universal panacea”
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultBy the time PTEs and Local Transport Authorities (LTAs) were created 
defaultby the Transport Act 1
default968 all “stage carriage” 
default services qualified for Fuel Duty Rebate 
default(FDR) 
defaultwhich became the default support mechanism for rural transport services, and also increasingly, as this consultation exercise obviously recognises, for services in similarly isolated communities. Off Peak 
defaultSunday  and
default evening services in many suburbs and small towns are now only marginally commercial by virtue of the F
defaultDR 
defaultfor which they still qualify. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultIt was recognised that deregulation of the bus industry 
default(under the Transport Act 1985) 
defaultcould deprive rural services of any cross subsidy from licensed commercial services and thus financial support over and above FDR might be called for. The 1985 Act created a Rural Transport Development Fund (RTDF), administered by the Rural Development Commission (RDG) and later by the Countryside Agency (
defaultCoAg
default) 
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.7 
defaultOne of the beneficiaries of RTDF was Royal Mail, who in the late 1980’s significantly grew their network of Post Buses. This was at the peak of an ill
default-
default fated parallel and mainly urban commercial “minibus revolution”. Few commercial minibuses or Post Buses survive today!
default&#xa0;
default3.8 
defaultWhen the Coalition Government disposed of 
defaultCoAg
default  in
default 2011 
default  the professional skills of their officers and partners 
default were lost (see question 1). A (formula based) Rural Bus Grant and a Rural Transport Challenge (for which operators or procurers had to bid) were carried forward but only for the short term, and are now defunct, “replaced” by non
default-
defaultrural
default-
defaultspecific Better Bus Areas (BBAs) and Local Sustainable Transport Funds (LSTF). Bus operators currently appear far more concerned about the future of BSOG which is fast being decoupled from Fuel Duty.
default&#xa0;
default3.9 
defaultTWNW concluded in its 2006 report 
default that where rural transport funding is limited to 
defaultc
defaultapital expenditure it is generally sub optimal, since operators require long term 
defaultr
defaultevenue funding if non
default-
defaultcommercial services are to be protected. The report noted the revenue implications of capital spending and proposed the mainstreaming of 
defaultr
defaultevenue funding.
default&#xa0;
default3.10 
defaultT
defaultW
defaultNW note
defaults
default that the Committee 
defaultis
default particularly interested in the provision of bus and rail services, as well as the role of Community Transport services”.
default&#xa0;
default3.11 
defaultBy definition
default 
default Community Transport 
default(CT) 
defaultis not public transport, although Community Buses can be. Rural Communities have a long tradition both of offering lifts to neighbours and of car sharing. It was the legalisation 
default of car sharing for a (non
default-
defaultcommercial)
default 
default“fare” (sufficient only to recover operating costs) which encouraged the development of 
defaultCT  
default. The sector has expanded greatly in the last 
defaulttwo
default years, with some large social enterprises prepared to tender for marginal services in areas of low 
defaultdemand
default 
default. It was pleasing to note the easements made by the Local Transport Act 2008 to assist operators of small passenger carrying vehicles (including taxis) wishing to provide (or reinstate) marginal registered local services 
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.12 
defaultThe Association of Community Rail Partnerships 
default(ACORP) 
defaulthas succeeded in facilitating bus/rail co-ordination at a few rural stations, some of which have also participated in parallel ACORP station adoption schemes. 
defaultHowever 
defaultin most instances a lack of co-ordination between bus and rail transport is 
defaultstill 
defaultthe rule rather than the exception with many bus services not serving the village/town stations, and
default,
default where they do
default,
default not connecting 
defaultwell 
defaultwith each other
default’
defaults services. Better co-ordination would enable a station to serve many surrounding villages. In some cases the rail service provided does not tie in with local needs - e.g. 
defaultthe 
defaultLancaster - Leeds service does not allow commuting from the 
defaultLancs
default/Craven villages to either destination thus minimising rural job opportunities. We should also not forget the need for rural station car parks which allow rural access to public transport into towns and cities - historic land sales have removed practical parking facilities from many rural stations.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the problems of buses serving rail stations is that 
defaultadditional travel time 
defaultcan be caused to 
defaultpassengers not using th
defaulte station.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1. How do Government and local authorities identify demand for defaultpdefaultassenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultIn the 1980s and 1990s now defunct “
defaultquangos
default” such as the Rural Development Commission and the Countryside Agency had a small but significant role in encouraging and funding rural transport.  They developed robust Transport Needs Analysis 
defaulttools 
default. Valuable human capital in these organisations and the “partnerships” 
default  they formed has now been largely lost. There is concern that the newly to be created and nebulous Local Transport Bodies will lack the necessary size and competencies.
default&#xa0;
default2. To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport in isolated communities?default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultBecause support for rural services has often in the past been through capital funding, a considerable number of relatively new Disability Discrimination Act compliance vehicles are now in service. Meeting DDA will mean than within a short timescale vehicles will need to be compliant. However meeting accessibility criteria, though commendable, is only half a solution where the problem is the lack of any public transport at all. This marginalises whole groups of potential passengers like concessionary pass holders (with no registered local bus service on which to use their pass) and young persons. Many C
defaultT 
defaultschemes are limited to registered passengers 
default(e.g. users of a day care centre)
default rather than the public at large. 
defaultW
defaulthere there is a passenger need which can only be met by CT then there should be a method of short term membership for visitors to the area
default 
default- someone staying with a relative might be an example.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultPerversely, many funds on which LTAs have in the past relied have been constrained by a requirement that services they seek to rescue should be in some way “innovative”.
default 
defaultThis has led to bids for services benefiting a new or additional clientele or incorporating an unneeded extension or diversion to make them innovative.  In extreme cases some LTAs have been known to ignore a need to replace a service because of the difficulty of meeting government or funders’ innovation 
defaultcriteria 
default. Often in such cases all the LTA wants to do is to secure funding for the continuation of 
defaulta service th
defaultat already satisfies established needs.
default&#xa0;
default 3. What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?default&#xa0;
default4.4 T
defaulthe overriding
default 
defaultchallenge
default is poor patronage, giving rise to high levels of revenue support, particularly challenged by current public spending constraints
default. 
defaultThese constraints also give rise to 
defaultcost/staff reductions in 
defaultL
defaultT
defaultA  departments
default which hinders proper planning.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultDespite the easements in the Local Transport Act 2008
default,
default deregulation and competition laws 
default can, and often do, discourage the integration of services within and between modes.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 LTA cross boundary services can be problematical. Such services 
defaultoften have 
defaultunco-ordinated
default connections and Northern Rail 
defaultfor example

default(CRPs) 
defaultto become a body containing representatives from 
defaultlocal government 
defaultand rail may also help but an involvement of bus operators in the CRP system would be helpful.
default&#xa0;
default4. How can these challenges be overcome?default&#xa0;
default4.7 
defaultThere is a need
default,
default in addition to capital funding
default,
default for ongoing revenue support. This should be mainstream and not just short term (which in the long run ha
defaults
default been shown to be 
defaultunsustainable 
default), also protected in some way.
default 
defaultAn appropriate fund could be established to replace the RTDF providing, in addition to capital, guaranteed revenue streams - 
defaulti.e

default 
defaultfencing
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.8 Eligibility 
defaultto use 
defaultCommunity Transport is often misunderstood and an 
defaultenigma 
default to
default many people. This is important when we realise that visitors from the city - to attractions; walking etc - are an important rural economic benefit. More use of these buses by 
defaultvisitors to the area 
defaultto return to their cars/stations etc would add to revenue and open access to the countryside. Dales Bus 
defaultseem
default to have done a lot to provide such services but knowledge of their exist
defaulte
defaultnce remains thin.
default&#xa0;
default4.9 
defaultLegislation is required to simplify the regulation of small passenger carrying vehicles with eight or 
defaultfewer
default passenger seats which currently may be operated as part of a voluntary car sharing agreement, under Restricted PSV O-licences issued by the Traffic Commissioners or under taxi/private hire vehicle licenses (issued by local authorities).
default&#xa0;
default4.10 
defaultThe example of the Royal Mail in allowing passengers to share some of the spare capacity on suitably converted mail vans is unfortunately unlikely to be repeated soon, but the principle of hybrid vehicles carrying goods and passengers has the potential to be developed 
default&#xa0;
default4.11 
defaultThe uncertainty surrounding the future of BSOG should be addressed. A grant  based on fuel used (a proxy for mileage) would assist rural transport operators more than one based on patronage, which will by definition be low in isolated communities.
default&#xa0;
default5. How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;default4.12 T
defaulthere has been a significant increase in this decade in the number of Community Bus services operating under section 22 Permits. Whilst welcome, this still represents a small proportion of (mainly) rural services. Potential passengers remain confused as to their eligibility to travel on section 19 services which are generally Demand Responsive

default(
defaultDRT
default)
default 
defaultand 
defaultnot available to the public at large 
default (as referred to above – Question
defaults
default 2
default and 4
default). 
default&#xa0;
default4.13 
defaultPublic Transport services in all areas, but especially
default defaultin isolated and rural areas, generate significant cross sector benefits. For example, old persons’ domiciliary care may be reduced by the provision of a service which allows them to shop independently rather than rely on their home help,
default 
defaultwith subsequent cost savings for the taxpayer. The cost of the help and the benefits to 
defaultthe elderly 
defaultof their consequential
default 
defaultimproved mental health and independence are rarely, if ever, passed to the procurer of that service.
default 
defaultTWNW has always argued that the LTAs should be able to capture these cross sector benefits.
default&#xa0;
default4.14 
defaultLTAs can do much to encourage the establishment of brokerages between the social enterprises they support, so that better utilisation can be made of the many small buses operated by their social services, the NHS’s Patient Transport Services, schools within their control and voluntary and other bodies. 
defaultIndeed there is a duty under Section 88 of the 1985 Act
default to 
defaultco-operate which could include a
defaultrrang
defaulting 
defaultbrokerages as a way of extracting value for money from all forms of public
default 
defaultsupported transport services
default.
default 
defaultNot all CT Social Enterprises are entirely Community Bus based, some of the larger ones have branched out beyond the provision of Community Buses with success in operating tendered bus services and even preserved 
defaultrailways 
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6. To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?default&#xa0;
default4.15 
defaultA reliable bus or rail service is generally preferred to demand responsive transport which can either be not available to the public at large or require potential users to pre-register and pre-book. However DRT can be designed 
defaultto operate more efficiently and at less cost than Registered Local Services and should be supported where no obvious alternatives exist. Given that the usually low volume of passengers is such that a regular service by time or day is unlikely to be best value for money flexible journeys tailored to passenger 
defaultneed can
default 
defaultoften 
defaultbe 
defaultmore appropriate.
default&#xa0;
default4.16 
defaultIn such cases the LTA might be encouraged (or required) to fund 
default the operator to accept concessionary passes and/or to subsidise a lower fare but this does raise issues about passenger commitment for a specially purchased service which L
defaultT
defaultA's need the power to deal with where there is abuse of the service.
default&#xa0;
default4.17 
defaultTWNW has already recently given evidence 
default to the committee on the potential for using taxis at separate fares to replace some marginal services.
default&#xa0;
default7. What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?default&#xa0;
default4.18 
defaultBus and rail fares are a critical consideration when discussing public transport in isolated areas where demand is low. Whilst rail fares are regulated, bus fares generally
default are
default 
defaultnot 
default, so it can often be cheaper to make the same trip by train than by bus in rural areas. Station to station rail fares are readily available but bus fares are hard to ascertain in advance of 
defaulttravel 
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.19 
defaultThe advent of 
defaultconcessionary traveldefault has undoubtedly grown ridership (a goal of the last Government) but obviously cannot do so in places where there are no bus services. Operators and LTAs each cite market distortions and arbitrary disbursement regimes. It is not unusual for 
defaultLTAs  to
default use discretionary powers to extend concessionary travel to DR
defaultT
default, C
defaultT
default and local rail services. 
defaultHowever whilst some LTA's may allow use on rail this is a rarity in rural areas.
default This leaves pass holders in the country doubly disadvantaged with 
defaultfewer
default services and many they cannot use. In some area the only bus is the school bus and the late start of concession allowance sometimes means these cannot be used either.
default 
defaultL
defaultT
defaultA’s 
defaultshould be 
defaultmore understanding in allowing special case use by local
default people
default of rail services
default, though we recognise that there are cost implications
default.  
default&#xa0;
default4.20 
defaultTravel is highly price sensitive and on the supply side fares will reflect, 
defaultinter
default 
defaultalia
default, amounts of subsidy received. There could be a case, therefore, for some degree of re-regulation of fares, especially in rural areas where often there is 
defaulta
default monopoly of one operator offering no choice.
default&#xa0;
default4.21 
defaultHowever there is some degree of control 
default over competition and this can have unintended consequences, such as preventing subsidised rural services from picking up or setting down along parts of their route where  competition with either tendered or commercial service(s) might arise. The introduction of multi operator ticketing would be helpful in reducing these consequences.
default&#xa0;
default4.22 
defaultWe hope our submission will be of help to the Committee and we are, if asked, prepared to enlarge on our observations either verbally or in writing.
