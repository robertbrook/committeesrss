"              \n              \n              \nWritten evidence from\n Enterprise Rent-A-Car (CMI0019)\n&#xa0;1. Overview&#xa0;\nThis paper has been prepared by Enterprise Rent-A-Car in response to the Transport Select Committee’s call for evidence on Government \nproposals for reducing the number and co\ns\nts of whiplash claims\n, which\n \nEnterprise \nhas \nwelcome\nd\n.\n&#xa0;\nEnterprise ha\ns expressed concerns on a number of occasions about the huge increase \nthat the business faces \nin \nexposure to \npersonal injury liability costs\n, which\n have\n tripled since 2005\n.\n \nThese costs ultimately impact the\n \namount that consumers pay for rental services. While\n we wish to ensure that those with serious and legitimate injuries are able to gain the compensation they need, we support furt\nher action to \nmak\ne it harder for anyone wanting to make a fraudulent or exaggerated claim to abuse the system. \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the Transport Select Committee\n’\ns \nefforts \nto expedite the implementation of the current proposals for whiplash and soft-tissue personal injury claims as set out in the Ministry of Justice’s Command Paper. \nWe also welcome the opportunity to comment further on the measures set out in this paper. \nIn \nparticular\n,\n we would \nlike to see the Government act swiftly \nto re\ndress the burden of evidence so it \nis balanced between claimants and defendants. \nWe believe that the t\nwo key measures \nto achieve this\n are\n, firstly,\n the implementation of mandatory medical rep\nort\ns\n before offers of compensation and\n, secondly,\n the reconsideration of raising the small claims threshold track. \n&#xa0;\n2. Introduction to Enterprise Rent-A-Car&#xa0;Enterprise Rent-A-Car was founded in 1957 and is an industry leading, multi-national company with approximately one million vehicles in its global rental fleet and an \nannual turnover of more than $16.4\n billion. In the UK its current rental fleet is over 5\n5\n,000 vehicles, which makes \nit\n the largest car rental company as well as the biggest private purchaser of vehicles in the\n country. Enterprise employs 3,5\n00 people in the UK across \nmore than \n370 office and branches – more sites than any other rental company.\n&#xa0;\nAs a large fleet owner and operator, Enterprise’s business model depends on being able to effectively manage the liability exposure associated with \nthe company’s\n vehicles. Currently this exposure is our third highest expenses after fleet acquisition cost\ns and personnel. However, our fleet liability costs have been significantly impacted in recent years by the huge increase in personal injury claims, with the growth driven by low value claims for soft-tissue injuries. This trend has seen our liability cost\ns triple since 2005\n, which is \nconsistent with the broad pattern identified by the MoJ.\n&#xa0;\n3. Independent medical panels&#xa0;Enterprise \nsupports\n t\nhe introduction of independent medical pa\nnels to assess whiplash claims. \nTo\n ensure that the independence and impartiality of medical panels \nwe also strongly support a system of peer review. \nW\ne would like to see\n the implementation of these panels\n at th\ne earliest possible opportunity.\n&#xa0;\nWe \nback \nmeasures which intend to make the \nmedical examinations of claimants’ soft-tissue \ninjuries\n rigorous and \nperformed\n \nby practitioners who do not have vested interests in the outcome of the diagnosis. One our main concerns with the current system is the conflict of interest for practitioners ex\namining the injuries of whiplash claimants. Many practitioners benefit financially from further referrals and often have close working relationships with legal organisations \nthat\n use their services.\n \nWe want to see the Government ensure that conflicts of in\nterest for all accredited professionals are reduced as far as possible \n&#xa0;\nD\niagnosis\n of whiplash injuries\n can be flawed when based so\nlely on self-reported symptoms and \nwe \nstrongly agree with\n the move towards shifting the burden\n of proof onto the claimant.\n \nThe current system means \nthat whiplash claims can be paid out by insurers on no more objective evidence than the word of a claimant that they suffered an injury in a car accident\n.\n We also believe that with soft-tissue injuries, where diagnosis can be diffi\ncult, medical practitioners should have access to the details of the accident and to the claimant’s medical history. \nWe welcome the Committee’s request for further informa\ntion from the government and suggest \nthat the Committee \ncontinue to \npress the Governm\nent \nto carry out a\n more comprehensive assessment of the medical examination process. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition\n, we believe the burden of evidence should shift more towards the claimant an\nd would like to see the Government consult on measures to require claimants to provide more information in support of a claim. \nWhile the Government has argued in its most recent response to the Committee that mandatory medical reports could negate the need\n for evidence that a claimant saw a medical practitioner shortly after an accident, we would continue to\n agree \nwith\n the Committee’s suggestions \nin this area as they can help assess a claimant’s claim of injury if significant time has elapsed since an accid\nent. We also agree with the Committee’s\n \nrecommendation of \npro\nvid\ning\n evidence of the impact of collision in relation to their injury.\n&#xa0;\nEnterprise\n welcome\ns\n the introduction of accreditation for practitioners but would like to see further information on how t\nhe system of accreditation would work. It is important that the accreditation system is rigorous and ensures that \npractitioners remain impartial in their examination. However, we are concerned that this system will not go far enough without proper regulati\non. The Association of British Insurers\n (ABI)\n \npresented evidence to the Committee \nwhich showed \nthat claimants are often triaged over the phone before their consultation and many have limited time, just a few minutes, with the medical expert prior to that e\nxpert giving their diagnosis. The ABI also said that several insurers highlighted reports of \nsome general practitioners\n carrying out in excess of 2,000 medico-legal reports a year\n,\n in addition to running their own practice\ns\n. We believe that any system of accreditation would need to ensure that proper consultation time is given for whiplash claimants and \nthat \nscrutiny could be given to \ninstances where \npractitioners compile a large number of whiplash reports. \n&#xa0;\nWe would also l\nike to see the Government provide more information on the proposal to provide equal access to medical reports for \nclaimants,\n insurers and the courts. \nWe are confident that this measure will contribute to reducing exaggeration on medical reports and will en\nable defendants to challenge disputed circumstances surrounding an accident. Enterprise therefore\n believe\ns\n this is an important step in redressing the balance of \njustice between claimants and defendants and \nwould like to see further details on this measure\n before \na swift implementation process in \nspring\n 2014.\n&#xa0;\n4. Small Claims Track Threshold&#xa0;\nThe current limit of £1,000 for personal injury claims means that a large proportion of RTA PI claims are going through the courts, which leaves defendants facing \nsignificantly higher costs and litigation for personal injury claims brought against them.\n \nEnterprise believes that \nraising the threshold for small claims to £5,\n000 would ensure defendants are not saddled with extensive legal costs and litigation for cl\naim\ns of a relatively low value.\n \nIt would also help reduce the cost of whiplash claims\n overall\n by \nending the requirement\n for costly legal advice in many \nclaims above £1,000.\n&#xa0;\nWe also believe that increasing the small claims track is\n fundamental to \nensuring \nfraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims are challenged\n. By ensuring a far greater number of claims proceed through \nthe small claims track\n, the cost of challenging such claims significantly diminishes. \nIn the past, the cost of challenging \npotentially \nfra\nudulent or\n exaggerated claims has caused insurers to consistently make pre-medical report offers to claimants to offset potential litigation costs of challenging a claim outside the small claims track.\n&#xa0;\nThis issue has been longstanding and we would highlight that in 2005-06, the Citizens Advice Bureau, in written evidence to the Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into \nThe Courts: small claims\n, suggested that with proper regulation there was a “stron\ng argument” that more cases could be dealt under the small claims track, possibly by raising the threshold for personal injury cases to £5,000. The Bureau also said that is supported the principle behind a wide small claims jurisdiction to ensure consumer \nfriendliness and end the requirement to hire expensive legal professionals.\n&#xa0;\nWe accept that there are concerns, especially from stakeholders in the personal injury sector, that genuine claimants could be inhibited in \ntheir access to justice and entitlement\n t\no full compensatory amounts\n, however \nwe \nbelieve\n that a number of approaches\n,\n which would offset these concerns,\n \ncould be \ntaken if a decision was made to introduce\n a higher small claims threshold. \n&#xa0;\nWe agree with the Transport Select Committee that the Go\nvernment should provide analysis on ways in which the small claims track could be combined with routine submission of expert evidence. We believe that if\n the threshold rise was accompanied by\n measures to make medical reports mandatory for all personal inju\nry claims, this would ensure that all cases have received an expert assessment, regardless of the claims track used\n.\n We would also suggest that the introduction of independent and impartial medical boards will provide a rigorous assessment of all claims, wh\nich would alleviate c\noncerns over accessibility and proper scrutiny\n for claimants under the small claims track.\n&#xa0;\nEn\nterprise believes that confidence in a higher threshold would grow after introduction, \nas claimants became more aware of the procedures and system for small claims. It is important that claimants feel comfortable and assured that they can pursue genuine cl\naims without the necessity for costly legal advice and representation. We believe the Government could offset some of these concerns by providing \ninformation and advisory tools. \nEnterprise believes that the Government should explore this approach in conjun\nction with an analysis of the impact of the electronic portal on claims management and costs, as suggested by the Committee.\n \nEnterprise \nwould add that it would \nbe willing to work with other stakeholders in\n the car rental sector to provide information and s\nupport to those going through the small claims track.\n&#xa0;\nEnterprise would be interested to hear from the Government over what approaches it has considered towards the introduction of a higher threshold for the small claims track. Thi\ns includes \nany \nassessment of the impact of mandatory pre-medical reporting \non the small claims system \nand \nwe\n agree with the Committee that the Government should provide analysis on ways in which the small claims track could be combined with routine submission of expert e\nvidence. \n&#xa0;\n5. Pre-report claim offers&#xa0;\nWe strongly support the \nproposal to introduce a rule which would ensure that a claim can only proceed once a medical examination and report have been completed.\n This would underpin a comprehensive system of medical ex\namination for all whiplash claims and would end the practice of pre-medical offers, which have been linked to the rise of spurious and opportunistic claims. \nTogether with a system of accreditation it would also ensure that claimants \nare \nall equally subject\n to a\n rigorous but f\nair examination of their injuries. Enterprise would like to see the Gove\nrnment \nundertake a proper assessment on the impact of introducing this rule and explore the possibility of introducing this rule in the package of currently propose\nd reforms. \n&#xa0;\n6. Other&#xa0;\nEnterprise agrees with the Transport Select Committee that the Ministry of Justice should give its view on issues involved in limiting the right to compensation where a claim is shown to be grossly exaggerated. \nWe would suggest that \nclaimants who are attempting any form of deception within a system which is \nintended\n to help the vulnerable \nshould be penalised, including the \npossibility of forfeiting\n part or \nthe \ntotal sum of their entitled compensation.\n&#xa0;\nEnterprise\n also\n strongly\n \nsupports\n the proposal to encourage the use of the Insurance Fraud Register\n and believes that any tool which allows organisations involved in the claims process to share data on known fraudsters to be universally beneficial.\n&#xa0;\n7. Conclusion&#xa0;We believe that the Government has made some significant progress in the proposals outlined in the whiplash Command Paper but would like to see \nfar greater detail on the proposals outlined in the paper, such as the accreditation system for medical examiner\ns. We would urge that not only is greater detail provided on the measures set out in the Command Paper, but the Government expedite the implementation of the main proposals outlined such as the independent medical panels. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition to this we would lik\ne to see the Government take proper account of measures suggested which have the potential to curb exaggerated and fraudulent claims and bring down \nlitigation costs whilst\n safeguarding the ability of genuine claimants to receive full compensation. \nThis inc\nludes \nthe provision to all\n stakeholders in the \nclaim\ns process\n equal access to reports \nand \nintroducing a rule to ban pre-medical report offers which fail to examine cases on their proper merits.\n&#xa0;\nEnterprise also urges the Government to revisit the issue of \nthe small clai\nms track\n threshold and believes that concerns over the access to justice for genuine claimants w\nould be alleviated through the implementation of a rigorous medical examination process \nfor all claims\n.\n This would ensure that all cases are assessed rigorously by several medical experts \nwhich would ensure genuine cases receive the attention they deserve, even in the absence of costly legal representation.\n \nWe also believe tha\nt confidence in the system woul\nd \nsignificantly grow after the first few years of implementation when stakeholders have \nhad time to familiarise\n themselves with the process.\n&#xa0;We look forward to the Government’s response\n to the Committee’s call for evidence and look forward to engaging wit\nh the Government over its consultation over the implementation of the current proposals.\n \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;1 | Page\n"
