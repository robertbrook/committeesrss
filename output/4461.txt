                                          Written evidence from Enterprise Rent-A-Car (CMI0019)

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1. Overview]]]&#xa0;This paper has been prepared by Enterprise Rent-A-Car in response to the Transport Select Committee’s call for evidence on Government proposals for reducing the number and costs of whiplash claims, which Enterprise has welcomed.&#xa0;Enterprise has expressed concerns on a number of occasions about the huge increase that the business faces in exposure to personal injury liability costs, which have tripled since 2005. These costs ultimately impact the amount that consumers pay for rental services. While we wish to ensure that those with serious and legitimate injuries are able to gain the compensation they need, we support further action to make it harder for anyone wanting to make a fraudulent or exaggerated claim to abuse the system. &#xa0;We welcome the Transport Select Committee’s efforts to expedite the implementation of the current proposals for whiplash and soft-tissue personal injury claims as set out in the Ministry of Justice’s Command Paper. We also welcome the opportunity to comment further on the measures set out in this paper. In particular, we would like to see the Government act swiftly to redress the burden of evidence so it is balanced between claimants and defendants. We believe that the two key measures to achieve this are, firstly, the implementation of mandatory medical reports before offers of compensation and, secondly, the reconsideration of raising the small claims threshold track. &#xa0;

[[[2. Introduction to Enterprise Rent-A-Car]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Enterprise Rent-A-Car was founded in 1957 and is an industry leading, multi-national company with approximately one million vehicles in its global rental fleet and an annual turnover of more than $16.4 billion. In the UK its current rental fleet is over 55,000 vehicles, which makes it the largest car rental company as well as the biggest private purchaser of vehicles in the country. Enterprise employs 3,500 people in the UK across more than 370 office and branches – more sites than any other rental company.&#xa0;As a large fleet owner and operator, Enterprise’s business model depends on being able to effectively manage the liability exposure associated with the company’s vehicles. Currently this exposure is our third highest expenses after fleet acquisition costs and personnel. However, our fleet liability costs have been significantly impacted in recent years by the huge increase in personal injury claims, with the growth driven by low value claims for soft-tissue injuries. This trend has seen our liability costs triple since 2005, which is consistent with the broad pattern identified by the MoJ.&#xa0;

[[[Independent medical panels]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Enterprise supports the introduction of independent medical panels to assess whiplash claims. To ensure that the independence and impartiality of medical panels we also strongly support a system of peer review. We would like to see the implementation of these panels at the earliest possible opportunity.&#xa0;We back measures which intend to make the medical examinations of claimants’ soft-tissue injuries rigorous and performed by practitioners who do not have vested interests in the outcome of the diagnosis. One our main concerns with the current system is the conflict of interest for practitioners examining the injuries of whiplash claimants. Many practitioners benefit financially from further referrals and often have close working relationships with legal organisations that use their services. We want to see the Government ensure that conflicts of interest for all accredited professionals are reduced as far as possible &#xa0;Diagnosis of whiplash injuries can be flawed when based solely on self-reported symptoms and we strongly agree with the move towards shifting the burden of proof onto the claimant. The current system means that whiplash claims can be paid out by insurers on no more objective evidence than the word of a claimant that they suffered an injury in a car accident. We also believe that with soft-tissue injuries, where diagnosis can be difficult, medical practitioners should have access to the details of the accident and to the claimant’s medical history. We welcome the Committee’s request for further information from the government and suggest that the Committee continue to press the Government to carry out a more comprehensive assessment of the medical examination process. &#xa0;In addition, we believe the burden of evidence should shift more towards the claimant and would like to see the Government consult on measures to require claimants to provide more information in support of a claim. While the Government has argued in its most recent response to the Committee that mandatory medical reports could negate the need for evidence that a claimant saw a medical practitioner shortly after an accident, we would continue to agree with the Committee’s suggestions in this area as they can help assess a claimant’s claim of injury if significant time has elapsed since an accident. We also agree with the Committee’s recommendation of providing evidence of the impact of collision in relation to their injury.&#xa0;Enterprise welcomes the introduction of accreditation for practitioners but would like to see further information on how the system of accreditation would work. It is important that the accreditation system is rigorous and ensures that practitioners remain impartial in their examination. However, we are concerned that this system will not go far enough without proper regulation. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) presented evidence to the Committee which showed that claimants are often triaged over the phone before their consultation and many have limited time, just a few minutes, with the medical expert prior to that expert giving their diagnosis. The ABI also said that several insurers highlighted reports of some general practitioners carrying out in excess of 2,000 medico-legal reports a year, in addition to running their own practices. We believe that any system of accreditation would need to ensure that proper consultation time is given for whiplash claimants and that scrutiny could be given to instances where practitioners compile a large number of whiplash reports. &#xa0;We would also like to see the Government provide more information on the proposal to provide equal access to medical reports for claimants, insurers and the courts. We are confident that this measure will contribute to reducing exaggeration on medical reports and will enable defendants to challenge disputed circumstances surrounding an accident. Enterprise therefore believes this is an important step in redressing the balance of justice between claimants and defendants and would like to see further details on this measure before a swift implementation process in spring 2014.&#xa0;

[[[4. Small Claims Track Threshold]]]&#xa0;The current limit of £1,000 for personal injury claims means that a large proportion of RTA PI claims are going through the courts, which leaves defendants facing significantly higher costs and litigation for personal injury claims brought against them. Enterprise believes that raising the threshold for small claims to £5,000 would ensure defendants are not saddled with extensive legal costs and litigation for claims of a relatively low value. It would also help reduce the cost of whiplash claims overall by ending the requirement for costly legal advice in many claims above £1,000.&#xa0;We also believe that increasing the small claims track is fundamental to ensuring fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims are challenged. By ensuring a far greater number of claims proceed through the small claims track, the cost of challenging such claims significantly diminishes. In the past, the cost of challenging potentially fraudulent or exaggerated claims has caused insurers to consistently make pre-medical report offers to claimants to offset potential litigation costs of challenging a claim outside the small claims track.&#xa0;This issue has been longstanding and we would highlight that in 2005-06, the Citizens Advice Bureau, in written evidence to the Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into The Courts: small claims, suggested that with proper regulation there was a “strong argument” that more cases could be dealt under the small claims track, possibly by raising the threshold for personal injury cases to £5,000. The Bureau also said that is supported the principle behind a wide small claims jurisdiction to ensure consumer friendliness and end the requirement to hire expensive legal professionals.&#xa0;We accept that there are concerns, especially from stakeholders in the personal injury sector, that genuine claimants could be inhibited in their access to justice and entitlement to full compensatory amounts, however we believe that a number of approaches, which would offset these concerns, could be taken if a decision was made to introduce a higher small claims threshold. &#xa0;We agree with the Transport Select Committee that the Government should provide analysis on ways in which the small claims track could be combined with routine submission of expert evidence. We believe that if the threshold rise was accompanied by measures to make medical reports mandatory for all personal injury claims, this would ensure that all cases have received an expert assessment, regardless of the claims track used. We would also suggest that the introduction of independent and impartial medical boards will provide a rigorous assessment of all claims, which would alleviate concerns over accessibility and proper scrutiny for claimants under the small claims track.&#xa0;Enterprise believes that confidence in a higher threshold would grow after introduction, as claimants became more aware of the procedures and system for small claims. It is important that claimants feel comfortable and assured that they can pursue genuine claims without the necessity for costly legal advice and representation. We believe the Government could offset some of these concerns by providing information and advisory tools. Enterprise believes that the Government should explore this approach in conjunction with an analysis of the impact of the electronic portal on claims management and costs, as suggested by the Committee. Enterprise would add that it would be willing to work with other stakeholders in the car rental sector to provide information and support to those going through the small claims track.&#xa0;Enterprise would be interested to hear from the Government over what approaches it has considered towards the introduction of a higher threshold for the small claims track. This includes any assessment of the impact of mandatory pre-medical reporting on the small claims system and we agree with the Committee that the Government should provide analysis on ways in which the small claims track could be combined with routine submission of expert evidence. &#xa0;

[[[5. Pre-report claim offers]]]&#xa0;We strongly support the proposal to introduce a rule which would ensure that a claim can only proceed once a medical examination and report have been completed. This would underpin a comprehensive system of medical examination for all whiplash claims and would end the practice of pre-medical offers, which have been linked to the rise of spurious and opportunistic claims. Together with a system of accreditation it would also ensure that claimants are all equally subject to a rigorous but fair examination of their injuries. Enterprise would like to see the Government undertake a proper assessment on the impact of introducing this rule and explore the possibility of introducing this rule in the package of currently proposed reforms. &#xa0;

[[[6. Other]]]&#xa0;Enterprise agrees with the Transport Select Committee that the Ministry of Justice should give its view on issues involved in limiting the right to compensation where a claim is shown to be grossly exaggerated. We would suggest that claimants who are attempting any form of deception within a system which is intended to help the vulnerable should be penalised, including the possibility of forfeiting part or the total sum of their entitled compensation.&#xa0;Enterprise also strongly supports the proposal to encourage the use of the Insurance Fraud Register and believes that any tool which allows organisations involved in the claims process to share data on known fraudsters to be universally beneficial.&#xa0;

[[[. Conclusion]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We believe that the Government has made some significant progress in the proposals outlined in the whiplash Command Paper but would like to see far greater detail on the proposals outlined in the paper, such as the accreditation system for medical examiners. We would urge that not only is greater detail provided on the measures set out in the Command Paper, but the Government expedite the implementation of the main proposals outlined such as the independent medical panels. &#xa0;In addition to this we would like to see the Government take proper account of measures suggested which have the potential to curb exaggerated and fraudulent claims and bring down litigation costs whilst safeguarding the ability of genuine claimants to receive full compensation. This includes the provision to all stakeholders in the claims process equal access to reports and introducing a rule to ban pre-medical report offers which fail to examine cases on their proper merits.&#xa0;Enterprise also urges the Government to revisit the issue of the small claims track threshold and believes that concerns over the access to justice for genuine claimants would be alleviated through the implementation of a rigorous medical examination process for all claims. This would ensure that all cases are assessed rigorously by several medical experts which would ensure genuine cases receive the attention they deserve, even in the absence of costly legal representation. We also believe that confidence in the system would significantly grow after the first few years of implementation when stakeholders have had time to familiarise themselves with the process.

[[[&#xa0;]]]We look forward to the Government’s response to the Committee’s call for evidence and look forward to engaging with the Government over its consultation over the implementation of the current proposals. &#xa0;December 2013
