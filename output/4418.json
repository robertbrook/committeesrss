"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Global Campaign for Education (GCE) UK submission to IDSC inquiry on Disability and Development&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome DFID’s recent commitments on disability, which are an important \nstatement\n to developing country partners and other donors. \nThe UK is the leading donor for education, so \nits\n commitments could help to \ngalvanise international action to include disabled children and young people in education.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled people are among the \nmost marginalised from education but also from other services, and f\nace \ndaily\n discrimination.\n \nDFID should therefore develop a high level, cross-cutting strategy on disability, championed at a senior level and sensibly phased towards the equitable inclusion of disabled people in all UK aid programmes.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, change will only happen with \nrigorous accountability. DFID should move towards making the \ninclusion of disabled people \na requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding, w\nith all education programmes a \npriority.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA disability-inclusive approach will not become reality without full implementation by DFID’s Country Offices and in-country partners. Top-\nlevel strategy must be complemented by \nembedding disability-inclusion into core processes, with strong \naccountability mechanisms to ensure delivery a\nt \ncountry level, training and support for all country advisers, and \ndisaggregation of all programmes by disability\n alongside gender\n, age\n and other \nrelevant \nfactors\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should \n‘mainstream’ disability into its education programmes, with an emphasis throughout on inclusive education that benefits all children, especially the most marginalised. \nAll teacher-training supported by DFID should incorporate inclusive teaching methodology.\n \nThis should be supported by the necessary resources, specific timeframes \nfor implementation, and clear accountability. A\nll programmes \nshould be \ndisaggregated to show h\now they reach disabled children, \nyoung people and \nteachers\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn line with a \n‘twin track’ approach, DFID should put in place \nadditional resources and support to reach disabled people. \nDFID should develop a \n‘\nDisabled Children’s Education Challenge Fund’ using the learning from the Girls’ Education Challenge Fund, and \ninvest in research to strengthen the evidence base on \ndisability\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability must be a core priority for post-2015 as part of a wider focus on equity. The UK \nshould\n continue to champion the ‘\nleave no one behind’ principle, the \ndisaggregation of all targets by disability, and the principle\n that disabled people have to be included in order for target\ns to b\ne considered achieved\n. \nA goal of \nquality education for all, prioritising the most marginalised, is urgent\nly needed\n \nto address\n the crisis in educational equity and quality\n.\n \nThe UK should \nlead\n a ‘\nGlobal Partnership on Disability Data’ to improve t\nhe data and\n \nevidence \non disability\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Global Campaign for Education is an international education campaign, with over 80 national coalitions across all continents. GCE UK is the UK branch of this campaign: we are a coalition of 30 international \ndevelopment NGOs and education unions\n. GCE UK maintains a strong link with \nparliament, working closely with the \nAPPG\n on Global Education for All, and through the ‘Sen\nd My Friend to School’ campaign\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability must be recognised as a core development issue. \n80% of disabled people live in developing countries and the UN calls them “\nthe world’s largest minority”\n.  It is clear that the MDGs, and post-2015 goals, will not be achieved without the inclusion of dis\nabled people. Ensuring that disabled people are included \nin\n \nUK\n aid programmes is an obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe MDG of achieving universal primary education by 2015 is “not on track”, with 57 millio\nn children of primary age still out of school and progress all but stalled. \n250 million children are in school but failing to learn\n. \nT\nhe \nGlobal Campaign for Education argues\n that in most countries, \ndisabled children are more likely to be out of school than any other group of children. \nIn Nepal, \nan estimated \n85% of all children out of sc\nhool are disabled. In Ethiopia\n, fewer than 3% of disabled children have access to primary education\n. \nA study by Plan International of its 1.4 million sponsored children recently \nconcluded that the likelihood that a \ndisabled \nchild did not attend school was often more than ten times greater than a child without a disability\n. \nDisabled children are \nalso \nless\n likely to remain in school and\n move\n up to the next year group\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany statistics quoted ab\nout disability are contestable \nbecause \nof \nthe invisibility of disabled people from national statistics in developing countries. The data gap has a major impact on ed\nucation, where \neven basic data on disabled children in and out of school is frequently absent.\n Planning for the inclusion of disabled children is \nalso \nchallenging without information about the type of impairment children have (whether long term physical, \nm\nental, intellectual or sensory impairment\n). \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability is highly interrelated to other aspects of inequality. \nT\nhe exclusion of certain populations including \ndisabled \npeople but also girls and women, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, and those\n living in remote rural areas or informal settlements has hindered progress towards the MDGs. \nDifferent dimensions of exclusion overlap, \ne.g.\n \nadolescent \nethnic minority \ngirls\n living with disabilities experience triple exclusion. \nO\nf all the excluding factors, \ndisability has the strongest correlation with poor educational outcomes.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome DFID’s recent commitments, particularly \nthat all schools built with direct DFID support will be accessible, an\nd the commitment to work with partners to improve data and evidence on disability\n. These \nannouncements\n are \nan important statement to other donors and developing countries that the UK is serious about \nincluding\n \ndisabled people\n \nin\n its aid programmes. \nGCE UK\n ha\ns worked hard to support DFID \nto strengthen its focus on disabled children’s education, and we \nurge it to build on this progress to become a world leader on disability, in particular \nby committing that all teacher-training supported by DFID will incorporate inclusive teaching methodology.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile there is \nstrong momentum, and \nDFID has \nexamples of good practice\n, it has \nno formal framework for the systematic inclusion of disabled people throughout its programmes, and \nno formal checks are in place to ensure that disabled p\neople benefit from UK Aid.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID has\n previously recognised the importance of a \n“twin-track” approach to disability which sees the active “mainstreaming” or inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of the\nir develop\nment work (eg.\n ensuring education programmes support disabled \nchildren\n), coupled with additional inputs and resources which recognise the marginalisation of disabled people and \nprovides them with\n target\ned support.\n \nThis approach should now be thoroughly embedded in DFID’s work.\n&#xa0;4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID has previously taken steps to integrate disability within its education programme. GCE UK welcomed DFID’s production in 2010 of a ‘\nGuidance Note on Education for Children with Disabilities’\n, and later worked with DFID to produc\ne a summary ‘one-pager’ \nwhich was sent by DFID to all Country Offices\n. However, a \n2012 \nGCE UK survey of six countries\n suggested that \nonly half of these Country Offices were aware of the ‘one-pager’, and only one was implementing it. \nIn its report ‘\nEquity \nand Inclusion for All in Education\n’\n, \nGCE UK \nanalysed 14 DFID Country Operational Plans and found \njust two mentions of disability. The report \nraised concern that\n, although there were examples of good practice,\n there was \nlittle evidence of DFID engaging in strategic planning to ensure that all education initiatives prioritised marginalised groups – such as disabled children - in a comprehensive way.\n \nDFID \ncould draw many lessons from its success in mainstreaming gender and prioritising girls and women, and co\nuld apply these to disability. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB\narriers to education for \ndisabled people \nare the result of \ncomplex factors involving social, economic and political systems, and the way in which schools engage with \ndi\nsabled \nchildren, \ntheir families\n and teachers\n. Responding to these barriers requires strategic cross-sector planning. \nDFID should therefore develop a high level, cross-cutting strategy on disability, and implement this in a sensible phased approach at all levels of its work. This strategy could draw lessons from \nDFID’s Strategic Vision for Girls and Women\n, and the disability strategy of\n Australia’s development agency\n. The strategy should be \nchampioned at a senior level, clearly emphasising its importance \ninternally and to partners\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, \na paper strategy will not lead to sustainable change without \nrigorous accountability. \nDFID should move towards making the inclusion of disabled people a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding, with \neducation\n programmes a\n priority.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGCE UK’s analysis highlights that\n the \ndevolved nature of DFID’s operations creates challenges for consistent implementation. \nS\ntrategy must be complemented by \nembedding disability responsiveness into core processes, with strong \naccountability mechanisms to ensure delivery at the country level, \ntraining and support for country advisers, and \ndisaggregation of all programmes by disability. The inclusion of disabled people should be \na requirement of all DFID Business Cases and Country Operational Plans. \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA network of \ntrained \nleads/focal points in all DFID Country Offices should report back regularly to a central senior \n‘Disability Champion’ on planning, implementation and evaluation of inclusive programmes. These leads could also \nbe\n \ncontact points for consultation with external groups of (and groups representing) disabled people. \nHowever lessons should be learned from \nthe\n experience\n of gender mainstreaming. DFID\n \nhas\n \npreviously \nhighlighted \nthat gender focal points often proved disappoi\nnting due to a \n\"...lack of clarity about their roles and responsibilities [and] lack of management support\n\"\n. \nAnother risk is that \nstaff may assume that since the focal point is ‘doing disability’ no-one else has to do anything. \nFocal points therefore need to be given sufficient resources, time and authority.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGCE UK welcomes DFID’s existing support for \nDisabled People’s Organisations. DPOs\n play \nan important role,\n \nempower\ning\n disabled people to participate in decisions that affect them, and \nchanging\n attitudes towards disability\n in society at large. \nDFID should continue to strengthen its support for DPOs, using a range of approaches that deliver effective participation in-country. \nDFID should also \nplace a clear requirement on its Country Offices to involve DPOs in programme development, implementation and evaluation.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGCE UK is strongly supportive of \nDFID’s leading position as the largest bilateral donor to basic education. We urge DFID to use t\nhis position to \nfurther prioritise disability-inclusion in education, which would \ngalvanise other donors and see a step-change in support \nto disabled children, \nyoung people\n and teachers\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nU\nnequal access to education is \noften \nexacerbated by the prevalence o\nf a medical deficit model of disability, which perpetuates the notion that disabled children must adapt in order to ‘integrate’ into mainstream schooling, or be educated in a separate ‘special’ education system\n. At the same time, the nature of \nchildren’s \nimpairments is often poorly understood, resulting in inappropriate service provision. \nGCE UK argues \nthat \ncarefully planned and implemented inclusive education strategies, utilising \nthe expertise \nof\n staff in rehabilitation services and special education schools\n, \nthat support the \ninclusion of disabled children in mainstream schools are appropriate in the large maj\nority of cases. Such strategies \nenhance the \nquality of teaching and learning for all children, not just disabled children. DFID should \nembed inclusive education as a leading principle of its education programmes, thereby strengthening the focus on disabled children \nand \nsimultaneously\n strengthening education systems and \nthe \nquality of learning \nfor all children.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile \nDFID’s commitment on accessible school construction\n is welcome, it is important to note that directly-funded school construction forms only a small part of DFID’s work. Similar commitments\n \nshould be made in areas which constitute a greater part of DFID’s spending and portfolio, ensuring that provisions are made for accessible \nschool infrastructure, transport and learning materials.\n DFID is a stro\nng leader i\nn supporting \nteacher training, which is fundamental to meeting MDG 2 and \nimproving the quality of education\n. In order to be inclusive of disabled children, teachers need to learn about and practise inclusive education during pre-service and in-service training\n. \nDFID should integrate inclusive education throughout the teacher-training it supports, and seek to also train specialised teaching assistants to support children with complex needs within a mainstream environment. \nDFID should \npromote the recruitment of disabled teachers including the reasonable adjustments needed in sch\nools for this\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nshould \nplay\n an influencing\n role in \nits \ndialogues with developing country governments to encourage disability-inclusion in the education system and governance. \nO\nne systemic barrier is the problem of \ndivided ministerial responsibility, \nwhere education for disabled children is the responsibility of a different ministry than that responsible for the education of non-disabled children\n. This division usually reflects the view that the disabled need welfare rather than equity\n in educational \nopportunity and \noften leads to segregated responses to disability. \n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe marginalisation of those with disabilities is often compounded by other \ninequalities\n. For instance, girls with disabilities are less likely to get an education, vocational training or\n employment than boys with disabilities or girls without disabilities\n. \nDFID should build on its strong work to reach marginalised girls – such as the Girls Education Challenge Fund – by ensuring that such mechanisms support disabled girls. \nT\nhere are good\n examples of GEC projects \nthat \naim\n to do this\n, and we urge DFID \nto \nmake this systematic\n by \nestablishing support for disabled girls as a requirement of all GEC projects.\n&#xa0;6.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn line with the “twin-track” approach, DFID should put in place \nadditional resources to support disabled children and young people’s education. DFID\n should\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID’s guidance \nhighlights\n that “\neducating children with disabilities is a good investment”\n.\n Prioritising disability \nwithin DFID’s work should not be \nthought of\n in terms of an additional cost burden. O\nn the contrary, \nthe costs of not investing in support to disabled people are much greater to the countries where DFID is seeking to deliver development progress. By one estimate, \nUSD 135–192 \nbillion is lost from the GDP of low-income countries per annum as\n a result of disabled people’s exclusion from the labour market\n.\n \nE\nducating disabled children reduces welf\nare costs and future dependence, and \nincreases children’s own potential productivity and wealth creation in turn help\ning\n to alleviate poverty\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn ma\nny cases, \nwhere disabled people and their needs are considered early in the planning of projects, additional costs are minimal. Directly relevant to DFID’s \ncommitment on \nschool construction, UNICEF note that \nthe costs of integrating accessibility into new \nbuildings can be negligible (less than 1% of the total cost) compared to the higher cost of making adaptations to completed buildings.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should invest in projects to improve disability statistics to better measure progress for disabled people. For instance, working closely with the \nUN \nWashington Group on Disabilit\ny Statistics and with UNICEF, and\n providing financial \nand technical assistance\n to national statistical agencies.\n It is also important to invest in partici\npatory qualitative research looking at the impact of \nthe \ni\nnclusive \np\nrojects being rolled out, such as looking at “Quality of Life” measures, in order to establish best practice. \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should lead in working with other \neducation \npartners to improve support\n for disabled children. This includes other \neducation \ndonors such as \nAusAid, and multil\naterals \nlike the \nGlobal Partnership for Education (GPE), UNESCO and the World Bank. \nDFID\n \nis represented on the Board of\n the GPE, whose \nnew strategic plan includes a \nstra\ntegic focus on ‘\nReaching Every Child\n’\n, with inclusive education a priority within its \nimplementation plan\n. \nThe GPE is the only multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into school for a quality education, and with the GPE’s replenishment t\naking place in 2014 the UK has an important opportunity to \nstrengthen\n GPE’s focus on disabled children.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;9.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Prime Minister and DFID\n \nhave\n already shown \nimportant\n leade\nrship on the need for post-2015 \ng\noals to \ninclude disabled people\n. GCE UK welcomed the \nUN \nHigh Level Panel’s\n (HLP)\n recommendations as they relate to disability, \nincluding\n the \"\nno one left behind\" transformative shift; the emphasis on the need for \ndisaggregation of indicators by disability for meas\nuring progress; and the commitment that \"\nno target should be considered met unless met for all social groups, including people with disabilities\"\n. \nWe urge DFID to champion these elements as the negotiations continue.&#xa0;\n9.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nnsuring disabled children and other marginalised groups are both in school and learning is a critical challenge for post-2015. The \nHLP’s illustrative goal\n “\nProvide q\nuality education and lifelong learning\n” rightly emphasises that there is an education crisis with millions denied their right \nto education.\n \nWe \nurge DFID to fight for an education goal and targets for universal, free, quality early childhood, primary and secondary education that tackles inequalities and guarantees education rights for all. Progress in access to education, completion and learning outcomes should be disaggregated by disability alongside gender, wealth, age, location and other relevant factors.&#xa0;\n9.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn order to better measure progress there needs to be a “data revolution” and nowhere is that more true than \nwith\n disability. \nGCE UK urges DFID to play a leading role in a multi-stakeholder ‘\nGlobal Partnership on Disability Data’\n to improve the visibility and focus on disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n GCE UK \nmember organisations \nlisted\n at \nhttp://groupspaces.com/GCEUK/pages/members\n.\n \nhttp://www.sendmyfriend.org/\n UN Enable (2013), ‘Factsheet on Persons with Disabilities’, \nhttp://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=18\n See: \nh\nttp://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=14&amp;pid=150\n \n \nAccording to UNESCO.

Seventy-six per cent of children with disabilities are estimated to be out \nof school in Sierra\n Leone. The programme will therefore include activities to mobilise communities to foster inclusion of girls and boys with disabilities, removing specific barriers to access and providing a safe and secure learning environment\n.” – p10, \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225715/Education_Position_Paper_July_2013.pdf\n \nDFID (2010), \n‘Guidance note: Education for children with disabilities –\n improving access and quality”\n, \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government\n/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/67664/edu-chi-disabil-guid-note.pdf\n \nMetts, R.L., World Bank (2000), ‘\nDisability Issues, Trends and Recommendations for the World Bank\n’, \nhttp://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf\n \n \nAs quoted in DFID (2010), \n‘Guidance note: Education for children with disabilities –\n improving access\n and quality”\n, \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/67664/edu-chi-disabil-guid-note.pdf\n \nUNI\nCEF (2013), \n‘The State of the World’s Children 2013: Children with Disabilities’, p19, \nhttp://www.unicef.org/sowc2013/files/SWCR2013_ENG_Lo_res_24_Apr_2013.pdf\n \nAs ou\ntlined in GPE’s new ‘Strategic Plan 2012-2015’ - \nhttp://www.globalpartnership.org/media/docs/library/GPE_Stategic_Plan_2012-2015_English.pdf\n \nUN High Level Panel \nof Eminent Persons \non \nthe \nPost-2015 Development\n Agenda\n (2013), \n‘A New G\nloba\nl P\nartnership:\nE\nradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable \ndevelopment\n’, \nhttp://www.post2015hlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UN-Report.pdf\n \nGCE UK (2\n013\n),\n ‘No Child Forgotten: Educa\ntion and Inequality Post-2015’\n, \nhttp://www.sendmyfriend.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/GCE-Post-2015-Policy-Paper.pdf\n"
