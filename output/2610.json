"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Eric and Esme Bricknell [OLS0062]&#xa0;\nWE SUPPORT THE CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT COMMITTEE IN THEIR CONCERN THAT THE INTERNET NEEDS TO BE A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED, FOR EVERY ONE OF US.My wife and I\n write \nas mature\n citizens\n and active grandparents\n who have considerable family responsibili\nties – towards our children, \ngrandchildren\n and the wider community\n. \nWe support the Inquiry which we believe\n could lead to greater\n \nprot\nection,\n safety \nand co\nhesiveness\n \nin t\nhe family setting\n. \nWe believe there are many parents, concerned about what their children can access on the internet, who would love to have some kind of filter to protect them, even from unintentional access to \ndefiling material, but don’t have the know-how to install it. By providing such protection by default, the Government will protect these vulnerable households.\nWe \nwrite as having \nparticipated \nin the governorship of an independent\n school – Focus School, Bra\nmley \nCampus\n -\n responsible \nfor the safety and welfare of successive \nannual \nintakes of school children\n,\n entrusted to our care by their parents and guardians\n.  \nT\nhese young people\n are our future – the developing potential who will give c\nharacter and strength \nto our country in oncomin\ng years\n.\nWe acknowledge the tremendous advantage that young people have in being able to access the internet to tap the stores of information. They can use this positively in their education to produce intelligent responses to ques\ntions in any of their subjects.\n Thus they\n develop intellectually and academically\n.\n We should however \nprotect them during their \nyears of study so that they keep\n their minds fresh and\n clear\n focus\ning\n on academic achievement and developing into responsible adu\nlts. Nothing will debilitate and detract more than \nhours of \noccupation with \nonline programs which arouse\n lust and \ncan lead to \nimpure relationships.\nWe write as\n Christian\ns, treasuring\n the message of the Holy Bible\n -\n the word of God – it provide\ns light to ou\nr path and shows what’s right and what’s\n wrong.\n \n Two\n very simple,\n brief example\ns\n from scripture:\n in his letters to Timothy,\n a younger person,\n the apostle Paul \nsays\n \n‘Keep thyself pure’ (1Tim 5 v23) and ‘B\nut youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness...\n’\n \n(2 Tim \n2\nv22)\n.\n These injunctions \nwould \npowerfully support \nthe expressed concerns of the CM and S Committee.\nAnd\n then\n I write as having \nsome \nyears of experience in Health and Safety \nat my workplace\n; you\n identify hazards, eliminate or reduce them and ensure \nthat residual risk is managed\n for the health and safety and well-being of all concerned.\n The Government\n has a DUTY OF CARE, expressed\n \ninitially in\n legislation, to eliminate as far as possible the \nhazards of moral and physical corruption, which are\n to be fo\nund on the internet.\nSo\n \nwe are \nvery \nconcerned about the danger lurking\n only a few clicks away \nfrom every child \n– what \nis regarded \nas legitimate adult material is defiling and damaging\n, especially\n to the minds and \nmorals of young people\n – and a very large percentage of our young have viewed such material before they have reached the age of 16\n!\nIt is most disturbing to see that while the Government \nhas legislated to protect under-\nage persons from the sal\ne of tobacco products, alcohol, \ndru\ngs, knives etc, they are left to their own devices when exploring the internet – and less than half of parents have taken the trouble to install filters on their home IT equi\npment to protect their children!\nWE FULLY SUPPORT THIS MOVE BY THE GOVT CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT COMMITTEE TO INTRODUCE POLICY CHANGES AND TO INVEST IN RESOURCES OF A TECHNICAL NATURE, AND POLICING, TO RESTRICT THE TOO EASY ACCESS TO ADULT MATERIAL.WE SUPPORT DEFAULT BLOCKING OF ALL ADULT CONTENT AS THE STANDARD SETTING ON ALL INTERNET ENABLED DEVICES SOLD IN THE UK TO STOP CHILDREN SEEING WHAT IS NOT SUITABLE.WE ASK FOR THE PROVISION OF BETTER AGE-VERIFICATION SOFTWARE WE SUBMIT THAT WE AS MATURE AGED PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO ACT TO PROTECT OUR YOUNGSTERS – DO NOT TAKE THE EASY OPTION OF ALLOWING ‘FREEDOM OF CHOICE’.&#xa0;\nSeptember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
