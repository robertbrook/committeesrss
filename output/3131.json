"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from CRH Electrical Solutions &#xa0;\nI have been watching the video of the meeting of the 2nd September and I can only add how completely ridiculous the current situation is.\nUnder Gas Safe there is a single scheme with assessments \nevery 4 or 5 years.\nUnder “electrical” safety there are several schemes and all of which require annual assessments, plus the annual charges are far too high.\nAll we want is a single body, no profit making, presenting a single voice to the homeowners and s\nparkys.\nPlease, please, please curb the stupidity of the current situation.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
