[[[Question 1]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Police and Crime Plan for&#xa0;Warwickshire&#xa0;2013/17 doesn't contain any crime reduction or detection targets.&#xa0;Please find attached a screen shot of the force performance dashboard which gives a flavour of how force performance is measured.&#xa0;

[[[Question 2]]]&#xa0;

[[[Review in Warwickshire and West Mercia]]]

[[[Crime Bureau]]]&#xa0;In July 2013, following the HMIC report in Kent, ACC Morgan was requested&#xa0; to undertake a review of the crime recording processes and practices in both Forces&#xa0; and assess any 'risk' of similar issues. The work and report was submitted by the lead within the Crime Bureau, DCI Tony Love, in July and the strategic lead, ACC Morgan, summarised the report with the following comments:-&#xa0;

[[[“My assessment is that both forces operate robust oversight and compliance mechanisms that ensure adherence to HOCR and where the balance between individual decisions and oversight ensures good decision making.” ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Since that date, there has been progress within the Crime Bureau to align and develop processes and DCI Love has refreshed his original report (July 2013). This report to the Committee highlights the key safeguards which are in place to ensure ethical crime recording is taking place and adds further strength to the comments from ACC Morgan as above.&#xa0;

[[[Crime Registrar]]]&#xa0;On 1st October 2013, the Crime Registrar function transferred across to Business Assurance &amp; Improvement.&#xa0; This move has provided the opportunity for the Crime Registrar to commence independent, structured audits across both forces.&#xa0; Spreadsheets have been developed and implemented outlining both methodology and evidence of the audit work to date. This work is undertaken daily and core themes identified are raised with relevant individuals.&#xa0; The Senior Detectives Forum, chaired by the Crime Manager, remains a good platform in which to raise any Home Office Counting Rule (HOCR) issues. The approach moving forward is to develop this work and initially the audits, with the resources available, will consist of daily reviews of logs on both STORM &amp; OIS.&#xa0; These audits will consist of the following:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 100% of logs opened as Sexual Offences.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;A minimum (per month) of - 20 logs opened as Burglary, 20 logs opened as Violence, 20 logs opened as Robbery, 20 logs opened as Antisocial Behaviour. &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;Audits across both force’s crime recording systems for - No Crimes, Reclassifications, Outcomes (Community Resolutions, Cautions, PNDs etc) and ad hoc audits resulting from FOIs or a steer from the National Crime Registrar.&#xa0;It is recognised that the sample sizes are small (with the exception of the 100% Sexual Offences) and this potentially poses a risk in respect of maintaining robust &amp; resilient processes to Crime Data Integrity.&#xa0; The Crime Registrar function, working across both Forces, is currently being designed and this risk is recognised within that work.&#xa0;

[[[Crime Manager]]]&#xa0;The Crime Manager leads the monthly Senior Detective Forum and the Crime Registrar has a standing agenda slot within this forum to address issues of HOCRs. A recent communication/message was circulated by the Crime Manager and Registrar jointly to reinforce the key issues around crime recording expectations. This is attached at Appendix C for information.&#xa0;Finally, in recognition of some of the issues relating to crime recording, the DCCs have recently communicated to the workforce via postmaster on what their expectations are. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Warwickshire Police Position]]]&#xa0;Within Warwickshire Police the Crime Recording and Volume Crime Management Unit have been developed under a crime management model referred to as Operation Rome.&#xa0; This model has delivered a management process based upon a purist’s view of dedicated crime management.&#xa0; The Unit manages crime investigations, screens crime and provides effective operational oversight and investigative supervision to all offences and investigations within the Force.&#xa0;The Warwickshire model has been adopted across the Alliance in September 2013 as the Alliance Crime Bureau with consistent roles, structures and procedures.&#xa0;The Unit is managed by a Detective Chief Inspector who is supported by two Crime Bureau Managers.&#xa0; The core roles and crime screening and management (undertaken by four Crime Decision makers) and telephone investigation and administration support / crime inputing.&#xa0;The key safeguards that are in place to ensure ethical crime recording are.&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; The Force Crime Registrar retains oversight and command of the crime recording process.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All Crime recording, screening, classification and decision making processes are managed by CDM’s.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Within Warwickshire Police every single crime is viewed and validated by the CDM’s, who ensure that they are recorded correctly in line with NCRS and HOCR guidance.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;All Crime Recording is Centralised; the creation of the Crime Bureau Crime Decision makers has been critical to ensuring compliance and integrity.&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;All STORM incidents (command control) are subject to an audit process on a daily basis, to ensure that appropriate incidents which have not been crimed, are recorded in line with national guidelines.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;There is also a back end validation process, which is carried out by the two data validation clerks before any crime enquiries are finalised and filed.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;All Iconic crime (Burglary, Serious Sexual Offences, Robbery, etc) recorded on STORM is subject to 100% scrutiny by the Force Crime Registrar.&#xa0;

[[[Summary ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The recommendations made for both Forces in previous HMIC inspections receive ongoing attention. Both Forces have been visited in recent weeks to commence Stage 1 of the HMIC inspection around crime data integrity. Stages 2 and 3 will follow in Spring 2014.&#xa0;&#xa0;The detail provided within this report confirms that both Forces have, and continue, to develop structures and processes to ensure ethical crime recording in line with HOCRs. This provides the appropriate assurance that the recorded crime figures for both Forces are correct. &#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
