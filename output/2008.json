"&#xa0;\nRosemary and Rodrigo Gomez – Written evidence&#xa0;\nMy husband and \nmyself\n are private individuals unassociated with any organization. \nAs keen walkers and admirers of the British countryside and its magnificent national parks, we wish to write to the committee to request their consideration of the following:\nin all national parks and areas of natural beauty .\nAs things are, it is really upsetting to meet rowdy and sometimes dangerous cars and bikes along the paths mostly used by walkers and cyclists.  \nThey are destructive of the paths and noisily out of place in these peaceful and beautiful areas.  \nTax-payers money is constantly being spent repairing green lanes damaged by off-roaders.  \nRed tape is involved when agencies have to be pressured into doing these repairs and when rights of way claims have to be processed.\nThe government is trying to save money,  and deregulate, is it not?  \nThese requests would seem to be in keeping with those aims and contribute to the betterment of the environment for ourselves and our descendants.\nThank you for this opportunity to express \nour views.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
