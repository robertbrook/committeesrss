"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Alan Gadian (IPC0020) &#xa0;\nThe opinions expressed below \nrepresent my personal scientific views and do not represent those of NCAS\n.\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary.&#xa0;A great deal of scientific effort has gone into the IPCC report and there is a lot of good science included.  However, because of the make up of the group writi\nng this report, \nI feel that \nthere are several \nsignificant \nmajor inadequacies \nin the report, which undermine its quality.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDetails and \njustification follow\ns\n in the next section.\n&#xa0;\nDiscussion.&#xa0;\nHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?&#xa0;\nI have \nconcerns about some \nimportant \nscience \nwhich seems to have been omitted \nin the report.\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe report has chosen not to evaluate the contribution of clouds in the summary figure TS.7 attached below.  There is \nan “aerosol-cloud” factor of \n~\n0.5\n5 W/m\n2\n with \na \nrelative\n error bar up to \n~\n1.3\n W/m\n2\n. This is inadequate and underestimates the contribution \nof clouds to the radi\nation balance of the planet.  (\nDouble CO\n2\n forcing is \n~ 3.7 W/m\n2 \n)\nMarine stratocumulus \n(layer) \nclouds \ncover 30% of the ocean surface, ~ 20% of the global planetary surface.  Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models (i.e. weather fore\ncasting models) have difficulty in getting sufficient and correct cloud fr\naction / cover.  In 2008 there \nwas a large VOCALS project which aimed at understanding the processes, which generate and dissipate these clouds.\n  NWP models improved, but these solve\n the equations on grids on 1 to 10km.  Climate models have gridpoints ev\nery hundreds of kilometres,  underestimate stratocumulus cloud cover.  With incoming solar radiation of 1350 W/m\n2 \n, and a change of reflection /albedo in the equator regions from \n20% t\no 80% depending on non-cloud or cloud cover, combined with the under\n-\nrepresentation of Marine Stratocumulus clouds\n in the climate models\n, then 3.7W/m\n2 \n is far smaller than the potential errors in the reflected solar radiation.  Even a modest error in the cloud cover would le\na\nd to feedback uncertainties of 10’s W/m\n2\n. The IPCC report g\nives a negative feedback of ~ 0.5\n5 W/m\n2\n up to \n~1.3\n W/m\n2 \n \n \nfor the cloud \ncontribution. Th\nis an \nunde\nrestim\nate of the cloud component forcing, which by\n \nfar dominates the uncertainties provided by aerosols etc.\n \n(see Figure TS.7 below taken fro\nm a preparatory copy of the IPCC report)\n&#xa0;\nThe small error bars and the lac\nk of discussion\n / application is a hugely significant oversight.\n&#xa0;\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n     The methane emissions from the melting sub-Arctic permafrost are well documented in the scientific liter\natur\ne. They\n are hugely important in \nthe earth’s radiation\n balance and yet of small contribution\n in the report\n.  The \nUK \nNCAS research aircraft \nused \nby UK scientists has produce\nd\n data and publications evaluating this.\n Many S\ncandinavian scientists are publishing results. \n \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/14/arctic-permafrost-methane\n.\nMethane is a gas which is \narguably 20-70 times more effective as a greenhouse gas.  However, in Fig TS.7 below, methane does n\not even appear as a gas\n of \nmuch import\nance and with \nassociated \nsmall error bars.\n&#xa0;\n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n      Furthermore water vapour is an \nimportant greenhouse g\nas.  The amount \nof water vapour, mainly found in the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere \nvery much depends\n on lower atmosphere temperatures and dynamical processes.  This is a large contributor to global greenhouse warming that should be \nmore carefully \nevaluated.  \n \n&#xa0;Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record? Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?  Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?&#xa0;\n        \n“Climate is now a weather scale process problem”. &#xa0;\n(iv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n    ”\nClimate is now a weather scale \nprocess problem`` and unless\n \nthese weather processes are understood\n and \nincluded, then \npredictions are \nvery \nlikely to \nbe \nin\ncorrect  (I consider that Prof Julia Slingo, Chief Scientist at the Me\nt Office might \na\ng\nr\nee with me on this point)\n&#xa0;\n(v)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \n    \nClimate models are unable to describe (resolve) \nsome of \nthe important processes\n which control the climate.   \nThe location\n of “blocking anticy\nclones”, high pressures in the Atlantic\n,\n largely determine the flux of warm moist air to the North Pole.  Climate models cannot resolve these large scale meteorological features, basically because the smaller scale eddies in the atmosphere, which drive and maintain these large structures, are to\no small and cannot be seen or resolved by climate models.  Thus the transport of heat to the poles (the main kinematic function of the atmosphere on the global scale) is misrepresented.  The critical differences between the Northern Hemisphere circulation,\n where the frequency of\n “blocks” are under-represented \nand the Southern Hemisphere circulation, where blocks are far to\no frequent\n,\n is important.  This inadequacy \nis of significant concern\n in the prediction of future climates\n.  The increase in intensity of \nSouthern North Atlantic hurricanes\n, observed, understood and predicted by meteor\no\nlogists, and which have significant impact o\nn the North American climate is\n not seen in climate models. The resolution in climate models is just not good enough to produce the\nm as they are driven from smaller scale convective systems and easterly waves, too small for these models.\n&#xa0;\n(vi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n      The overall Meridional Heat f\nlux \n(MHF) \nin the climate models is, for the above reasons \ngiven in section (iv)\n,\n \nnot adequate to simulate the \nflux of warm moist air to Artic regions\n.  \nThis \nissue \nis controversial\n and topical but\n \ngetting these ideas into the mainstream \nscientific discussion \nis difficult \npartly \ndue to the \nconsequence \n(\nand a negative aspect\n)\n of the peer review process\n, \nwhi\nch is by n\nature reticent to\nwards\n new ideas.  \nI would argue \nMHF \nis critically \nimportant to explain why\n the Arctic Ice melt is very much more rapid than the models \nhave \npredict\ned\n.  \nTentatively I would\n suggest, that in just a few years time, the Arctic will be ice free\n in September. (Ice-free I define as &lt; 15% broken ice).  Artic Polar ice retreats \nand advances each year, but \nFigure 1 below, shows that over the past 30 years the Arctic Ice volume has been very \nmuch \nsignificantly reduced.  This process can be reversed (a\nnd hence why the climate sceptics and the climate green lobby \nboth object to this hypothesis)  Yet\n the overall assertion is that the sophisticated climate models do NOT\n replicate this rapid decline (e\nlephant in the room) and the “climate modelling industry\n” largely ignore this.   \n&#xa0;\nIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?\n To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis summary?\n&#xa0;\n(vii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n     \nThe IPCC and the \ncurrent structures are not an effective \nmechanism.  T\nhe peer review system is excellent at ensuring a good level of\n scientific achievement.  When new ideas and approaches appear, history has shown th\nat peer review procedures are far from ideal to provide funding for \nblue sky thinking.\n  IPCC is a concensus document.\n&#xa0;\n(viii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe q\nuestion is not as simple as po\nlitical intervent\nion and control\n.\n  Certainly governments have a vested interes\nt in being re-elected and there\nfore not upsetting major commercial interests\n or electorate into a change in life style\n behaviour\n.  \n In science\n, as above, \naccepted theories \nare difficult to \nchange. History is full of such scientific challenges (\n(a) \nlongitude measurement, \n(b) flat earth etc) which cannot\n be put down \njust \nt\no political intransigence. \n \nI would argue\n also\n, the scientific\n community \nis traditionally \nconservative, \nblinkered\n a\nnd self-\npreserving\n. (e.g. \n(c\n) \nwhen US satellites lost signals going into the Venusian atmosphere, the NASA scientists said it had hit a mountain 27km high, when every \nUK \n“A”\nlevel\n geology student  knew a mountain that high would sink into the g\nround.  F\new\n \nscientist\ns \nwould accept the spectroscopic evidence of \nSulphuric acid vapour.  (d\n) the ozone hole \nwas \ndiscovered \nby Joe Farnam \n(BAS) \nwhen he contradicted\n years of NASA satellite data whi\nch said there was no problem\n.\n  Thus the sci\nentific community (and the IPCC) shou\nld take\n some of the blame.\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?\n&#xa0;\n(ix)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n      \nSome would argue that the academic scientific establishment is unable to \nrecognis\ne \nrapid change, \n(e.g. AMEG group\n hypothesis\n)\n.  New ideas \noften \nthreaten the scientific community.  They\n consider bigger computers and satellites \nalone \nwill provide the solution, rather than new scientific ideas.\n  \nAlthough\n,\n I would not go as far as\n some climate scientists who say\n,\n that the IPCC (document and report) ha\ns now become a co\nncensus document \nunable to see the “elephant in the room\n of very rapid climate change”\n and \n “\na career gravy train \nfor the scientists who have been promoted by being involved\n, and \nthe \nlure of research grants and fame\n”\n.  The report\n, in my vi\new, \nhas \nomissi\nons\n, two of which\n \nI have explained \nabove\n.  \nA\n \nmajor \nscientific \ncriticism is that \nthe report \nhas ignored major meteorological processes\n which\n some \nwould \nconsider obvious and important.\n  Blue sky research, needs to be funded by the government\n but spent wisely\n. \nThe £3 million \nfunding by EPSRC for the “SPICE” project was a classical example w\nhere government money was squandered on a project which had “good” \npeer reviewed” \nand\n was\n “acceptable”\n, yet\n has resulted in\n \na waste of \nvaluable resources\n.  \n Many s\ncientists\n and engineers \nwho understan\nd\n basic\n meteorolo\ngy and engineering\n,\n predicted failure\n yet, they \nwere ignored because of \nthe \naccepted \n“good peer review”.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1.\n&#xa0;\nA plot of the reduction in Arctic Ice volume since 1979.  The September volume (black line) has decreased from 17 million cubic kilometres to 3.6 million cubkic kilometers, and is the \nbasis of my ascertion that in just a few years,\n September Arctic Ice wi\nl\nl disappear altogether (&lt; 15% broken ice\n)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure TS.7.\n&#xa0;\nThis figure is taken from the draft report.  \n Radiative forcing of climate change.  The horizontal bars indicate the level of uncertainty. \n&#xa0;\nI have \nseveral concerns regarding \nFigure\n TS7\n. Mainly \nthat \nthe importance of clouds in the system is totally m\nisrepresented, and the “cloud” \nerror bars are totally inadequate.  \nFurther\nmore\n, m\nethane is a very important g\nreenhouse gas which has\n \nonly been included \nas a small factor\n in the report. \n  \nSimilarly, the contribution to greenhouse warming by water vapour in the boundary layer\n although\n important\n has been underrepresented\n.   \nThe measurement of w\nater vapour \nconcentrations need\n t\no be improved\n and \nthe critical \nmeteorological processes \nbetter \nunde\nrstood b\nefore such a diagram is complete\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
