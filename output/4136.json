"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by TV Licensing Watch [FBB0054]SummaryRaise the issues:\nWhy \npeople in the UK \nare \nby law denied and deprived of access to live television programme services because they cannot afford to fund the BBC or do not want to fund the BBC\n.\nWhy\n people in the UK are by law subject to legal sanction in UK courts because they cannot afford to fund the BBC or do not want to fund the BBC.\nWhy people in the UK are denied the right to exercise personal choice of \nwhether or not to \nfund the BBC\n as a norm\nal private purchasing decision.\nIntroductionTV Licensing Watch \nare \nprivate individuals who \nmonitor\n, blog\n and report on issue\ns concerning BBC tv licence, \nthe realities of BBC \nlicence enforcement activities and \n victims of the BBC tv licence enforcement reg\nime\n.\n  \nA\ns a consequence of the experiences of what\n we do we want to persuade Parliament that it is no longer appropriate that the BBC \nnor anyone else \nis funded by an enforced \nbroadcast receiving\n licence regime.  That there must no longer be any criminal or\n civil sanction used against people who cannot afford to or do not want to fund the BBC.  Bring a permanent end of \nthe by \ndenial of access \nby law \nto live television programme services because people in the UK cannot afford to or do not want to fund the \nBBC.\n To end any form of enforced broadcast receiving licence regime.\nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? 1\nIn 2012, on behalf of the BBC, Capita TV Licensing brought 181,880 prosecutions and secured 155,135 convictions for tv licence evasion.  The n\number of prosecutions and convictions for tv licence evasion have been increasing year on year and for many years and show no sign of decline.  The figures speak for themselves.  It has become increasingly evident that this increasing trend has been going \non for far too long and cannot be allowed to continue after 2016.\n  Arguably, there are as many reasons for people no having tv licences as there are people who are unlicensed.  However, the point has to be made that prosecuting and convicting people who ca\nnnot or do not want to fund the BBC\n cannot be allowed to continue.  \nAny pretence that enforcement activities carried out by Capita TV Licensing on behalf of the BBC in any way detect, prevent or reduce the “crime” of tv licence evasion have long since been\n exposed as false.  According to the BBC’s own figures approximately 3 million letters of varying degrees of threat are sent to unlicensed addresses each and every month.  That is approximately 2.6 million more unlicensed addresses than there are “no licen\nce needed” declarations.  If the BBC are to be believed there are approximately 400,000 “no licence needed” declarations on record.\n   \n2\nThere are as many reasons for addresses being unlicensed as there are unlicensed addre\nsses.  However, may we\n suggest th\nat a significant reason for the huge discrepancy between unlicensed addresses and no licence needed declarations is the simple fact that people just cannot be bothered\n with the BBC and its broadcast receiving licence\n any longer.  They have made what amount\ns to a private purchasing decision in the audio-visual broadcast market and decided that they no longer want to or need to fund the BBC.\n  People seem to have decided that what they do in the privacy of their own homes is no business of the BBC or Capita TV\n \nLicensing.\n  People are voting with their viewing habits, \npurchasing decisions, \nwallets and purses and turning their backs on the BBC and the BBC broadcast receiving licence regime.  People are rejecting the BBC and no amount of BBC enforcement \nby Capita T\nV Licensing \nwill change it and seeking to criminalise people or subject people to a civil enforcement regime for what amounts to a private buying decision \nfor\n products and \nservice\ns\n consumed \nin \nthe privacy\n and intimacy of\n their own homes \nby people in an \nexpanding audio-visual media market in which the BBC has a declining share is plainly absurd.\n3\nThere is no \nlogical \nreason why people in the UK should deprived of \nand denied \naccess to all live television programme services on the bases that they cannot aff\nord to fund the BBC and or \nthat \nthey do not want to fund the BBC.  \nMay we point out that people who purchase products advertised on television have in essence paid to watch the commercial television channels concerned as those channels are funded through a\ndvertising revenues.  Under the present BBC tv licence regime people who have thus alr\neady paid in advance to watch/\nrecord live commercial television programme services are denied access by law to those services that they have already paid\n for if they cann\not afford to or\n do not want to fund the BBC.  \nThere is definitely no reason why\n \nsuch private purchasing decisions for services consumed in the privacy of the home should be the subject of sanction whether through criminal e\nnforcement or civil enforcement f\nor that matter.\n4\nProposals to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC broadcast receiving licence by introducing a system of civil enforcement \nrecently introduced in the House of Lords \nseem to \nus\n to be as\n fundamentally flawed and as\n nonsensical as the contin\nuation of the BBC broadcast receiving licence. For example, parking was decriminalised and made subject to civil enfor\ncement \nand the number of penalty charge notices issued by civil enforcement officers employed by private enforcement companies contracted \nby local councils increased exponentially with concomitant increase\ns\n in the number of complaints about indiscriminate, vexatious and petty issuing of penalty charge notices for financial gain\n as well as the terroristic follow-up activities of bailiffs seek\ning payment\n.  \n5\nThe main reason why penalty charge notices for non-payment of the BBC broadcast receiving licence are unacceptable is simple.  The activity of watching and or recording \nlive television programme services takes place in the privacy of peopl\ne’s homes.  Making what goes on in the privacy of people’s homes\n, \nthe \nwatching and recording of audio-visual media the \nsubject of a civil enforcement regime is inappropriate, disproportionate and grossly intrusive for what is really a petty infraction\n conc\nerning a private contractual matter\n to supply\n between customer and \nlive television programme \nservice provider\n.  \n6\nAs intimated \nby the DCMS \nSelect Committee \nrequest for submissions, the audio-visual media market has burgeoned with a huge variety of platfor\nms which currently fall outside the scope of the BBC broadcast receiving licence.  Arguably, those audio-visual media platforms currently outside the scope of the BBC broadcast receiving licence should continue to remain outside the scope of the BBC broadc\nast receiving licence\n if the BBC broadcast receiving licence were to continue\n. The reason is very simple, \ndespite the obligations set out in the Charter, \nthe BBC played \nlittle or \nno part in the \nfinancing, \ndevelopment and content of such unlicensable audio-\nvisual media platforms\n which numerically far outnumber BBC channels.\n  With the plethora of audio-visual platforms now available people are free to pick and choose where they source their public service content from.  There is no longer any rational argumen\nt to restrict public service content \nto the BBC and have an enforced\n private hypothecated television access tax \nlevied by and \npayable only to the BBC to fund it.  However, any form of enforced television or live television programme service provider licensing regime is \nno longer acceptable \nin our view \nand the UK should follow Australia’s example and abolish any form of enforced b\nroadcast receiving licensing.\n7\nHowever, numerically outnumbering the BBC \nin \nthe way that they do, private channels offering unlicensable audio-visual content to the overall \nmedia \nmarket \nin the UK \ncomplain vociferously and with some justification that the \nrevenues that the BBC are guaranteed through the combination of BBC broadcast receiving licence, taxpayer funding via The Treasury for various BBC broadcast receiving licence concessions (over 75, blind) in addition to the revenues of the BBC’s commercial \nactivities through BBC Global and BBC Worldwide lead to the BBC structurally dominating and distorting the wider media markets \nand production facilities \nwithin the UK.\n8\nThere are \nfour basic \nmodel\ns to fund the BBC: tv licence revenue with merchandising, fo\nrmat and content revenues (the current model): advertising, format, content and merchandising revenues only: voluntary subscription with format, content and merchandising revenues: combination of advertising, subscription, format, content and merchandising\n revenues\n.\n9\nAlthough it is not widely known, John Reith, first BBC Director General was against the BBC being funded through licensing revenue.  \nIn 1922, \nJohn Reith preferred voluntary subscription and had no fundamental objection to the BBC \nbroadcasting advertisements and \nreceiving advertising \nrevenue. However, \nhe believed\n, wrongly as\n \nit turned out, that\n no company would be prepared to pay the advertising rates the BBC could \ndemand and \ncommand.  \nHowever, Reith disliked\n the BBC licence revenue model and argued with the Postmaster General who did not believe that the Post Office should be in the business of collecting mere subscriptions. \nReith was overruled and t\nhe BBC broadcast receiving licence was created \nas a conseque\nnce \nand\n although fundamentally flawed and regressive\n \nfor the reasons John Reith cited in 1922 \nthe BBC broadcast receiving licence \nis still current.\n10\nIn our opinion, and in this \nsubmission \nas with many other submissions from private \nparties\n it can be diff\nicult to separate opinion from fact in the matter of how the BBC s\nhould be funded post-2016, in our\n opinion the BBC should be funded by voluntary subscriptions paid by people who want to \nfund the BBC.  We\n believe that people must have the right to exercise\n their personal choice in making a private buying decision in the wider audio-visual media market.  If the BBC need to or want to supplement subscription revenues with other revenues from advertising, placement, content and format licensing and merchandisi\nng then they should be commercial decisions made by a fully privatised media company and be the subject and consequences of market forces alone.  In other words, that is the \nBBC should become a private commercial concern \nwith business development its\n only\n \ncommercial concern\ns\n.  Whether the individual potential subscriber buys into the BBC and its \nproducts, \ns\nervices\n and commercial ethos\n is \nthe free will concern only of the individual concerned and not the subject of \nmonitoring and \ncom\npulsion through BBC \nenforcement or indeed any other enforcement processes.\n11\nThe transfer from licence to subscription will involve huge restructuring for the BBC and I do not underestimate the task.  However, nor do I overestimate the task.  The task was not and is not beyo\nnd \nnetworks and \nservices such as Sky\n, Al Jazeera, Russia Today, Japan Satellite TV, and numerous others freely available in the UK \nwho \nsuccessfully \nmarket their services and therefore exercise no compulsion\n but still \noperate viable, profitable media busine\nsses\n from\n and for \ntheir customer base\n.  Nor was the subscription task beyond the mobile telephone service \noperators\n who are in state of permanent n\network and structural changes.  If private media businesses can do all of th\nese\n structural strategic \nthings \ns\nuccessfully \nand still operate as viable businesses\n then so can the BBC. \n \nThe project would be on a similar scale to the ending of analogue services in the UK\n and may be fraught with difficulties\n.  How should the project be funded.  \nWe suggest w\nith the fina\nl year\ns’ BBC tv licence revenue in 2015-2016 the rest of the BBC can fund itself th\nrough its commercial activities which\n,\n by the way\n,\n it already does and \napply to the City for\n \ninvestment funds and issue shares to raise money for large scale proje\ncts the way any other plc would and would take the BBC back to its \npre-Charter \nprivate business entity roots as the British Broadcasting \nCompany Ltd.\n12\nIt cannot be any longer legitimately argued that people in the UK who cannot fund the BBC or do not wan\nt to fund the BBC should any longer be denied access to all live television programme services as a consequence.  The argument deployed against subscription funding of the BBC by willing subscribers was and is that subscription excludes those with the leas\nt money to be able to afford the subscription.  The fact of the matter is that people are already excluding themselves from the BBC and\n \nall \nlive television programme services\n in the UK\n altogether either through choice or \nfear \nbecause they cannot afford eit\nher the cost of the BBC tv licence nor the \nfines, \ncosts\n and victim surcharges \nassociated with \nbeing prosecuted and convicted for\n so called tv licence evasion.  Exclusion already \nh\nappens\n under the present \nbroadcast receiving\n licence funding model for and op\nerated by the BBC.  Were the B\nBC tv licence to scrapped, and we\n firmly believe that the BBC tv licence \nand the Charter obligations cited and deployed as excuses f\nor the continuation of the BBC broadcast receiving\n licence \nshould be scrapped at the earliest \nopportunity, then people in the UK would still have access to live television programme services for which they would not have to pay a subscription for and not face the \nfear\n of prosecution and conviction because they were unable \nto afford to \nor unwilling \nto pay \ninto \nthe BBC\n and its\n \nbroadcast receiving\n licence.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
