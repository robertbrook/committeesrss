"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the RSPCA              \nAbstract\nFood security and what it means needs to be taken in the context of the increasing global trade in food and farm products and t\nhe challenges \n \nfacing the agricultural industry \nto meet projected global demand.  The default position -  i.e. that this needs to be met with further food production, and by implication, greater intensification of food animal production\n \n - needs to be reconsidered.  Achieving a healthier diet, cutting down on food waste and assessing what the UK or Europe can or cannot produce (given increasing global trade and reducing subsidies) all \nneed to be \naddressed first.   The EU’s progress in securing animal w\nelfare improvements in  sectors such as pigs, chickens and laying hens\n in the last seven years must not be undermined\n.  However\n,\n these improvements could be contrary to meeting present forecasted global demand for meat and could put the EU at a disadvantage to products being more intensively \nproduced\n in other countries.  Further work is required in this area.  \nClimate change is another parameter to be included before any framework can be developed on food security.  Progress on agreeing what s\ncientific data \nindicates and getting political agreement on what is required from the British livestock industry \nto m\neet UK greenhouse gas reductions has been \npatchy.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Whether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planning;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new markets; &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWays of increasing self sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013 \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nEurobarometer\n No. 229 June 2005 Attitudes of consumers towards the welfare of farmed animal;  \nEurobarometer\n 270.  March 2007.
