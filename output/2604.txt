[[[ [WAS0041]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The report examined two key issues within the context of newspaper coverage during the London 2012 Olympics.&#xa0;First, the interdependent relationship of mainstream media and certain sports and second, the gendering of sport and media. &#xa0;Media platforms have over the past twenty years developed technologically and some sports have benefited more than others from building relationships with media in general and in particular TV. The revenue from TV rights has been important in the growth and global dominance of men’s football/soccer. Golf, boxing and cricket are also winners as are big events like the Olympics. &#xa0;More than any other event the Olympics provides a platform for men and women athletes from many sports to deliver entertainment to global audiences. The sporting drama of failure and success, resilience and heroism, leadership and loyalty is spellbinding and for millions of people is a window into the sporting world.&#xa0;Such media and sport relationships are unique, yet they have become a widespread benchmark for judging media approaches to different sports and sporting events. Alongside this benchmark is often an argument suggesting that media should be more open to a model of fairness which means shared coverage and as such greater access to financial success.&#xa0;The Gender Hub who undertook this research believe gender, sport and media are a nexus which together can effect greater understanding about the value of social change and serves to diminish social inequalities. In order for such change to be realised sport and media organisations have an important role that can be enhanced by engaging with gender specialists who work in these sectors.  &#xa0;Women are increasingly breaking down barriers in business, arts, science and sport. While superficially numbers are greater in all areas, structural change is slow.  Drawing on the analysis of newspaper data (over 2000 pages) collected during four weeks in 2012 when the London Olympics were held we want to encourage more sophisticated debates. Such debates could include professionalism and grassroots sport, resource allocation of finance and media, leadership and governance of sporting bodies and the influence of gender in all aspects of sport.  We want to facilitate more effective and inclusive strategies that can be employed by sporting bodies and media owners to deliver a broader and deeper menu of men’s and women’s sport.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
