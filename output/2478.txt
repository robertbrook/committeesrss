[[[Introduction]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK 1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners 1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed 1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Overarching concerns about the proposals]]]2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; First, there is a genuine risk that all four proposals will lead to the erosion of access to justice, particularly in relation to cases against public bodies.  As a consequence, public bodies may increasingly be able to act with impunity as the ability of citizens to challenge them is reduced.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Second, the proposals, which risk depriving the poorest and most vulnerable citizens of a legal remedy, are potentially detrimental to the concept of equality before the law and the ability of all citizens to have equal access to justice.

[[[Legitimacy of  the government's objectives]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To further reduce the cost of legal aid; and&#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To restore public confidence in legal aid.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Prison Law scope cuts]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cases involving the determination of a criminal charge for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR (right to a fair trial);&#xa0;8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cases engaging Article 5.4 ECHR (right to have ongoing detention reviewed); and&#xa0;8.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The most serious disciplinary matters that meet the 'Tarrant Criteria'.&#xa0;&#xa0;9.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Society’s view is that imprisonment should not deprive prisoners of protection of their basic human rights.&#xa0;9.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have particular concerns about the impact  on  prisoners with mental health and learning disabilities who cannot reasonably be expected to negotiate the internal complaints procedures without assistance.&#xa0;9.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are sceptical of the MOJ assurance that 'reasonable adjustments' will be made to internal complaints procedures to make them accessible to prisoners with mental health problems or learning disabilities. Without the ever present risk of legal intervention a strong incentive to maintain an effective system is removed.&#xa0;9.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The cuts will disproportionately impact on black and ethnic minority males who are disproportionately represented in the prison population.

[[[A residence test that will make 12 months lawful residence in the UK a requirement for eligibility for civil legal aid.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;15.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that the disproportionate adverse effect of a residence test on non UK nationals may amount to unlawful discrimination. It is likely to be unlawful under s29 of the Equality Act 2010, which prohibits discrimination in the provision of services including those provided by public authorities. If the residence test amounts to unlawful discrimination on the ground of nationality, there is no statutory defence in the Equality Act.&#xa0;15.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; It may be discriminatory under Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) combined with Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 14 requires that there should be no unjustified difference of treatment between people who are similarly placed in relation to rights guaranteed by the Convention. As legal aid is only available for matters of English law for proceedings before domestic courts it is difficult to see how residence status can be a legal basis for distinguishing between people for the purpose of legal aid eligibility. Article 1 requires states to secure Convention rights to 'everyone within their jurisdiction'.&#xa0;15.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; A change of this nature interferes with the common law rights of access to the courts and non discrimination.&#xa0; According to the now well-established common law principle of legality, the general words of the power to make regulations in LASPO are not apt to allow such a fundamental interference with constitutional rights, which can only be effected by primary legislation.&#xa0;15.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; It may also fall foul of EU prohibitions of discrimination on grounds of nationality and EU law provisions such as Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights which provides that legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources to ensure effective access to justice in relation to the implementation of EU law.  It may also be contrary, depending on the circumstances of the case, to legal aid provisions under Council Directive 2002/8/EC which provides that persons involved in cross border disputes are entitled to appropriate legal aid to obtain effective access to justice. Article 4 of the Directive states that legal aid must be made available without discrimination to EU citizens and third country nationals residing lawfully in a member state. The 12 month qualification rule is incompatible with this provision.
