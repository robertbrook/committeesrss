defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART)
defaultSummarydefault:defaultHumanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART) works with local partners, many of whom are trapped behind closed borders and “off  the radar screen” of the international community and major aid organisations.
defaultMany of our colleagues in Burma are representative of ethnic national groups including the Shan, Karen, Karenni, Kachin, Chin and Rhohinga people.
defaultThe consistent reports we obtain during our visits highlight the increasing concern over recent developments in Burma.
defaultWhile we welcome reforms and developments such as those relating to Aung San Suu Kyi and the release of a number of political prisoners, we are increasingly worried that the plight of ethnic national peoples is not improving and that representatives fear that they are being marginalised.  They are also worried that increase in international investment in Burma may lead to continuing exploitation of their resources and expropriation of their lands.
defaultWe therefore hope that DFID will make every effort to ensure that these peoples suffering from continuing conflict and massive displacement of civilians will receive the aid that they need.  Moreover, if the Burmese Government or State authorities do not facilitate access to these areas, we hope that DFID may increase its honourable and ethical policy of “indirect funding” through local reliable partners.
defaultHART is privileged to work with some of these partners who take much-needed humanitarian aid to civilians trapped in these areas and, therefore, we know there is a proven track-record of reliability and accountability.
defaultWe would be very pleased to provide any additional information which might assist DFID to develop a policy to reach some of the civilians in Burma most in need of urgent aid.

defaultThis submission is based upon constant contact with, and regular visits every year to, various peoples within Burma, including the Chin, Kachin, Shan, Karen and Karenni as well as contact with representatives of the Rohingya people.

defaultHART’S main involvement in Burma is with the various ethnic groups, as stated in the summary, constituting at least 40% of the population and probably more. DDID states that “despite the political progress so far Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Asia.” (We may note that Chin State, by the statistics of the Burmese government itself, is the poorest.) This will inevitably continue as long as the condition of the ethnic nationalities is largely ignored. And as long as warfare and the breaking of truces continues to hinder economic and social development.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe taking of land by the policy of the central government, the well-documented removal of populations, and the exploitation of mineral, water and other resources, such as notoriously amongst the Shan and Kachin, for the benefit of supporters of the central government, lie at the base of the continuing poverty and failure to achieve genuine development.
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA worthwhile attempt to address poverty within Burma must be targeted at these, either directly, or indirect through policies that will genuinely alleviate their effects while also building up the strength and awareness and organization of the peoples concerned to resist the implications of these policies.
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndirect government aid through other agencies is able to achieve large results and has great potential for the future.
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndigenous relief and development groups amongst the peoples are proving their greater efficiency compared to that sometimes achieved by international bodies. They can be trusted. 
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFrom our own experience, in just one of our projects working with indigenous partners, basic health care is being greatly extended amongst the Chin People, where costs are at a minimum due to community support. The governments of Guernsey, and especially Jersey, have been generous in their support for this work. DFID was generous in its support for famine relief 2008-2009 amongst the same people, although, unfortunately, it was felt that these funds had to be transmitted via the WFP so only a very much reduced aid reached the ground, and none to the remoter areas which indigenous organizations were perfectly able to reach with their, sadly, more limited resources. However, if one considers how funding from DFID could assist the expansion of this work, as well as its replication in other parts of Burma, the following are of interest:
default7.1   Provision of education for the ethnic Peoples. This work in Chin State continues to be achieved due to the great effort and ingenuity of a few individuals in overcoming a lack of nearly all kinds of education, plus local community support in sponsoring their education outside Burma, at great cost in their resources.
default7.2   Realistic monitoring of the health provision claimed by the government to exist. The Burmese government produces very ‘nice’ maps detailing the widespread provision for clinics and hospitals, which do not actually function on the ground.
default7.3   Support for the establishment and training of efficient, indigenous, managerial and monitoring structures (important not only for the efficiency and transparency for donors but also for the backup and morale of the health workers functioning in remote and isolated areas).
default7.4   Support for re-training as well as for the visit of specialist training teams, such as in Maternal, neo-natal and prevention and treatment of malaria.
default7.5   Perhaps, DFID or FCO could encourage the Burmese authorities to be more ready to grant permission to such training teams to travel to: specific locations; for specific training purposes; for a specific but longer period than merely one day or three days (period actually resident in training location, not inclusive of lengthy travel).
default7.6   Assistance, including financial, in setting up efficient routes of supply for good-quality medicines within Burma; so less necessity to procure from across border in India, which presents dangers and threats to health workers from the Burmese security forces.
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe definite targeting of the needs of ethnic peoples, making it clear that they are NOT ignored by the international community amidst international praise and rewards for the government, could help greatly as part of a plan to “resolve ethnic tensions”.
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRegarding “the move towards democracy”.
defaultFrom our experience, in which we judge the reality of democracy and human rights not by the central government and parliament, but by the condition  of the people on the ground, in those large parts of Burma inhabited by non-Burman peoples, which contain the largest natural resources, both underground and in water; and by assessing how little these people see of the benefits of so called “economic development” and international investment: 
default   from that experience, we would re-affirm the importance of DFID’s stated “transparency” and “natural resource management” in order to monitor, and hopefully increase, any genuine improvement from the present appalling absence of benefit to local people. And, more basically, to at least attempt the limitation of the great setback to their economic and social condition (including displacement without compensation) caused by the so called “economic development”.
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would also re-affirm the words of the Shan leader who stated, “All the world came to Rangoon, to praise them, but they missed us still in the shadows.”
