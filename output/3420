defaultOil &amp; Gas UK – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultOil &amp; Gas UK’s defaultcomment on draft Deregulation Billdefault&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefaultOil &amp; Gas UK is the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the United Kingdom, with more than 
default390
default member companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, supplie
defaultrs, law firms and consultants.
defaultWe welcome th
defaultis
default opportunity to 
defaultrespond to the Deregulation Bill that has been drafted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses
default.
defaultAs a trade association for the UK’s offshore oil and gas industry, our 
defaultcomments address Clause 28 of the Deregulation Bill and reflect the views of our members.
default&#xa0;defaultSummary of key pointsdefaultOur members did not take issue with the principle behind the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Act and no concerns were expressed about Model Clauses being implemented in a “document to be published by the Secretary of State” as opposed to regulations. However, the below comments were made:
default&#xa0;defaultQuestionsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultOil &amp; Gas UK positiondefaultWhilst there is not necessarily a concern about Model Clauses being implemented in a “document to be published by the Secretary of State” as opposed to regulations, the Bill is unclear as to the process by which Model Clauses will be introduced and scrutinised in future. Members were keen to understand, in particular, what ability the industry will have to comment on any proposed amendments or new editions before they are published and come into effect.
defaultIt was proposed that a period of consultation should be required.  The process to be followed for any document published outside of the regulations would need to be given due consideration and developed.
defaultAnother concern was whether such a process could tend towards individual licences having individually negotiated terms (the Bill seems to leave this possibility open although it is assumed this is not the intent).  The view of Oil &amp; Gas UK is that this should not be the case on grounds of lack of transparency and administrative complexity and should be expressly addressed in the legislation.
defaultBelow is a summary of the opinions of our members.
default&#xa0;defaultMember OnedefaultWe do not see any reason why model clauses should continue to be issued in regulation form only, particularly now that the applicable model clauses are set out in full within each licence and the regulation is not required as a point of reference.   Therefore, we do not have an issue with the principle behind the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Act. 
defaultHowever, we do believe that the current proposals are too vague as no further information is given on what form the model clauses will take if not set out in regulation and what the new process will be for issuing such model clauses. It may be appropriate for the process to be governed by legislation even if the model clauses themselves are not.  If the process is to be contained in legislation, this could also be effected by an amendment to the Petroleum Act introduced by the Deregulation Bill.
defaultWe would therefore recommend that the change should not be introduced in the Deregulation Bill unless and until the new process for introducing model clauses other than by regulation has been agreed.  The issues should be considered at the same time – it does not seem appropriate to make the suggested change now and consider the details of what form the model clauses will take and the new process for agreeing them at a later stage. 
defaultTo summarise, we believe that the industry should not support this amendment without more detailed proposals also being made as to new form of model clauses and the process for agreeing such model clauses going forward.  If it is the case that the Government already has proposals on these issues, those proposals should be shared with industry as soon as possible.
defaultWe have a further concern as to the volume of model clauses that this could lead to and how often the model clauses will be amended.  It would be preferable to maintain a good level of uniformity across licences.  If the Secretary of State is able to issue model clauses out with regulation, will this lead to a larger volume of model clauses being used at any one time?
defaultThis should also be considered alongside the process for issuing new model clauses and restrictions on how often new model clauses can be introduced by the Secretary of State may be required.  It may be appropriate for there to be one or more sets of model clauses issued for each Licensing Round. The proposed model clauses for that Licensing Round could then be released at the same time as the Licensing Round is announced (e.g. one set of model clauses per type of licence).

defaultMember twodefaultWe
default agree with your assessment that it is unclear as to how model clauses will be introduced / scrutinised and that industry should have the ability to comment on proposed amendments.  The wording does also appear to leave it open for individual licence terms to be negotiated, which 
defaultwe
default agree should not be the case.
default&#xa0;
defaultMember threedefaultOverall, there is a benefit to speed up the legislative process and thereby allow Secretary of State published documents as opposed to 
defaultregulations
default. However, it is important to have clarity and transparency around the process concerning a simplified process on Model Clause which with the draft Bill is difficult to foresee, both concerning possibility to influence by the industry and how such clauses could be applied individually.

default&#xa0;
defaultWe agree that some period of consultation is required. We are not sure what legal obligation exists for consultation about regulations (and suspect it’s part of the Contracting Out and Deregulation Act). In any event, we have suggested an amendment to s4(2)(B) - see above - to ensure that there will be no reduction in the level of consultation.
defaultWe also agree that DECC is unlikely to agree different clauses for different licences. Apart from the points you make, DECC will be concerned to treat applicants equally for fear of JR.

default“Model clauses in petroleum licences: procedural simplificationdefault(1) Section 4 of the Petroleum Act 1998 (which makes further provision about licences under Part 1 of that Act to search and bore for and get petroleum) is amended as follows.

default(2) In subsection (1), omit paragraph (e) (which requires the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations model clauses which, unless modified or excluded in a particular case, must be incorporated into licences granted under Part 1 of that Act).
