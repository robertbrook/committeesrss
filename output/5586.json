"&#xa0;\nLetter submitted by DefraPlastic bag charge carbon emissions analysis T\nhe Committee has asked if we c\nould\n provide further information about the carbon emissions analysis\n which we provided in our written evidence\n. \nThe Government has\n not \nbeen using a \ncarbon reduction argument as the main basis for the policy\n to reduce the distribution of single-use plastic carrier bags\n and increase the number of bags being reused by consumers. \nThe main benefits of this policy are in terms of a reduction in litter on land and at sea.\n I\nn addition this\n will also reduce the environmental\n,\n resource \nand economic \ncost of their production\n, storage and transport\n.\n Until this point in the process, therefore, we had not carried out a thorough review of the relevant carbon data. When we did so an error came to light in an estimate of the benefits carried out in 2012; this over-estimated the carbon impact significantly due to how the original 2006 Environment Agency figures were being used.\nThe analysis set out below therefore differs \nfrom that in our original evidence and we would like to take this opportunity to rectify the error.\nT\nhe 2006 Environment Agency’s assessment of the life cycle environmental impacts of different carrier bags presents CO\n2\ne figures for each type of bag (single-use plastic bag, paper bag, bag for life, etc) based on a comparable ‘functional unit’, i.e. carrying one month’s shopping (483 items) home. For example 82 single-use bags are required to fulfil this function, with associated emissions of 1.57 kg CO\n2\ne, while 61 bags for life fulfil the same function with emissions of 1.39 kg CO\n2\ne (if each bag for life is re-used 5 times). \nThe error was to \nuse the CO\n2\ne figures associated with one month’s shopping as referring to individual bags (i.e. one single-use plastic bag was assigned emissions of 1.57kg CO\n2\ne), thus overstating the carbon impact of the charge by a factor of 82.\nThe estimates are calculated on an embedded emissions approach. \nThis means that much of the emissions reduction occur outside of the UK\n as most plastic bags are manufactured abroad\n. \nI have attached a revised copy of the Defra \nwritten evidence\n \nand \nhave \nset out the areas requiring amendment below. If possible \nwe \nwould also like to \ncorrect \none of the statements \ngiven by \nthe Minister, \nDan \nRogerson\n, during his \noral evidence. \nAmendments (in bold): EAC written evidence “\nParagraph 19. The charge in England is also expected to reduce the local environmental and biodiversity impact of littered bags. The indicative reduction in single-use plastic bag usage outlined would cause an associated fall in GHG emissions of around \n97,000-130,000 tonnes\n CO\n2\n equivalent (not taking into account impacts of plastic bags for life or bin liners).\n”\n“\nFootnote 15. \nEA \n2006\n \nestimates 1.57 kg co2e \nper month’s shopping \nhttp://a0768b4a8a31e106d8b0-50dc802554eb38a24458b98ff72d550b.r19.cf3.rackcdn.com/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf\n“\n“\nParagraph 26. The\n \nGovernment\n has calculated that even if customers of large retailers increase their paper bag use by 50% there would still be a negligible environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions (\n3,500 tonnes\n CO\n2\n equivalent\n \nrepresenting less than 4% of the savings from plastic bags) due to the very low current levels of use\n.\n”\nEAC oral evidence “\nWe would expect also that we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nby\n around \n97,000 -130,000 tonnes of \nCO\n2\n, \nwhich is equivalent to permanently taking \n32,000 – 43,000 cars off the road.\n”\nI trust this information on our carbon emissions analysis is sufficient and answers any queries the Committee might have had. \n&#xa0;\n29 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDepartment of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Written Evidence into the Inquiry by the Environmental Audit Committee on plastic bags (Revised)Summary Introduction&#xa0;\nThe environmental impacts of the proposed 5p charge in England, including:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Increase in sales of other\n plastic bags\nIncrease in \ndistribution\n of paper bags\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n WRAP, UK Voluntary Carrier Bag Monitoring - 2013  study, July 2013\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/waste-prevention-programme-for-england\n \n \nhttps://consult.defra.gov.uk/resource-atmosphere-and-sustainability/call-for-evidence-plastic-bag-charge-for-england\n WRAP, UK Voluntary Carrier Bag Monitoring - 2013  study, July 2013, \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Carrier%20bags%20results%20(2012%20data).pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-publishes-new-figures-carrier-bag-use\n \n WRAP, UK Voluntary Carrier Bag Monitoring - 2013  study, July 2013\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/waste-prevention-programme-for-england\n \n \nhttps://consult.defra.gov.uk/resource-atmosphere-and-sustainability/call-for-evidence-plastic-bag-charge-for-england\n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-publishes-new-figures-carrier-bag-use\n \nhttp://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/epq/waste_recycling/substance/carrierbags/reduction/?lang=en\n \nhttp://www.seas-at-risk.org/1mages/Economic%20impacts%20of%20marine%20litter%20KIMO.pdf\n \nGalgani\n et al (2000) \n‘\nLitter on the Sea Floor Along European Coasts\n’, \nMarine Pollution Bulletin\n40 \n(\n6\n)\n,\n \npp. \n516\n–\n527\n \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X99002349\n \nhttp://www.mcsuk.org/downloads/pollution/beachwatch/latest2011/Methods%20&amp;%20Results%20BW10.pdf\n \nhttp://www.seas-at-risk.org/1mages/Economic%20impacts%20of%20marine%20litter%20KIMO.pdf\n EA \n2006 \nestimates 1.57 kg \nper month’s shopping\n \nhttp://a0768b4a8a31e106d8b0-50dc802554eb38a24458b98ff72d550b.r19.cf3.rackcdn.com/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf\n WRAP forthcoming, \nEffect of charging for carrier bags on bin-bags sales in Wales\n Exodus Research (2013) Consumer behavioural study on the use and re-use of carrier bags 2012.
