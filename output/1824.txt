[[[&#xa0;]]]I will now deal with each of these points in more detail.3. 

[[[Cost of determining status of lanes and applying Traffic restriction orders]]]: There is huge bureaucracy involved in the determination of BOAT claims.

[[[ ]]]Across the country and particularly in national parks, motorised organisations have put in BOAT claims on huge numbers of green lanes and local authorities around the country now have to consider each and every one of these. This is a time-consuming and expensive job- notices must be put up, responses collected from organisations and individuals, responses are considered in great detail, reports are written, public meetings are held, committees meet and appeals are dealt with. Once BOAT status has been determined, national parks and councils may then consider whether Traffic Restriction Orders are required to protect the tracks, the adjoining countryside or the non-motorised users.  This involves more notices, meetings, collection and consideration of evidence and finally if a TRO is recommended, wealthy off-roader organisations usually immediately appeal to the High Court.  This incurs huge costs for the councils and national parks at a time when their budgets have been cut.  Automatically redefining all unsealed green lanes as 'restricted Byeways' would at a stroke put an end to all of this.

[[[Damage to green lanes:  ]]]Unsealed green lanes are ancient tracks never designed to take heavy motorised traffic.  Their current use by motorised off-roaders damages the lanes, causing deep ruts,  which make the lanes difficult for walkers and horse riders to use. Use by motorised vehicles in winter causes particular damage, with many paths reduced to deep, muddy quadmires.  In the national park where I live - the Peak District National Park - this area of outstanding beauty which should be protected is instead having deep vehicle ruts etched on its beautiful green lanes and tracks.4. 

[[[Cost of repair: ]]]The local council incurs enormous expense in mending damaged tracks and of course as soon as they are mended the motorised users damage them again.  Often local volunteer groups such as Peak Horsepower send volunteers to help with mending tracks but with the vehicles who caused the damage free to continue to use the lanes, this is only a temporary solution and is really a waste of everyone's time and money.5. 

[[[Safety of non-motorised users]]]: For me personally this is the biggest issue of all. It simply isn't safe for non-motorised users such as walkers and horse riders to share narrow tracks with motorised vehicles.  Motorbikes in particular often come in convoy and at speed, expecting everyone to leap out of their way and horse riders, sitting on a flight animal, are at particular risk.  4 x 4 vehicles often completely fill a narrow track and riders and walkers have nowhere to get out of the way. Sadly, most non-motorised users, myself included, will not now use green lanes where we have to face such dangerous situations. Councils and national parks do have the ability to apply Traffic Restriction Orders but the process is extremely time-consuming and expensive and each proposed TRO is immediately appealed to the High Court by wealthy off-roader organisations. Out of the many lanes which are considered by the Peak Park Authority to be a priority for action only a few have been dealt with to date and all are currently mired in lengthy and expensive legal challenges.  This picture is replicated across the country on a lane by lane basis. The Peak Park is meant to be a place where people can relax, enjoy the countryside and get some exercise. However, walkers and riders will simply not use tracks which they do not consider to be safe and it is so unfair for us not to be able to exercise our right to use these beautiful lanes.6. 

[[[Other users deterred from using green lanes: ]]]As our roads get ever busier, our quiet green lanes become an ever more important resource for walkers, cyclists and particularly horse riders. However, the danger of meeting convoys of fast motorbikes with their noisy exhausts on a narrow lane means that many of us are deterred from using green lanes. The government is keen to encourage people to increase physical activity to benefit their health but the current situation with green lanes is having the opposite effect and deterring people from using green lanes.  I personally no longer use the local green lanes that for the past 25 years I have accessed weekly to ride my horse and walk my dog. This is happening all over the country and is a great national  tragedy.7. 

[[[Nuisance: ]]]Anyone who has met a convoy of noisy fast-moving motorbikes on a green lane will attest to the nuisance - the noise, the smell of the exhaust fumes and often the need to leap into the nettles at the side of the track to get out of the way of convoys who unfortunately do not always see the need to slow down for pedestrians and horse riders. Residents living near green lanes endure the constant noise (particularly loud motorbike exhausts) and farmers using green lanes to access their livestock often find access difficult at busy times ie. weekends. Motorised groups now even organise night rides down green lanes which is frightening and upsetting for nearby residents.8. I am delighted to see the proposed Deregulation Bill and am fully in support of the proposal to redefine all unsealed green lanes as 'Restricted Byways' which can only be used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders but not by motorised vehicles (with the exception of emergency vehicles and landowners tending to stock). &#xa0;5 September 13&#xa0;&#xa0;
