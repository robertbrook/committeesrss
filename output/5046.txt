[[[Summary of Key Points ]]]&#xa0;4.1              

[[[The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area]]]

[[[.]]]Since taking up the new role of Commissioner on the 22 November 2012, the Commissioner and his Deputy Commissioner have worked closely with the Force, partners, stakeholders and the public to create a more holistic approach to problem solving. The focus has been clear, to forge stronger relationships with communities. &#xa0;4.2              The Commissioner’s vision is to be the 

[[[‘People’s Commissioner’, ]]]making himself available to individuals, victims of crime and communities and listen to their concerns. The Commissioners focus is on making people feel safer, remove criminality from their neighbourhoods and tackle the social cause behind offending to permanently interrupt this vicious cycle.&#xa0;4.3              The Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Plan reflects the views and interests of everyone living and working in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.&#xa0;4.4              Crime in Nottinghamshire is currently following a national trend which has seen a slight increase in comparison to last year. The increase (+3.2%) has slowed since the start of the year but remains a concern and the Commissioner and Chief Constable are working hard to address this fluctuation.&#xa0;4.5              One way of addressing the rise is through smarter working with our partners (Community Safety Partnerships for the City (CDP), the County (Safer Neighbourhood Board and Local Criminal Justice Board) as well as commissioning services from crime reduction organisations so that we tackle criminality from every angle. It is recognised that Nottinghamshire Police has had a more difficult financial challenge than many other forces, it needs to save £43.6m over the four years of the spending review (between March 2011 and March 2015). This savings requirement is 19% of the overall budget. The Commissioner recognises that there is to be a review of the funding formula, with the suggestion that this will not be introduced until 2016-17 at the earliest. The Commissioner is urging that consultation on the new formula needs to begin now.               4.6              One of the positive developments highlighted in the recent performance update relates to satisfaction levels among victims of crime. 87.1% of victims of crime are completely, very or fairly satisfied with the service they have received from Nottinghamshire Police which is just 2.9% away from the Police and Crime Plan target of 90%. The County is 87.8% and the City is 86.2%&#xa0;

[[[The role of commissioners in holding th]]]

[[[eir chief constables to account.]]]The Police and Crime Plan sets out the Commissioner’s governance and accountability arrangements; these are further outlined in the Commissioner’s Governance Framework. &#xa0;4.8              A range of performance indicators relating to the seven strategic themes contained within the current Police and Crime Plan are monitored by the Office of the Commissioner (OPCC) and where performance is identified as a risk the Commissioner holds the Chief Constable to account to seek assurances that action is being taken to address the performance concerns. The Commissioner will do this through bilateral weekly meetings with the Chief Constable and through an extended bimonthly Strategic Resource and Performance Meeting with the wider Chief Officer Team. These meetings are held at various venues across Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. In addition, the Commissioner, his Deputy and various members of his office attend a number of Force and Divisional performance meetings where necessary assurances are sought and obtained.&#xa0;

[[[4.9]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[The role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners ]]]

[[[to account.]]]The Nottinghamshire County Council is the host authority for the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Panel. The Panel scrutinises the actions and decisions of the Police and Crime Commissioner and makes sure information is available for the public, enabling them to hold the Commissioner to account.&#xa0;4.10              The Commissioner provides the Panel with an update report on the performance, key decisions made and activities. Together with providing an update report on Domestic Violence and six monthly Police and Crime Plan monitoring reports.&#xa0;4.11              The Commissioner’s Police and Crime Plan was scrutinised and approved by the Police and Crime Panel in March 2013. The refreshed Plan will be reported to the Panel meeting the 3 February 2014.  &#xa0;

[[[The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and]]]

[[[ Social Responsibility Act 2011.]]]As part of the stage two transfer process, the Commissioner was required to advise the Home Secretary of plans for the Stage Two Transfer of staff by 16 September 2013. The vision for the Stage Two Second Transfer has been agreed between the Commissioner and the Chief Constable. The Commissioner’s recommendation is that there is a ‘

[[[M]]]

[[[aximum Transfer]]]’ model for Nottinghamshire, which would mean the transfer of all police staff from Operational Frontline, Operational Support and Business Support functions to the employment of the Chief Constable. The Deputy Commissioner and the staff employed to work within the Nottinghamshire OPCC will remain under the employment of the Commissioner. In addition the Force will provide business support to the Commissioner as identified within the Working Relationship Agreement and in line with the Policing Protocol Order 2011. &#xa0; 4.13              There will be ongoing work to ensure a robust implementation plan once the Home Secretary has approved the Transfer Scheme.&#xa0;

[[[he role of commissioners ]]]

[[[in budget and precept setting.]]]Together with producing the Police and Crime Plan, the Commissioner has had to make some key decisions which have included setting the precept and the budget for the totality of policing. The Commissioner has also produced his first Annual Report which has been shared with the Police and Crime Panel. This Annual Report covers the whole of the financial year from April 2012 to March 2013, and highlights the key commitments made by the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, together with reflecting the performance improvements achieved by the previous Police Authority. &#xa0;4.15              The Commissioner has set up the Community Safety Partnership Fund specifically to assist small local groups to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour and protect and support victims of crime at neighbourhood level. The projects complement those led by partners through the Community Safety Partnerships in each local authority area. Confirmation of the funding allocation for next year will be in January 2014. &#xa0;In the meantime there will be a review of the application process for the Community Safety Partnership Fund to be ready for any future funding rounds. &#xa0;4.16              The Community Safety Partnership Fund provides small grants of £25,000 or less to voluntary and community groups for projects which assist in reducing crime and protecting victims, witnesses and vulnerable people. There were 89 applications received at the end of May, requesting £1.4m.  Following appraisal, 28 projects were approved to a value of £351,50.90.  There is a diverse range of projects working in the following areas:&#xa0;&#xa0;4.17              Some projects contribute towards more than one of the Police and Crime Plan Priorities.  All the projects can be viewed at the Commissioners Web Page 

[[[he]]]

[[[r]]]

[[[e]]].  &#xa0;4.18              The small grants fund is currently running at £380k which includes match funding for preventative and target hardening work in the County, with a further amount for supporting crime and antisocial behaviour through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Develop a multi agency process of identification of girls affected by gangs, identifying risk and developing pathways to enable appropriate support.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Offer early intervention support to girls involved in gangs.&#xa0;&#xa0; £130k per annum for Domestic Violence Medium Risk Intervention Workers (X1 City &amp; x2 County - WAIS) &amp; NWAL)&#xa0;&#xa0; £30K to the University of Leicester for academic research to identify innoavtive opportutnites to improve services to support and respond to victims’ individual needs&#xa0;4.19              The Commissioner also hosted a national “Facing up to Offending” Conference on the 3 December, outlining the recognition of the significant benefits of Restorative Justice and the need for a quality consistent approach.&#xa0;4.20              There are various consultation exercises planned for refreshing the Police and Crime Plan and ensuring public opinion informs priorities, these include:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4.2]]]

[[[The effectiveness of commissioners in prom]]]

[[[oting local policing priorities.]]]The annual Joint Partnership Strategic Assessment provides the threat, risk and harm assessment of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire to ensure that we identity new and emerging issues and tackle the policing and community safety issues that are of most concern. The assessment includes consultation with communities in order to make sure that we are addressing the issues that matter the most to Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.&#xa0;4.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A significant focus on performance is being progressed by three Partnership Gold Groups which have now been established following recent Crime Summits (i.e. Burglary, Violence and Shoplifting) and action plans are being developed and actions implemented where possible to tackle identified key risks.&#xa0;4.23              Listening to local communities is essential for the Commissioner, but so too is getting first-hand insight into the issues and concerns they raise. With the Deputy Commissioner there are targeted Community walkabouts in priority areas, to gain a better understanding of the police and partnership working, areas covered have included: St Ann’s, Aspley, Arboretum, Bulwell, Newark, Worksop, Mansfield and Sutton, these neighbourhood visits include meeting local representatives to hear more about how we might help resolve local problems.&#xa0;4.24              The Commissioner also opened the first Bingham Safety Fair which brought together a multitude of crime reduction organisations to provide free advice and information to the public.&#xa0;

[[[4.25]]]

[[[Progress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, poli]]]

[[[cing organisations and partners.]]]The Commissioner currently sits on a Regional PCC Collaboration Board which is addressing opportunities to develop future regional collaboration agreements. In July 2013, the PCCs for the East Midlands region commissioned Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to conduct a review of the arrangements for collaboration between the five forces in the region. The Final Report was published on the Commissioner’s website on 11 November 2013. &#xa0;4.26              Previously three areas of collaboration were treated as Jointly Controlled Operations (JCO). &#xa0;&#xa0;4.27              These are all between Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire PCC’s and Nottinghamshire’s proportion is 27.6%.  There are five additional collaborations accounted for as JCO’s this last year:&#xa0;&#xa0;4.28              All of these arrangements are covered by Section 22 Agreements and financial information is included in note 13 to the accounts. &#xa0;

[[[4.29]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Transparency of and reporting by commissioners to date.]]]The Commissioner has produced his Annual Governance Statement, reporting against the ‘Delivering Good Governance’ principles. There has been an annual governance review and the production of the Group Statement of Accounts for 2012-2013 which reflects the financial position of meeting continued savings of £10m each year whilst increasing visibility and accessibility of policing. There has also been the production of the Code of Corporate Governance which sets out the standard that the Commissioner and the Chief Constable will govern as separate corporations sole.&#xa0;4.30              All decisions and reports are published on the Commissioners website.&#xa0;

[[[Commissioners’ Activities]]]PCP C2.1 The Commissioner will work with Criminal Justice Partners to agree ways in which the Criminal Justice System can be more accessible to all communities.Funding has been made available to providing support for victims of domestic violence and working with the Criminal Justice System, through IDVAs. The work of the BME project has contributed to identifying the 30 recommendations for improvements being progressed through the Working Group. The Commissioner has held a Restorative Justice Summit with key partners to ensure victims get the best deal and identify how this approach can be expanded. The Commissioner is hosting a national conference called Facing up to Offending on 3 December at Nottinghamshire Golf Club in Cotgrave. The Police and Crime Plan includes targets to reduce the number of ineffective trials at magistrates and crown courts. 

[[[A]]]PCP C2.2 Monitor the effectiveness of the Youth Justice and Criminal Justice System, including timeliness and compliance with national standards on sentencing decisions.There is ongoing monitoring through the Performance and Insight packs and the update reports to the Strategic Resources and Performance Meetings as part of the performance management and the Commissioner’s Governance Framework.

[[[G]]]

[[[Force Activities]]]PCP F2.3 Improve the timeliness and quality of case files.File Quality Monitoring System now in place. Monthly Performance report produced by OBSU Manager.  Sergeants Accreditation process almost fully complete. In terms of the quality of files submitted, the error rate was

[[[%]]] for the Crown Court.  

[[[A]]]PCP F2.4 Digitalise the way case files are produced and transferred.Digitalisation of case files update - everything is now sent electronically from the Bridewell and Mansfield Custody suites bar Crown Court upgrade files (trial files). Newark custody suite is fully digitalised.  Remand files are still sent via paper due to process issues with the Crown Prosecution Service; capacity is lacking for dealing with these pre court, so whilst the files are digitalised ready for upgrade, hard copies are also sent.  Crown Court upgrades are in process- current progress is that all Early Guilty plea files are sent electronically.  There is still a lot of manual input from the Police side in terms of delivering electronic files, but the main focus of work is now Crime and Justice working to ensure electronic capture.

[[[G]]]Partner ActivitiesPCP P2.5 Improve the effectiveness and support of victims and witnesses going through the Criminal Justice System.Following process mapping of support services for Domestic Violence, undertaken dedicated focus groups about why survivors do not engage with services with an action plan in development. The outcomes of focus groups have helped to review policies and practices of Police and CPS – with an action plan in development.Currently there is monitoring of the impact of implementation of "the greatest need" support for Victims with view to highlight gaps and support commissioning process of PCC. CJ processes are being regionalised. Work is beginning to develop a "victim and witness impact tool" to assess effectiveness and influence planned changes.&#xa0;&#xa0;Secured more slots for SDVCs following HMCTs decision to hold fewer sessions. Work to be progressed through the development of the Victim’s Strategy. This will be supported by Partnership activities and will involve a strategic assessment of need. Also redesigning the service. Year-to-date figures to July 2013 show that the current effective trial rate is 

[[[43.5%]]] for the Magistrates Court, and 

[[[42.6%]]] for the Crown Court, meaning that neither court is achieving the target 50% effective trial rate.

[[[A]]]PCP P2.6 Ensure that all agencies deal fairly with offenders from all backgrounds.Work to be progressed through the development of the Victim’s Strategy. This will be supported by Partnership activities and will involve a strategic assessment of need. Also redesigning the service. There is national work in development that may reinvigorate a cross agency approach. In Nottinghamshire the focus has been on the ‘front end’ and with the police in their attempts to improve practice and accountability for stop and search.

[[[A]]]PCP P2.7 Promote and align community payback with local neighbourhood priorities to improve the local environment.Nottinghamshire Probation Service manages a very successful community payback scheme, which is directly benefiting local communities and their environment. The Commissioner will be in discussion with Nottinghamshire Probation Service for Quarter 4 to take the action forward.

[[[A]]]PCP P2.8 Develop opportunities to involve victims of anti-social behaviour and crime in neighbourhood justice.The Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner has set up the Community Safety Partnership Fund specifically to assist small local groups to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour and protect and support victims of crime at neighbourhood level.
