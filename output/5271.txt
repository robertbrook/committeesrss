[[[Health Expenditure as a Proportion of DFID Burma’s Budget]]]

[[[ - ]]]

[[[Clarification]]]&#xa0;Health now accounts for roughly one third of DFID Burma’s expenditure over the current Operational Plan period (2011/12 to 2014/15) – as indicated in the table submitted in the Memorandum to the IDC’s inquiry (page 5).  An older chart reproduced on page 7 of the Memorandum indicated that health expenditure was closer to half. The difference arises due to the changing pattern of DFID Burma’s expenditure since the start of the Operational Plan.&#xa0;In particular, we have a commitment of up to £80m for the 3MDG Fund to 2016. Most of this could potentially have been spent within the Operational Plan period, but over £30m of this will now fall into later years. This is due in part to slower than expected expenditure by the 3MDG Fund and partly due to DFID Burma prioritising new work in other sectors as the reform environment improved and new opportunities arose. We were also allocated additional budget of £6m in September 2014, which was allocated to non-health sectors – this also reduced the proportion of our budget spent on health. Health remains our largest area of expenditure, but expenditure in other sectors has grown more quickly reducing the proportion accounted for by health to about a third.  In addition to ‘pure’ health programmes, a proportion of our humanitarian budget also goes to funding health services to internally displaced people and refugees in camps (note this expenditure is not included in the health expenditure figures quoted above).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;15 January 2014DFID Burma&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
