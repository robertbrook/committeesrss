[[[Introduction]]]1.1               This submission is made to assist the HASC by providing information on the operation of the PCC for Cleveland. It is set out according to the headings of the 6th November announcement. Given that it is only one year since the introduction of PCCs, though there has been considerable work undertaken, there has been insufficient time to evaluate this work. Of necessity considerable energy has been expended in building the foundations from which to operate in what is a wholly new landscape.&#xa0;

[[[The effectiveness of Commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police force in their area.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Policing represents only part, albeit a very important part, of a collective effort to reduce crime. There is a wide diversity of work undertaken in this area, whether in prisons, by probation, by the ‘troubled families’ programmes, by police officers and others. PCCs have responsibility across the entire criminal justice landscape at a local level and so make considerable efforts to join the disparate parts of it together and make it as effective as possible. However given that each component of this complex system is being squeezed financially, the gaps are widening whilst the dependencies become more acute.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Detailed analysis of performance data is used to ask questions and arrive at imaginative ways to address the upward pressure on reported crime. When shop theft was on the increase a summit was held to identify creative solutions to business crime. The PCC was a champion for local initiatives developed and delivered by the Middlesbrough Retail Crime Partnership and ‘Redcar Shop Link’ Scheme. Analysis showed a move away from stealing items to sell, to stealing food and essentials. Food banks have been supported and promoted by the PCC where essentials such as groceries and baby formula were the main items stolen. 2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With ‘other theft’ on the increase due to fraud offences, the PCC is taking the opportunity in the run up to Christmas to share fraud prevention advice through a series of public consultation roadshows in town centres. 2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Analysis of the disproportionate involvement of people with mental health problems held (under section 136) in custody led to a ‘street triage’ approach involving the NHS and police. This has reduced the numbers detained unnecessarily and the level of reoffending within this cohort, whilst reducing the pressure on police resources and allocating the identified mental health need into the correct care pathway. Other forces are now adopting this approach.&#xa0;2.5               When police are called to an address or incident and believe that an individual involved has a mental disorder, learning disability or substance misuse problem, they contact the mental health nurses who carry out an assessment. This informs further care planning, ascertaining whether the person needs to be held under s136 and if not, whether follow up from mental health, social or substance misuse services is required. The nursing team refer to those services if required, provide information to service users about relevant agencies and where appropriate, provide follow up appointments within seven days of the assessment.      &#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In depth consultation with vulnerable groups with regard to a perceived under reporting of hate crime has led to the development of a Cleveland wide ‘Safe Places’ scheme for vulnerable people, with major retailers being particularly supportive. Feedback uncovered issues for vulnerable people travelling on public transport and therefore the PCC will host a meeting with transport providers to identify preventative solutions. The public profile of the PCC has fostered the ability to bring together a range of partners to develop cross Cleveland initiatives, and has also aided in engaging with the private sector at a strategic level to obtain Cleveland wide support for schemes.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Restorative Justice has been developed by the PCC working with the force to deal with crime, anti-social behaviour and ‘conflict’ in communities. &#xa0;From 1st April 2013 across Cleveland most offences of crime, anti-social behaviour and disorder committed by young people under the age of 18, who have not previously come to the attention of the police are resolved by way of a Restorative Intervention (RI).&#xa0; The RI will usually take place within the community, led by a police officer, PCSO or police staff member and will be swift, effective, sustainable and impactive.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Anti Social behaviour, whilst not always resulting in reported crime is of major concern to very many communities, as evidenced in the visits made by the PCC. A summit was held to ensure it was on the agenda of every partner within the wider CJ family, including housing providers. A particular focus was to ensure that the tragedy of the Fiona Pilkington case would not be repeated in Cleveland. The outcome of the summit ensured social housing providers now work in partnership with police and others using the legal powers available. This collaborative approach provides a constructive baseline when dealing with repeat offenders, allowing the needs of the perpetrator to be addressed alongside those of the community. The summit also established a training process to identify repeat victims and assess the difference between ASB and hate crime.&#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Throughout the first year in office, grappling with CSR10 and then CSR 13 has been a major issue. Working with the Chief Constable and senior staff to develop a policing model that should be sustainable in the longer term, whilst still delivering the 5 priorities of the Police and Crime Plan has been the goal; albeit at a cost of redundancies and compulsory retirements.&#xa0;

[[[The role of Commissioners in holding their Chief Constables to account]]]&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A comprehensive programme of accountability sessions is in operation. Each week the PCC and CC meet to deal with emerging and current issues, postbag, complaints, press, IPCC, HMIC. Each month a strategic performance group involving wider police representation goes into detailed performance trends. In addition is a session each month on a rolling programme of Force Performance, Force Financial, Policy and Organisational issues and ‘Partners and Commissioning’. This ensures that crime trends are central to activity, with the involvement of Community Safety Partnerships designed to ensure that all partners are operating in concert, and to provide third party views on police performance.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Chief Constable is required to document key decisions with detailed business cases to be considered by the PCC. These are published, as is a forward work plan. Examples include support to G8 and collaboration agreements. With regard to the latter, the Police and Crime Panel have taken the opportunity to scrutinise the PCCs decision making approach and challenged the decision to send resources to Northern Ireland to support G8. The PCC then arranged for Keith Bristow of the National Crime Agency to brief panel members and the PCC on the Strategic Policing Requirement. 3.3              Mystery Shoppers and Independent Custody Visitors are employed to report directly to the PCC and so provide independent views of services delivered by the Chief Constable.&#xa0;

[[[The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The following has been submitted to the Home Secretary;Stage 2 Transfer &#xa0;As required by the above, please find enclosed documentation. This falls within the ‘maximum transfer’ category. Core staff will be retained by the PCC in order to fulfil the statutory role, plus those staff needed to manage the contractual and ancillary arrangements (with particular regard to the extensive outsourced services), and functions that may not be delegated to the Chief Constable.&#xa0;The submission details only arrangements for staff, with discussions underway on the future scheme of governance, to be completed well before April. The submission is based on the three principles of setting out clarity of roles, enshrining operational independence for the Chief Constable, and conformance with the Policing Protocol. It allocates staffing to enable the PCC to fulfil the duties of S17 of the Protocol, and the S20 ‘wider responsibility for the enhancement of the delivery of criminal justice’ in Cleveland, without duplication or excessive cost. It does not facilitate any involvement of the PCC in operational policing, with all relevant staff in the employ of the Chief Constable. &#xa0;It does not detail any proposed changes to the arrangements for contracts, pensions, estates, assets and liabilities. These require further considerable detailed work which is underway. It is based on the assumption that the issue of pension arrangements, and associated liabilities, for transferred staff will be resolved by April.&#xa0;4.2 Before April arrangements will be in place for resources to be shared between PCC and CC. This will include for example, HR, media, legal. For this reason, the notion of a ‘cost of a PCC’ is of very limited value.&#xa0;

[[[The role of commissioners in budget and precept setting;]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The PCC has written to the Home Secretary to draw her attention to Cleveland’s budget concerns, and invited her to reconsider future years cuts, and visit Cleveland to see the valuable work going on.&#xa0; The 6 local MPs were contacted for their support. A roadshow with the Chief constable has been used to inform and consult on the budget.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The PCC receives detailed assessments from the PCC treasurer and the force before agreeing a budget position and consequent precept assumption. This is refined through stakeholder consultation before discussion with the police and crime panel.

[[[The effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities;]]]6.1                The PCC believes understanding the concerns and needs of communities as well specialists across the Criminal Justice sector is essential in developing priorities. The 

[[[‘]]]Your Force

[[[ ]]]Your Voice’ programme has been the main driver for identifying issues.   The PCC has attended meetings in all 82 of the wards in Cleveland to hear directly the views of communities.   Meetings have also been held at schools, colleges and local businesses. The PCC has also hosted several web-chats (called ‘Community Click’) with the general public and more targeted audience such as young people and the rural community.  Issues discussed at the meetings are published on the PCC website and quarterly reports are produced which identify key areas for development.  &#xa0;

[[[Progress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policing]]]

[[[ organisations and partners;]]]7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cleveland collaborates with Durham and Northumbria on interpreting services. The three North East Police and Crime Commissioners have committed to develop and implement an integrated regional Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy. This will ensure that the strategy is incorporated into Crime and Policing plans. 7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Following concerns raised by rural communities regarding the police response to rural issues, several initiatives have been developed. This has culminated in the PCC joint hosting the North East Rural Crime Conference with the Durham PCC. The event was aimed at police forces and organisations across Cleveland, Durham, North Yorkshire, and Northumbria, and highlighted the progress made since the last conference. This was the first time that Cleveland had hosted the event.7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A Criminal Justice Volunteers Fair was held to encourage volunteering, not only as special constables, but across all of criminal justice. The PCC brought together organisations such as Victim Support, My Sisters Place (DV service), DTV Probation Service, CPS, Unite mediation services, the Prince’s Trust, and Cleveland Police. 16 organisations were represented with some 900 potential volunteers identified.&#xa0;The event illustrated how volunteers already make an impact in the criminal justice service as well as highlighting volunteering opportunities and showing how the various agencies together support an important area. &#xa0;The College of Policing noted “The Criminal Justice Volunteer Fair was the first of its type anywhere in England and it was the by far the best example of community and collaborative working.”&#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Give it a Go’ is a project supported by the PCC which aims to disseminate information through Blue Tooth and other technologies on diversionary activities available for young people. The project is being delivered as a collaboration between the Police and Teesside University and aims to reduce antisocial behaviour by promoting diversionary activities.7.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The PCC has launched annual Cleveland Community Safety Awards to highlight good practice in community safety. The awards were hosted by Teesside University and sponsored by housing providers.7.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The PCC chairs the core partnership which drives forward the engagement of young people who are classified as NEETs. Talent Match is a 5-year young person led project that will engage, inspire and support 500 young people aged 18-24 from the most deprived wards in Cleveland who have been unemployed for 12 months or more.  By the end of the project, 400 young people will have improved confidence, motivation, self esteem and skills and 100 young people will be supported into employment or enterprise, sustained for 6 months or more. The Project is a collaborative approach to service delivery by the PCC, Princes Trust, Voluntary Sector, ASDA, PD Ports, Middlesbrough College.&#xa0;

[[[Transparency of and reporting by commissioners to date.]]]8.1              The website http://www.cleveland.pcc.police.uk not only facilitates adherence to Specified Information Orders but carries far more detail on the operation of the PCC. Some 1000 people visit each month. It provides an in box for those users who need further information. An independent joint audit committee is open to the public, on line ‘community clicks’ are held, a newsletter is produced and public meetings are held across Cleveland. It is disappointing that the media focus is far more likely to be on trivia than on the important work undertaken. Despite the facts being published on the website it is equally disappointing to see media reports of limited accuracy.   There are serious concerns that the desire to have some form of PCC comparator tables published will lead to distortion of the facts and diversion from the important issues.&#xa0;8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The police and crime panel have been assiduous in their scrutiny of PCC actions and this has supported the genuine desire to be open. &#xa0;

[[[Additional information]]]&#xa0;9.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The wider responsibilities of the PCC beyond policing can be illustrated by the drive to improve the coroners service; currently subject to unacceptable delays. A partnership with the local authority, and probation service has provided a roadmap to sustainable improvement. Reflecting on this wider responsibility, the term ‘police and crime commissioner’ should perhaps be replaced by ‘community safety commissioner’.9.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Achieving ‘living wage’ accreditation, especially as Cleveland has outsourced so much of its services, is a significant achievement.9.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Identifying that because Home Office set firearm licence fees which do not cover costs, they require forces to subsidise licence holders. Ending this subsidy would reduce the need to cut officer numbers.9.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Alcohol continues to be a major driver to crime and disorder and a consequent drain on resources across the criminal justice arena. Government failure to move to minimum unit pricing could reduce pressure and assist the public sector in dealing with austerity.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
