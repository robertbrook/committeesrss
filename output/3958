[normal]Written evidence from Patients First (GMC0015)[bold]Patients First is a network of NHS whistleblowers and supporters who purpose is to reduce death and harm in the NHS by campaigning for the UK Government to create policies and laws that ensure the NHS becomes open and accountable and we will actively support all those who raise concerns about patient safety
[normal](1) Patients  First has concerns that the General Medical Council has a poor understanding of the nature of raising concerns and does not in its system and processes, adequately take note of whistleblowers information or take active steps to support and protect them from [bold]victimisation[bold].[bold]Summary and recommendation[bold]Submission[bold]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the case of Patients First founder Dr Kim Holt 2955126 who 
[normal]whistleblew
[normal] with regard to the understaffing and administration issues at St Ann’s Hospital 
[normal]Haringey
[normal], she raised these system issues with the GMC in the post baby P time before she was openly acknowledged as a whistleblower.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] Despite numerous attempts to notify the GMC of the 
[normal]Haringey
[normal] health system issues, the GMC appeared to dismiss or take account of these in the case of Dr Al 
[normal]Zayyat
[normal].
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Al 
[normal]Zayyat
[normal],  became suicidal through the process of her fitness to 
[normal]pratice
[normal] hearings. 
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A significant amount of her distress was the manner in which she was referred to the GMC by her employer and that she felt used as a scapegoat.
[normal]5)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nurse Ms L Blackburn
[normal] was a whistleblower in the case of 
[normal]Dr 
[normal]Hickstep
[normal] a GP in Oxford and she was not given a chance to be interviewed by the case examiners at the time that 
[normal]Dr 
[normal]Hickstep’s
[normal] case was being looked at. Ms Blackburn lost her job having raised her concerns about 
[normal]Dr 
[normal]Hicksteps
[normal] practice, and she feels that the least the GMC could have done is to have listened to her detailed evidence whilst his case was being looked at by the GMC.
[normal]6)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The most famous case of a doctor being referred to the GMC having raised patient safety concerns is that of Dr Raj 
[normal]Mattu
[normal], a consultant cardiologist. He was reportedly referred to the GMC with over a hundred allegations, all subsequently proven to be wrong. In the meantime he was subjected to huge emotional pressure, and this affected his health badly. He remains out of his post and has endured many years of legal battles to try and protect his name.
[normal]7)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are however other cases of doctors who have been referred to the GMC following raising of concerns and we believe that a full inquiry into these cases needs to happen so that there can be steps taken to prevent this happening in the future.
[normal]8)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are a number of high profile cases, where there have been serious failures of patient care and where doctors should have been more responsive to early warnings. 
[normal]9)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We submit that in the examples of Community 
[normal]paediatric
[normal] services, 
[normal]Haringey
[normal], maternity services at 
[normal]Morecambe
[normal] Bay, Warnings at Stafford hospital, the GMC should have looked into the roles of responsible medical practitioners, and should be more ready to hold these individuals to account for failures to protect patient safety, and act in a pro active way rather than await referrals from elsewhere.
[normal]10)[bold] 
[normal]Finally Dr Jane Collins ex Chief executive of Great Ormond Street hospital removed herself from the GMC register in 2010, when the scandal of the alleged cover up over baby P death was in the press. This has prevented a fitness to practice hearing regards her involvement in the editing of the 
[normal]Sibert
[normal] report being possible. There is clear evidence that Dr Collins edited the report, and removed the references to the service being clinically risky or of “grave concern” to the investigators. Being able to remove oneself from the register in this way seems wrong.
[normal](2) The refusal of the General Medical Council to accept any referrals regarding Fitness for Practice of senior medical managers in respect of their acts and omissions as lead doctors[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary and recommendation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Submission[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]56. You must give priority to patients on the basis of their clinical need if these decisions are within your power. If inadequate resources, policies or systems prevent you from doing this, and patient safety, dignity or comfort may be seriously compromised, you must follow the guidance in 
[normal]paragraph 25b
[normal].
[normal]"I was instructed to change my reports, to reduce the number of points that might be awarded to the claimants. I felt that was wrong professionally and ethically.”
[normal] (

[normal])
[normal]5. If Dr Wood’s allegations were correct (and we believe they are) then there would appear to be a prima facie case for considering whether the senior ATOS medical leaders might have breached Paragraphs 56, 24 and 25 b and c of 
[normal]Good Medical Practice
[normal] which state
[normal]24. You must promote and encourage a culture that allows all staff to raise concerns openly and safely. 
[normal]25. You must take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is or may be seriously compromised.

[normal]"Our role in the process is to do an assessment, gather the medical evidence and write a report that goes to the department, upon which they can gather more evidence and make a decision."
[normal]"Clinical judgement is the foundation of our part of the Work Capability Assessment process. We send the DWP independent, clinically justified reports to help the department's decision makers make a decision on benefit entitlement...”
[normal]“Edward Cooper is mistaken that the principle of making the care of your patients does not apply to doctors when they are assessing 
[normal]benefits claimants on behalf of ATOS. Our guidance is for all doctors and in the guidance we use the term ‘patient’ to refer to anyone whom doctors test, treat or assess in their professional capacity as a doctor. This includes amongst others, employees, benefits and insurance claimants, and athletes.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]“16 [bold]Whether you have a management role or not, your primary duty is to
[normal]patients. Their care, dignity and safety must be your first concern. You
[normal]also have a duty to the health of the wider community, your profession,
[normal]your colleagues and the organisation in which you work.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Although these principles are relevant to all doctors, whatever roles they have, the judgment in Remedy UK Ltd, R (on the application of Remedy UK Ltd) v General Medical Council [2010] EWHC 1245 (Admin) found that there are some roles that are so far removed from practising medicine that the GMC’s fitness to practise procedures do not apply to them. However, doctors are still accountable to the GMC when they are performing a wide range of clinical management roles (for example, as a clinical or medical director) or other non-clinical roles (for example, as a medical educator or researcher), even if medical knowledge or expertise is not needed for the roles (for example, as a chief executive of a hospital

[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our complaint is whether, in the light of the systematic and publicly recorded evidence of standards which appear to undermine the ethical standards expected of medical managers and leaders of these processes, they should be held to account for not upholding the ethical standards which are a prerequisite of their registration as medical practitioners relies on. In particular we believe that all the healthcare practitioners are required to show the same level of competency and professional duty towards their patients and clients as their peers working in other healthcare organisations and that the three practitioners about whom we raise concerns had a duty to ensure that was the case and have a case to answer that they failed in that duty.
[normal]We have reviewed your letter about ATOS and the doctors who have held senior management roles there. We have also reviewed the decision of the Court in the Remedy UK case. 
[normal]We have concluded that at present we have no evidence or information raising specific fitness to practise concerns of any of the doctors identified. As such the GMC cannot investigate the matter further under our fitness to practise procedures and we will be taking no further action at present.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Applying your logic to Mid Staffordshire or any other hospital, can you clarify whether this means, as it appears to do, that any failing by registered medical leaders to set appropriate standards, to ensure the 
[normal]work of their staff was monitored and appraised, to ensure that the standards to be followed met the requirements within Good Medical Practice, or to fail to act on public reports of unsafe or inappropriate practice, would not (could not) be the basis of any investigation by the GMC unless it could be demonstrated the individual hands on medical practice of senior managers who may never undertake direct care, or whose own direct care is deemed appropriate would excuse them from investigation? 
[normal]Please be advised that we can’t consider any matters related to ATOS as an organisation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We can only consider issues that would raise concerns about an individual doctor’s fitness to practise. 
[normal]As there have been no specific concerns raised about a doctor we are not able to assist you with this matter at present.
