"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by the CLAThe CLA is a membership organisation which represents 33,000 landowners and farmers as such the provision of food is \nvery important to our membership. \n&#xa0;\n1.1\n \nAll the major policy affecting food security in this c\nountry \nis\n decided at EU level, \nthe Common Agricultural Policy\n (CAP)\n, t\nhe EU Common External Tariff (i.e. trade policy) and \nmany other \nEU directives\n, governing almost all environmental policy\n. This means Defra must provide leadership in Europe to shape emerging EU policy on \nfood \nsecurity.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n The CLA pressed for the\n \nimplemen\ntation of the \nlatest reform of the \nCAP\n 2014-2020\n to ensure \nthat European agriculture is in a position to produce as much food as it can, sustainably, and in response to market signals. \nThe CAP also\n \nhas a role in providing\n incentives and mechanisms to encou\nrage farming that uses less water and fossil fuels, produces less greenhouse gas emissions, does not degrade soils and manages nitrogen use better. \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nLand is a limited commodity; \nthe \ntotal size of the UK is 24 million hectares, 76% of which is dedicate\nd to agriculture.  \nLand conversion is a large source of greenhouse gas\n emissions\n, and perhaps the greatest source of biodiversity loss. \nThe optimal land use mix for any given area will depend on local conditions.\n \nIt wouldn’t be feasible or environmentally beneficial to plough up UK uplands to try and grow grains and vegetables. Instead, this land could be used for low input livestock systems or converted to woodland. \n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nClimate change is likely to mean a reducti\non in agricultural land, through processes such as sea level rise and changes in rainfall patterns. We need to understand better how efficient different food types are in terms of their land use. \nWe know that \nin the UK, as in most of northern Europe,\n \norgan\nic crop yields can be 40%–50% lower than conventional farming, and labour use can be 10%–25% higher. \n&#xa0;\n1.5 Producing\n sufficient food is only part of the challenge the world faces, the implications of the way in which it is produced are equally important. T\nhe only acceptable form of food production is that which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.\n S\nustainable production\n is not the preserve of any one method of farming\n&#xa0;\n1.6 \nM\naximising food\n production does not rely solely on agriculture; there will be knock on impacts along the food supply chain, e.g. on infrastructure-transport systems \nand\n food storage. How\n \nthis\n will\n be managed\n needs further consideration\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.7 \nUK public-sector research into food and farming is still world-class in some respects. However, there is an urgent need to: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 \nThe market price of food reflects commercial supply and demand factors.  However, it is the intention of the retail sector to ensure that the cost of food products to the consumer is kept \nas \nlow\n as possible\n. This necessarily will have an impact on the ability of producers to match the demands from supermarkets.  \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nProducers wish to see higher food prices in order to maintain viable margins. For \nfarmers, where input prices have often risen at a rate above\n inflation, static pricing or even reduced returns\n,\n \nmakes it harder for farmers to compete.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nIn this sense\n,\n the issue to resolve is essentially that between the producer and the retailer. \nT\nhis should not exempt the impact of other parties in the food s\nupply chain, such as processors or packagers. \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nThe CLA believes it is incumbent\n on the retail sector to ensure\n the relationship between the producer and the retailer is both fair and equitable. To make farming more sustainable, there needs to be an eq\nuitable share of risk and profit along the food supply chain, and some form of investment from the larger retailers in the producer’s business\n,\n to help secure the ability to supply. Whilst it is accepted that a cheap food policy is being pursued by the Gov\nernment, there has to be a realisation that the increasing costs of producing food will lead to many exiting the industry\n,\n which is a threat to food security.\n&#xa0;\n2.5 The Groceries Code Adjudicator must enforce the Groceries Supply Code of Practice.  This sho\nuld ensure that retailers do not transfer excessive risk and unexpected costs to their direct suppliers. This would otherwise impact \non suppliers’ willingness to i\nnvest, quality and innovation, \nleading to potential consumer detriment\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6 \nConsumers need t\no be encouraged to think more about the environmental consequences of where and how their food is produced. The public need to be provided with information to enable them to make responsible choices. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1 \nFood is a global, not\n national\n, market. Demand for food is rising rapidly.  By 2050, the world will need to feed 9 billion people on about the same land area as we use today, \nusing limited fertiliser, water and \npesticides and in the context of a rapidly-changing climate.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n  The CLA\n believe\ns\n the prime factors that influence global markets and food prices are:\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nBy concentrating production in a few large countries, the risk of a significant disruption to the world’s food supplies increases. If\n, as forecast, \nBraz\nilian chicken exports were\n \nto account for 89.7% of the global volume by 2018, the consequences if a problem were to occur with their production could be substantial.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nLand-rich countries\n and regions\n, such as Brazil\n and Africa\n, have great potential to boost global food supplies, but neither their ability to realise this potential, nor a well-functioning global market, can be taken for granted. \nWe also have to deal globally with limited water; not just depleting aquifers, but al\nso droughts that\n, due to climate change, \nare expected to strike with increasing intensity\n \nin the agricultural heartlands of continents the UK imports food\n from\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nWhile a healthy domestic agriculture is an essential component of a secure food system in\n the UK, a balance is needed.  Total self-sufficiency would make the UK’s food supplies less secure rather than more secure.  If the UK refocused solely on domestic production and ignored external trade, there could be an unforeseen catastrophic event, suc\nh as a major crop failure or disease epidemic in livestock, which would leave the UK needing to rapidly source food from global markets. Diversity of supply is the key to resilience.\n&#xa0;\n3.6 \nTrading relationships themselves ar\ne\n a source of risk.\n In 2006, 26 c\nountries, including the UK, accounted for 90% of the UK’s food supplies, up from 22 countries in 1996.  In 2009, 34 countries each supplied the UK with at least 0.5% of its food imports. The Netherlands accounted for the highest share with 13%. According t\no Defra\n,\n the vast majority of our food (69% in value) comes from trading partners in the EU. But, \nthere is no guarantee that even our EU trading relationships will always remain stable. In\n \nthe event of severe shortages of basic food stuffs, it is questiona\nble whether intra-EU trade would continue to operate smoothly.  While this may seem unlikely, there might be a need to consider contingency plans for dealing with the breakdown of the single market.  If EU countries did attempt to take protectionist action\n in a time of severe food shortages, the Commission would seek to ensure that the rules of the single market were upheld. But it may not be able to apply sanctions with sufficient speed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1 \nIt is very difficult to make an accurate forecast of what value GM technology could bring to the UK food sector. This is because the current regulatory framework is so restrictive that the possibility for companies to develop GM products is very limited. A\ns a result, UK food producers do not \ncurrently \nengage with the potential of such technologies\n,\n as it \nis not commercially viable.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nGM techniques, used as part of a wider approach to food se\ncurity, can make a significant\n positive impact to food productio\nn in the UK. This is not just in how we can produce\n more from existing resources; \nit also concerns how we can protect biodiversity, improve natural resource provision, and make contributions to animal welfare. It is therefore vital that food security, howe\nver it is defined, takes into account the indirect challenges that come with needing to produce more. \nIn our view,\n the livestock and woodland sectors have arguably more to gain from such GM technologies, and subsequently more to contribute in food security\n policy.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nT\nhe net global economic benefits at farm level added by cultivating GM crops\n,\n rather than conventional varieties of crops\n,\n have been estimated at $14billion in 2010, and by 2011, almost 17 million farmers around the world planted GM crops, up from 15 million in 2010\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nIt is estimated that without GM, additional plantings of 5.1 million hectares of soybeans, 5.6 million h\nectares of corn, \nand three\n million hectares of cotton and 350,000 hectares of rape seed would have been globally required in 2010 to maintain existing output.\n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nIn 2013, supported by national governments and UNESCO, the International Service for the Acq\nuisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) calculated the effects of GM crops on the environment. It concluded that GM crops alone saved the equivalent of 473 million kilograms of pesticides in 2011, saved 109 million hectares of new land being ploughed\n up and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 23 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 \nThe growth of yields worldwide has stagnated for many major \nconventional \nfood crops, as research published in Dec 2012 in the journal \nNature Communications\n \nshowed. If yield growth \ndoes not get \nback on track\n,\n \nthe UK is \ngoing to have trouble keeping up with population growth and resulting \nfood \ndemand, and prices will rise\n,\n as well as more land being converted from nature to agriculture.\n Development of higher yi\nelding and \nimproved \ndrought \nand pest \nresistant non-GM plant varieties would help\n, \nas well as selection of positive genetic traits in the livestock sector\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nIt \nwould be\n difficult to legislate or \nundertake policy intervention\n in this area without potentially compromising the market. Previous Government policy has \nsought\n to make the UK food chain more market orientated\n, e.g.\n with its s\ntrict decoupling policy approach under direct payments. \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nSome sectors have been able to build better resilience as a result\n \n– larger arable sectors have benefitted from area based payments, whilst livestock producers have\n \nsuffered\n \n– simply because \nof \nthe average size of\n their holdings\n. In a market of varying input costs and market returns, it has remained one of the key constant sources of regular income for farmers. \n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nIntensive sectors, such as pigs and poultry have been forced t\no become hugely re\nsilient, \nas they receive no effective support payments.  However, this has come at a price – coupled\n with\n high welfare standards imposed by the Government, the number of intensive producers have reduced notably as sizes of pig holdings have increased. Such\n economies of scale are becoming more common in agriculture (especially the livestock sector) in response to market forces and Government policy. \n&#xa0;\n5.4 \nDepending on the product in question, supply chains vary. Fresh produce will tend to have shorter chains\n, whilst component products will have longer and potentially more complicated supply chains. \n&#xa0;\n5.5 \nWhere there are longer supply chains, the ease of providing clear traceability and labelling to the consumer is potentially jeopardised. This was made clear \nwith beef products that contained traces of both horse meat and pig meat, in early 2013. To gain consumer confidence, these supply chains need\n to show greater transparency, arguably through labelling. H\nowever\n,\n where this inevitable cost is placed remains c\nontentious. \nIt should rest with the retailers at point of sale to the consumer, and not be passed onto the food producer. \n&#xa0;\n5.6 \nWe can be confident that robust traceability for some sectors is quite easy; however\n, for others\n it will be expensive and arguab\nly administratively complex\n,\n and may add further costs to bu\nsinesses, \npotentially compromising resilience. \n&#xa0;\n5.7\n The CLA supports \nfully \nthe need for traceability systems that ensure the safety of food products. \nW\ne believe that the emergence and success of \nthe \nf\narm assurance schemes in the different agricultural sectors have gone some way in ensuring that food is safe\n,\n and produced to a high quality\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1 \nIn the UK\n,\n the C\nlimate Change Act has been the \ntrigger to \nobtain\n better information about climate impacts and risks in a \nformat that\n allows businesses to plan. The Climate Change Risk Assessment process for different sectors, including Agriculture and \nForestry, will be updated every five years\n,\n and so offers the opportunity to continually refine and update.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nThere are some key ris\nks for agriculture that require\n different levels of resilience building\n,\n as well as adaptation\n,\n depending on the farming \nsystem\n,\n and their current \n&#xa0;\nability to make changes. The risks are drought, flooding, disease and pests. The changes that can be initiated are not just limited to financial or business related\n,\n but migh\nt also be geographical location\n, topography, soil type.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nAgricultural producers that rely on irrigated water will need to plan ahead to ensure that they have enough water during times \nof \nless availability. This will mean planning their water \nuse efficiently\n,\n as well as investment in infrastructure\n, such as\n on farm reservoirs to improve their resilience. The growing of more drought resistant crops will also help reduce risks to water stress.\n&#xa0;\n6.4 \nFlooding events will become more frequent and will require a range of responses\n,\n from improved drainage to embrac\ning more natural solutions, like \nflood alleviation. B\nut importantly\n,\n&#xa0;\nit will need improved forecasting to allow local decisions to be made. Changes to cropping systems and land use will need to be carefully made to fit changing local conditions.\n&#xa0;\n6.5 \nRenew\nables have a role to play in managing UK food security and supporting British farming.\n  They \ncan help reduce costs of production whilst providing environmental benefits.\n These benefits include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1 \nThe CLA is concerned by the levels of regulation in agriculture. \nMany find that the administrative burdens do not make \nfood productio\nn\n \nworthwhile.\n \nThis is why many mixed farm holdings are dropping certain aspects of their business and focussing \nonly \non the most profitable aspect. \n \n&#xa0;\n7.2 \nEven for small producers who are seeking to set up a specialist business outright, the amount of regu\nlation and red tape is very high. The key issue is that producers will have to deal with a multiplicity of agencies and bodies who often duplicate areas of competence\n,\n and very rarely share information with one another. An example would be sm\nall livestock \nproducers who wish\n to slaughter and sell products from their holding. The number of relevant bodies who they would have to deal with would include the FSA, Defra, Valuation Offices, Trading Standards, Local Authorities, AHVLA, the Environment Agency and Na\ntural England. \n&#xa0;\n7.3 \nT\nhe red tape \ninvolved is stifling\n businesses\n;\n it is often only larger businesses that have the resources to undertaken the compliance and administration.\n \nThe Government needs to fully implement the McDonald Review. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n4\n \nT\nhat\n said\n agri\nculture, as a secto\nr, has to be more innovative.  I\nncreasing attention has to be paid to the development of niche products. It is generally accepted that value added production is a main route to new markets and this development has to continue.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1 \nT\nhe UK is\n,\n on average\n,\n 62% self sufficient in food products. \nT\nhis level represents a fall of some 13% \nsince\n 1991\n and reflects the globalisation\n \nof the food market\n. \n&#xa0;\n8.2 \nAgricultural produce\n,\n such as milk and dairy products, given the climatic advantages the \nUK enjoys for grass growth, would suggest a greater focus should be afforded. However, expansion of the sector has been curtailed through the quota system\n,\n and th\ne latest milk deliveries figures suggest that production is significantly under quota. With milk quotas being removed in 2015, there is a real concern that the sector no longer has the capacity to expand as it might\n,\n in order to exploit commercial opportun\nities, both in the \nUK, EU\n and in other global markets.\n&#xa0;\n8.3 \nThe CLA believes \nthere has to be recognition that production is necessarily geared to price. If food security is to actually mean something\n,\n it has to recognise that farmers have to receive a fair\n return for their labours. Unfortunately, the current situation\n \nmeans that there is no equitable balance in the supply chain.\n&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;\n Future Farming: CLA Policy on Biotechnology 2013\n"
