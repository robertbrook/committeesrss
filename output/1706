default              
defaultSignificant progress has been made towards increasing the diversity of recruitment intakes across the Engineering industry e.g. 23% of EDF Energy new hires into our engineering business in 2012 were women (the UK talent pool indicates that approximately le
defaultss than 15% of STEM graduates in the UK are women). 
default 
defaultWomen currently within our organisation also show increasing engagement on our annual employee survey year-on-year; 2013 engagement scores of women within our engineering business at the highest aggregat
defaulte level show positive engagement of 89% (this is higher than the non-gender general UK benchmark of 72%).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultWith the steady influx of women into STEM careers, one might expect that this talent pipeline would show a continuous (but perhaps gradual) increase when moving further through an organisation’s management structure. 
default 
defaultIndeed, focused research and examinati
defaulton of internal practices at EDF Energy has highlighted that within the first 10 years of a STEM career there is no discernable difference in the rate of progression of men and women. 
default 
defaultOutput from internal focus groups also showed that women in the organisa
defaulttion did not perceive barriers to progression directly related to gender. 
default 
defaultHowever, it was also highlighted that some women were making a conscious decision not to progress into leadership roles, and we are exploring further their reasons behind this.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultThere was some evidence in the focus groups that some women were uncomfortable with actions that might be perceived as positive discrimination when progressing their careers: particularly communications which could be construed as target or goal setting ag
defaultainst numbers of women.  
defaultHowever, it was widely agreed that the biggest enabler to ensuring women are keen to progress into leadership careers within the company was flexibility.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultThis was mainly in terms of role design and ‘ways of working’ within some
default of our management routines. It was also suggested to include more flexibility in terms of career paths and the means of gaining development for the necessary experience required in senior roles (e.g. a flexible approach to mobility: recognizing that indiv
defaultiduals may have varying degrees of mobility at different life stages). 
default 
defaultAligned with this they highlighted the need for transparency and open communication: to ensure a level of fairness across the business and to assist them with more effective career and
default development planning.
default 
default It is also worth noting that the focus groups highlighted that male employees also sought increased flexibility.  
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultMapping forward the % of women in our engineering workforce, proportions of female talent would grow from 13% to 
default18% in 10 years, with the % of female managers growing from 9% to 15% if progress is accelerated. 
default 
defaultWe are currently working across the company to evaluate our ways of working and how to build further flexibility into job designs.
default&#xa0;defaultWhen women leave 
defaultacademia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
default&#xa0;default7.
default              
defaultIt is of critical importance to EDF Energy that we continue to build the diversity of our w
defaultorkforce. 
default 
defaultEmployees who feel valued and respected are more likely to be highly motivated and committed, and more likely to perform better.
default 
default It is also important that our workforce reflects our communities and customers, leading to a better understanding o
defaultf our customers.
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultIn their ‘The State of Engineering 2013’ report, Engineering UK reported that ‘over two thirds (68.3%) of male first degree graduates went into an engineering and technology occupation. 
default 
defaultThe comparable figure for women was 51.1%. Conve
defaultrsely, just under a third (30.2%) of males went into a non-STEM career, compared with 45.1% of women’. 
default 
defaultThis trend can be seen to impact the diversity of EDF Energy’s Engineering and Science graduates. 
default 
defaultOf the 2013 graduate intake, 24% are female. 
default 
defaultThis un
defaultder-representation is evident from application stage, with 23% of applications coming from females.
default 
default Given that 15.3% of 2009 Engineering degree starters were female, an application rate of less than 25% is perhaps not surprising, but it is essential that 
defaultthe representation of females in Engineering and Science graduate schemes increases.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultEDF Energy 
defaultis
default therefore working to attract greater numbers of applications from female STEM graduates, including organisation of targeted events for female undergradua
defaulttes, the development of relationships between EDF Energy’s Women’s Network and university networks, and ensuring that the diversity of our workforce is reflected in the material we use with prospective employees.
default&#xa0;defaultWhat should universities and the higher ed
defaultucation sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
default&#xa0;default10.
default              
defaultAt Higher Education level, female participation in STEM varies greatly between and within subject areas. 
default 
defaultThe figure below shows the
default gender breakdown of applicants for 2007/08. 
default 
defaultComputer Science (15% female participation) and Engineering (12% female participation) are indicated as having the lowest proportion of female applicants within STEM, with engineering remaining static at around
default 12% over the last six years.
defaultDiagram 2 - 
defaultApplications to STEM subjects at HE level (segregated by Gender)
default&#xa0;default11.
default              
defaultAs an industry that requires a skill-specific workforce, university education and applied engineering courses are valuable to ensuring that the future engineering workforce is equipped. 
default 
defaultIt is critical that the engineering and higher education sectors atte
defaultmpt to increase participation from female students at this level and retain it through greater engagement at the academic level.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultMany UK engineering companies have female focused employee networks that are helping to drive change in the female make-up
default of engineering industry.
default 
default Partnerships between universities and employee networks are an area for investigation.
default 
default For example, the chair of EDF Energy’s Women’s network recently spoke at a careers event for women held at University College London, and we 
defaultare exploring further opportunities in this area. Women’s Employee Networks could work in partnership with universities in terms of sponsoring candidates, mentoring students, breaking down gender perceptions of the engineering industry, and providing visib
defaultility of senior females as role models.
default 
default This will help retain women within academia, and increase their desire to stay within STEM.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
default The appropriate use of role models has been widely recognised as a successful tool to increasing female participation in STEM careers, the key challenge therefore lies in reaching large numbers.
default 
default STEMNET’s 20,000 STEM ambassadors (of whom 40% are female) 
defaultis an appropriate successful programme; of those ambassadors who have an engineering background and/or career, 25% are female (and 80% of these are under 35).
default 
default Increasing the numbers of females attending and participating in various STEM related initiative
defaults is a pre-requisite to affecting attitudes. 
default 
defaultEDF Energy actively promotes STEMNET to all employees, including new graduate and apprentice starters, and recently offered Public Speaking training to its STEM ambassadors.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultEDF Energy has coordinated and 
defaultcontributed to wide a range of events and initiatives for younger generations, children from age 
defaultsix
default, to change the way children think about STEM. 
default 
defaultThese include general events, for example 
defaultEDF
default 
defaultEnergy 
defaultis principal Education sponsor of the Cheltenham Science Festival, and helped further its outreach to 250 students from schools in Somerset through a ‘careering Around’ session. 
default 
defaultFollowing a ‘speed-dating’ format, pupils got the chance to question young sc
defaultientists and engineers about their jobs and talk informally about what it is really like to work in industry. 
default 
defaultThe session aimed to help young people consider science subjects in a fun and engaging way, ahead of making career choices at A-Level.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultWe ha
defaultve also targeted some of our early careers outreach specifically towards younger women. 
default 
defaultOur ‘Inspire’ Programme encourages young girls to get involved in STEM subjects and helps to open their eyes to pathways and careers in our industry. 
default 
defaultThe ‘Women into 
defaultEngineering and Construction’ is a progressive programme starting in year 
defaulteight
default, which takes cohorts of girls through an interactive STEM related experience over a 
defaultthree
default year period. 
default 
defaultThis is run through our partnership with Bridgwater College, Somerset.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultAt a later stage in career pathway, we run the ‘Access to Apprentice’ scheme which gives a foundation year of educational tuition to those who may not normally choose to follow an apprentice route. 
default 
defaultAlthough the programme is not targeted at women, we h
defaultave tended to have a higher intake of girls. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultOther ways in which we are working to attract female talent to our organisation is to highlight female role models from the organisation externally, in order to showcase the opportunities available. 
default

defaultThe

default              
defaultIt is essential that all students are provided with quality careers guidance from ages 14 – 18, when the choices of A-Level and degree subjects are made. 
default 
defaultThis careers guidance must come from both educational institutions and employers in the engineering s
defaultector. 
default 
defaultGovernmental policy and practice that supports the provision of this careers guidance is essential.  
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultThe creation of female role models in Engineering is also of critical importance.  The understanding of, and engagement in, their field of sc
defaultience has improved significantly in recent years, largely due to the popularisation of role models such as Prof Brian Cox through national media.  There is less understanding and awareness of engineers and engineering careers, and therefore nation-wide pro
defaultmotion of key female role models in this field would significantly help develop interest in careers in the Engineering field.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultThe development of local role models is supported largely by the STEM Ambassador programme of schools intervention.
default 
default STEM Ambassadors significantly improve the accessibility of STEM professions to students of all ages, and increase awareness of the variety of careers and 
defaultopportunities available to engineers or all backgrounds.  It is of critical importance that this pro
defaultgramme continues to be supported and grown within the UK.
default&#xa0;defaultConclusion
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultEDF Energy is making progress in working to widen actively the pool of talent from which we recruit. 
default 
defaultWhile we have seen progress in increasing the number of female entrants to our 
defaultSTEM areas (such as the nuclear science and engineering graduate scheme and apprentice scheme), we recognise that there is more still that we, as a company, and as an industry, can do.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultWe would highlight the significant of using positive role models t
defaulto attract women into STEM careers, and how targeted marketing STEM opportunities (both through role models and also through using specific recruitment channels such as at targeted university events) has increased the number of applications from women.
default 
default We 
defaultmust always recruit the best person for the role, however
default,
default widening our pool enables high-potential females to join an industry they may not have previously considered. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default              
defaultIt is important for Government and industry to work together to increase the enga
defaultgement of female students at all academic stages of their STEM careers. 
default 
defaultThe promotion of STEM through female role models, sound career advice, and increasing the visibility of the engineering sector as a career prospect for women will he
defaultlp us achieve our 
defaultcommon goals.
