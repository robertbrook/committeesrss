default              
defaultHow do 
defaultGovernment and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?
default&#xa0;
defaultIn West Somerset, Somerset County Council (SCC) has 
defaultthe responsibility for public
default transport and the Local Transport Plan.  West Somerset Council (WSC) has cl
defaultose links with our parish/town councils and their concerns are relayed to SCC via our district 
defaultcouncil 
defaultLead Member for the Environment and the SCC 
defaultcouncillor (who is also a 
defaultWSC 
defaultdistrict councillor), who both sit on the SCC Transport
default Forum
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA Voluntary Car
default Scheme Partnership exists in the district which is attended by SCC
default and local community transport providers
default.  This group feeds into Transport in Somerset 
defaultCommunity Transport Forum 
defaultmeetings twice a year.

defaultTo what extent are the needs of different group
defaults
default o
defaultf passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?
default&#xa0;
defaultWest Somerset district is spread over 740 square kilometres with 0.45 people per hectare making the area one of the most sparsely populated in the co
defaultuntry.  Rural residents
default have an increased pressure as they have 
defaultto travel further for services 
defaultplus
default challenges with regard to accessibility by road to key services and employment centres, especially via foot and public transport.
default  More than one in five peo
defaultple in West Somerset live beyond the ‘reasonable’ limit for accessing key services via public transport, with the exception of hospitals and primary schools.  Only 26% of residents live where they can either walk or get public transport to access their
default loc
defaultal
default town centre. 
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung people find it difficult to access evening employment, studies or social activities as there is limited public transport often finishing to early.  Many older people who do not have their own transport rely on community transport to
default take them to and from hospital appointments, though they struggle to attend 
defaultany 
defaultsocial functions due to the lack of volunteer drivers for the community car schemes.  Accessible Transport West (ATWest) 
defaultprovides
default a minibus service which can accommodate peopl
defaulte with wheelchairs and other physical needs
default of clients
default.

defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are no mainline rail 
defaultlinks in West Somerset; the closest mainline station is Taunton.  A heritage steam railway operates a tourist service along a 20 mile track between Minehead and Bishop Lydeard.  The track is connected to the mainline at Taunton but is used very infrequentl
defaulty for tourist services.  There would be potential to bring a commuter rail service into West Somerset with sufficient finances – reducing the traffic and CO
default2
default emissions on the busy A358.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is one viable bus service which runs between Minehead and Taunt
defaulton.  All other public transport services in West Somerset are subsidised.  SCC is considering axing many of these services in the future to reduce their costs.

default.
defaultTo our knowledge no mapping of the present service provision has taken place in the 
defaultdistrict, so it is not possible to confidently identify where the gaps in provision are.
default&#xa0;
defaultTransport provision is a huge issue in the district and Clinical Commissioning, Public Health, MIND, Somerset Sight and the Alzheimer's Society all share our concerns
default about the poor public transport 
defaultservice which is available across a
default large area of our district.

defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?
default              
default&#xa0;
defaultWest 
defaultSomerset is fortunate to have nine community car schemes operating in the district, 
defaultrun
default by volunteers, where there is little or no public transport, with the aim of reducing 
defaultindividual isolation and providing
default access to healthcare
default and ensuring
default local familie
defaults’ health needs are met
default, where possible
default.  Accessible Transport West (ATWest
default - 
defaulthttp://www.atwest.org.uk/
default) is a community transport service offering wheelchair and accessible transport to residents of West Somerset. 
default They provide for those who do not have their own transport or cannot access public transport or car scheme
defaults due to lack to availability,
default sickness, age or disability.  The services include a SLINKY ‘dial a ride’ door to door service, a car scheme using vol
defaultunteers own vehicles, Moor Rover
default (taking local people and tourists with their dogs/bikes to the moor to access linear/circular rights of way) (self-financing), six shopping buses to Minehead and one to Williton (full to capacity – no vacancies at present)
default 
defaultand travel club.
default  All users of ATWest services register free of charge and can then access all their services.
default&#xa0;
defaultDue to the increase in retirement age and the need for people to continue to work, our community transport schemes are finding it much harder to
default recruit volunteer drivers; these services may need additional funding in the future to encourage more drivers.
default&#xa0;
default5
default              
defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport service?
default&#xa0;
defaultOnly 
defaultthose residents who can afford to pay for taxi services should be expected to rely on this provision
default, particularly taking into consideration the large distances people have to travel to reach our main service areas
default.  Many of our isolated residents are unable to afford the luxury of a taxi service with the added 
defaultchallenge of having an unknown driver.  For some this can be addressed by using community car scheme service (when available) as the driver is usually a loca
defaultl person, who is already known to them
default, thereby reducing their perceived vulnerability
default.
default&#xa0;
default6
default              
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities?  How can these services be made more affordable?
default&#xa0;
defaultCosts for providin
defaultg the service will only increase.  Funding should be based on need 
defaultand allocated to those who do not have sufficient funds to pay for taxi services.
default  
default  
defaultExplore new ways to enable people to get from home to their required destination.  Consider bringing mor
defaulte services to residents rather than them having to travel.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would be grateful if the above evidence can be taken into consideration by the Transport Committee.
