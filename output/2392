Written evidence submitted by the defaultFamily Rights Group (LAI 0017)default&#xa0;defaultWhat is Family Rights GroupdefaultFamily Rights Group is the charity in England and Wales that advises families whose children are involved with, or require, local authority services because of welfare needs or concerns. We promote policies and practices that help children to be raised safely and thrive within their family and community and give families a voice when decisions are made about their children’s lives.  We campaign for effective support to help struggling parents and family and friends carers who are raising children that cannot live at home.  We provide a free, confidential telephone and email advice service assisting over 7000 callers per year. Typically, this involves advising:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultparents of their legal position, helping them to understand the child protection concerns and supporting them to work with the local authority to make, and implement, safe plans for their child; and 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultrelatives and friends about taking on the care of a child who is unable to live with their parents, and the implications of different legal options.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also
default lead th
defaulte Kinship Care Alliance, which comprises a number of voluntary organisations working with family and friends carers, local authorities and academics. The Alliance develops and promotes a joint policy agenda aimed at preventing children from being unnecessarily raised outside their family and securing improved support to enhance outcomes for children who are raised in family and friends care.
defaultOur concerns defaultWe have grave concerns about 
defaultthe following government proposals to reform legal aid which affect our client group:
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe support the revision to the proposed residence test (in the ‘Next Steps’ document) so that children under 12 months won’t need to meet the requirement of at least 12 months of previous, lawful residence.  However we are concerned that paragraph 1.24 of ‘Next Steps’ then says that the government has now also 
default“revised the proposed residence test…. 
defaultto include exceptions for certain types of cases, where we accept that there should be no requirement for an individual to demonstrate a strong connection to the UK
default”. 
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe hope this means that the 
defaultresidence 
defaulttest won’t apply to parties to proceedings under Part IV of the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002
default (as suggested in the Impact Assessment document)
default but since we have not seen this spelt out we include our concerns below should that not be the case: 
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current position is that all parents and others with parental responsibility are entitled to non means and non merits tested legal aid for care and emergency protection order appl
defaultications
default. Legal aid
default for them
default in placement order and adoption proceedings is means and merits tested.
default The effect is that parents (and others with parental responsibility) almost always have legal aid, hence they are represented when decisions are made by a court which may result in their children being removed from their care permanently against their wishes. 
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are particularly concerned that the 
defaultresidence pr
defaultoposal may result in parents whose children are subject to such proceedings 
defaultNOT 
defaultgetting legal aid 
defaultunless
default they have lived 
default(
defaultlawfully
default)
default in the country for 12 months
default and are lawfully resident at the time of 
defaultapplicationUNLESS
default a clear exception to this rule is made for them. If such an exception were not made, the proposal would seriously undermine their fair treatment in the decision-making process when the State decides that their child sh
defaultould
default be removed from their care against their wishes. This would not only have a potentially detrimental effect on the individual lives of the children and parents involved, but also would be very likely to constitute a breach of both their human rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the ECHR, imp
defaultlemented
default in domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998.
default  It is established by the 
defaultEuropean Court of Justice that Article 6 rights to a fair trial require legal aid for children and family members in care proceedings etc.
default  
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithout 
defaultthis
default express exception
default, 
defaultindividual parents (and others with parental responsibility) would have to 
defaultpass the residence test 
defaultto get legal aid. For those who could not, they would have to apply to the Legal Aid Agency under exceptional criteria in LASPO
default, for legal aid to prevent a breach of their human rights. 
defaultW
defaulte have no doubt that in some cases it would lead directly to children being unnecessarily separated from their families and/or forcibly adopted without the parents having legal representation.
default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultWe advise many parents/family members in situations where redress or review
default of decisions 
default is not available through family proceedings but only through judicial review. 
defaultThis arises particularly when local authorities make administrative decisions about the care and support of children outside of any legal process. 
defaultEg
default: 
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is already incredibly difficult for the family members we advise to access judicial review due to the complexity of the law, risk of costs against them and means testing for legal aid. Their legitimate access to judicial review proceedings will be further compounded by
default the proposals to:
default2.2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultO
defaultnly pay their legal services providers for work done, if leave is then granted
default. 
default 
defaultThis will make it even harder for our clients to find providers willing to take on their cases particularly if the matter is urgent, complex or justifiably pushing at the boundaries of established law.
default2.2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRemove legal aid in borderline case. This involves amending the merits criteria to remove civil legal aid for cases that are assessed as having ‘borderline’ prospects of success. Such cases are already only funded where they have ‘
defaulta significant wider public interest’ or are ‘of overwhelming importance to the individual’ so the measure is likely to prevent some important but challenging cases.
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultYet, unlike family proceedings it is effectively impossible to happy for judicial review as a litigant in person.
