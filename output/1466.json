"&#xa0;\nProfessor Terence Daintith, Emeritus Professor of Law, University of London – Written evidence&#xa0;The purpose of this submission is to draw to the attention of the Committee the impact of Clause 28 of the Bill on the scope for Parliamentary and democratic supervision of an important area of policy.  I am aware that the main concern of the Committee at this stage is with general issues, but since there are few energy-related points in the Bill it seems wise to bring the point to the Committee’s attention at this stage in case it does not fall within the scope of any specific later request for comment.  The provision is also unusual in that the only regulatory burden it removes is one on the Minister to bring the rules he or she is making to the notice of Parliament. \n&#xa0;\nNo. 3 of the Committee’s questions asks whether “t\nhe changes proposed in the draft Bill [are] evidence-based” and whether “any risks associated with the changes [have] been taken adequately into account?”  The effect of the clause in question is to enable the Energy Minister to prescribe new model clauses for oil and gas exploration and production without submitting them to Parliament in the form of regulations made by statutory instrument, as is presently required by Petroleum Act 1998, s. 4(1)(e).  Instead the Minister can simply issue “a document.”  The only justification offered for this change is that it “\nenables sets of model clauses to be introduced more quickly” (Explanatory notes, \npara\n. 126).\n&#xa0;\nNo doubt it is the case that all rule-making activities of government could be accomplished “more quickly” if the rules could be promulgated as simple “documents” without the burdensome procedures associated with legislation and delegated legislation.  A desire to be free of these burdens does not constitute “evidence.”  The effect of providing a quicker procedure in this case will be to eliminate any possibility for Parliament to review, and if thought appropriate annul, any given set of model clauses.  This power has existed since oil and gas deposits in Great Britain were first brought into public ownership in 1934.  \n&#xa0;\nIt might be thought that a power to review what \nare simply “model” clauses\n could not be of very great significance.  The opposite is the case.   The United Kingdom, unlike most other oil-producing nations, does not set out in legislation or in regulations the terms under which oil and gas companies may exercise rights to explore for and exploit onshore and offshore oil and gas.  Many key controls on companies are instead given legal effect by the detailed and extensive clauses of the licences under which they operate.  These licences, legally speaking, are individual contracts between the Minister and each licensee.  The importance of these individual contracts, in terms of the national interest, is recognised by the requirement that they must normally incorporate a comprehensive set of model clauses promulgated by statutory instrument. \n&#xa0;\nThe model clauses cover such crucial matters as \n              \nthe\n nature of the rights granted to the licensee;\n&#xa0;\nthe\n submission and approval of development and production programmes;\n&#xa0;\npowers\n to control the mode of drilling wells and generally to ensure good oilfield practice (including ensuring that operators have adequate finance to remedy pollution);\n&#xa0;\nthe\n exploitation of fields extending across national boundaries, \n&#xa0;\ncontrolling\n the ability of licensees to transfer their licence rights to others, \n&#xa0;\nenabling\n the revocation of licences in case of breach, and providing other remedies, and \n&#xa0;\nproviding\n for dispute settlement procedures.  \n&#xa0;\nAll these provisions are thought important enough, in other jurisdictions as varied as the United States (in respect of the federally-controlled continental shelf), Australia (in respect of offshore waters under Commonwealth jurisdiction) and Indonesia, to be the subject of formal regulation promulgated by delegated legislation (indeed, in Australia, by primary legislation).   In the United Kingdom, democratic oversight of such matters is secured \nonly by the requirement that each licence incorporate the model clauses as prescribed by regulations currently in force except to the extent that the Minister “thinks fit to modify or exclude them in any particular case” (Petroleum Act 1998, s. 4(1)(e)).  This formula is designed to ensure that adjustments are made only on a case-by-case basis having regard to the circumstances of an individual licence.  The model clauses express the rules which will normally apply.  They thus have a quasi-legislative function which is properly recognised by the requirement of promulgation by statutory instrument.\n&#xa0;\nThe proposed removal of this requirement would mean that the exercise of the Minister’s extremely broad discretion to grant licences “on such other\n terms and conditions as [the Minister] thinks fit” would escape Parliamentary scrutiny.  The Minister could, for example, pursue the government’s stated aim, of “streamlining” the regulation of shale gas exploration and production, by prescribing new and less onerous model clauses for onshore petroleum exploration and development licences to replace those presently contained in The Petroleum Licensing Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/352), schedule 6, and such replacement would not be subject to Parliamentary disapproval; indeed, it need not even be brought to Parliament’s notice.   \n&#xa0;\nIt would appear that the Department has for some years found inconvenient the legislative injunction to frame model clauses as regulations.  Between 1998 and 2003, in the 18\nth\n to 21\nst\n seaward licensing rounds, it framed all licences in terms of model clauses which differed in several significant respects – including, in the 21\nst\n round, the removal of any reference to royalties - from those contained in the then applicable regulations under Petroleum Act 1998, s. 4(1).  These clauses were published in the Communications (non-statutory) section of the Official Journal of the European Union, but were not formally published to Parliament.  These changes in model clauses, being applied to all licences granted in the relevant rounds, could not be legally justified under the power to modify the clauses “in any particular case”, and in consequence the legal status of the licence clauses not conforming to the then applicable regulations is open to question.  The position was regularised (though only for future licences) when new regulations were made in 2004 incorporating the changed model clauses.\n&#xa0;\nIn the most recent set of regulations (The Petroleum Licensing (Production) (Seaward Areas) Regulations 2008, SI 2008/225) , incorporating new model clauses for seaward production licences, the Department has found a way of introducing greater simplicity and \nflexibility by transferring certain provisions, relating to the length of different periods within the licence and the amount of acreage that has to be relinquished by the licensee at the end of each such period, from the model clauses themselves to a schedule to the licence so that they can vary from case to case (or from one group of licences to another).   While this practice also limits the information available to Parliament, in that licence period and relinquishment requirements can now be found only in informal communications about the licensing round and in individual licences, it is at least based on regulations which Parliament has had the opportunity of reviewing.    The flexibility introduced by this change should also reduce the need, in future, for the rapid changes in model clauses advanced as the sole basis for this important reduction of Parliamentary powers of scrutiny.
