[normal]Personal statement[bold]My 
[normal]Risk Mana
[normal]gement 
[normal]team at City University London has developed a new method
[normal], the J-value
[normal] framework
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]that is able to estimate
[normal] objectively
[normal] for the first time
[normal] the maximum
[normal] sum it is
[normal] rational
[normal] to
[normal] spend on measures
[normal] and systems
[normal] to protect people and the environment
[normal].  An up-to-date list of J-value papers and publications is given on the website, 
[normal]www.jvalue.co.uk
[normal] .  
[normal]I have carried out risk development and appraisal work for several nuclear industry organisations (BNFL, MoD and 
[normal]EDF) and am currently Principal 
[normal]I
[normal]nvestigator for a 
[normal]research
[normal] contract under the UK-India Civil Nuclear Power Collaboration, 
[normal]with the UK component being funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.  
[normal]W
[normal]e are tasked with applying objective 
[normal]techniques such as the J-value to 
[normal]assess
[normal] the post-accident mitigation
[normal] measures
[normal] desirable following a large nuclear accident such as Chernobyl or Fukushima.  City is being supported by 
[normal]Manchester, 
[normal]Warwick and 
[normal]T
[normal]he Open Universit
[normal]ies
[normal] in the UK, and by the Atom
[normal]ic Energy Commission (AEC) in India.
[normal]  
[normal]I carried out
[normal] a
[normal] recent
[normal],
[normal] preliminary appraisal of level crossing safety in connection with discussions
[normal] 
[normal]and a small contract laid on City University London by
[normal] 
[normal]First Group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]My evidence reviews the problem of lev
[normal]el-crossing safety, and considers how 
[normal]to assess the amount that
[normal] should be spen
[normal]t
[normal] on 
[normal]uprating
[normal] 
[normal]safety 
[normal]against the background of UK and international safety law.  The principles of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are considered, including the difficult question of
[normal] how to value human life.  The current rail industry practice is reviewed, and deficiencies in the approach are pointed out
[normal].  It is shown that a
[normal] CBA using the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] value of a prevented fatality (VPF) will under
[normal]state
[normal] the
[normal] safety
[normal] benefit of a measure to 
[normal]reduce
[normal] 
[normal]level-crossing
[normal] risk
[normal].  The J-value method is 
[normal]recommended
[normal] as a fully objective and better 
[normal]technique
[normal] for assessing level-crossing safety upgrades.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence: A[bold]ssessing methods of improving level crossing safety[bold]The risks associated with level crossings[bold]1.[bold]  Level crossings
[normal] allow pedestrians and road vehicles to cross the track along which passenger and goods trains may run at high speed.  
[normal]P
[normal]ermitting
[normal] 
[normal]trains and road users 
[normal]to use
[normal] the same piece
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]ground 
[normal]creates a hazard for:
[normal]This was illustrated well
[normal] by the collision at the 
[normal]Ufton
[normal] Automatic Half Barrier Level Crossing near Reading, early in the evening of 6 November 2004.  
[normal]A
[normal] London to Plymouth train 
[normal]travelling at just less than 100 mph 
[normal]struck
[normal] a Mazda 323 car that was
[normal] 
[normal]stationary on the crossing.  The car was destroyed and the train suffered a massive derailment.  7 people were killed (car driver, train driver, 5 train passenge
[normal]rs), 18 train passengers were badly injured and 53 train passengers suffered more minor injuries.
[normal]  
[normal](Rail Safety and Standards Board, 2005).
[normal]  Moreover, although only on-site damage and human harm were caused at 
[normal]Ufton
[normal], train crashes
[normal] can
[normal] have the potential to
[normal] cause off-site damage and injury
[normal], as 
[normal]demonstrated
[normal] by Canada's Lac-
[normal]Megantic
[normal] recent
[normal] rail tragedy (BBC, 2013).
[normal]2.[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]However, the existence of a hazard does not o
[normal]f itself mean
[normal] that the hazardous activity should be discontinued.
[normal]  Key additional factors are the
[normal] expected frequency of occurrence and the cost of 
[normal]the 
[normal]countermeasures
[normal] that would be needed
[normal] to reduce th
[normal]at
[normal] frequency to a lower level.
[normal]  In the case of level crossings, the frequency might be reduced by replacing half barriers by full barriers and
[normal] might be
[normal] eliminated more or less entirely by the provision of a bridge and fences.  The question is then to balance the cost of the provision by the reduction in the frequency of the adverse consequences: are the gain in safety and reduc
[normal]ed
[normal] financial loss worth it?
[normal]  Or is the installation safe enough already?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Legal requirements[bold]3.[bold]  
[normal]The Health and Safety At Work Act 1974 sets down, for most work situations,
[normal] how to determine when 
[normal]the current level of safety is satisfactory
[normal].  This Act
[normal] puts duties on employers to safeg
[normal]uard the health, safety and welfare of their workers and to control risks to the health and safety of those not their employ 
[normal]so far as is reasonably practicable
[normal] 
[normal](SFAIRP)
[normal].   The precedent for this requirement was set 
[normal]in the Court of Appeal by Lord Justice A
[normal]squith in the case of 
[normal]Edwards v. National Coal Board
[normal] (All England Reports, 1949).  The judge mandated that risks should always be reduced unless the employer could demonstrate that there was "gross disproportion" between the sacrifice (money, time, trouble
[normal]) of implementation and the benefits, in terms of greater safety or reduced risks, the sacrifice being greater. 
[normal]4.[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]The requirement of "gross disproportion" creates an imbalance in 
[normal]favour
[normal] of safet
[normal]y that
[normal] is not unique to the UK.  In the USA, despite the l
[normal]andmark judgment of
[normal] 
[normal]Judge Learned Hand in
[normal] 
[normal]United States v Carroll Towing Co
[normal]. 
[normal](
[normal]Second Series of the Federal Reports, USA, Court of the Second Circuit, 1947)
[normal],
[normal] in which
[normal] 
[normal]he deemed strict proportionality to be acceptable
[normal] for protection schemes, the concept of d
[normal]isproportion appears to be r
[normal]eflected in other verdicts in US
[normal] courts.  For example, t
[normal]he jury in the civil case
[normal] 
[normal]Grimshaw
[normal] v Ford Motor Company
[normal] rejected the company's c
[normal]ontention
[normal] that the disproportion factor needed to sanction the safety expenditure would be t
[normal]oo great at 2.8, and found against the Ford Motor Company 
[normal](Third Series of Court of Appeal Reports, USA, 1981)
[normal].  
[normal]In the UK, inspectors of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) may insist on a sacrifice, in regard to a safety measures against a high risk, t
[normal]hat is between twice and ten times the benefit in terms of risk averted
[normal].  [T
[normal]hese figures have never been tested in a court but were accepted at the 
[normal]Public I
[normal]nquir
[normal]i
[normal]es held in the 1980s and early 1990s into the PWRs that were built at Sizewell B and 
[normal]contemplated for
[normal] 
[normal]Hinkley
[normal] C (
[normal]O
[normal]ffice of Nuclear Regulation, 2009
[normal])
[normal]]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Cost-[bold]benefit analysis[bold]5.[bold]  While i
[normal]n many cases there is sufficient good practice to determine the necessary safety measures
[normal], it is sometimes
[normal] necessary to carry out a direct comparison of th
[normal]e sacrifice with the risk averted. Such a comparison requires a common measure and in general th
[normal]is
[normal] is money, with the comparison being a form of cost-benefit analysis (CBA).  
[normal]Here one of
[normal] the significant difficulties is putting a value on the direct effects
[normal] on people, 
[normal]viz
[normal]. injury, ill-health and death.  These aspects are rarely thought of in a financial form in general public discourse.  Moreover, although courts may offer compensatory amounts
[normal] 
[normal]to the injured and to the relatives of the dead, this has not bee
[normal]n found to provide a good guide to how much such be spent 
[normal]a priori
[normal] (Thomas and Vaughan, 2013)
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]But finding
[normal] a sound, well-established figure for the values people put on th
[normal]eir life is essential for CBA
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is [bold]l[bold]ife [bold]w[bold]orth?[bold]6.[bold]  Placing a value on a good is
[normal] a simple matter when there is a market in that good –  it is simply the price on which the buyer and the seller agree.  But placing a price on a non-market good such as clean air or the continued survival of a rare plant species is more difficult.  Human 
[normal]life falls into this second category, for which two approaches are possible: revealed preferences and stated preferences.  Revealed preference
[normal] methods
[normal] deduce the worth of the good from people's actions, and are thus fully in sympathy with the precept of the philosopher, John Locke: 
[normal]"I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts".
[normal]  
[normal]Stated preferences
[normal], which
[normal] rely on wh
[normal]at people say rather than what they are observed to do, run the risk of the 
[normal]person
[normal] shading his response to fit what he thinks he should say
[normal] or what it is advantageous for him to say
[normal].  Thus Levitt and 
[normal]Dubner
[normal] (2005) suggest that 
[normal]"The gulf between the inform
[normal]ation we publicly proclaim and the information we know to be true is often vast.  (Or, put a more 
[normal]familiar
[normal] way: we say one thing and do another.)  This can be seen in personal relationships, in commercial transactions, and of course in politics."
[normal]7[bold].[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]UK rail industry
[normal] relies
[normal] 
[normal]for its valuation of life on the "value of a prevented fatality (VPF)" published by the Department for Transport
[normal].  
[normal]There are concerns about the concept of a single-valued VPF, since what we can expect to lose if we are killed is our
[normal] expected life to come, 
[normal]and this
[normal] differs between young and old, between the genders
[normal] and between
[normal] 
[normal]workers and the general public 
[normal](Thomas and Vaughan, 2013).
[normal]  
[normal]However, t
[normal]he gap between
[normal] the VPF and what should be measured can be bridged in some cases (although 
[normal]not all, 
[normal]e.g.
[normal] school bus safety, breast cancer treatment
[normal]s
[normal]) by assuming the VPF to represent an average value across the UK population.
[normal]8.[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]DfT's
[normal] VPF
[normal] is based on a stated preference study 
[normal]published in 1999 (
[normal]Carthy
[normal] 
[normal]et al
[normal]., 1999), following that team's d
[normal]ecision not to recommend the results of their first stated preference study, published a year earlier
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]Beattie et al., 1998), where the authors stated that the form of the question had a great 
[normal]influence
[normal] on the answer
[normal]s given
[normal]:
[normal]"it would appear that the VOSL 
[normal][value of 
[normal]a 
[normal]statistical life, a synonym for VPF]
[normal] can be more or less arbitrarily inflated or deflated simply by manipulating the magnitude of the risk reduction in the CV 
[normal][contingent valuation, a synonym for opinion survey]
[normal] question concerned."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Problems [bold]of opinion[bold] censoring in the [bold]DfT[bold] VPF[bold]9[bold].[bold]  
[normal]P
[normal]roblems
[normal] remain, however,
[normal] with the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] VPF
[normal] based on t
[normal]he
[normal] 1999 paper
[normal].  In contrast to the 1998 paper, the 
[normal]later
[normal] paper
[normal] 
[normal]censor
[normal]ed many
[normal] people's opinions 
[normal]on the way to finding 
[normal]its
[normal] VPF
[normal], choosing to ignore altogether t
[normal]he opi
[normal]nions of about
[normal] 10% of the 167 people
[normal] in the sample
[normal].  But, as a general point, the analyst is entitled to downgrade or discard opinions only if those offering the opinions are unqualified to do so.  Th
[normal]ose legitimately disqualified
[normal] may include the insane, th
[normal]ose without the necessary knowledge or experience and those trying
[normal] deliberately
[normal] to subvert the aims of the study.  The rest of the people in the survey need to be treated on an equal rights basis – the opinion of each person should be accorded the same wor
[normal]th as everyone else
[normal]'s
[normal] in the survey, no more, no less.  For who is to decide which views should be given higher weightings?  Not the analyst, because he does not know what the correct valuation is – he will not know until after he has analysed the results 
[normal]of the survey in order to find out.  Not the other participants, who presumably would each give the highest weightings to their own and similar views, and the lowest weightings to views with which they personally disagreed most.  
[normal]10[bold].[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] chosen mean sho
[normal]uld not impose any structural bias whereby the size of the views 
[normal]results in
[normal] some
[normal] of those
[normal] views 
[normal]being
[normal] favoured over others.
[normal]  
[normal]It is proved in Thomas (2013) that th
[normal]e only way of protecting the analyst from the charge of bias is
[normal] for him
[normal] to use the well known and conventional sample mean: add up the views of all the people in the sample
[normal], without exception,
[normal] and divide the sum by their number.
[normal]1[bold]1[bold].[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]"
[normal]Trimming
[normal]"
[normal] of means is a 
[normal]procedure
[normal] intended to reduce the influence of outliers
[normal] in measureme
[normal]nts
[normal] by rejecting data points in pairs.
[normal]  It is not a valid procedure for applying to human opinions because of its violation of the concept of structural view independence  – the equal rights philosophy outline
[normal]d
[normal] above
[normal] (Thomas, 2013)
[normal].  
[normal]Trimming is, h
[normal]owever, 
[normal]sometimes used as a rule of thumb 
[normal]in
[normal] application
[normal]s involving repeated but
[normal] unreliable physical measurements, where the
[normal] idea is that some degree of compensation for the censoring of an outlier is achieved by rejecting a data point at the other end of the spec
[normal]trum.  Thus the term, "
[normal]trimmed mean"
[normal],
[normal] denote
[normal]s
[normal] the arithmetic average of a sample
[normal] subject
[normal]ed
[normal] to 
[normal] a 
[normal]double-sided reduction
[normal] in size
[normal]:
[normal] the same number of measurements
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] taken
[normal] from the bottom end of the range as from the top end (Rice, 2007).
[normal]  
[normal]While t
[normal]he authors 
[normal]of the 
[normal]1999 paper descr
[normal]ibe
[normal] their final VPF as a "trimmed mean"
[normal], in fact they use
[normal] single-sided censoring, rejecting the top 10% of the sample 
[normal]without 
[normal]attempting to make
[normal] a
[normal] compensating rejection of the bottom 10%.
[normal]  On this basis, and on its own terms, the 
[normal]Df
[normal]T
[normal] VPF can be expected 
[normal]to have an inherent bias
[normal] towards
[normal] putting too low a value on
[normal] human life.
[normal]  
[normal]12.[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]In the past the UK rail industry used to apply a factor of 2.8 to the VPF used i
[normal]n
[normal] CBA analys
[normal]e
[normal]s that could involve multiple fatalities
[normal] such as a level-crossing accident
[normal], thus including an allowance for gross disproportion
[normal].  
[normal]However the rail industry
[normal] dropped that multiplier
[normal] a few years ago
[normal], and
[normal] now
[normal] uses the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] VPF without 
[normal]uprating
[normal].  
[normal]But
[normal] any CBA applied to level crossing
[normal]s
[normal] using the
[normal] unmodi
[normal]fied
[normal] 
[normal]DfT
[normal] VPF can be expected to underestimate the value of a safety measure 
[normal]as opposed to
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Applying the J-value framework to level crossing safety and loss[bold]1[bold]3[bold].[bold]  
[normal]The J-value provides an objective assessment tool which can be applied across all ind
[normal]ustries.  It is a new approach, but it is based on established economic theory. 
[normal]The J-value has the considerable advantage when compared with other 
[normal]methods
[normal], such as conventional CBA, that no explicit assumptions have to be made about the difficult issue o
[normal]f the monetary value to be attached to saving a human life.  Also, unlike other approaches, the J-value allows immediate fatalities and potential loss of life in the longer term (
[normal]such as
[normal] when the hazard includes exposure to a carcinogen that might be carri
[normal]ed on a goods train), to be measured on the same scale.  Ways to reduce risks can then have their cost effectiveness assessed fairly.
[normal]14.[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]The J-value balances safety spend against the extension of life expectancy it brings about.  At the core of J-value 
[normal]is the concept of the life-quality index
[normal] (
[normal]Nathwani
[normal] et al., 2009)
[normal], placing a monetary value on all future years of life based on discounted income, the share of wages in the economy and the work-life balance (ratio of time spent working to time not working)
[normal].  The J-value is found by dividing the actual cost of the safety measure by the maximum that it is reasonable to spend.  A value of less than one indicates that the spend is justified.  A value greater than one suggests that spending resources may not be 
[normal]justified.  The objective decision is then simple.  If the J-value is much more than one, the starting point for any decision is that the resources should not be committed to reducing this risk.  If it is less than one, there is a strong case to be made fo
[normal]r spending money.
[normal]15.[bold]  
[normal]              
[normal]The J-value approach has been extended so that it can take account of not only health and safety risks but environmental consequences also.  Thus, for example, the J-value 
[normal]framework 
[normal]can assess how much resource might be committed 
[normal]cost-effectively to reducing the risk of level crossing accidents involving off-site damage (as in the case of the Lac-
[normal]Megantic
[normal] rail crash), both in terms of impact on human health and the environmental losses that might be associated with such events.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Im[bold]proved Life Expectancy versus Prevented Fatality[bold]16.[bold]  As noted above, improved life expectancy is a much better characterisation of the benefits to be gained from a safety system than 
[normal]"lives saved"
[normal].  In fact, nobody's life can ever be saved: the best that 
[normal]can be done is to return an individual's life expectancy back to what it was in the absence of the spec
[normal]ific hazard being considered.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Objectivity of [bold]J-value [bold]Input Parameters[bold]17.[bold]  Input parameters to the J-value are all measurable economic and actuarial p
[normal]arameters: GDP per head, share of wages in GDP, work-life balance, the characteristics of the exposed population, such as initial life-expectancy, the probability of the risk occurring without the proposed safety measure, the cost of the safety measure and
[normal] the residual probability of occurrence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Making the Best Overall Use of Resources  [bold]18.[bold] 
[normal] 
[normal]One important feature of the J-value is that it allows a level playing field to be defined across all industries.  By using the extension in life expectancy as a meas
[normal]ure, the J-Value can 
[normal]put level-crossing safety on the same footing
[normal] as medical treatments, fire safety, transport safety
[normal] generally
[normal], nuclear safety, or the safety of chemical plant.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Factoring Wider Considerations into the Decision[bold]19.[bold]  I
[normal]t is
[normal], of course,
[normal] a
[normal]ccepted that both industry and Government may wish to take account of other factors when making decisions about how best to use resources to reduce risk
[normal] on level crossings
[normal].  These might include socio-political issues and corporate considerations, such as t
[normal]he avoidance of negative and damaging public perception.  However, the J-value allows a clear baseline to be defined.  Then if other considerations have an influence on the final decision, these can be viewed in an open and transparent way against the back
[normal]drop of an objective assessment of how best to use scarce resources.
