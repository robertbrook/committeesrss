defaultSummarydefaultMy evidence reviews the problem of lev
defaultel-crossing safety, and considers how 
defaultto assess the amount that
default should be spen
defaultt
default on 
defaultuprating
default 
defaultsafety 
defaultagainst the background of UK and international safety law.  The principles of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are considered, including the difficult question of
default how to value human life.  The current rail industry practice is reviewed, and deficiencies in the approach are pointed out
default.  It is shown that a
default CBA using the 
defaultDfT
default value of a prevented fatality (VPF) will under
defaultstate
default the
default safety
default benefit of a measure to 
defaultreduce

default.  The J-value method is 
defaultrecommended
default as a fully objective and better 
defaulttechnique
default for assessing level-crossing safety upgrades.

defaultThis was illustrated well
default by the collision at the 
defaultUfton
default Automatic Half Barrier Level Crossing near Reading, early in the evening of 6 November 2004.  
defaultA
default London to Plymouth train 
defaulttravelling at just less than 100 mph 
defaultstruck
default a Mazda 323 car that was
default 
defaultstationary on the crossing.  The car was destroyed and the train suffered a massive derailment.  7 people were killed (car driver, train driver, 5 train passenge
defaultrs), 18 train passengers were badly injured and 53 train passengers suffered more minor injuries.
default  
default(Rail Safety and Standards Board, 2005).
default  Moreover, although only on-site damage and human harm were caused at 
defaultUfton
default, train crashes
default can
default have the potential to
default cause off-site damage and injury
default, as 
defaultdemonstrated
default by Canada's Lac-
defaultMegantic
default recent
default rail tragedy (BBC, 2013).
default2.default  
default              
defaultHowever, the existence of a hazard does not o
defaultf itself mean
default that the hazardous activity should be discontinued.
default  Key additional factors are the
default expected frequency of occurrence and the cost of 
defaultthe 
defaultcountermeasures
default that would be needed
default to reduce th
defaultat
default frequency to a lower level.
default  In the case of level crossings, the frequency might be reduced by replacing half barriers by full barriers and
default might be
default eliminated more or less entirely by the provision of a bridge and fences.  The question is then to balance the cost of the provision by the reduction in the frequency of the adverse consequences: are the gain in safety and reduc
defaulted
default financial loss worth it?
default  Or is the installation safe enough already?
default&#xa0;
defaultLegal requirementsdefault3.default  
defaultThe Health and Safety At Work Act 1974 sets down, for most work situations,
default how to determine when 
defaultthe current level of safety is satisfactory
default.  This Act
default puts duties on employers to safeg
defaultuard the health, safety and welfare of their workers and to control risks to the health and safety of those not their employ 
defaultso far as is reasonably practicable
default 
default(SFAIRP)
default.   The precedent for this requirement was set 
defaultin the Court of Appeal by Lord Justice A
defaultsquith in the case of 
defaultEdwards v. National Coal Board
default (All England Reports, 1949).  The judge mandated that risks should always be reduced unless the employer could demonstrate that there was "gross disproportion" between the sacrifice (money, time, trouble
default) of implementation and the benefits, in terms of greater safety or reduced risks, the sacrifice being greater. 
default4.default  
default              
defaultThe requirement of "gross disproportion" creates an imbalance in 
defaultfavour
default of safet
defaulty that
default is not unique to the UK.  In the USA, despite the l
defaultandmark judgment of
default 
defaultJudge Learned Hand in
default 
defaultUnited States v Carroll Towing Co
default. 
default(
defaultSecond Series of the Federal Reports, USA, Court of the Second Circuit, 1947)
default,
default in which
default 
defaulthe deemed strict proportionality to be acceptable
default for protection schemes, the concept of d
defaultisproportion appears to be r
defaulteflected in other verdicts in US
default courts.  For example, t
defaulthe jury in the civil case
default 
defaultGrimshaw
default v Ford Motor Company
default rejected the company's c
defaultontention
default that the disproportion factor needed to sanction the safety expenditure would be t
defaultoo great at 2.8, and found against the Ford Motor Company 
default(Third Series of Court of Appeal Reports, USA, 1981)
default.  
defaultIn the UK, inspectors of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) may insist on a sacrifice, in regard to a safety measures against a high risk, t
defaulthat is between twice and ten times the benefit in terms of risk averted
default.  [T
defaulthese figures have never been tested in a court but were accepted at the 
defaultPublic I
defaultnquir
defaulti
defaultes held in the 1980s and early 1990s into the PWRs that were built at Sizewell B and 
defaultcontemplated for
default 
defaultHinkley
default C (
defaultO
defaultffice of Nuclear Regulation, 2009
default)
default]
default.
default&#xa0;defaultCost-defaultbenefit analysisdefault5.default  While i
defaultn many cases there is sufficient good practice to determine the necessary safety measures
default, it is sometimes
default necessary to carry out a direct comparison of th
defaulte sacrifice with the risk averted. Such a comparison requires a common measure and in general th
defaultis
default is money, with the comparison being a form of cost-benefit analysis (CBA).  
defaultHere one of
default the significant difficulties is putting a value on the direct effects
default on people, 
defaultviz
default. injury, ill-health and death.  These aspects are rarely thought of in a financial form in general public discourse.  Moreover, although courts may offer compensatory amounts
default 
defaultto the injured and to the relatives of the dead, this has not bee
defaultn found to provide a good guide to how much such be spent 
defaulta priori
default (Thomas and Vaughan, 2013)
default.
default  
defaultBut finding
default a sound, well-established figure for the values people put on th
defaulteir life is essential for CBA
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is defaultldefaultife defaultwdefaultorth?default6.default  Placing a value on a good is
default a simple matter when there is a market in that good –  it is simply the price on which the buyer and the seller agree.  But placing a price on a non-market good such as clean air or the continued survival of a rare plant species is more difficult.  Human 
defaultlife falls into this second category, for which two approaches are possible: revealed preferences and stated preferences.  Revealed preference
default methods
default deduce the worth of the good from people's actions, and are thus fully in sympathy with the precept of the philosopher, John Locke: 
default"I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts".
default  
defaultStated preferences
default, which
default rely on wh
defaultat people say rather than what they are observed to do, run the risk of the 
defaultperson
default shading his response to fit what he thinks he should say
default or what it is advantageous for him to say
default.  Thus Levitt and 
defaultDubner
default (2005) suggest that 
default"The gulf between the inform
defaultation we publicly proclaim and the information we know to be true is often vast.  (Or, put a more 
defaultfamiliar
default way: we say one thing and do another.)  This can be seen in personal relationships, in commercial transactions, and of course in politics."
default7default.default  
default              
defaultThe 
defaultUK rail industry
default relies
default 
defaultfor its valuation of life on the "value of a prevented fatality (VPF)" published by the Department for Transport
default.  
defaultThere are concerns about the concept of a single-valued VPF, since what we can expect to lose if we are killed is our
default expected life to come, 
defaultand this
default differs between young and old, between the genders
default and between
default 
defaultworkers and the general public 
default(Thomas and Vaughan, 2013).
default  
defaultHowever, t
defaulthe gap between
default the VPF and what should be measured can be bridged in some cases (although 
defaultnot all, 
defaulte.g.
default school bus safety, breast cancer treatment
defaults
default) by assuming the VPF to represent an average value across the UK population.
default8.default  
default              
defaultThe 
defaultDfT's
default VPF
default is based on a stated preference study 
defaultpublished in 1999 (
defaultCarthy
default 
defaultet al
default., 1999), following that team's d
defaultecision not to recommend the results of their first stated preference study, published a year earlier
default 
default(
defaultBeattie et al., 1998), where the authors stated that the form of the question had a great 
defaultinfluence
default on the answer
defaults given
default:
default"it would appear that the VOSL 
default[value of 
defaulta 
defaultstatistical life, a synonym for VPF]
default can be more or less arbitrarily inflated or deflated simply by manipulating the magnitude of the risk reduction in the CV 
default[contingent valuation, a synonym for opinion survey]
default question concerned."

default in the sample
default.  But, as a general point, the analyst is entitled to downgrade or discard opinions only if those offering the opinions are unqualified to do so.  Th
defaultose legitimately disqualified
default may include the insane, th
defaultose without the necessary knowledge or experience and those trying
default deliberately
default to subvert the aims of the study.  The rest of the people in the survey need to be treated on an equal rights basis – the opinion of each person should be accorded the same wor
defaultth as everyone else
default's
default in the survey, no more, no less.  For who is to decide which views should be given higher weightings?  Not the analyst, because he does not know what the correct valuation is – he will not know until after he has analysed the results 
defaultof the survey in order to find out.  Not the other participants, who presumably would each give the highest weightings to their own and similar views, and the lowest weightings to views with which they personally disagreed most.

default intended to reduce the influence of outliers

default by rejecting data points in pairs.
default  It is not a valid procedure for applying to human opinions because of its violation of the concept of structural view independence  – the equal rights philosophy outline
defaultd
default above
default (Thomas, 2013)
default.  
defaultTrimming is, h
defaultowever, 
defaultsometimes used as a rule of thumb 
defaultin
default application
defaults involving repeated but
default unreliable physical measurements, where the
default idea is that some degree of compensation for the censoring of an outlier is achieved by rejecting a data point at the other end of the spec
defaulttrum.  Thus the term, "
defaulttrimmed mean"
default,
default denote
defaults
default the arithmetic average of a sample

default to 
default a 
defaultdouble-sided reduction
default in size
default:

default 
defaultis

default from the bottom end of the range as from the top end (Rice, 2007).
default  
defaultWhile t
defaulthe authors 
defaultof the 
default1999 paper descr
defaultibe
default their final VPF as a "trimmed mean"
default, in fact they use
default single-sided censoring, rejecting the top 10% of the sample 
defaultwithout 
defaultattempting to make
default a
default compensating rejection of the bottom 10%.
default  On this basis, and on its own terms, the 
defaultDf
defaultT
default VPF can be expected 
defaultto have an inherent bias
default towards
default putting too low a value on
default human life.
default  
default12.default  
default              
defaultIn the past the UK rail industry used to apply a factor of 2.8 to the VPF used i
defaultn
default CBA analys
defaulte
defaults that could involve multiple fatalities
default such as a level-crossing accident
default, thus including an allowance for gross disproportion
default.  
defaultHowever the rail industry
default dropped that multiplier
default a few years ago
default, and
default now
default uses the 
defaultDfT
default VPF without 
defaultuprating
default.  
defaultBut
default any CBA applied to level crossing
defaults
default using the
default unmodi
defaultfied
default 
defaultDfT
default VPF can be expected to underestimate the value of a safety measure 
defaultas opposed to
default 
defaultits
default cost.
default&#xa0;
defaultApplying the J-value framework to level crossing safety and lossdefault1default3default.default  
defaultThe J-value provides an objective assessment tool which can be applied across all ind
defaultustries.  It is a new approach, but it is based on established economic theory. 
defaultThe J-value has the considerable advantage when compared with other 
defaultmethods
default, such as conventional CBA, that no explicit assumptions have to be made about the difficult issue o
defaultf the monetary value to be attached to saving a human life.  Also, unlike other approaches, the J-value allows immediate fatalities and potential loss of life in the longer term (
defaultsuch as
default when the hazard includes exposure to a carcinogen that might be carri
defaulted on a goods train), to be measured on the same scale.  Ways to reduce risks can then have their cost effectiveness assessed fairly.
default14.default  
default              
defaultThe J-value balances safety spend against the extension of life expectancy it brings about.  At the core of J-value 
defaultis the concept of the life-quality index
default (
defaultNathwani
default et al., 2009)
default, placing a monetary value on all future years of life based on discounted income, the share of wages in the economy and the work-life balance (ratio of time spent working to time not working)
default.  The J-value is found by dividing the actual cost of the safety measure by the maximum that it is reasonable to spend.  A value of less than one indicates that the spend is justified.  A value greater than one suggests that spending resources may not be 
defaultjustified.  The objective decision is then simple.  If the J-value is much more than one, the starting point for any decision is that the resources should not be committed to reducing this risk.  If it is less than one, there is a strong case to be made fo
defaultr spending money.
default15.default  
default              
defaultThe J-value approach has been extended so that it can take account of not only health and safety risks but environmental consequences also.  Thus, for example, the J-value 
defaultframework 
defaultcan assess how much resource might be committed 
defaultcost-effectively to reducing the risk of level crossing accidents involving off-site damage (as in the case of the Lac-
defaultMegantic
default rail crash), both in terms of impact on human health and the environmental losses that might be associated with such events.
default&#xa0;
defaultImdefaultproved Life Expectancy versus Prevented Fatalitydefault16.default  As noted above, improved life expectancy is a much better characterisation of the benefits to be gained from a safety system than 
default"lives saved"
default.  In fact, nobody's life can ever be saved: the best that 
defaultcan be done is to return an individual's life expectancy back to what it was in the absence of the spec
defaultific hazard being considered.  
default&#xa0;
defaultObjectivity of defaultJ-value defaultInput Parametersdefault17.default  Input parameters to the J-value are all measurable economic and actuarial p
defaultarameters: GDP per head, share of wages in GDP, work-life balance, the characteristics of the exposed population, such as initial life-expectancy, the probability of the risk occurring without the proposed safety measure, the cost of the safety measure and
default the residual probability of occurrence.
default&#xa0;
defaultMaking the Best Overall Use of Resources  default18.default 
default 
defaultOne important feature of the J-value is that it allows a level playing field to be defined across all industries.  By using the extension in life expectancy as a meas
defaulture, the J-Value can 
defaultput level-crossing safety on the same footing
default as medical treatments, fire safety, transport safety
default generally
default, nuclear safety, or the safety of chemical plant.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFactoring Wider Considerations into the Decisiondefault19.default  I
defaultt is
default, of course,
default a
defaultccepted that both industry and Government may wish to take account of other factors when making decisions about how best to use resources to reduce risk
default on level crossings
default.  These might include socio-political issues and corporate considerations, such as t
defaulthe avoidance of negative and damaging public perception.  However, the J-value allows a clear baseline to be defined.  Then if other considerations have an influence on the final decision, these can be viewed in an open and transparent way against the back
defaultdrop of an objective assessment of how best to use scarce resources.
