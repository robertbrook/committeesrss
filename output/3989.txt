[[[ ]]]I am an independent, self-funded climate science researcher. In recent years I have specialised in the key area of climate sensitivity. My work has been published in the peer reviewed literature and is cited and discussed in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). I was an expert reviewer of AR5.are unreliable and/or unable to provide usefully well-constrained estimates. I agree with this conclusion. That leaves in essence only estimates based on observations of warming over multi-decadal periods. Useful surface temperature records extend back approximately 150 years (the ‘instrumental period’). However, global warming ‘in the pipeline’ is predominantly reflected in ocean heat uptake, calculated from changes in sub-surface temperatures, records of which extend back only 50 years.This last approach represents poor design. It is impossible to estimate aerosol forcing – which largely affects the northern hemisphere –with any accuracy without separate temperature data for, at a minimum, the northern and southern hemispheres. are eliminated from the assessment, the average ECS for those that remain is, at 1.8°C, considerably lower than the GCM average of 3.2°C, but close to the energy-budget best estimate of 1.7°C that was outlined in the last paragraph. is unscientific.December 2013&#xa0; Observationally-based methods involve some limited use of models. In the form of a weight given to each possible value for it. The posterior takes the form of a probability distribution for the property of interest rather than a point estimate. Such a prior is not a representation of an understanding of the likely value of what is being estimated, but is simply a prior calculated to give an objective answer. Incorrectly in two cases. When, as is very much the case for ECS, the parameter involved does not have a straight line relationship with the observational data from which it is being estimated, a uniform prior generally prevents the estimate fairly reflecting the data. http://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2013/1/25/uniform-priors-and-the-ipcc.html Using a mathematical, noninformative, prior. The top of the 5-95% range for the study’s ECS estimate as given in Table 9.3 of AR4-WG1. WG1 report, Figure 10.20.b). Forster and Gregory 2006 used standard non-Bayesian statistics, which are intrinsically objective and (as often the case) gave the same results as using an objective Bayesian method.A critical analysis that I wrote of Instrumental and Combination ECS estimates shown in Figure 10.20.b) of AR5-WG1 is available at: http://niclewis.wordpress.com/ipcc-ar5-climate-sensitivity-and-other-issues/ar5_ecs_estimates/. Likewise an analysis of TCR estimates shown in Figure 10.20.a) of AR5-WG1 is available at http://niclewis.wordpress.com/ipcc-ar5-climate-sensitivity-and-other-issues/ar5_tcr_estimates/ 17–83% probability In other words, the average of the GCM estimates and their range (which was interpreted conservatively). In principle, studies that used observational data to form their own estimate of the aerosol effect would be unaffected by a revision in the consensus estimate of it. However, in practice all such climate sensitivity studies featured in AR4 were badly flawed in other ways.  The method involves comparing changes in the average levels of three key variables between two multi-year periods, normally one early in the instrumental period and one at the end of it. Based on (a) the AR5 best estimates of the combined warming/cooling strength (forcing) of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other agents over the instrumental period, and of ocean heat uptake; (b) using the longest principal global surface temperature dataset; and (c) measuring changes between multi-year periods early in and at the end of the instrumental period with similar volcanic activity. . References herein to best estimates are to medians (50% probability points) unless otherwise stated. Aldrin et al. (2012) (the estimate of which was, exceptionally, not significantly affected by the subjective Bayesian method used); Ring et al. (2012) (average of four estimates); Otto et al. (2013) (averaging the 2000-2009 and 1970-2009 period estimates); and Lewis (2013) (preferred main results estimate).  Taking median estimates from Schwartz (2012), Gillett et al. (2013) and (averaging the 2000-2009 and 1970-2009 period estimates) Otto et al. (2013). Aldrin et al. (2012) and Lewis (2013) did not provide ranges for TCR, but their ECS estimates imply TCR best estimates below 1.4°C.  2016–2035 relative to 1986-2005 Tol, R. 2009.
