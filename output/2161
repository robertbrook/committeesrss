[normal]As a Derbyshire County Councillor from 2009 – 2013, and indeed as a District Councillor for Derbyshire Dales District Council I have had experience of dealing with matters pertaining to the abuse of Green Lanes by 4x4 and motor cycle vehicles, both in the Derbyshire Dales and the Peak District.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I also felt the frustration of the cumbersome ROW Acts and Regulations which give particular problems to Authorities such as the Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA) and its Constituent Councils in dealing with the extremely well organised lobby of the 4x4 and motor bike fraternity, who, in the past of successfully won Judicial Reviews against the Yorkshire Dales Park Authority, who, like PDNPA, have simply been trying to protect the beauty and tranquillity of the National Parks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is strong evidence of the damage done to such areas by the erosion of Green Lanes, SSSI’s, Archaeology, Endangered Species etc, by the use of 4x4 vehicle and motor cycles. Additionally, there have been frightening moments when vehicle and pedestrian and/or horse clash with each other, and serious injury and at least one known fatality has occurred.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Highway Authorities will only deal with the application for and the rolling out of BOAT Orders. It has been left to the PDNPA, of which I was Chairman and Vice Chairman successively of the Audit, Resource and Performance Committee, charged with trying to deal with this problematic issue, and its only recourse was to examine all of its

[normal] routes and consider the evidence for a Traffic Regulation Order.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, in essence, one might argue that this clashes with the statutory purpose of a National Park, the enjoyment and freedom of access to the Park.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A balance has to be drawn though and we simply cannot allow the continuance of damage and erosion of the features as detailed above, and especially where road safety is concerned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe the proposal for De-regulation will make matters simpler for Authorities such as the PDNPA and other National Parks, especially when, it seems, that Highway Authorities are failing to implement any TRO and thereby protect the precious Green Lanes of this Country and its heritage.
