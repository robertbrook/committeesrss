default&#xa0;defaultISSUES AND RESPONSESdefault&#xa0;

defaultAdefaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police areadefault&#xa0;

defaultBdefaultThe role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to accountdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI developed my first four-year Police and Crime Plan in consultation with the Chief Constable to ensure it was informed by the Force’s strategic assessment of risks, threats and opportunities, and consistent with the Force’s operational service delivery plan in terms of shared policing priorities, strategic objectives and target outcomes.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving established common priorities and objectives, I then negotiated agreed performance measures and, where appropriate, performance targets that would enable 
defaultregular and 
defaulttimely indications as to whether 
defaultthe policing policies, objectives and initiatives incorporated in 
defaultmy Plan 
defaultare being successfully delivered by the Chief Constable and the Force under her direction and control.
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2013/14 annual policing budget and medium-term financial plan covering the period 2013-2017
default 
defaultwas developed by the Chief Constable and presented to me for consideration and approval.  This process gave me the necessary assurance that

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving set my budget for 2013/14 and published the Police and Crime Plan at the end of March 2013, I have agreed a corporate framework for holding the Chief Constable to account for the delivery of the policing priorities and objectives contained in the Plan.  This involves:  
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith the Chief Constable I have set up a Joint Independent Audit Committee which is charged with reviewing and testing the adequacy and effectiveness of the corporate governance framework and internal management control environment.  This committee reports to both me and the Chief Constable and is due to present 
defaultto us 
defaultits first ‘Annual Assurance Report’ 
defaultlater this month (17
defaultth
default December).
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI have regular liaison meetings with HMIC to obtain an independent opinion on the performance of the Force.  HMIC inspection reports and Value for Money (VFM) Profiles contribute to my evidence base and inform my assessment of the performance of the Chief Constable and the Force.
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI also take into account reports from the external auditor (Ernst and Young) that help inform my views on the quality of financial management arrangements and probity exercised by the Chief Constable and the Force.
defaulth)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn area that needs further development is the formal ‘Performance Development Review’ (PDR) process applicable to the Chief Constable to reflect the new governance arrangements following the introduction of 
defaultPCCs
default and the establishment of PCCs and chief constables as separate legal entities with specific respective roles and responsibilities.  This is a national issue that has been identified by the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC).

defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Panel received my draft Police and Crime Plan and subjected it to intensive, but fair, challenge as to the evidence base underpinning my policing and crime priorities and objectives.  
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Panel established a ‘Task and Finish’ group to scrutinise my budget plans 
defaultin detail in order to inform its views and recommendations concerning my council tax precept proposal for 2013/14. This process also facilitated the Panel to form a view as to whether the proposed annual budget and medium term financial plan had allocated resources appropriately in accordance with priorities and objectives set out in my police and Crime Plan.

defaultTh
defaultese
default process
defaultes
default helped ensure that I and the Panel had 
defaultshared 
defaultconfidence that the Plan had correctly identified and was properly addressing the ‘right’ priorities of the communities and stakeholders across the Thames Valley
default, and that the associated objectives could be delivered within the reduced level of resources available
default. 
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Panel’s work programme and business procedures ensure it is reviewing my performance in delivering the strategic objectives set out in my Police and Crime Plan in a methodical and mutually supportive manner.
default  This process has introduced an independent performance monitoring regime that is effectively acting as an ‘early-warning’
default system to inform me
default,
default as much as the Panel
default,
default as to whether my objectives are being successfully achieved according to plan.
