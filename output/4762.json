IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy…”. \n&#xa0;\nThese statements make it clear that the IPCC is not an academic scientific organization and that it has clear governmental – hence political – input.  Furthermore its aim is not to investigate the reasons for changes in the climate, but to seek out “human induced climate change” – which presupposes there is such climate change.&#xa0;At the end of September the IPCC published versions of \nthe Working Group 1 (WG1) \nreport “\nThe Physical Science Basis\n” and the related “\nSummary \nfor \nPolicy Makers\n”\n (SPM)\n; the former was prepared by scientists, the latter by a mix of scientists and representatives of governments\n.  The comments here are more often \nmade about the SPM, which is the more widely read document.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe character of the submissions\n&#xa0;\nThere are \n4\n5\n submissions\n of which two did not appear relevant to the matter at hand\n and two were from organisations that had an obvious commercial interest in promoting anthropogenic climate change (ACC)\n.\n  \nOf the remaining \n41\n submissions:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nssessment of \nA\nssessment\n&#xa0;\nThe British warmist establishment accepted with few caveats the views expressed by \nthe IPCC, singing from the same hymn sheet:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAll \nthe \nsubmissions avoided discussion of, or attempted to finesse the unreliability of models\n \nand consequently none addressed the question of the magnitude of natural variability; all danced around the issue of whether AR5 has sufficiently \nexplained the hiatus in the global surface temperature; none addressed the empirical mea\nsurement of climate sensitivity.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn adopting their approach that “all was for the best of all possible worlds”\n re the IPCC’s work\n, the warmists ignored 1) the IPCC’s \npast promotion of pseudo science such as the “hockey stick” and “Himalayagate”; 2) its past baseless claims of increased hurricanes and the spread of malaria due to ACC; 3) the exposure in Climategate of the unethical practices of a coterie of climate scie\nntists involved with the IPCC; 4) its association with the inconvenient inaccuracies promoted by Senator Al Gore; and 5) the various shortcomings of both science and process discussed \nin this submission.  \nFrom the sceptic’s perspective they live in a Briti\nsh bubble of consensus about settled science that is not disturbed by the reality outside the bubble!\n&#xa0;\nThe \nsceptic\n scientists included some leading North American \nclimate \nscientists and a physicist of international stature\n, who provides \nthe advantage of an\n independent p\ner\nspective from the debates that vex climate scientists.\n \nThe main scientific criticisms of AR5 are:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe public policy analysts (and some of the \nsceptic\n scientists) \nargue \nthat the IPCC process is not all that it is cracked up to be, notably:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n.\n              \nTH\nE BRITISH WARMIST \nESTABLISHMENT\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nDECC\n&#xa0;\nDECC\n stated “\nthat the conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis report are robust.\n&#xa0;\n The report was produced by over 850 independent expert scientists, all leaders in their fields\n (209 Lead Authors, 50 Review Editors and Over 600 Contributing Authors\n).\n&#xa0;\n The report took over 2 years to produce and underwent multiple rounds of expert review.\n&#xa0;\n It was also reviewed by the 194 governments which form the IPCC.\n&#xa0;\n They have all accepted th\ne findings.”\n  \n&#xa0;\nDECC c\nlaimed “\nThe IPCC is a highly effective\n&#xa0;\nmechanism for assessing scientific knowledge.

The IPCC’s dismissal\n \nof the stagnation as being associated with unpredictable climate \nvariability raises the question as\n \nto what extent the warming between 1975 and 2000 can also be explained by unpredictable\n \nclimate variability.\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nThe climate community has worked for\n \nmore than 20 years to establish a scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.

Various\n \nmechanisms have been \nproposed that could amplify relatively small variations in total solar\n \nirradiance, such as changes in stratospheric and tropospheric circulation induced by changes\n \nin the spectral solar irradiance or an effect of the flux of cosmic rays on clouds\n…\nThe IPCC\n \nignored\n many [the paper claims 123]\n \npeer-reviewed articles published 2008 – 2012 tha\nt show the sun is a main driver of climate change.”  The submission cites three studies which show strong correlation between aspects of climate and \nchanges in the solar ma\ngnetic field\n…\nThe solar\n \nmagnetic field has doubled from 1900 to 1991 causing warming. The maximum temperature\n \nresponse is delayed about 10 years to 2001 due to the large heat capacity of the oceans.

He comments:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nThe IPCC expect us to accept that with hundreds of climate models which\n \ndo not match observations and measurements, they are 95% confi\ndent that\n \nwarming since 1951 is human caused\n. The global average surface record\n \nonly shows warming in concert with increased CO2 between 1978 -1997.\n  \nThat is only 19 of the past 63 years amounting to only 30%. There is\n \ntherefore a 70% chance that CO2 and \natmospheric warming are not\n \ncorrelated and the claim that warming is human caused can not be\n \nsupported\n…I\nn order to characterize modern warming as unprecedented the IPCC\n \nsimply evade the eight Holocene warming and cooling cycles \n[i.e. over the last 15,000 y\nears] \nof which our\n \nmodern warming is the last and coolest. Evidence is incontrovertible that\n \nthe Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period had world wide\n \neffect and were at least 1degree C warmer\n. \nIPPC simply ignore the evidence from \nthe early history\n of the earth…\n \nThe focus by the IPCC on only the last 50 years of \nc\nlimate variability is like\n \ntrying to describe a large richly furnished d\nrawing room through the keyhole.”\n&#xa0;\nIPCC in an effort to preserve credibility have simply written off the Sun\n,\n the\n \nmajor source of our planetary energy\n.\n Because solar output is relatively\n constant\n, IPCC have chosen to ignore a large body of evidence linking\n \nsolar variability with climate which has the support of abundant peer\n \nreviewed measurement observation and experi\nment to corroborate the\n \ns\nun, together with\n c\nosmic influences, are the main driver of climate\n…\nThe worst aspect of the IPCC report is their total disregard of the solar\n \ninfluence on climate. In the very period where they are 95% confident of human\n \ninfluence \nwe have \nthe most active solar cycles of the 20th Century showing solar maxima 30 to 40% greater than the 19th Century or the first half of the 20th\n. From \n1950 there are six cycles numbered \n19 \nto \n24\n. The daily sun spot maximum at cycle \n19 \nwas \n200 \ndropping to \n110 \nin cycle \n20\n. Cycle \n21 \nshowed an increase to \n163 \nthen there is gradual decrease through cycles \n22 \nand \n23 \nfrom \n155 \nto \n115 \nand finally cycle \n24 \nis at a low of \n65\n. This pattern of solar variability has a 95% correlation with global average temp\nerature and so there is no need to search for missing heat.”\n&#xa0;\n“The IPCC is a deeply flawed process not scientific but political…\nScientific\n \nobjectivity and integrity have been sacrificed to achieve political goals almost at\n \nany cost, including blocking publ\nication, lobbying editors, interfering with peer\n \nreview and selective use of data. Lead authors are not obligated to address\n \ncritical comment and for the most part critical reviews are ignored.\n  \nThe AR5 report has provided no evidence on which policy decis\nions can be\n \nbased\n…\nWhat we should do about CO2 is wisely nothing.”\n&#xa0;\nMadhav Khanderkar w\nas\n a research scientist for the National Research Council of Canada and then for Environment Canada.  He \ncomments “\nThe latest release of the IPCC AR5 SPM leaves \na \nlot to \nbe desired! The SPM claims\n \nlinkage between warming of the earth’s climate of the last fifty years with increasing\n \nconcentrations of human-CO2, but provides NO substantive evidence to support this\n \nclaim! Further the SPM has failed to explain the hiatus in t\nhe warming for the last 16\n \nyears! Finally the SPM has totally ignored the reality of earth’s climate, which is that\n \n“The earth’s climate now appears to be entering into a colder epoch!” With the\n \napproaching of the solar grand minima in the next decade or a\nbout, there is now a distinct\n \npossibility that the \nearth’s climate could see an onset of an \nIce Age type climate \nin \nthe\n \nnext two to three decades!\n”\n&#xa0;\nNicholas Lewis is an independent self-funded \nAmerican \nclimate researcher whose specialism is climate sensitivity.  He points out that \n“\nThere are two principal issues with the IPCC’s handling of the climate sensitivity area\n.\n  \nFirstly the inclusion of sensitivity estimates from flawed observational studies tha\nt used\n \nunsuitable data, were poorly designed and/or employed inappropriate statistical\n \nmethodology\n. \n[Lewis is very critical of the poor statistical methodology of climate scientists\n].\n \nTh\nat obscured what should have been a key message from AR5 – that the\n \nbe\nst observational evidence now points to the climate system being substantially less\n \nsensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought. Secondly, the elevation of computer\n \nmodels over observational evidence. Virtually all the projections of future clima\nte change\n \nin AR5 are based on simulations by\n General Climate Models\n despite these being out of line with the best\n \nobservational evidence.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\nHe argues that “\nA particularly robust way of empirically estimating climate sensitivity is the so-called\n \n‘energy-budget’ method, which is based on a fundamental physical law – the conservation\n \nof energy. Energy-budget best estimates of \nECS fall\n in a range between 1.5°C and\n \n2.0°C (1.25–1.4°C \nfor TCR\n), depending on the exact periods chosen for analysis. Using\n \nt\nhe longest available periods that were free of major volcanism gives a ECS best estimate\n \nof approximately 1.7°C (1.3°C for TCR)\n…\nFor the shorter-term TCR measure, the discrepancy between the average of the best\n \nobservational estimates is, at 1.4°C, also sub\nstantially lower than the average of the\n \nGCM value of 1.8°C, but close to the energy budget estimate based on the best AR5 data\n \nof 1.3°C.\n”\n&#xa0;\nRichard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences of MIT\n,\n is a leading US climate scientist.  He comments that “\nThe claim that 51% of \nthe small warming over the past 60 years\n \nis due to man’s activities is completely consistent with there being no problem worth bothering\n \nabout. The concern arises because of the c\nlaim that models with high sensitivity can still be\n \nfudged…to replicate the observed warming…As concerns the more serious questions such as what the sensitivity of the climate is or\n \nwhat the relationship is between global warming and various purported disa\nsters, even the IPCC\n \ngenerally admits to ignorance…As the attached paper notes, virtually all observational tests point to sensitivity less than that of any models, and\n \nthere is no evidence of any relationship between extreme weather and global warm\ning.”  \nHis \nsubmission includes \nhis\n paper “Falsification of climate models used in experimentation and scenario construction” which explains how the models are constructed and their limitations.\n&#xa0;\nIn a blog he observed\n \n“I think that the latest IPCC report has truly\n sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.

This could take the form of a ‘Red Team’ in which experts from other\n \nscientific disciplines would be commissioned to undertake a critical review of the IPCC\n \nreports, in whole or in \npart.\n”  \nHer submission is the least critical of the IPCC.\n&#xa0;\nJonathan Drake is a \n“\nprofessional physicist who has spent much free time engaged in independent climate research\n”\n.  He comments that “\nAny and every piece of data that can be\n \nforced to support the \nAnthropogenic Global Warming (aka Climate Change) belief has been\n \nseized upon without due diligence or regard\n to normal scientific practices…t\nhere was a great deal of secrec\ny involved at all stages of AR5.”  He concludes “\nThe IPCC mechanism for assessing s\ncientific knowledge has numerous flaws, not least the\n \nfact that it has been established that there are many authors with biases, whether they are\n \nvested interests (grants/funding), political or ideological, or simply just assumed prestige.\n”\n&#xa0;\nRobin Guenier is a barrister with a varied career in business and as CEO of the Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency reporting to the Cabinet Office.  He examines the question \n“\nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate\n \nscientists?”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHe concluded: “(a) there is insufficient evidence to support a satisfactory answer to the Commi\nttee’s question; (b) the only way to establish a satisfactory answer would be to carry out a full, properly conducted worldwide opinion survey (considered likely to be impracticable); and (c) such evidence as does exist indicates that the answer may well b\ne that AR5 reflects climate scientists’ views to only a very limited extent.”\n&#xa0;\nAlex Henney specializes in electric markets and regulation.  He has taken an interest in climate science because of the manner in which the government’s belief in ACC \nis destroying \nthe electricity market and is adding to costs.  He \npointed to errors in some of the science that the IPCC had promoted\n in the past\n, and cites Professor Don Easterbrook as identifying factual errors in AR5.  Easterbrook commented o\nf the IPCC c\nlaim that “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millenia…there just isn’t any nice way to say this—it’s is an outright lie.” \nHe points to other errors and \nconclude\ns “These are only a few examples of the highly biased, misrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”\n&#xa0;\nHen\nn\ney drew attention t\no the lack of reliabilit\ny of climate models. \nHe noted that a scientist at the Hadley Centre forecast in 2000 that “British children could have only virtual experience of snow”\n,\n and in 2007 climate scientists at the Met Office used their new climate model to \n(incorrectly) \nforecast\n 0.3\n0\nC warming over the decade 2004-2014.  He applied Richard Feynman’s concept of “cargo cult science” to climate models\n, and argues\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nIf climate science were a “normal” science \nthe \nfailure of the models to predict the\n \ntemperature pause would lead many \nscientists to conclude that the assumptions underlying\n \nthe models were wrong and\n \nthey \nwould \ngo back to the drawing b\noard\n. But climate science is\n \npoliticised with extensive commercial, reputational and grant funding vested interests\n \nhanging on it. So the IP\nCC tries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly\n \nto claim an increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and\n \nobservations increase.”\n&#xa0;\nHe drew attention to papers that attributed much of climate change to changes i\nn solar activity\n and to a\n ne\nw report issued by the National Research Council\n \n“The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth’s Climate\n”,\n which \nlays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar activity can make itself felt on our planet.”\n  Also \nJasper K\nirby, Head of the CLOUD Experiment at CERN, \nrecently gave \na presentation \nshowing strong correlations between cosmic rays, so\nlar cycles and earth’s climate\n.\n&#xa0;\nHenney pointed out that the very costly green/decarbonizing agenda is neither particularly effective in achieving its basic objectives or reducing CO2 emissions \nbecause\n t\nhe few nuclear plants will \nat a vast cost \nhave a marginal effect\n; \nCCS is not proven; \nwind farms \nare not only expenisve, they \ndo not achieve what they claim on the tin\n by way of \nmitigation of CO2; r\nesidential solar makes offshore wind look cheap\n; and fresh cut wood chips masquerading as biomass actually increase CO2 emissions\n.\n&#xa0;\nNor will our effort do much if anything to save the planet. While the British government is obsessed with driving unabated coal plants off the system, \nin 2012 the World Resources Institute identified 1,199 new coal fired plants with a capacity of 1400GW being proposed\n.  T\nen 900MW new coal plants are being completed\n in Germany and the Netherlands.  \nThe IPCC failed to provide a sound assessment of the state of climate science.  We need a truly independent assessment undertaken by people who have no vested commercial or reputational interest in the outcome.&#xa0;\nDavid Holland describes some of the abuses of process and of science in the first four ARs of the IPCC, summarizing “…\nthe IPCC process has\n \nalways been over presumptive of the scientific knowledge and has failed to\n \nensure that the experts, who serve it, meet the \nrequired professional and ethical\n \nstandards. The IPCC has conspicuously failed to ensure any compliance with its\n \nfundamental principle of requiring a \n“comprehensive, objective, open and\n \ntransparent” \nprocess.\n  \nGiven, the views already formed by the majority\n of its founders and their\n \nlack of any enforcement of its Principles and Procedures, the IPCC is seen by\n \nmany as established to provide a justification for political commitment. For these\n \nreasons it has never been fit for purpose.\n”\n&#xa0;\nMichael Kelly, Prince P\nhilip Professor of Tech\nnology, University of Cambridge,\n comments that “\nEmpirical studies of the global climate during the 20th century all suggest another century\n \nlike the last and another temperature rise of order 1C. It is only the computer models that p\nroduce\n \nthe hi\ngher temperatures and the alarm…\n \nThe most \nserious defect of the IPCC 5th A\nssessment \nReview\n, as published, was the truculent\n \nand obfuscatory manner with which it admitted the temperature statis since 1996, halved its\n \nestimate of the rate of global warming over the last 60 years, and when insisting that it was \nm\nore\n \ncertain than ever that man was playing a role, that role is still small in the context of the last 150\n \nyears of climate change. A scientific report \nwritten b\ny neutral consultants would have been much\n \nmore upfront, yes, and honest, about these facts.\n”\n&#xa0;\nHe\n then proposed th\nat if (and he is not persuaded)\n \nwe should reduce CO2 emissions, then \nw\ne should do it cost effectively.  He points out “\nRenewable energy source\ns are intrinsically dilute at source. One needs all 1000 square\n \nkilometres of the Fen Country (now producing food) to generate 0.8-1GW from biomass if we\n \nharvested and burned miscanthus, a rapidly growing grass. We already get 1.3GW from Sizewell B,\n \nthe ac\ntual nuclear plant for which is less than one tenth of a square kilometre in area. The factor of\n \n10,000 in energy efficiency of the use of land is not something that can be closed by tinkering with\n \nthe renewable energy efficiency. Furthermore one can grow \nfood or miscanthus or cover the lan\nd \nwith solar panels, but not do more than one of these with the land at any one time.\n”\n&#xa0;\n“\nIn 2050 most of the 9\nbn\n population of the earth will live in megacities. Only nuclear energy\n \nand the burning of fossil fuels with \ncomplete carbon capture and storage produce energy numbers\n \nthat add up to make global sense, but the latter technology (i.e. capture and storage) has not been\n \ndemonstrated as effective and safe at anything like the scale needed. Everything else, and\n \nespeci\nally renewable energy technologies, is hubris as far as energising megacities is concerned.\n”\n&#xa0;\nDonna Laframboise, a Canadian journalist who has written two books about the IPCC and its chairman\n, \nqueries whether the IPCC produces as it claims “objective rep\norts” that are “policy \nneutral”.  She notes that people \n“with d\nocumented \nlinks to activist organizations” have significant \nIPCC participation\n:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nShe concludes “\nThe IPCC\n…\nis a child\n \nof one of the most politically riven bodies known to humanity, the United Nations\n…\nAt a 2008 event celebrating the IPCC's 20th anniversary,\n \nchairman Pachauri told a group of IPCC insiders: \"The UNFCCC is our main customer\n…A\nn international treaty is a political instrument.

This is unscientific and casts doubt on the validity of the exercise and the credibility\n \nof the IPCC.\n”\n&#xa0;\nJohn McLean’s doctorate in Australia is\n on climate issue\n.  He wrote a book \n“We have been conned – an independent review of the IPCC” \nwhich \nis a detailed\n \nanalysis of the flaws in previous IPCC reports. H\ne points out that in order to understand part of the agenda of the IPCC it is necessary to \nappreciate the history of its formation and that it “\nis focussed on the narrow issue of any human influences on climate and has no mandate\n \nto examine all possible causes (which means it cites only material relevant to its\n \ncharter)\n; it \nbenefits through the \nmassive government funding to research aligned with the IPCC\n \nview because such research produces a large number of peer-reviewed papers\n; \nattracts researchers who benefitted \nfrom the research funding above\n as Lead Authors\n \nand Coordinating Lead Authors\n; \ndoes\n not include sceptical authors (and yet scepticism is an essential part of science)\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC “\nis not independent of government and politics because government representatives\n \neffectively dictate what will be said in the Summary for Policymakers\n…\n \nT\nhe IPCC\n is ineffective because of its narrow focus and this distorts its outlook into a\n \nform of political justification\n.”\n&#xa0;\nHe points out “\nThe writing of an IPCC \nAssessment Review i\ns made much easier if there is general\n \nagreement between the Lead Authors and Coord\ninating Lead Authors of a given chapter.\n \nOne way to achieve this is to avoid involving any potential authors who might be sceptical of\n \nthe claim of a significant human influence on temperature.\n”\n&#xa0;\nConor McMenamie is an inventor.  He opines that AR5 has an agenda to promote global climate \nc\nhange, and to support this by claiming the science is settled and rejecting other views.  He comments “\nThe climate research institutions, upon whom we rely for an honest and accur\nate\n \nprovision of information, are quickly becoming the least reliable authorities at\n \nproviding that same information, since it is their ambition to adhere to the\n \naspirations of the IPCC, despite their 100% failure record.”\n&#xa0;\nChristopher Monkton, a well know\nn \nsceptic\n, responded to the question of “How robust are the conclusions in AR5?” with an effective set of exhibits showing the discrepancy between various model predictions and aspects of global temperatures.  He linked the exhibits to 1) the failure of re\nliability of the models; 2) the failure to explain the temperature hiatus; and 3) the lack of credibility of the IPCC.  In response to the question of whether AR5 reflected the range of scientific views he pointed out that he had not been allowed to attend\n the initial scoping meeting for AR5 and the IPCC also tried to exclude Professor Paul Reiter, a world expert on epidemiology of malaria, who had disagreed with the IPCC line on the spread of malaria due to ACC.  He claimed “only one viewpoint is allowed”.\n  \n&#xa0;\nMonkton considered “There is no economic case for climate action…it is time to do away with the IPCC…There is no need to cut CO2 emissions…the climate scare is over.”\n&#xa0;\nSusan Morrow is a retired science teacher and an amateur meteorologist/climatologist\n.  She comments “The IPCC is 100% AGW lobbyists/scientists; there are\n \nother climate groups/ scientists that are 100% the opposite\n.  If\n the UK \nMet O\nffice wants to lead world climate research \nit should not shun and demoralize alternative r\nesearch\n, but employ \nsome \nAGW \nsceptic\ns on an equal basis.”\n&#xa0;\nPhilip Richen has a PhD in theoretical physics.  He concludes \nthe IPCC \n“\ndoes not provide a balanced assessment of the scientific literature on natural\n \nvariability\n…\nThe report only partially addresses the r\neliability of climate models\n…T\nhe report does not sufficiently explain the reasons for the hiatus in global temperature.\n”\n&#xa0;\nFenton Robb comments “\nIPCC AR5 is unashamedly presented, not as the outcome of scientific\n \nobservation, but as a compilation of the opi\nnions of a close community of experts.\n  \nThis is made abundantly clear in Sect\nion A Introduction paragraph 3.”  He considers that “\nClimatologists form a closely-knit peer group that shares an interest in promoting\n \npublic alarm and provoking continued \nresearch.\n”  \n&#xa0;\nThe Scottish Climate and Energy Forum states that notwithstanding its claim to the contrary the IPCC does not know enough about climate science to model it accurately; it cannot determine the effects of climate change; and it provides no basi\ns for government action.\n&#xa0;\nIan Strangeways was head of Applied Physics at the Institute of Hydrology and is now Director of TerraData Ltd, a consultancy in environmental monitoring and measurement.  He \ncomments:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHe developed the latter point that [IPCC] “B\neing a ‘Governmental’ organisation makes it difficult to summarise and report\n \nscientific research objectively because of political pressures, interference,\n \ninterpretation and spin. This is particularly so in the case of the Summary for\n \nPolicymakers, which \nis all that most people read. The IPCC should, therefore, be\n \nreplaced by a purely scientific panel free from any political involvement whatsoever.\n \nThe IPCC is increasingly perceived by many as having a political agenda,\n \nundermining the excellent scientific\n work behind it.\n”\n&#xa0;\nRichard Tol is a professor of economics at the University of Sussex and of the economi\ncs of climate change at the Vrij\ne Universiteet Amsterdam.  He does not regard the IPCC as an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge, co\nmmenting “\nThe IPCC reports justify the existence of a large bureaucracy which, judging from the lack\n \nin progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vulnerability to climate change, seems\n \nprimarily occupied with maintaining and expanding said \nbureaucracy.\n”  \nHe also opines:-\n&#xa0;\n              \n“\nThe UK could be a leader in international climate policy if it would demonstrate that\n \ngreenhouse gas emissions can be cut substantially without causing economic pain. Current\n \nUK climate policy shows the opposite: Climate \npolicy can cause real hardship without\n \nmaking a dent in emissions.\n”\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nASSESSMENT OF ASSESSMENT\n&#xa0;\nThe British Warmist establishment took no notice of 1) the IPCC’s past promotion of pseudo science such as the “hockey stick” and “Himalayagate”; 2) its pas\nt baseless claims of increased hurricanes and the spread of malaria due to ACC; 3) the exposure in Climategate of the unethical practices of a coterie of climate scientists involved with the IPCC; 4) \nits \nassociation with the inconvenient inaccuracies promo\nted by Senator Al Gore; \nand 5) the various shortcomings cited in the previous two sections\n.  It continued living in its politically correct bubble of consensus settled science, claiming\n:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn view of the close involvement of the various organisations and people in the IPCC none can be regarded as independent judges of AR5.  Furthermore they variously have political face, grant income, expenditure on bigger and faster computers, and reputations at stake.&#xa0;The\n main scientific\n criticisms of AR5 are:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPublic policy criticisms are that the IPCC process is not all that it is cracked up to be, notably:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Climate models have improved since the [\nFourth Assessment Report\npublished in 2007]. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th c\nentury and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (\nvery\n&#xa0;\nhigh confidence\n).”\n&#xa0;\n     Followed immediately by\n&#xa0;\nthis\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with\n the observed trend (\nvery high confidence\n). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012).”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles.pdf\n.\n \nThis is the total on 20/12 plus those of Professors Judith Curry and John Christy.\n \nViz those by Brigitte Nerlich and by James Painter focused more on communication than the science and poli\ncy implications of AR5.\n \nViz those by Carbon Tracker and EDF Energy.\n \ni.e. those who claim that climate warming over the period 1996-1998 is mainly – if not entirely – a consequence of CO2 emissions due to mankind.  Note that in the period prior to 1976 \nthere was concern about global cooling while since 1998 the surface temperature has been stable\n, \nthe so called “hiatus” or “pause”\n.  That does not stop the more enthusiastic warmists claiming that the earth is still warming, perhaps with the heat going int\no the deep ocean\n where it cannot be measured!\n \nDonna Laframboise points out the green credentials of some of the lead authors, see\n 3\n. \nThe key people are the 209 Lead Authors who control the input\n, \nwhich is accepted from Review Editors and Contributing \nAuthors and control the drafting.\n \nThis is a stretch;\n m\nost – if not all – of those involved are employees of governmental organizations or universities.  They are not putting in \ntheir \ntime and \ntheir \nmoney.\n \nInterestingly this included the Imperial Granth\nam.  However, in an interview with the Economist on 18/3/10 Professor Hoskins stated of climate models “they’re still pretty lousy.”  Clearly the submission is being politically correct.\n \nSceptics\n are those who accept that the climate is (as ever) changing and warmed up from 1976 to 1998, but that the reasons for the warming are complex and far from fully understood, and cannot all be laid at the door of CO2 emissions due to mankind.\n \nHe notes tha\nt \nthe IPCC relies on climate models to distinguish “natural” from “human” caused climate change\n, but “\nthese \nm\nodels on average fail by a significant amount to reproduce the climate of the past 35 years\n…the\n IPCC now has even more confidence that the models c\nan distinguish “natural” from “human” change over a period the models clearly fail to simulate well. It doesn’t make sense to me.”\n&#xa0;\n In an interview for EconTalk with Russ Roberts of Stanford \nUniversity \nhe commented how unusual her approach was in the feb\nrile environment of climate science.  Her interview\n is on her blog judithcurry.com, \nJC interview with EconTalk, 23 December 2013.\n \nCurry, Judith, \n2013\n,\n IPCC diagnosis – permanent paradigm paralysis. \nClimate Etc. \n(blog)\nhttp://judithcurry.com/2013/09/28/ipcc-diagnosis-permanent-paradigm-paralysis/\n. \n&#xa0;\n \nThe paper shows the failure of 97.5% of 90 climate models to track temperatur\ne over the period 1983 to 2013.\n \nCO2 without amplification or positive feedbacks cannot warm the atmosphere in the mann\ner proposed by IPCC scientists and a doubling world other things being equal increase the global temperature by about 1\n0\nC. The IPCC and climate models assume positive feedback which amplifies the effect.  Thus the \nIPCC AR4 conclusion on climate sensitivity is as:-\n&#xa0;\n“The equilibrium climate sensitivity…is likely to be in the range 2\n0\nC to 4.5\n0\nC with a best estimate of about 3\n0\nC and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5\n0\nC.  Values higher than 4.5\n0\nC cannot be excluded…”\n&#xa0;\nIt is the increase in sensitivity which leads to the predictions of significant future increases in temperature.  AR5 avoided setting an official \nfigure\n for climate sensitivity beca\nuse of disagreement\n.  \n  \n&#xa0;\nThe\nre are two measures of sensitivity.  The first is Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), which is the equilibrium change in global mean near surface air temperature that would result from a sustaine\nd doubling of CO2 concentration.  The second is Transient Climate Response (TCR), which is the average temperature respo0nse over a 20 year period.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nThe World Climate Research Programme established the Coupled Model Intercomparison\n Project (CMIP) to study the output of coupled atmosphere – ocean ge\nneral circulation models.  CMIP3\n we\nre the models developed for AR4 and CIMP5 for AR5\n.\n “The Delinquent Teenager: IPCC exposé”\n and \n“Into the Dustbin\n: Rajendra Pachauri, the Climate Report \nand the Nobel Peace Prize\n” (which is available as a pdf from her website, nofrakkingconcensus.com)\n. \n \nAccor\nding to Monckton at the request of representatives \nof the German and Hungarian\n governments\n.\n \nI have read a number of papers by the Met Office and o\nthers purporting to claim ACC.  A noted characteristic of most of them is a reliance on models to show whatever (e.g. \na “probabilistic” seeming \ndistribution to outcomes) followed by an assertion that the event is probably due to ACC\n, but in reality there i\ns no empirical link\n.  I call this “\nint\nellectual fluff”.\n \nIn “Solar and planetary oscillation control on climate change: hind-cast, forecast and a comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs”, Nicola Scafetta of Duke University argues that \n“global surface temperature \nrecords since 1850 are characterized by climatic oscillations synchronous with specific solar, planetary and lunar harmonics superimposed on a background warming modulation. The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in the\n chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases). However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be used in the AR5 IPCC Report in 2013, fail to reconstruct the observed climatic oscillations. As an \nalternate, an empirical model is proposed that uses\n \na specific set of decadal, multidecadal, secular and millennial astronomic harmonics to simulate the observed climatic oscillations…\nand performs the GCMs by better hindcasting the observed 1850-2012 clima\nte patterns…\nabout 50-60% of the warming observed since 1850 and since 1970 was induced by natural oscillations likely resulting from harmonic astronomical forcings that are not yet included in the GCMs.”\n&#xa0;\n"
