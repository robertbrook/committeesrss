defaultAsylum Aid is gravely concerned about the government’s proposed 
defaultLegal Aid
default reforms. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese changes are likely to impact the human rights of some of Asylum Aid’s most vulnerable clients, including:
default&#xa0;
defaultA
defaultt the same time as removing access to justice from our clients, the proposals would immunise the government from challenges against its decisions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will have deep, worrying and lasting implications for human rights in the UK.

defaultThe proposed introduction of a residence test for civil defaultLegal Aiddefault claimants, so as to limit defaultLegal Aiddefault to those with a “strong connection” with the UKdefaultAsylum Aid is very concerned that the proposed ‘residence test’ 
default– generally understood as one year’s legal residence in the UK – 
defaultis 
defaultincompatible with human rights.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt will directly affect our clients whose applications for asylum have been refused, but who rely on 
defaultLegal Aid
default to bring new information about their situati
defaulton (or ‘fresh claims’) before the Home Office. This right is essential, given that:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.1. Fredefaultsh asylum cdefaultlaimsdefault and destitute asylum seekersdefault defaultIt is unclear from the consultation document whether the Ministry of Justice proposes to grant access to 
defaultLegal Aid
default as soon as a fresh claim for asylum has been submitted or, as it appears from the consultation
default proposals, whether 
defaultLegal Aid
default will only be granted once an application has been accepted by the Government as amounting to a fresh claim. This needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf it is the latter, then in a situation where a person submits a
default fresh claim but the government refuses to treat it as such, the applicant would not have a 
defaultright of appeal. Under the present system the only legal remedy open to a person in t
defaulthis situation would be to seek J
defaultudicial 
defaultR
defaulteview – but under these proposals, whe
defaultre a person has no right to reside, access to 
defaultLegal Aid
default for 
defaultJ
defaultudicial 
defaultR
defaulteview would also be curtailed. This has the potential to deny access to justice for vulnerable asylum seekers and is therefore incompatible with human rights legislation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAsylum Aid’s work advising destitute asylum seekers consistently finds that at least 50% of the clients advised have legitimate merits for accessing 
defaultLegal Aid
default to reopen their cases. This could be to undertake fresh asylum claims or to commence judicial rev
defaultiew proceedings as a result of the Home Office not following their own established policies and procedures.
default This vulnerable client group already faces extreme barriers accessing 
defaultLegal Aid
default for further advice on 
defaulttheir cases. This is why Asylum Aid has devel
defaultoped outreach advice surgeries to undertake this work, outside the scope of 
defaultLegal Aid
default. Once we have established the merits of the case, we use this as evidence to persuade legal providers to take these people on because – despite the barriers they have fac
defaulted – they should be entitled to access 
defaultLegal Aid
default. This can then also assist to resolve destitution problems. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultMinistry of Justice 
defaultproposals 
defaultwould
default establish further barriers for this vulnerable client group, making it more difficult for them to access 
defaultjustice and exacerbating their destitution. Moreover, preventing access to justice for people with legitimate human rights claims in this way may well be incompatible with human rights legislation to which the government has signed up. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.2. Fresh defaultasylumdefault claims and wdefaultomen defaultMaking it harder to get 
defaultLegal Aid
default for fresh claims has a disproportionate impact on women asylum seekers. This is because there are a range of factors that can make it harder for women to disclose their experiences at the time of their a
defaultsylum claim and appeal. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese factors include: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI would also d
defaultraw your attention to the situation described by the campaign group Save Justice, whose client was recognised as a refugee and was able to access 
defaultLegal Aid
default to apply for a non-molestation order against her violent and dangerous ex-husband.
default This potentially
default life-saving provision would be lost under these proposals.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. Separated Asylum-Seeking Children defaultAsylum Aid works to ensure separated asylum seeking children are kept safe from harm.
default We are therefore deeply concerned about the potential impact that the
default residence test could have on t
defaulthis extremely vulnerable 
defaultgroup
default of young people, and about the potential breaches of the 
defaultConvention on the Rights of 
defaultthe Child, 
defaulta
default 
defaultlegally binding international agreement w
defaulthich the UK has ratified and 
defaultwhich is applicable to all
default children present in the United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
defaultAsylum Aid is particularly concerned 
defaultthat the introduction of a residence test would breach
default Articles 
defaultof the Convention, including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. Assessing the Residence Test defaultAsylum Aid believes that the ability to assess a client under the proposed residence test will be an extremely complicated process and that, as such, only specialist immigration lawyers would be competent to undertake this work. If this reform is implement
defaulted, it would be necessary to grant 
defaultLegal Aid
default to advise on this process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNotwithstanding this concern, this is a complex area of law with significant scope for wrongful interpretation, particularly in the absence of concrete evidence to prove or dis
defaultprove 
defaultthe right to reside. I
defaultt is highly likely that people will be denied access to justice due to a misunderstanding of their eligibility.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies defaultshould only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceeddefaultThe proposed changes to access to Judicial Review (JR) are likely to impact asylum seekers and refugees, as well as the charities who work with the
defaultm, far beyond that anticipated in the consultation.
default&#xa0;
defaultWork to research, prepare and present a JR is often substantial, especially to address concerns in the handling of the most complex asylum claims. If implemented, this proposal would act as a 
defaultdisincentive for providers to undertake JR work even where merits are established, as any work prior to permission being granted by the court would have to be undertaken pro bono. This will make it very difficult for people facing destitution to access JR,
default particularly to apply for urgent injunctions. It will also make it far more difficult to undertake strategic litigation work to test and develop the law, which by definition is work carried out at risk, with border line potential for success.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe govern
defaultment has emphasised that funding will remain in place for meritorious JRs, to be paid after the decision on merits; but few organisations will have the cash-flow resources to prepare a JR appropriately knowing that this work will not be recompensed for man
defaulty months. As 
defaultthe 
defaultI
defaultmmigration 
defaultL
defaultaw 
defaultP
defaultractitioners’ 
defaultA
defaultssociation
default 
default(ILPA) has argued recently
default, after a succession of cuts many 
defaultLegal Aid
default providers “cannot assume any more financial risk in their businesses”.
default In practice, it will become a lasting challenge to fun
defaultd upfront the work needed to file a JR, even where the merits of the case are immediately evident. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition
default, the underlying motive to sav
defaulte public expenditure is 
defaultquestionable when one takes into account the fact that weak cases are already refused perm
defaultission to proceed. This mechanism is already in place to protect the public purse and strikes a fair balance. In urgent cases the merits of the case need to be kept under ongoing assessment, but the final decision on whether to grant 
defaultLegal Aid
default always rests
default with the 
defaultLegal Aid
default Agency, not the provider. 
defaultRestricting access to JRs would have the effect of limiting essential access to justice, even where there is an overwhelming need to correct an error in a previous decision. Some of the most vulnerable asylum 
defaultseekers and refugees would be left without recourse to help to which they are entitled, including: 
default&#xa0;
defaultAsylum Aid is deeply concerned at this prospect. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving borne witness over many years to the flaws and shortcomings in asylum decision-making, and the regularity with which the Home Office acts in breach of its own policies and procedures, the use of JR is paramount where there are legitimate concerns th
defaultat the government has acted illegally or irrationally. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government can maintain access to justice and more effectively save money by ensuring the Home Office takes a fair and competent approach to asylum claims earlier in the system. If the operation 
defaultof the asylum system is aligned with the policies already in place, recourse to an expensive JR process will rightly become an exceptional occurrence.

defaultThe proposal that defaultLegal Aiddefault should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of successdefaultThere is a very real risk that, by removing 
defaultLegal Aid
default from cases which meet the ‘borderline’ criteria, the human rights needs of some asylum seekers will not be met. 
default&#xa0;
defaultW
defaulte share the concerns raised by ILPA in their response to the government’s consultation paper, where ILPA stated:
default&#xa0;
default[
defaultLegal Aid
default practitioners]
default are frequently in the position of challenging cases that they know will be hard to win, for example because there is
default settled law in the higher courts against them. It is frequently impossible fairly to judge the merits of a case before it has been prepared, which is why the borderline category is important.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is true of many of the complex asylum cases in which Asy
defaultlum Aid specialises, where particular expertise and time is required to identify the protection needs that ensure a case meets at least the ‘borderline’ criteria. If these cases are no longer funded, 
defaultsuch vulnerable clients
default will not enjoy access to justice
default. This is also the case for strategic litigation, which necessarily tests the law in areas which remain under development.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, it is our experience that some legal representatives are unable or unwilling to take on the most complex appeals and Ju
defaultdicial Reviews because of the unfunded hours of work required to demonstrate that they meet at least the ‘borderline’ criteria. In our 2011 
defaultUnsustainable
default research into women’s asylum claims, for example, half the women in our sample from Cardiff did not ha
defaultve legal representation on appeal, something likely related to the complexity of many gender-related asylum claims.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite this, women’s claims are disproportionately likely to be overturned on appeal, indicating that 
defaultsome
default work at first assumed not be m
defaulteet ‘borderline’ criteria is nonetheless necessary to overturn poor initial Home Office decisions.
