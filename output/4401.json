"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Guide Dogs (LTD0014)&#xa0;1.1 \nP\nublic transport is essential in allowing disabled people to live independent and active lives. Guide Dogs is an organisation dedicated to improving the independent mobility of blind and partially sighted people and, as such, we have considerable experience\n \nin this area \nand a body of evidence of the experiences of this group in using transport. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nGuide Dogs campaigns on transport issues which affect our service users both locally and nationally. In particular we campaign for buses to be made accessible t\no blind and partially sighted people through the fitting of audio-visual \n(AV) \nannouncements and for streets to be accessibly \ndesigned \nand \nkept \nfree from clutter. Guide Dogs has concerns about \nhow \nchanges in \nlocal transport \ndecision-making structures will a\nffect \nthese \naccessibility\n issues\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nIn our capacity as a mobility organisation\n, we have a particular interest in\n:\nOur response is therefore\n focused on\n the Committee’s questions \nwhich relate\n to these areas.\n&#xa0;2 What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?2.1 \nDevolution and localism are desirable objective\ns\n inasmuch as they provide greater flexibility to meet the needs of the local population.\n However, there is a risk th\nat the needs of minority groups within these local populations will not be taken into account\n in \nfunding \ndecisions\n. D\nevolution has to be in the context of prevailing national standards for the accessibility of vehicles, infrastructure and networks. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nI\nn the real world, travel is not confined by local authority \nor LEP \nboundaries and people with sight loss need to have the confidence that certain accessibility standards will be upheld throughout their journey. \nA door-to-door\n journey is only as ac\ncessible \nas its weakest link. This can be illustrated \nthrough the current situation on \nAV announcements: though trains are equipped with AV technology, this brings no benefit to a blind person if their bus to the station is not. If \nthey \ncannot be confident of safel\ny travelling to the station, then the whole journey becomes \neffectively \ninaccessible.  \n&#xa0;\n2.3 Guide Dogs concern is that u\nnless national standards are imposed, \ni.e.\n \na requirement for AV\n a\nnnouncements on all buses across the UK, this type of accessibility im\nprovement may become \nthe sort of 'minor' issue which would \nbe\n scrimped and saved on \nby a local body \nat the last minute to avoid budget over-runs.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nA recent report by the National Audit Office on Funding and Structures for Local Economic Growth showed \nthat \nthere is no plan to measure outcomes or evaluate performance comparably across different local growth progress. It also noted that \nLEPs were mak\ning progress at different rates:\n \n“Some partnerships continue to face significant capacity issues, a factor\n exacerbated by the recent step change in the demands placed upon them through introducing the Growth Deals and new responsibilities for EU structural funds.”\n \n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nTh\nese regional differences between LEPs will result in patchwork provision of transport, \nincluding accessibility improvements, reducing the ability of blind and partially sighted people to travel across th\ne country safely and with confidence\n. \n&#xa0;3.0 What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?3.1 \nGuide Dogs is concerned that the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund \ncould result in less funding for transport projects overall. Our understanding is that the Department for Transport is the \nbiggest\n dep\nartmental\n \ncontributor to the \nSingle Local Growth Fund – contributing £1.9bn of funding. Most relevant to Guide Dogs is that \n£100m of \nthis is from the \nLocal \nSustainable Transport Fund\n, a fund\n \nfor smaller projects \nwhich could\n, for example,\n be used to equip b\nuses with AV. The money paid by the DfT into the \nSingle Local Growth \nFund is not ring-fenced so it is possible that some of the DfT’s\n money\n could be\n used for other local projects unrelated to transport.\n&#xa0;4.0 How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?4.1 \nT\nhe establishment of the £2b\nn Single Local Growth F\nu\nnd and the transfer of decision \nmaking in respect of this fund to \nLEPs \nwill increase the\n part that LEPs\n \nplay \nin taking local transport decisions. Guide \nDogs is concerned about the accountability of LEPs and their obligations with regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty.\n \nThe \nPublic Sector Equality Duty\n empowers \ndifferent transport u\nsers\n, and particularly disabled p\neople,\n \nto engage \nin the decision-making \nprocess, creating better transport solutions for all sections of society.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n \nL\nocal authorities, Passenger Transport Executive\ns and Integrated Transport Authorities come directly within the remit of the Equality Act 2010,\n through listing in Schedule 19. T\nhe status of\n L\nocal \nT\nransport \nB\nodie\ns\n and \nLEPs \nis far less clear. \nT\nhe\nse bodies\n \ncarry\n out public functions \nand so should be \nsubject to the Act, \nbut this \nhas not been supported by clear guidance to this effect. It is concerning that the only easily \naccessible guidance \nis contained in the Supplementary Guidance to Local Enterprise Partnerships on the Development and Delivery of European Structural \nand Investment Funds \nStrategies. This document\n reminds LEPs they need to “\nfamiliarise themselves\n”\n with th\ne Public Sector Equality Duty as they will be advising Managing Authorities (which are bound by these \nduties) on how best to exercise\n public functions. \nThis implies that LEPs do not themselves have to have regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n \nTh\nere are further concerns about accountability. In a recent article in Transport XTra, Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics\n wrote,\n “LEPs and local transport bodies are not local government. At the margin they are less legitimate than loc\nal government, pure and simple”.   \nFurther concerns come from the recent National Audit Office report which stated: \n‘Locally, it is not clear that the government has achieved its objective to “increase democratic accountability and transparency, and ensu\nre that public expenditure is more responsive to the need\ns of local business and people” ’\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n \nFurthermore, the report states \n‘\nLocal Enterprise Partnerships are not subject to the same transparency requirements as local authorities\n’\n. Not only is it unclear whether LEPs have to abide by the same equality requirements as local authorities but \nwe are concerned that it will be more difficult for disability groups, such as Guide Dogs, to monitor the work of LEPs and hold them to account. \nDevolving responsibility for large amounts of transport funding to these bodies may \nresult in less transparent and \nless accountable decision \nmaking, which will have a negative impact upon disabled people. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n \nLEPs \ndo \nincorporate a voluntary sector input,\n \nbut disability is much more than just a third sector issue and it would be wrong to assume that the third sector is necessarily the best way for people with disabilities to engage. \nIn summary, \nwith LEPs ta\nking a greater role in decision \nmaking, \nwe want to\n see LEPs placed under a clear statutory duty to take equa\nlities into account in decision \nmaking and to meet the same standards that apply to other public authorities in respect of consultation and engagement with people with a differing range of disabilit\nies, including \nvisual impairment\n.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nwww.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10285-001-Local-economic-growth.pdf\n"
