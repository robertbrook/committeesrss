[[[&#xa0;]]]Written evidence from British Retail Consortium [PCC Progress 29]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry into the work and effectiveness of Police and Crime Commissioners.   This paper briefly summarises the BRC’s views, which are most relevant to the following strands of the Committee’s inquiry: 

[[[About The BR]]]

[[[C]]]The BRC is the lead trade association for the retail sector and the authoritative voice of the industry. We bring together a whole range of retailers across the UK, from small independents to large multiples and department stores, selling a wide range of products through high street, out of town, neighbourhood, rural and online stores.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The level of crime committed against businesses is significant and continues to be of real concern to BRC members.  Analysis carried out by the by the Metropolitan Police for the Mayor’s Office found that in 2012/13, businesses were the victims of 15% of all reported crime in London. 2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are in the process of analysing the results of the BRC Annual Retail Crime Survey for 2013.  The last report, published earlier this year, found that in 2011-12:  2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite the level of retail crime, tackling it is often not considered a priority by law enforcement and retailers remain frustrated about the often poor response they receive to reported crimes.  Crimes committed against retailers, such as shop theft, are still perceived by many as 'victimless'.  Such a view fails to recognise the importance of the retail sector to local communities and the fact that the same offenders targeting shops often commit other crimes in their local areas.  It also fails to recognise the impact on employees themselves.  Local perceptions of crime and criminality are undoubtedly shaped by what people experience in their shopping centres and local stores.    

[[[Measuring business crime ]]]2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A fundamental problem with assessing the impact of business crime is that there is no agreed definition of it.  We cannot fight it effectively until the true scale of the problem is measured and understood.   This is why the BRC fully supports the work by DCC Sue Fish, ACPO lead for Business Crime, to introduce a single, national business crime definition.  This, along with the capability of police forces to ‘tag’ such crime on their recording systems, would represent a major step forward. It would allow there to be focused partnerships between businesses and the police to tackle retail crime, utilising resources more effectively to target hot spots within each force area.2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If this definition is introduced by ACPO, we would expect PCCs to help ensure that their police forces implement it as soon as possible and have in place the necessary IT software to start recording and measuring business crime.  In time, we would like to see business crime statistics published by each police force in the same way that other crime data is routinely made available. 3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BRC supported the introduction of elected Police and Crime Commissioners.  We undertook a range of work both before and after the PCC elections to explain how, through working with retailers, PCCs can help to cut crime affecting local communities.  The BRC produced guidance for PCC candidates, and held a number of meetings with individual PCCs to discuss retail crime. 

[[[Business Crime in PCC Police and Crime Plans ]]]3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Earlier this year the BRC conducted an informal review of published PCC Police and Crime Plans for 2013-17, to examine the extent of commitments within them to tackle business crime and retail crime in particular.  3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The majority of the Police and Crime Commissioners have recognised in some way the need to work with businesses in their Plans. Out of the 41 newly elected Commissioners, over half of them (27) refer to engaging with business as part of their crime fighting strategy. 3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However the degree to which PCCs set out specific proposals to tackle crimes affecting businesses varies greatly, from brief references to consulting with business to more detailed commitments about specifically working with retailers to tackle crime affecting them.   

[[[London: A dedicated Business Crime Strategy ]]]3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 26 November the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime published a consultation on a business crime strategy for London.  The BRC very much welcomes this and had been engaged in the early stages of the consultation process to help shape the strategy.  If delivered, the proposals within the draft strategy would represent a significant step forward in how business crime is tackled, such as: 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BRC would like to see the production of a dedicated business crime strategy replicated by PCCs elsewhere. Whilst the strategy is still in development and crucial issues such how operational delivery will be achieved have yet to be resolved, the approach being taken in London is a very positive one. 4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A specific example of where PCCs could help to deliver improvements for retailers is in relation to the police response to fraud, an issue of major concern for the sector.  The introduction of Action Fraud in April 2013 created a single, central reporting centre for fraud.   Action Fraud feeds reports of fraud into the NFIB for further analysis, which then sends cases out to local police forces for further action.  However from an enforcement perspective the new process is failing retailers, for the following reasons:&#xa0;4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The extent of the problem is made clear in the MOPAC consultation document.  In London of the solvable fraud reports which have been sent out from the NFIB to the MPS for further action since the inception of Action Fraud, just 3% have been solved.  4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Retailers would like PCCs to work with their local police forces to improve their response to fraud and deliver improvements for businesses in this area. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Set out below are the BRCs recommendations for how PCCs could help to reduce retail crime more effectively. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
