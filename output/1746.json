"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from John Greenwood (TIC 079)&#xa0;Improving Public transport provision for Cropwell and the Vale of Belvoir  (South East of Nottingham)&#xa0;Introduction 1. \nThis discussion note has been prepared in response to the \ncall for evidence by the Transport Committee Inquiry into Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities (SCA 21/2013-14, \n27\nth\n June 2013)\n&#xa0;\n2. \nI am a \nP\narish Councillor for Cropwell Bishop\n,\n \na village with a population of around 2000 people located about 8 miles South East of Nottingham City.  \nAdjacent smaller villages\n \nextend into the Vale of Belvoir.  \nTh\nis\n note\n \nreflects the gro\nwing concerns and isolation felt by local people due to inadequate public transport provision.  I am\n a\n Chartered Civil Engineer (recently retired) and the comments reflect my personal perspective and frustrations as \na resident of Cropwell Bishop\n and a comm\nuter to Nottingham for the last 20 years.\n \nThe proposals have the support and backing of the Cropwell Bishop Parish Council.\n&#xa0;\nSummary \n3. \nBus services in village communities such as Cropwell Bishop are inadequate.  The village is just 8 miles from \nNottingham but the population of around 2000 people is disadvantaged because there is no direct commuter service and no evening services connecting with the city or other local communities.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nLocal authorities have reduced funds available to help subsidi\nse bus services in less populated areas. Commercial operators have little interest in less profitable semi rural services\n \nbut are generally making healthy profits from their core routes. \nS\nometimes 2 or more operators cover the same core route\n indicating po\ntential profits to be made.\nIt is considered that Improvements to semi rural bus services can be achieved at very small costs if available resources are redirected by partial regulation and licensing of local area concessions.  \nLicensed \n(franchised) \no\nperat\nors would be required to provide\n agreed\n appropriate \nsemi \nrural service\ns alongside their profitable core routes.\n&#xa0;\n5. \nThese comments were \npreviously \nmade to the \nCompetition Commission investigating the \nL\nocal Bus Market.  Their provisional findings report of \nMay 2011 supported the use of local area or route franchise to help provide the much needed commuter and evening leisure services for the less populated semi rural areas whilst avoiding wastage by excess competition on the more densely populated, commercia\nlly attractive routes.\n  Unfortunately, after pressure from the major operators, the local franchise idea was not promoted in the final report of the Competition commission.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nSimilar comments were \nalso \npassed to the Institution of Civil Engineers request\n for comment on the proposed High Speed railway line (HS2) and a station for the East Midlands\n (April 2011)\n. \n \nThe nation desperately needs improved transportation and the proposed HS2 line \nmight\n be an appropriate step forward \nbut only if it is \naccessible a\ns \npart of a\nn improved\n national and local integrated transport system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Local Issues7. \nAt a local level, I have been campaigning for many years to achieve \nattractive\n \ndirect \ncommuter and evening bus services for Cropwell Bishop\n and other smaller villages in the Vale of Belvoir\n.  My commuter journey into Nottingham \ntook\n approximately 55 minutes door to door using the available indirect bus services but only 35 minutes if I choose to drive my car \n10 miles across\n \nacross Nottingham \nC\nity to the Forest \nF\nields \n‘\npark and ride\n’\n and take the tram back in to my work place at Nottingham Trent \nU\nniversity\n – \nN\not a very ‘green\n’\n \nsolution\n.\n  \nA direct commuter bus would reduce door to door journey times to 35 minutes – a reduction of 20 minutes.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nThe local bus services are supported by generous subsidies from the County Council but \ndespite the \ngreater powers under the \n2008 \nLocal Transport A\nct\n (See Appendix 2)\n, \nthey seem unwilling (or unable?) to require the bus companies to provide \nattractive \ndi\nrect commuter services and evening leisure services \ninto Nottingham \nas part of that subsidy agreement.\n \n(\nThis could\n change with current \nNottinghamshire \nCounty Council \nTITAN project initiatives\n but we are not holding our breath\n as available funds diminish\n!\n)\n&#xa0;\n9. \nFactors such as \nc\nity parking levies, road congestion, fuel costs, and pensioner subsidies, have increased bus usage in recent years and alternative bus companies\n, such as Premiere Travel,\n moved in to try and take a share of the profits enjoyed by the e\nstablished companies\n (\nsuch as \nTrent Barton)\n.  This has not really helped us in semi rural areas \nlike\n Cropwell Bishop because the competition \nwas\n focussed on the more populated areas of nearby C\not\ngrave and Bingham.  It also generated unproductive ‘bus wars’\n with the sister company of \nTrent Baton\n running ‘spoiling’ services with the sole intention of driving out the competition. \nEventually\n \nthe \nsister company’s ‘spoiling’ service did force the competitor, Premiere Travel to abandon the Nottingham to Cotgrave r\noutes in 2012.  The \n‘\nspoiling\n’\n service stopped soon after Premiere pulled out!\n  The competing company, Premiere Travel went into liquidation, January, 2013\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n10. \nAt one time in 2011, \nWe \nhad\n the nonsense of 3 competing buses running in to Notting\nh\nam from C\nropwell Bishop at 8.00am but none of them provid\ned\n a direct service because they \nsaw\n the main revenue coming from the \nC\notgrave estates \ne\nn route.\n \nAfter the demise of Premiere, w\ne have now returned to one indirect bus at 8.00am and no other services into Not\ntingham until\n \n09.26\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n11. \nThe day time services into Nottingham are adequate (2 indirect buses per hour) but we have recently lost the direct link to the adjacent community of Bingham where many of our village children attend seconday school. \n&#xa0;\n12. \nOur evening \nbus \nservices are very poor with the last bus into Nottingham at 5.40\n pm\n and the last bus home from Nottingham at 6.00 pm.  This creates a severe isolation \nof village people \nfrom the work and social \nopportunities\n \noffered\n by Nottingham City in th\ne evening\n.\n&#xa0;\n13. \nIt is observed that \np\neak time (7.30-8.30\n am\n) traffic flows from Cropwell Bishop towards Nottingham are over 400 vehicles per hour compared with flows of \naround 150\n vehicles per hour outside peak times.  If direct commuter buses were availab\nle, a proportion of the peak time private vehicle journeys would be eliminated.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The Solution14. \nThe solution\n is to integrate our public transportation systems.  This will never happen if left to the vagaries and \ncommercial \ninterests \nof the private opera\ntors and therefore a form of regulation is required.  \n&#xa0;\n15. \nAn appropriate approach would be (as for London buses and the various railway concessions) for the bus companies to tender for local area concessions which would require them to run certain commut\ner, shopper and \nevening \nleisure services for the surrounding semi rural areas (such as Cropwell Bishop and the villages in the Vale of Belvoir) alongside their regular \ncommercial \nservices to the more populated centres (such as Cotgrave and Bingham).\n \n An ex\nample of \npossible area concessions for South East Nottingham\n is presented \nin the Appendix.\n In the case of the ‘Cotgrave’ concession, 6 buses would provide an adequate day time, off peak service\n for the area\n, instead of the\n \n13 used\n during the competitive ‘b\nus wars’\n. \n(Since Liquidation of Premiere, Currently 5 buses running + 1 on route 50 (route 53 abandoned\n for present\n))\n&#xa0;\n16. \nThe Local Authorities are under severe pressure to save money by cutting subsidised rural bus services.  The fact that \ntwo\n (or even temporarily 3) bus operators are able to profit from \nservice provision on the Nottingham – Cotgrave \n (\nand Nottingham –Bingham\n)\n route is indicative that there if the route were assigned to one operator there would be sufficient surplus profit to s\nubsidise the extension of the service to the less populated village areas. \n(Trent Barton currently run as sole operator with full buses making healthy profits!)\n.\n \nRegulation \nby\n the award of area concessions to operators by competitive tender would \nseem to b\ne the best way forward to help\n fund the necessary semi rural routes with reduced cost to the public purse.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;City Integration17. \nLooking more widely at the integration of services, it is not necessary to run all buses into Nottingham.  With the much im\nproved passenger information and bus location controls now available, timetabled connecting services from the populated centres to the rural villages are perfectly feasible.  \n&#xa0;\n18. \nWithin Nottingham itself not all buses need cross or circulate the city.  T\noo many buses are currently clogging our city streets \nfor example \nat \nParliament Street\n and \nFriar Lane\n (\nMarket Square\n)\n.\n  \nA free \nC\nentre\n L\nink has already been introduced and this is the right approach. \n \nSuggestions have been made to Nottingham City Council (C\nhris Carter) for further development of the free link \nwith \n(electric?) \nbuses running in \ntwo circuits\n every few minutes between key bus stations\n (hubs)\n \nwhere the radial routes can terminate.\n \n&#xa0;\n19. \nProvision of the free centre link alongside the partial regu\nlation and letting of area concessions as suggested will mean that operators do not have to compete for passengers.  Only selected key routes need complete the city loops and operators \ncould ther\ne\nby\n save some 10 – 15 minutes on many journeys.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Some Broader Suggestions for Transport Integration and Usage.\n20. \nThe improvement of the A453 between Nottingham and the M1 and East Midland airport is a high priority\n and \na\nfter much local pressure this scheme is now under construction.\n \nIt was \nunfortunate for th\ne region \nthat the previous government chose to throw ‘fiscal stimulus’\n \nmoney at the lower priority, over priced, \n‘\nover engineered\n’\n A46 Newark to Widmerpool scheme with its overscaled earthworks at Str\na\ngglethorpe and Saxondale resulting in unnecessary loss \nof valuable agricultural land\n and poor energy efficiency (more fuel\n used\n, higher CO\n2\n \nemissions\n) for vehicles using the \nnew\n junctions\n. \nWhilst giving local benefits such as improved\n, safer\n access to Newark and Leicester, \nthe somewhat blinkered design of the A46 improvement has done little to help regional traffic flows \nand integrated transport \n– the A52 traffic into Nottingham is still delayed\n!\n  \n&#xa0;\n21. \nThe Nottingham tram extension out towards the M1\n is currently under cons\ntruction.   \nInvestment in the tram is fine for the areas it serves but it has to be recognised that \nmany areas such as \nSouth East Nottingham \ngain\n no direct benefit\n.  \nPriority should therefore be given to improvement of bus and other transportation services\n in these areas.\n&#xa0;\n22. \nWhilst the \nproposed \nHS2 may be \nsome\n help for travel between our main cities (assuming it is affordable to all) it will not address the \nneeds for \nregular inter\n-\ncity\n and \ninter\n-\ntown\n travel or the needs of travel to and from the more isol\nated communities.\n  The options of longer trains, longer platforms at certain key stations and revised signalling should be carefully explored to increase capacity where overcrowding \non the current rail network \nreally is an issue.\n&#xa0;\n23. \nW\nhere existing rail c\nonnections are poor, there would seem to be\n much scope for a\nn improved\n network of intercity\n/intertown\n buses, attractively priced to draw travellers away from the private car.  When more than one person is travelling the car tends to be the obvious \n‘value f\nor money’ \nchoice. \n \nA \n‘partner’\n rail/bus card could enable a partner to travel at say half fare to make the public transport journey more \nfinancially \nattractive\n for the pair of travellers\n?\n&#xa0;\n24. \nArriving in a town or city by public transport the traveller ne\neds good information for onward connections.  Perhaps subsidised taxi fares are appropriate for some rural locations\n where demand for bus services is very low?\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion25. \nI cannot see an efficient integrated transportation system developing within a\n free market economy.  Transport\nation\n is too important for the economic future of our country to be left to commercial interests alone.  It is therefore necessary to plan and regulate services at a national\n, regional\n and local level\n \nso that \nunnecessary dup\nlication is avoided and \nsurplus profits from commercial operations in the more populated areas are directed towards supporting provision of \nvital\n transportation in the less populated areas. \n&#xa0;\n26. \nAs\n concluded at the ICE sponsored, HS2 workshop on 6\nth\n April\n 2011\n,\n \nif this expensive scheme is to proceed, \nit must be developed within a system of improved integrated transportation for the whole nation.\n  ‘Connectivity’ is the key buzzword.\n&#xa0;\n27. \nAt a local level for a village such as Cropwell Bishop, access to \n(and\n usage of) \nan East Midlands \nHS2 \nstation \nwill be rather limited.\n \nI\nt is far more important\n \nfor\n residents of the local area\n to \nhave\n attractive direct commuter buses which could \ncut 15 minutes off \nthe\n \ncurrent 45 minute journey\n time into \nNottingham\n.  Improvemen\nts of this sort can be \nachieved at very small costs\n if available resources are redirected as suggested by partial regulation and licensing of local area \nconcessions\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAPPENDIX\n 1\nSUGGESTED AREA CONCESSIONS
