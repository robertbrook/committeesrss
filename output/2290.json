W\ne\n welcom\ne\n the opportunity to \nprovide this submission to the Committee and respond \nto questions most relevant to PWYP’s \nmandate \nas a coalition working for transparency and accountability in the extractive industries.\n \nTh\ne\n sub\nmission was drafted by PWYP UK’s Coordinator\n, \nMiles Litvinoff\n (\nmlitvinoff@pwypuk.org), \ncirculated among PWYP UK members for comment\n and \nrevised in light of comments received.\n&#xa0;\nExecutive summary and recommendations&#xa0;\nRecommenda\nt\nions \n&#xa0;\n1. What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? 1\n.1\n \n \nPWYP is concerned that the \neconomic \ncontribution of EI\n in the UK and other countries \nis \nnot as \npositive \nas it \nsh\nould be. \nGlobally, corruption and other aspects of the widely documented “resource curse”\n \n(or better: “resource challenge)\n, \nincluding \neconomic “\nexternalities\n”\n,\n are reco\ngnised \nas \nwide-scale \nand largely socialised\n in terms of costs\n, i.e. \ncosts are \nborne by society at large including in the UK.\n \nBy contrast, EI profits are excessively privatised, including through \nexploitative contractual terms with some host countries (which ultimately impact on the UK through the effects of global \npoverty and poor resource governance), \nthe use of profit shifting through transfer mispricing\n, secret deals,\n and the use of secretive shell companies and tax havens\n – the latter including UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1\n.2  \nT\nhe world’s \nt\nen \nlargest extractive companies, including \nLondon\n-listed BP, Shell, \nGlencore \nXstrata, \nRio Tinto, BHP\n \nBilliton\n and \nAnglo American\n, are reported as \nown\ning and controlling more than \n6,\n000\n separate companies\n, at least a third of which are \nincorporated in \ntax \ns\necrecy \nj\nurisdictions\n (tax havens)\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3\n  \nRecommendation\n: To address concerns about \nprofit shifting, transfer mispricing\n, secret deals\n and the use of secretive shell companies and tax havens, \nThe\n UK \nGovernment \nshould implement an open public registry of beneficial ownership for all UK-listed and \nUK-\nregistered companies\n,\n and with other countries take speedy and effective action to curtail profit shifting and the use of tax secrecy jurisdictions \n(tax \nhavens\n) \n– inc\nluding among them UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies – and \nensure \npubli\ncation of all EI contracts and licences\n.\n&#xa0;2. What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?2\n.1  Besides the “externalities” referred to \nin \npara \n1.1, \nwhich include negative environmental and human rights impacts, EI are associated\n in resource-rich developing countries \nwith corruption\n, \n \ncapital flight \nand \nsimilar \naspects of the “resource curse”\n (“resource challenge”)\n, which across all economic sectors \ncost Africa an \nestimated $854bn from 1970 to 2008.\n \n&#xa0;\n2\n.2  Corporate governance co\nncerns about EI companies listed \nand registered \nin the UK\n, and \nreputational risks for the UK and \nfor \nUK financial institutions\n,\n \nare considerable and \nwill remain \nsignificant and in some cases high \nfor \nas long as the EI globally exhibit a lack of \ntransparency and accountability\n and do not visibly contribute to equitable and sustainable patterns of economic development.\n \nAn estimated \n1.6 billion people\n live in resource-rich developing countries, of whom at present approximately \n640m or 40%\n li\nve \non l\ness than \n$2 a \nday\n (a higher proportion than \nin resource\n-\npoor countries\n)\n, while EI senior executives earn \nfar more than is reasonable\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2\n.3  \nUK-listed EI companies and UK financial institutions will \ntherefore \nbe associated with a sense of injustice on the part of \nhundreds of thousands of \ncitizens of resource-rich developing countries unless and until UK-listed\n/registered \ncompanies are clearly \nand comprehensively proven \nto be contributing\n \nequitabl\ny\n and sustainab\nl\ny \nto host-country economies through payment of \nappropriate levels of \ntaxes, royalties, etc.\n, for the non-renewable natural resource they extract. \n&#xa0;\n2.4  \nRecommendation\n: \nThe UK Government should ensure s\npeedy and effective implementation of the EU Accounting \nDirective \n(Chapter 10: \ncountry-by-country reporting of payments to governments\n)\n \nand \nthe \nTransparency Directive\n, and as soon as possible implement the Directives with \nopen and \nmachine-readable data ac\ncording to the \nG8 \nOpen Data Charter.\n \nIn addition, EI financial transparency in the UK and EU needs to be accompanied by the establishment of a global mandatory EI financial transparency standard\n, i.e. equivalent disclosure rules in all major jurisdictions\n and capital markets, \nand to lead to effective EI financial accountability, including \nregarding company \nbeneficial ownership and contract transparency as noted in \npara \n1.\n3\n above, \nwith \nempowered and informed civil society in resource-rich developing countri\nes able to hold companies and their governments to account for natural resource revenues. \n&#xa0;3. Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?3\n.1  \nTo date there has not been \nsufficient constructive \nengagement between UK \nEI \ncompanies \nand NGO\ns\n. \nIn PWYP’s experience, EI companies have engag\ned\n \nonly \nvery reluctantly in initiatives that \nenhance transparency and accountability, \noften alleging \n– but failing to satisfactorily substantiate – cost, \nconfidentiality, competitiveness and \nsupposed \ncriminal liability as reasons why they cannot become more transparent and accountable. \n&#xa0;\n3.2  However, there have been differences between min\ning and oil companies in this regard, and among oil companies. \nAmong the larger companies, m\nin\ners\n have \nappeared \nmore willing to \nrecognise and implement the emerging global mandatory transparency standard \nthan have oil companies, \nalthough \namong UK oil companies one smaller company has \nalready \nembrace\nd\n financial transparency on a \nproactive and \nvoluntary basis. \n&#xa0;\n3\n.3  PWYP has concerns about the fact that \nUK-listed \nand UK-registered EI multinational companies \nthat belong to the American Petro\nleum Institute (API) have not dissociated themselves from\n, and therefore can be considered to support,\n the API\n’s\n law suit in the US \nagainst the SEC’s rules for Dodd-Frank Section 1504 (country-by-country reporting of payments to governments\n, equivalent to \nthe EU Directives’ requirements).\n&#xa0;\n3.4  S\nome \nEI companies\n \nhave been \nlobbying to delay and/or weaken UK and EU implementation of the Accounting and Transparency Directive\ns, such as by pleading the need for specific country \nexemptions\n and/or alleging compet\nitiveness concerns in light of delays in US implementation of Dodd-Frank Section 1504 following the API court case, which the companies themselves instigated. All this despite the UK Government’s and the G8’s public commitment to see these Directives speed\nily and fully implemented.\n PWYP regards this as a lack of good faith on the part of such companies, which claim to champion transparency and to obey the law wherever they operate.\n&#xa0;\n3.5  \nRecommendation\n: The UK Government should make it clear to EI companie\ns that a \nglobal mandatory transparency standard, without \nany country \nreporting exemptions, is here to stay and that it will not \nconsider special pleading \non the part of EI companies on alleged competition, confidentiality, cost or other grounds\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4. What is the impact on the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?4\n.1  PWYP has called for the UK to sign up to the EITI for\n \nsome years and sees this as a positive step. As \nthe initiator of the EITI, the UK’s commitment \nto\n \nimplement\n helps address \nobjections\n \nthat the EITI has been yet another instance of the global North \ntelling\n the South what to do. \nIt will also provide a forum in which \nUK \ncivil society can, \npotentially\n, dialogue constructively with industry and government.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2  \nThere is\n a\n need for \nUK EITI \ndelivery to match the rhetoric\n about the UK “getting its house in order”. \nAlthough\n, unlike Norway, the UK failed to invest proceeds from its North Sea oil \nbonanza\n in long-term \nfunding\n for pensions \nand \nother public goods,\n \nthe UK needs a well-informed public\n debate about \nresource sustainability, \nprogress towards a low-carbon economy\n and the entrenchment of transparency as a national norm.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.3  \nT\nhe UK \nshould \nimplement the EITI to a high standard. Anything less will reflect negatively on the UK’s reputation as\n a champion of \nEI \ngood governance. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.4\n \n \nRe\nc\nommen\nd\na\nt\nio\nn\n:  The UK Government should ensure that the UK \npilot\ns\n the EITI‘s \nrecommendation \nfor \nbeneficial ownership public transparency; \nensure \nfull EI contract transparency in the UK; \nthrough the multi-stakeholder group \nsupport “\ncapacity-building efforts, especially with civil society and through\n \ncivil society organisations, to increase awareness of the process, improve\n \nunderstanding of the information and data from the \nreports, and enc\nourage\n \nuse of the information\n”; and as soon as possible implement \nthe EITI \nwith \nopen and \nmachine-readable data.\n \n&#xa0;\n5. Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?5\n.1  \nThe UK should apply \nproportionate\n and effective \nregulation\n to UK-listed \nand UK-registered \nEI companies\n,\n irrespective of potential or alleged effects on \ncompetition\n. \nAttempting\n to benefit from anything resembling a “race to the bottom” \nwould\n be a poor approach for the UK to \ntake\n and undermine its \ninternational\n moral authority\n in this area\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.2  \nPrompt\n,\n \ncomprehensive\n \nand effective \nimplementation\n of the \nAccounting\n and Transparenc\ny \nDirectives\n, \nas noted above, \ncan and should \nimprove\n \nthe UK as a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3  \nRe\nc\nommen\nd\na\nt\nio\nn\n:\n \nThe UK’s \nenforcement\n regime under Article 51 of the \nAccounting\n \nDirective\n \nneeds to \nbe seen to be \neffective.\n \nThis requires adequate Government resourcing of scrutiny of company reports under the Directives and sufficient penalties to \ndeter \nmisreporting.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n23 September 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n “Extractive industries” are abbreviated to ”EI” throughout this submission.\n US$ 2.15 trillion as the “cost of environmental damage caused by the world’s 3,000 largest publicly-listed companies in 2008” – UN \nEnvironment\n Programme Finance Initiative and Principles for Responsible Investment, \nUniversal Ownership: Why Environmental E\nxternalities Matter to Institutional Investors\n, 2010, http://www.unpri.org/viewer/?file=files/6728_ES_report_environmental_externalities.pdf, p.2.\n PWYP Norway, \nPiping Profits\n, 2011, http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/sites/publishwhatyoupay.org/files/FINAL\n%20pp%20norway.pdf; see also \nChristian Aid, \nMultinational Corporations and the Profit-Shifting Lure of Tax Havens\n, 2013, http://www.christianaid.org.uk/images/ca-op-9-multinational-corporations-tax-havens-march-2013.pdf\n \nAccording to \nthe new Extractive In\ndustries Transparency Initiative (EITI)\n \nStandard\n, p\nublic beneficial ownership registries are recommended and \nwill \nbe piloted, and contract transparency is encouraged\n: \nhttp://eiti.org/document/standard\n Africa Progress Panel, \nEquity in Extractives: \nStewarding Africa’s natural resources for all\n, 2013, http://africaprogresspanel.org/en/publications/africa-progress-report-2013; European Centre for Development Policy  Management, \nFrom Curse to Purse: Making Extractive Resources Work for Development\n, 2012\n, http://www.ecdpm.org/Web_ECDPM/Web/Content/Download.nsf/0/6A371689F627EFF1C1257AA00049445D/$FILE/DP136_Final%20Layout.pdf\n See e.g. \n“\nEuropean Investment Bank halts loans to Glencore\n”\n, May 2011, www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/may/31/eib-halts-loans-to-\nglencore; “BP, Cobalt cases in Angola show why the oil sector needs tougher transparency rules”, February 2012,  http://www.globalwitness.org/node/7934; “Global Witness comment in relation to [Shell Oil] Nigerian OPL-245 oil deal”, July 2013, http://www.gl\nobalwitness.org/library/global-witness-comment-relation-nigerian-opl-245-oil-deal \n Former Shell CEO \nvan der Veer \nsaid on retiring in 2009:\n \n“[I\nf I had been paid 50% more, I would not have done \n[the job] \nbetter.
