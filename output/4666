defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;defaultThe LGA supports greater 
defaultautonomy for schools as a way of driving up standards. We believe that giving frontline professionals the freedom to innovate and respond to the needs and priorities of local children and young people and their families will improve educational attainment 
defaultand overall outcomes. We have called for greater devolution of power from the Government to councils and would not want to deny schools greater freedom.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have encouraged councils to play a more strategic role and to work with all local schools
default, 
defaultincludin
defaultg the in
defaultcreasing numbers of academies, 
defaultto drive improvement; promote fair access; support pupils with Special Educational Needs; and ensure there are sufficient school places at a time of sharply increasing demand. Councils across the country have also sup
defaultported a greater role for school-to-school improvement in improving educational outcomes for children and young people
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we have argued that
default,
default as schools are given more freedom, it becomes more important that they are effectively held to account a
defaultnd swift action is taken in the case of underperformance. As more schools take responsibility for their own admissions
default,
default it is also vital that admissions are fair, and seen to be fair, particularly for the most disadvantaged children and young people and th

default. The Education Funding Agency 
default(EFA) 
defaultestimates that an additional 417,000 primary school places will be needed over the lifetime of the current Parliament and councils face an enormous challenge in providing these places in time and with limited 
defaultcapital resources. 
defaultU
defaultntil now, the majority of places have been provided by expanding existing schools because this is the most cost-effective way of providing new places.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, as the room for expansions is exhausted, councils are concerned that the p
defaultrocess of building new schools will be hampered by the ‘academies presumption’ which places all the final decisions about new schools in the hands of the Secretary of State and 
defaultDepartment for Education
default-approved academy sponsors. We believe this hampers eff
defaultective local decision-making and partnership working with schools and sponsors. In many cases
default,
default it is likely 
defaultto override the input of local parents and local communities. It is not sustainable to continue to remove decision-making from councils in this way.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe would like to see the restoration of decision-making on 
defaultthe 
defaultprovision of new schools to local level, as it was prior to the Academies Act 2011. 
defaultCouncils need the flexibility to deliver whatever new type of school is required to fulfil their statutory 
defaultduty to offer places and to contribute to the local education offer
default. 
defaultThis 
defaultmay
default include the option of establishing community schools if that is the locally preferred option. Where academies are the preferred option, decisions about sponsors should be taken locally to meet the needs and wishes of local parents and communities.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe pr
defaultocess for establishing and funding free schools is completely outside the control of local councils, although councils are increasingly trying to engage potential free school sponsors to make sure that new schools are established in areas of need. 
defaultThe Depa
defaultrtment for Education (DfE)
default have said that they are taking local need into account 
defaultmore 
defaultin making decisions about free schools. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultwe would like councils to be given a greater role in judging and approving free school proposals to 
defaultensure 
defaultthat new free
default schools are established where they are needed and in a way that supports councils in their place planning duties.

defaultThe role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expanddefaults; and the functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what defaultgaps there are in sudefaultpport for schools at this leveldefault.default&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently there is a two-tier system of school accountability. Local councils have oversight of the performance and finances of maintained schools. They have powers to intervene in the case of underperformance and to direct them to take individual pupils t
defaulto support local fair access protocols. However, they do not have these powers for academies – these rest with the Secretary of State for Education and 
defaultthe 
defaultEFA.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthis two-tier system might have been viable while there were low numbers of academies, 
defaulthowever 
defaultwe do not believe that the 
defaultDfE
default has either the capacity or the local knowledge and connection to exercise effective oversight of standards and financial propriety in a situation where the majority of secondary schools and a growing number of primary schools
default are now academies.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe DfE’s recent adver
defaulttisements for 
defaultRegional 
defaultSchools 
defaultCommissioners to exercise the Secretary of State’s powers in relation to underperforming academies are an acknowledgement that the current arrangements are no longer sustainable. How
defaultever, we do not believe that th
defaultey
default 
defaultare
default a sustainable long-term solution either. A region is too big an area to carry out detailed oversight of the performance and financial propriety of schools. If all 24,000 schools become academies, rather than the curren
defaultt 3,500, then a middle tier at the level of a council is likely to have to be re-introduced.
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that the R
defaultegional 
defaultCommissioners 
defaultwill 
defaultadd
default a new confusing layer of bureaucracy for parents
default. The regions covered by the Regional Commissioners do not alig
defaultn with the standard regions, and London will be split in three by the new regions, which will confuse parents who are familiar with the standard regions. 
default Furthermore, i
defaultt is unlikely they 
defaultwill 
defaultbe able to raise their concerns about a local primary school wi
defaultth a
default R
defaultegional 
defaultCommissioner which
default might be hundreds of miles away, in the same way as they do with the local council. 
defaultI
defaultt is unlikely that the 
defaultR
defaultegional 
defaultCommissioner 
defaultwill be able to deal with all the issues a parent is likely to raise – they are likely to hav
defaulte to refer them back to the 
defaultEFA
default, the DfE or to the local council.
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Ofsted framework for inspection of council school improvement support, introduced in June 2013, makes clear that councils are expected to have a role in driving and supporting improvemen
defaultt in all local schools, including academies. In support of this, Ofsted point to Section 13A of the Education Act 1996. This places a duty on councils to exercise their relevant education functions with a view to promoting high standards. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith the increasing number of academies, we do not think it is sustainable for oversight of, and intervention in, failing academies and free schools to rest with the Secretary of State or with regional bureaucrats. We do not believe it is reasonable for Of
defaultsted to hold councils accountable for performance in academies when they have no funding or powers in this area. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultParents ask for clear accountability in order to ensure swift action when issues arise during their child's 
defaultone opportunity to get a good 
defaultedu
defaultcation
default. The
default proliferation of different agencies with different areas of responsibility and improvement offers puts this at risk. Parents with concerns will be faced with dealing with local and national Ofsted offices, their local council, and 
defaultpotentially 
defaulta
default Regional School Commissioner
default. 
defaultC
defaultouncils responding to their concerns may have to engage the DfE, the EFA, regional and national Ofsted and a Regional School Commissioner. This is not an efficient way of supporting improved standards.
default&#xa0;
default2.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that counc
defaultils, as local champions of children and young people, their families and their communities
default,
default are best placed to provide the local oversight needed to continue to drive up standards and ensure that all children and young people have fair access to a good loc
defaultal school
default.  
defaultWe think that councils should have the same powers in relation to 
defaultall
default local schools to intervene in cases of underperformance or designation in an Ofsted ‘category of concern’, including the power to select new academy sponsors.

default, 
defaultparticularly in supporting school-to-school improvement and providing additional capacity for severely underperforming schools. However, if councils

defaultto be inspected by Ofsted, we th
defaultink academy chains should also be open to inspection 
defaulton 
defaultthe support they provide for schools in their chain. 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultacademy chains, as proprietors, have too close an interest in their own schools to replace the current role of councils as champions o

defaultThe appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply; and what evidence there is that academy statudefaults can bring value for money either for individual primary schoodefaultls or for the system as a wholedefault&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are concerned that many primary schools are just too small to become stand-alone converter academies. We have called for a radical rewiring of public service
defaults
default which will allow decision-making for public services to be brought together in one place. We argue that what people want more than anything else is for services to be built and integrated around the needs of children and their families, not around build
defaultings, institutions and wasteful bureaucracy. 
defaultTherefore, 
defaultwe do not believe that a fragmentation of the school sector into more than 24,000 separate public service units will promote value-for money in spending of public money, particularly if accountability
default lies with the Secretary of State 
defaultfor Education or remote R
defaultegional 
defaultCommissioners
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany primary schools rely heavily on the central services procured and provided by councils and would not have the desire
default or 
defaultcapacity to negotiate a good deal for the taxp
defaultayer with other suppliers. 
defaultOur concern is that too many primary schools lack the scale to provide efficiently the range of services that they need
default. 
defaultOne solution is for smaller primary schools to federate 
defaultwhich
default is likely to be a more sustainable arrangement than individual primary schools becom
defaulting
default academies.

default&#xa0; 
defaultCouncils need the flexibility to make whatever arrangements are
default required to deliver improvement, engaging the resources of the local education community and outside support whether through a sponsored arrangement or a federation.  
defaultWe believe that federations, mergers and partnerships with other high-performing schools
default in an area offer an alternative to sponsored academy status, if that is the preference of governors, local parents and children.
