[normal]&#xa0;[bold]FOIL[bold] (The Forum of Insurance Lawyers) exists to provide a forum for communication and the exchange of information between lawyers acting predominantly or exclusively for insurance clients (except legal expenses insurers) within firms of solicitors, as barriste
[normal]rs, or as in-house lawyers for insurers or self-insurers. FOIL is an active lobbying organisation on matters concerning insurance litigation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]FOIL[bold] represents over 8
[normal]000 members. It is the only organisation which represents solicitors who act for defendant
[normal]s in civil proceedings.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is already recognised, by a ban on the practice by CMCs, that it is undesirable for potential claimants to be offered an
[normal] immediate inducement to bring a claim. Inevitably some claimants will be encouraged to make a fraudulent claim by the promise of an immediate benefit, before they have had a chance to think through the consequences of such a step. FOIL believes that the b
[normal]an should be extended to law firms to completely outlaw this practice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When asked during the course of giving oral evidence to the Committee, what compensation would be appropriate for a whiplash injury, James Dalton
[normal] from the ABI replied that it was “
[normal]whatever society determines is the right amount which will then be built into insurance premiums
[normal]”. FOIL would suggest that, bearing in mind the heavy burden claims place on motorists and the current concerns ove
[normal]r the high cost of living, 
[normal]society may reasonably consider that the current level of compensation for whiplash claims is adequate. Without intervention the level of damages
[normal] set out in the Judicial College
[normal] Guidelines
[normal] 
[normal]will contin
[normal]u
[normal]e to rise. 
[normal]FOIL 
[normal]would sugges
[normal]t that steps should be taken to ensure that, 
[normal]for a
[normal] period, damages 
[normal]in low value RTA claims 
[normal]should not rise further. 
[normal] This is a matter which ultimately will need to be considered by the judiciary but FOIL would welcome the Committee’s examination of the iss
[normal]ue.
