[[[&#xa0;]]]I write on behalf of GLPG to express support for the proposal by GLEAM dated 19 Aug 2013 concerning an appeal provision for TROs.  We rely on the reasons already given and have nothing to add.&#xa0;GLPG has already lodged a submission dated 21 August 2013 in support of the proposals by PDGLA for reclassification of UUCRs and unsealed BOATs as restricted byways. &#xa0;GLPG now offers evidence (attached) of the damage caused by off-roading on green lanes, notably in cases where TROs have been refused by the local authority.  Four photographs are attached.&#xa0;Graham Plumbe  Vice Chairman&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;27 August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Sarn Helen, Powys (old Roman road) - claimed as BOAT - 21.12.05
