[normal]Written evidence from the 
[normal]Enterprise M3 Local Enterprise Partnership
[normal] (LTD0007)
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Response of [bold]Enterprise[bold] M3 Local [bold]Enterprise[bold] Partnership (LEP)[bold] to T[bold]ransport Select Committee call for evidence on local decision-making on transport expenditure[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for 
[normal]the opportunity to submit evidence to the Committee.  
[normal]The 
[normal]Enterprise M3 
[normal]LEP broadl
[normal]y welcomes the devolving of decision-making about transport expenditure, on Major Transport Schemes, part of the Integrated Transport Capital Block and Local Sustainable Transport Fund (Capital) from central Government down to the LEP level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The rationale for such reforms would be to help ensure that capital expenditure on transport infrastructure via the Local Growth Fund (LGF) is gea
[normal]red towards those interventions that make the greatest contribution towards economic growth and improving competitiveness. This can be through infrastructure that helps to unlock development sites, tackle congestion or improve journey time reliability. The
[normal] LEP is articulating through emerging Strategic Economic Plans (SEPs) its priorities for transport infrastructure improvements and investment, which is based on dialogue with the business community, Local Transport Authorities (LTAs) and other key partners
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The key advantage is that decision-making on prioritising and allocating funding towards Major Transport Schemes from 2015/2016 onwards and Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) 
[normal]capital will now be made at a more local level when compared to the previous centralised system of bids being assessed and approved/managed by the Department for Transport (DfT).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Placing the decision-making powers for these funding streams locally, then pooling these funds together with 50% of Integrated Transport Capital Block funding previously awarded to LTAs into the  Local Growth Fund has the advantage that it will mean the LG
[normal]F can be more effective and deliver more ‘bang for its buck’. The Growth Deals to be negotiated between each LEP and central Government will determine the total amount of LGF that LEPs receive.  The competitive element, whereby the best SEPs are rewarded b
[normal]y more funding in broadly welcomed, so long as it is objectively applied and encourages innovation and new approaches to delivery.  By pooling funding for investment in transport into the LGF (alongside funding for skills and housing), the LEP and our part
[normal]ners will be able to deliver more interventions geared towards supporting job creation and new development than would otherwise be possible. It will also help to maximise the opportunities for levering in more third party investment, thereby increasing the
[normal] total value of investment in infrastructure. This greater quantum of investment will benefit the economy by increasing the volume of construction employment – both for the intervention itself and within associated development sites unlocked. Once complete
[normal]d, the additional transport network capacity will help to persuade 
[normal]businesses already based in the area to stay, and invest or expand – given they can reap the rewards and cost savings arising from improved connectivity, access to a larger pool of skilled 
[normal]labour, more predictable journey times and a reduction in the cost to them of congestion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP welcomes the moves towards meaningful devolution of central government funding which will happen through the introduction of the £2billion-a-year LGF from 20
[normal]15/16 onwards. The LEP notes that disappointingly the LGF is six times smaller in size than was recommended by Lord Heseltine in his report 
[normal]“No Stone Unturned in pursuit of Growth”
[normal] – which suggested that this fund should be allocated £12 billion a year. Ne
[normal]vertheless it is a starting point, and the challenge now for LEPs is to prove that the funding boosts economic growth through job creation, investment and improved mobility of labour. Efforts to lobby the Government to expand the size of the LGF funding po
[normal]t will be made easier with tangible and clear evidence based on experience of LGF delivery.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Making decisions on funding at a local level will ensure that there are closer links between priorities and local strategies, such as Local Transport Plans and L
[normal]ocal Plans.  It will also make it easier to secure local buy in from key stakeholders and businesses.  The EM3 LEP has recently completed a survey of the transport and investment priorities of some 300 local business and we will be able to ensure that the 
[normal]proposed investment plans link closely to their key issues of addressing congestion, improving network reliability and improving transport links to major attractors such as Central London and Heathrow Airport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In terms of risks or downsides, through the G
[normal]rowth Deals process, it is important that the Government does not over-prescribe how the LGF funds can be used. The more detail that is given, the less freedom is likely to be available to respond to opportunities. There is a risk that too much prescriptio
[normal]n will undermine and reduce the benefits of devolution. Excessive rules or requirements from Government will curtail and limit the scope for innovation which could mean that LEPs miss out on opportunities to lever in greater private sector match funding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]LEP also acknowledges that these changes to funding could mean that some transport schemes that contribute towards quality of life or environmental objectives that do not offer a clear and tangible link to supporting the economy and job creation may fi
[normal]nd it harder to secure funding in the future. This risk would be mitigated by the fact that LTAs could prioritise spending from their remaining 50% of ITB resources on projects that deliver on these kinds of objectives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An approac
[normal]h of using the Growth Deals process to deliver devolution of decision-making powers and responsibilities to LEPs is viewed by the LEP as a sound model for helping to support economic growth and improve competitiveness of the EM3 LEP area. By pooling togeth
[normal]er three previously separate funding streams for transport (major schemes funding, 50% of Integrated Transport Block (ITB) funding and LSTF capital funding) into the LGF, these resources can be targeted appropriately towards investment in infrastructure in
[normal] those areas within each LEP that are the local “engines of growth”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through the Growth Deals process, it is important that the Government avoids taking an over-prescriptive approach on how the LGF funding can be used by LEPs. 
[normal]Governance requirements shou
[normal]ld be proportionate and not overly bureaucratic, and the stipulation and use of ring-fences should be avoided. LEPs are best placed to determine the priorities for LGF investment within their areas free from interference.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Enterprise M3 LEP works closely in partnership with Hampshire and Surrey County Councils in the prioritisation and asses
[normal]sment of local transport schemes. Both LTAs have strong track records of delivery of local transport schemes, so the LEP has full confidence in their capability to deliver schemes that are awarded LGF funding. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP has a strong focus on delivery of ec
[normal]onomic growth. The LEP has a small core team with a strong economic and regeneration background. It would not be cost effective to employ a dedicated in-house team to manage the assessment, prioritisation of local transport schemes. Therefore the LEP has c
[normal]hosen to make use of secondments and partnership working to draw on the technical skills and transport planning expertise of professionals employed by both LTAs to assist the LEP in prioritising and assessing schemes.  Where impartial independent expert vi
[normal]ew is necessary, then LEP will utilise the expertise of external transport consultants as appropriate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The optimum delivery body within the EM3 LEP area is for the LEP to award LGF funding for priority inter
[normal]ventions and schemes to the relevant LTA to deliver. The LEP will monitor delivery against key programme milestones. In other metropolitan areas, delivery through PTEs/ ITAs would be the optimum arrangement. Each LTA has already in place sound financial an
[normal]d programme management functions which will be able to monitor, manage and report against progress with delivery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At present most LEPs 
[normal]or LTAs recognise that there are occasions when it is in their best interests to collaborate with neighbours to prioritise and deliver major schemes that either cross boundaries or have wider regional impacts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the EM3 LEP area, there are a number of ex
[normal]amples of major schemes that are either located on the LEP boundary, or where the economic benefits unlocked by a proposed major scheme located within our LEP area would be shared with other LEPs. For example, a proposal to alleviate congestion at a key bo
[normal]ttleneck on the A31 at Ringwood within the south west part of the EM3 LEP area would help deliver significant benefits to the Dorset LEP area. The funding contributions would come largely from the Highways Agency, with the LEP potentially making a local co
[normal]ntribution consummate to the scale of the economic benefits that each stands to gain from the improvement in journey time reliability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LEPs should be free to collaborate and where appropriate form clusters or groupings to address issues of common interest
[normal] that cross LEP boundaries. Applying this to transport schemes, the nature of collaboration and the grouping may vary depending on the project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We can offer an example of how this is already happening. EM3 LEP has recently collaborated with Thames Valley 
[normal]Berkshire LEP, Oxfordshire LEP and Buckinghamshire Thames Valley LEP to jointly commission work on the economic contribution of Heathrow airport to our combined area. This research was able to quantify the direct and indirect benefits derived by proximity 
[normal]to Heathrow, and feed this work into the Airports Commission. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP welcomes the recent commitment by the Government to commission a study to look at Southern Rail access to Heathrow Airport, as we believe this would make a significant contribution to 
[normal]economic growth. We will pro-actively seek to engage with this study, working closely with neighbouring LEPs such as Thames Valley Berkshire where our interests align.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP cannot speak for areas outside of the EM3 LEP area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Within the EM3 LEP area, there are strong relationships with both LTAs and with district and borough councils. The EM3 LEP has sought to develop strong relationship
[normal]s with the Department for Transport, the Highways Agency (HA) and Network Rail. The LEP regularly holds engagement will these bodies via Transport Action Group meetings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These sessions provide very effective mechanisms for information sharing, and a fram
[normal]ework for fostering closer partnership working between the LEP, LTAs and the DfT, HA and Network Rail. This regular dialogue is helping to enable the development and delivery of transport infrastructure projects to be managed in a strategic, coherent and j
[normal]oined-up way. The DfT, HA and Network Rail recognise the value of attending these regular meetings, and the benefits of co-operating at the sub-regional level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP would recommend that other LEPs give consideration to setting up similar mechanisms fo
[normal]r partnership working with the DfT/ HA and Network Rail.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP is not involved directly in the cu
[normal]rrent system of funding streams that are awarded to LTAs, and Hampshire and Surrey County Councils can make their own representations on this issue if they wish to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under future arrangements, provision of allocations to each LEP via the Local Growth
[normal] Fund, LTAs should benefit by having more certainty and confidence that they will be able to secure funding to deliver major transport schemes within their part of the EM3 LEP area, provided that their business cases are strong and meet LEP requirements fo
[normal]r supporting economic growth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The level of evidence required for inclusion within the five business cases under the current system is not necessarily proportionate to the value of the scheme. Recent changes to WebTAG guidance have partially remedied this
[normal], with less detail required within business cases for schemes between £2m and £5m in value. This more 
[normal]proportionate approach is welcomed, and this principle will be embedded in the EM3 approach from 2015/16 onwards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LTAs have indicated to us that under the current system requirements for local match funding are not always easy to achieve. In the current climate, LTAs are under considerable funding pressures, and major schemes require considerable up-front investment i
[normal]n feasibility, scheme development and business case preparation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP fully supports the decision by the Government to devolve funding and decision-making powers to LEPs for major schemes and LSTF capita grant as part of the LGF and pool this together with 50% of the ITB funding stream.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local Growth Deal awards to the EM3 via the LGF will be a mix of formula funding and a competitive element linked to the quality of our Strategic Economic Plan (SEP). This competitive element is in our view a positive thing so long as the true contribution
[normal] the LEP can make to the local economy is the basis upon which the funding allocations are made.  This should help to ensure that across all 39 LEPs, they are focussed on ensuring that the transport elements of the SEP are coherent and justifiable in terms
[normal] of how priority schemes contribute to delivery of economic growth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through the SEP development process, the EM3 LEP will prioritise the allocation of LGF resources towards those transport infrastructure schemes that contribute strongly towards unlocking
[normal] economic growth and improving competitiveness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Awarding significant sums of capital funding to the LEP to then allocate to transport schemes via the LGF could result in the majority of funding being concentrated in the vicinity of areas of planned develo
[normal]pment. It would then be up to LTAs how they use the resources that are within their own control leaving very little funding available to address transport priorities in other areas where due to designations, such as National Parks or environmental constrai
[normal]nts there is limited scope to accommodate new development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LTAs and District Councils within the EM3 LEP area have a strong track record of securing development-related contributions to deliver transport improvements associated with mitigating the impact of new development on the transport network. The introductio
[normal]n of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is expected to lead to a reduction in funding available to LTAs for this purpose, so will require closer partnerships with Local Planning Authorities (the District Councils). New Homes Bonus contributions now be
[normal]ing retained by Local Planning Authorities are likely to offer a useful source of local match funding contributions to support the delivery transport infrastructure schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the current challenging economic climate, it can be difficult to secure suffic
[normal]ient private sector investment in transport infrastructure or to provide up-front payments to deliver infrastructure in advance of building out development sites. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Initiatives such as the Growing Places Fund awarded to LEPs – which within the EM3 LEP area
[normal] is the Growing Enterprise Fund, has allowed the creation of a pump-priming fund, to deliver transport infrastructure that unlocks development sites, which the developer repays over time, which can then be re-invested in further transport infrastructure sc
[normal]hemes, the cost of which is also repaid over time. If scaled up, this sort of pump-priming mechanism has the potential to remove barriers to delivery of a number of strategic development sites.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Current local highway networks in the EM3 LEP area are seen a
[normal]s a vital asset on which businesses and markets depend for the movement of goods, services and labour. Both LTAs within the LEP area have prioritised and increased investment in highway maintenance through programmes of planned (rather than reactive) maint
[normal]enance. These programmes are expected to continue. The LEP welcomes bids to the LGF from the two LTAs that cover our area for structural maintenance schemes alongside other major scheme bids for new infrastructure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LEP would welcome steps by the Gover
[normal]nment to run further rounds of funding streams awarded via a competitive bidding process - such as Local Pinch Point Fund and Better Bus Area Fund. This would favour and reward those LTAs who have a strong track record of delivery of capacity improvements 
[normal]within short timescales and within budget.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LTAs have clear and robust systems in place for decision-making governance and assurance on major transport schemes. L
[normal]ines of accountability are transparent and well-understood.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The EM3 LEP has appointed Hampshire County Council to act as the accountable body, who receives, holds and manages all funding awarded to the LEP on behalf of the LEP. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of the dialogue 
[normal]with the Government over the Growth Deal for the EM3 LEP area, we will proposed an appropriate governance structure that  satisfies the Government that LGF funding will be allocated in a fair and transparent manner, and that appropriate systems and suitabl
[normal]e mechanisms will be in place for audit and scrutiny, thereby ensuring that public money is used appropriately.
