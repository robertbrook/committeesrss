[normal]Written evidence submitted by James Painter (CLC057)[bold]1. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism 
[normal](RISJ) 
[normal]is part of the Department of Politics and International Relations at 
[normal]the University of 
[normal]Oxford.  It was established in 
[normal]2006. The 
[normal]RISJ 
[normal]aims to serve as 
[normal]a
[normal] leading forum for a productive engagement between scholars from a wide range of disciplines and the practitioners of journalism.  It 
[normal]aims to 
[normal]bring the depth of academic scholarship to major i
[normal]ssues of relevance to the practice of 
[normal]the 
[normal]news media. 
[normal]2. The 
[normal]RISJ
[normal] regularly publishes reports and books on various issues affecting the media.  On the specific issue of climate change, it has published three recent works:  
[normal]Summoned by Science: Reporting C
[normal]limate Change at Copenhagen and Beyond
[normal] (2010); 
[normal]Poles Apart: the international reporting of climate scepticism 
[normal](2011); and 
[normal]Climate Change in the Media:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]reporting
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]risk and uncertainty
[normal] (forthcoming, September 2013).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]3. James Painter is the author of the abo
[normal]ve three publications.  In an individual capacity, he has als
[normal]o published extensively on the theme 
[normal]of climate change a
[normal]nd the media, including a
[normal] recent 
[normal]academic article on the relative presence of climate scepticism in the UK print media compared to the 
[normal]media in five other countries.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]He also teaches the 
[normal]MSc
[normal] module on the media and the environment at the School of Geography, Oxford University.
[normal]4. This submission focuses on the role that the UK media play in portraying climate change, the affect that this 
[normal]may have on public understanding, and recommendations that may help journalists, scientists and government bodies improve the communication of climate science.
[normal]5. The committee asks: [bold]Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and polic[bold]y? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?[bold]6.  Even though 
[normal]various
[normal] surveys show different results about the 
[normal]trends in the 
[normal]absolute
[normal] 
[normal]level of trust in cl
[normal]imate scientists
[normal] (for example, 
[normal]Poortinga
[normal] et al., 2011 and 
[normal]Shuckburgh
[normal] et al., 2012)
[normal], 
[normal]two recent 
[normal]surveys which focus on 
[normal]comparative
[normal] levels of trust in different sectors clearly indicate that climate scientists 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]are significantly more trusted than ot
[normal]her sectors such as politicians
[normal], environmental groups/charities or the media
[normal] to talk about climate science
[normal] (
[normal]Donald, 
[normal]2013
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]Shuckburgh
[normal] et al., 2012). 
[normal]7.  In this context, it is worth pointing out that even though they are the most trusted group, scientists 
[normal]are often not the most vocal group to be heard in the media.  
[normal]A
[normal] RISJ 2010 study on the media coverage of the Copenhagen summit in December 2009 showed that when the climate science was being reported in newspaper articles, university scientists represented
[normal] only 12% of those 
[normal]quoted on the science, compared to 11% for representative
[normal]s
[normal] of environment or development NGOs
[normal] (Painter
[normal],
[normal] 2010)
[normal].  This was despite the fact that around 2,000 members of delegations from 250 universities around the world were present
[normal] at the summit
[normal], including 280 professors.
[normal]8. Part of the explanation for this is that NGOs and governments had far more communication officers or media relations personnel at Copenhagen than universities. For example, Greenpeace alone had more media people
[normal] there than all the universities put together (20 compared to 12). The I
[normal]ntergovernmental 
[normal]Panel on Climate Change (I
[normal]PCC
[normal])
[normal] ha
[normal]d
[normal] just one paid media officer
[normal] at the time, although at the time of writing this has since been increased to two
[normal].
[normal]9. 
[normal]There is plenty of
[normal] scope for 
[normal]climate 
[normal]scientists from government departments, universities and other publicly funded bodies to receive more training in 
[normal]effective public engagement, including 
[normal]how to deal with the 
[normal]different types of 
[normal]media.  There 
[normal]are 
[normal]well-run organisations off
[normal]ering excellent training (such as the Science Media Centre)
[normal].  B
[normal]ut it remains the case that often scientists are not good communicators with a wider audience beyond their peer group and/or are 
[normal](understandably) 
[normal]reluctant to 
[normal]engage
[normal] with the media through fear
[normal] of misrepresentation
[normal], or being asked to comment beyond their area of expertise or engage in adversarial debate (amongst other factors)
[normal]. 
[normal] More institutional recognition needs to be given to those scientists who do engage with the media, as it requires time
[normal], 
[normal]experience, 
[normal]commitment and skill.  
[normal]10. The committee asks: [bold]How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? [bold]Do the media[bold] have a positive role to play?[bold]11. To focus on the media coverage o
[normal]f climate change, it is worth stressing that the degree to which media 
[normal]coverage of any particular issue 
[normal]affect
[normal]s
[normal] or change
[normal]s
[normal] individual attitudes, understanding 
[normal]or behaviour change 
[normal]is a disputed area in academic circles. 
[normal]Many
[normal] scholars argue that the media ma
[normal]y only have a minor impact, when compared to other factors such as wider cultural, social or political values
[normal] and the views of peer groups, family or friends
[normal].  However, there is much more agreement that the media have a huge role in setting the agenda for 
[normal]what people talk or think about, even if they have much less of a role
[normal] 
[normal]in shaping their views.
[normal]12. In the specific area of science coverage, most people in the UK get their information from the media
[normal], so the way the media report and frame climate change is
[normal] 
[normal]one
[normal] significant input into 
[normal]public understanding of the topic. 
[normal]13. It is also important to 
[normal]point to the
[normal] strong evidence that in their consumption of news, the UK public have markedly different levels of 
[normal]trust in different media organis
[normal]ations and platforms.  In a 2013 report on the digital consumption of news, the RISJ found that despite the advance of new and social media 
[normal]such as blogs, 
[normal]F
[normal]acebook
[normal] and Twitter, the web sites of the UK broadcasters were by far the most trusted for news
[normal] 
[normal]by 7
[normal]9% of those surveyed
[normal] (Newman and Levy, 2013
[normal]).  These were followed by UK newspaper sites (60%), news-related blogs (11%), Twitter (10%) and 
[normal]Facebook
[normal] (8%). 
[normal]14.  
[normal]Of the UK broadcasters, the BBC’s coverage of science topics is recognised around the world for
[normal] its high quality. Part of the reason for this is that t
[normal]he BBC 
[normal]for the most part 
[normal]takes considerable pains to follow its editorial guidelines of aiming for ‘due impartiality’ in reporting climate science, in other words asking its correspondents and reporte
[normal]rs to reflect the mainstream consensus on climate science while not ruling out the presence of climate sceptics when 
[normal]their presence is 
[normal]deemed to be appropriate (for example in discussing policy options of how to tackle climate change, rather than the scien
[normal]ce of climate change).
[normal]15.  However, 
[normal]there have been recent examples 
[normal]from
[normal] some BBC 
[normal]output
[normal] such as the Daily Politics Show where the programme might have been better served by inviting climate scientists
[normal], rather than advocates,
[normal] onto the programme.   In June
[normal] 2012 for example, Friends of the Earth’s Andrew Pendleton was invited to debate with the well-known sceptic blogger, James 
[normal]Delingpole
[normal], the significance of the apparent slowdown in global temperature rises since 1998. Both invitees were not disinterested p
[normal]arties to the 
[normal]debate 
[normal]or experts on the science
[normal].  I
[normal]t would have been more appropriate to invite two climate scientists with differing views on the significance of the slowdown.
[normal]16. 
[normal]A more pressing issue than the BBC’s coverage is the presence of climate sce
[normal]ptics (of different types) in 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]print media, and in particular the right-leaning tabloid press. 
[normal]  The RISJ 2011 study 
[normal](Painter, 2011) 
[normal]of 5,000 articles in six countries in 2007 and 2009/10 showed that the UK’s press is similar to that of the USA in gi
[normal]ving much more space to sceptical views than in the other four countries examined (Brazil, China, France and India).  
[normal]Together the UK and the USA represented more than 80% of the times sceptical voices were quoted across all six countries.  
[normal]17. Other 
[normal]key 
[normal]findings of this study relevant to the 
[normal]select 
[normal]committee’s questions are:
[normal]18. 
[normal]The second period under examination (2009-10) was a time when a 
[normal]significant
[normal] amount of media inclusion of climate sceptic voices could have been expected as it covered the time of 
[normal]‘
[normal]Climategate
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal](when scientists at the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia in the UK were accused of manipulating results and keeping critics out of science publications) 
[normal]and the questioning of some aspects of the 2007 IPCC reports.  
[normal]However, f
[normal]urther 
[normal]examination of articles on climate change in the UK press from a later period (2010-11) suggests that the presence of sceptic voices remain
[normal]ed
[normal] high at about one in five of all articles, despite a marked drop in the 
[normal]total 
[normal]number of articles covering the topi
[normal]c
[normal] (Painter and Gavin, unpublished 2013)
[normal].
[normal]19. 
[normal]There are several reasons why it is important to reflect on the high presence of climate sceptic voices in the UK print media, and particularly the opinion pages.  The first is that much of the uncontested scept
[normal]ic opinion is written by in-house columnists and not climate scientists.  Th
[normal]is could give the impression to a general audience that climate science is 
[normal]a matter of opinion or merely
[normal] ‘a point of view’, in the same way as many political issues are, without gi
[normal]ving the readers a sense of what most climate scientists 
[normal]say is the case about rising temperatures and the 
[normal]causes of 
[normal]them
[normal].
[normal]20. 
[normal]A second important aspect to consider is the effect on readers of the promulgation of uncertainty, and in particular the view oft
[normal]en put forward by sceptics that there is significant disagreement amongst scientists.  There is evidence from a recent study carried out with focus groups in the UK that many people believe that there is a lack of consensus in scientific opinion, partly be
[normal]cause this is frequently 
[normal]the way climate science is presented in the media.  The participants thought that scientists are often in disagreement with each other or change their mind over time
[normal] (
[normal]Shuckburgh
[normal] et al, 2012)
[normal].  
[normal]21.  Moreover, research carried out b
[normal]y communicat
[normal]ions scholars in the USA sugges
[normal]t
[normal]s
[normal] that uncertainty generated - deliberately or not - in peoples’ minds about the level of agreement amongst scientists can make a big difference for engagement.  P
[normal]eople
[normal] who (wrongly) believe that scientists disag
[normal]ree on global warming tend to feel less certain that global warming is occurring, and show less support for climate policy
[normal] (Ding Ding et al., 2011)
[normal].  
[normal]Likewise, 
[normal]the lead author of the 
[normal]research done by the Glasgow Media Group found that 
[normal]i
[normal]n 
[normal]their focus 
[normal]groups
[normal] in the UK
[normal], 
[normal]‘
[normal]the uncertainty of the science left the evidence open to interpret
[normal]ation by a range of experts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Participants said they were very reliant on these interpretations due to the complexity of the subject, and yet found it difficult to place faith i
[normal]n any of them – hence stalemate, and disengagement.
[normal]’ 
[normal](Catherine Happer quoted in Painter, 2013) 
[normal]22. 
[normal]A 2013 study by the RISJ 
[normal](Painter, 2013) 
[normal]suggests that risk language can in certain circumstances and with certain groups be a more helpful of talking abou
[normal]t climate change than uncertainty
[normal], and particularly for policy makers
[normal].  It is certainly the language now being used by a wide variety of politicians and scientific reports on climate change. 
[normal]23. Part of the 
[normal]challenge
[normal] is that scientific uncertainty is ofte
[normal]n misunderstood, particularly by the general public, and misinterpreted as ignorance.  For example, many people fail to recognise the distinction between ‘school science’, which 
[normal]is 
[normal]a
[normal] source of solid facts and reliable understanding
[normal], and ‘research science’ 
[normal]where uncertainty is engrained and is often the impetus for further investigation. Risk on the other hand is an essential part of everyday experience, including the worlds of insurance, health and investment.   
[normal]23.  
[normal]The RISJ
[normal] 
[normal]2013 
[normal]study, which looked at mo
[normal]re than 300 articles 
[normal]on climate change 
[normal]in the print media in six countries, found that the media on the whole overwhelmingly use a narrative of ‘disasters’ and ‘uncertainty’, when reporting climate change. 
[normal]The language of risk (and of opportunity) was much
[normal] less prevalent.  
[normal]Studies show that d
[normal]isaster and uncertainty frames – at least in their more extreme forms - are not usually seen as enhancing public understanding, engagement or behaviour change
[normal] (Moser and 
[normal]Dilling
[normal] 2004, O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2010)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]24. 
[normal]Recommendations[bold]More research 
[normal]is needed 
[normal]into the effect of certain messages
[normal] about climate change
[normal] in the media and elsewhere on public understanding, e
[normal]ngagement and behaviour change. It is often wrongly assumed that simply giving the public more infor
[normal]mation about climate science will promote ‘better’ engagement, when most communication theory suggests that most people filter information about climate science through their cultural values.  Dialogue and discussion are 
[normal]often 
[normal]more effective than top-down 
[normal]information. 
[normal]Scientific uncertainty about climate change (for example, the timing, severity and location of 
[normal]future 
[normal]impact
[normal]s
[normal]) is particularly difficult to convey without confusing the public. More work need
[normal]s
[normal] to be done on 
[normal]testing 
[normal]what sort of messages 
[normal]and l
[normal]anguage 
[normal]might help
[normal] with what sectors of society
[normal], and whether risk is a more productive language.
