default Can 
defaultthe G
defaultovernment confirm that it intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ method to adjusting the block grant for the 
defaultintroduction of devolved income
default? 
default What information can it supply about the impact of applying that reduction to the Welsh block grant?  
defaultIf an element of income tax is devolved following a referendum, the Government intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ mechanism to adjust the Welsh Government block grant as recommended by the Silk Commission (and which is also being implemented in Scotland).  
defaultIn the first year of operating this mechanism (as well as in any preceding transitional years) an amount equivalent to the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax (at 10p) will be deducted from the block grant.  If the Welsh Government sets a rate of 10p then its budget will be unchanged during these years (as the deduction will be the same as the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax). Setting a Welsh rate of 11p or 9p will lead to a higher or lower budget respectively (as the deduction will still be based on the 10p forfeited by the UK Government).  
defaultIn year 2 onwards, the deduction from the previous year will be indexed against growth in the UK non savings non dividend (NSND) 
defaultincome tax base,
default  
defaulti
default.e. if the UK NSND income tax base grows by, for example, 1% or -5%, then so will the deduction. The Welsh Government budget will therefore benefit from these new arrangements when the NSND income tax base grows more quickly in Wales than the UK average (and conversely the budget will be lower if growth is slower).  
defaultBy linking the Welsh Government budget to the performance of the Welsh economy, this increases accountability and provides a further incentive to create growth.  But at the same time this mechanism shields the Welsh Government budget from UK-wide effects that the UK Government is better placed to manage (as the Welsh Government budget is only affected by the relative performance of the Welsh and UK NSND income tax base).
default4. 
defaultWhat approaches will be used to calculate 
defaultreductions
default from the block grant for stamp duty land tax and landfill tax?  
defaultThe UK and Scottish Governments are currently discussing the most appropriate block grant adjustment mechanism in relation to stamp duty land tax and landfill tax.  The Scotland Bill Command Paper indicated that this would be a one-off adjustment but the precise nature of that adjustment is still to be agreed.  
defaultThe UK Government has now opened similar discussions with the Welsh Government, with the intention that the same mechanism can be agreed for both Wales and Scotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default definition of a Scottish taxpayer inserted by the
default Scotland Act 2012 
defaultsets out that,
default 
defaulti
defaultf an individual has a main place of residence for the same amount of time, or spends the same number of days, in Scotland as in another part of the 
defaultUK;
default they will be a Scottish taxpayer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis means that the definition of a Welsh taxpayer cannot be identically drafted to the parallel provision in Scotland, as this would mean a taxpayer could be both a Welsh and Scottish taxpayer in the same year
default if
default,
default for example, their main place of residence was in each country for an equal amount of time.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultOptions to resolve thi
defaults issue are currently being considered
default and will be included in the final Bill.

default&#xa0;
default Could you clarify paragraph 66 in the explanatory notes on reliefs. It seems there are discussions yet to be had between the Government and stakeholders on the devolution of reliefs. How will this process work? What powers will the Welsh Government have over reliefs under the proposals?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHMRC consulted representatives from private sector 
defaultrepresentative
default group
defaults
default 
defaulton
default the impact of the Scottish rate of income tax on aspects of the UK income tax system including income tax reliefs.  The consultation 
defaultcontributed to 
defaultthe approach to the treatment of reliefs for Scottish taxpayers in 
defaultHMRC’s Technical Note, published 
defaultin 
defaultMay 2012
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBefore making any orders under this section, to amend 
defaultthe application of the Welsh rate of 
defaultincome tax
default to tax reliefs
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultUK Government would consult relevant stakeholders. 
defaultOur starting point would be the results of the previous consultation, so we would expect that 
defaultthe approach taken in these areas, including the treatment of tax relief for charitable donations and pension contributions would follow the proposals in the
default 
defaultTechnical Note
default, 
defaultsubject to
default any changes in the tax system or 
defaultin the capability of IT systems in the interim.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe devolution of income tax reliefs is not within scope of this Bill. 
defaultThe Welsh Government’s power relates only to the rate of income tax – we would expect the Welsh Government to be involved in 
defaultconsultation
default in relation to reliefs, but the final decision would rest with the UK Government because of the potential for wider impacts on the income tax system as a whole.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default The draft Bill does not contain provision for devolving business rates to Wales.  Indeed, the term ‘business rates’ does not feature in the draft Bill. However, in the explanatory notes attached to the draft Bill it says “The draft Bill also implements the [Silk] Commission’s recommendation to fully devolve business rates in Wales. The Welsh Government budget would then be directly affected by revenues from business rates in Wales, reflecting the performance of the Welsh economy, rather than being determined by spending funded by business rates in England through the Barnett formula.” (p68). 
default Do the proposed changes to business rates require statutory change, and if so where is this to be found 
defaultthe draft Bill? Which clauses do this? Could you please give a detailed explanation. 
defaultThe summary impact assessment refers in error to the inclusion of business rates in the draft Bill. We apologise unreservedly for this error. 
defaultLegislative competence over business rates is already devolved to the National Assembly for Wales by virtue of the “local government finance” subject in heading 12 (local government) of Schedule 7 to the GoWA 2006. No further devolution of legislative competence is needed to effect the Government’s commitment to “work with the Welsh Government to fully devolve non-domestic (business) rates”
default, and so no provision is made in the draft Bill in relation to business rates.
defaultChanges are needed to the way in which business rates affect the Welsh Government’s budget in order to implement full devolution. At present, changes to the Welsh Government’s budget in relation to business rates are  determined through the Barnett formula, following changes in spending funded by business rates in England, and so revenues generated by Welsh business rates have no direct effect on the Welsh Government’s budget. 
defaultDiscussions are underway between HM Treasury and the Welsh Government so that changes in business rates revenues in Wales directly affect the funds available to the Welsh Government (as is already the case in Scotland and Northern Ireland). This will link growth in the Welsh Government’s budget more closely to the performance of the Welsh economy. 
defaultThe aim of both Governments is to implement these changes as soon as possible.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Could you clarify whether clause 11 means that the Secretary of State has the power to prevent a referendum on income tax devolution even if there has been a vote in favour in both the National Assembly for Wales and the Houses of Parliament?
defaultUnder clause 11 of the draft Bill, the Secretary of State may refuse to lay a draft order following a “trigger” vote passed by two thirds of the Assembly, and must give notice and reasons for that refusal to the First Minister within 180 days of receiving notification from the Assembly. This process is based on the same procedure which led to the referendum in March 2011 which led to full law-making powers for the National Assembly for Wales. Once the Order has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and the Assembly, in practice the Secretary of State has no power to prevent the Order being made by Her Majesty.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default The Welsh Government’s borrowing capacity will be increased if there is a ‘yes’ vote in a referendum on income tax devolution. In that event, what mechanism is there to decide how much the borrowing capacity should be increased by?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has set out a principle linking capital borrowing powers to the level of Devolved Administrations’ independent revenue.  This would suggest that the Welsh Government’s capital borrowing limit would be increased if an element of income tax were to be devolved.  The precise increase would be a matter for a future government, but the limit could be increased to slightly more than £1bn using the borrowing/revenue ratios applied in Scotland.  The draft Wales Bill includes the power for the capital borrowing limit to be amended but not to a level below the initial £500m.

default&#xa0;
default(3) This subsection requires a recalculation under paragraph (b) of section 8(3) in relation to a party–
default(a) for the first application of subsection (2), if the application of subsection (1) resulted in the allocation of an Assembly seat to the party, or

default(b) one has been added to the number of votes given for each individual candidate with that electoral region figure.
default&#xa0;
default(9) If, after that, the highest electoral region figure is still the electoral region figure of two or more parties or individual candidates, the regional returning officer must decide between them by lots.

default&#xa0;
default(6) A person whose name is notified under subsection (2) is to be treated as having been declared to be returned as an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region on the day on which notification of the person's name is received by the Presiding Officer.
default&#xa0;
default(7) The seat remains vacant until the next general election–
default(a) if the Assembly regional member was returned as an individual candidate, or
