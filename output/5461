[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Can 
[normal]the G
[normal]overnment confirm that it intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ method to adjusting the block grant for the 
[normal]introduction of devolved income
[normal]? 
[normal] What information can it supply about the impact of applying that reduction to the Welsh block grant?  
[normal]If an element of income tax is devolved following a referendum, the Government intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ mechanism to adjust the Welsh Government block grant as recommended by the Silk Commission (and which is also being implemented in Scotland).  
[normal]In the first year of operating this mechanism (as well as in any preceding transitional years) an amount equivalent to the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax (at 10p) will be deducted from the block grant.  If the Welsh Government sets a rate of 10p then its budget will be unchanged during these years (as the deduction will be the same as the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax). Setting a Welsh rate of 11p or 9p will lead to a higher or lower budget respectively (as the deduction will still be based on the 10p forfeited by the UK Government).  
[normal]In year 2 onwards, the deduction from the previous year will be indexed against growth in the UK non savings non dividend (NSND) 
[normal]income tax base,
[normal]  
[normal]i
[normal].e. if the UK NSND income tax base grows by, for example, 1% or -5%, then so will the deduction. The Welsh Government budget will therefore benefit from these new arrangements when the NSND income tax base grows more quickly in Wales than the UK average (and conversely the budget will be lower if growth is slower).  
[normal]By linking the Welsh Government budget to the performance of the Welsh economy, this increases accountability and provides a further incentive to create growth.  But at the same time this mechanism shields the Welsh Government budget from UK-wide effects that the UK Government is better placed to manage (as the Welsh Government budget is only affected by the relative performance of the Welsh and UK NSND income tax base).
[normal]4. 
[normal]What approaches will be used to calculate 
[normal]reductions
[normal] from the block grant for stamp duty land tax and landfill tax?  
[normal]The UK and Scottish Governments are currently discussing the most appropriate block grant adjustment mechanism in relation to stamp duty land tax and landfill tax.  The Scotland Bill Command Paper indicated that this would be a one-off adjustment but the precise nature of that adjustment is still to be agreed.  
[normal]The UK Government has now opened similar discussions with the Welsh Government, with the intention that the same mechanism can be agreed for both Wales and Scotland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] definition of a Scottish taxpayer inserted by the
[normal] Scotland Act 2012 
[normal]sets out that,
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]f an individual has a main place of residence for the same amount of time, or spends the same number of days, in Scotland as in another part of the 
[normal]UK;
[normal] they will be a Scottish taxpayer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This means that the definition of a Welsh taxpayer cannot be identically drafted to the parallel provision in Scotland, as this would mean a taxpayer could be both a Welsh and Scottish taxpayer in the same year
[normal] if
[normal],
[normal] for example, their main place of residence was in each country for an equal amount of time.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Options to resolve thi
[normal]s issue are currently being considered
[normal] and will be included in the final Bill.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Could you clarify paragraph 66 in the explanatory notes on reliefs. It seems there are discussions yet to be had between the Government and stakeholders on the devolution of reliefs. How will this process work? What powers will the Welsh Government have over reliefs under the proposals?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HMRC consulted representatives from private sector 
[normal]representative
[normal] group
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]on
[normal] the impact of the Scottish rate of income tax on aspects of the UK income tax system including income tax reliefs.  The consultation 
[normal]contributed to 
[normal]the approach to the treatment of reliefs for Scottish taxpayers in 
[normal]HMRC’s Technical Note, published 
[normal]in 
[normal]May 2012
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Before making any orders under this section, to amend 
[normal]the application of the Welsh rate of 
[normal]income tax
[normal] to tax reliefs
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK Government would consult relevant stakeholders. 
[normal]Our starting point would be the results of the previous consultation, so we would expect that 
[normal]the approach taken in these areas, including the treatment of tax relief for charitable donations and pension contributions would follow the proposals in the
[normal] 
[normal]Technical Note
[normal], 
[normal]subject to
[normal] any changes in the tax system or 
[normal]in the capability of IT systems in the interim.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The devolution of income tax reliefs is not within scope of this Bill. 
[normal]The Welsh Government’s power relates only to the rate of income tax – we would expect the Welsh Government to be involved in 
[normal]consultation
[normal] in relation to reliefs, but the final decision would rest with the UK Government because of the potential for wider impacts on the income tax system as a whole.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The draft Bill does not contain provision for devolving business rates to Wales.  Indeed, the term ‘business rates’ does not feature in the draft Bill. However, in the explanatory notes attached to the draft Bill it says “The draft Bill also implements the [Silk] Commission’s recommendation to fully devolve business rates in Wales. The Welsh Government budget would then be directly affected by revenues from business rates in Wales, reflecting the performance of the Welsh economy, rather than being determined by spending funded by business rates in England through the Barnett formula.” (p68). 
[normal] Do the proposed changes to business rates require statutory change, and if so where is this to be found 
[normal]the draft Bill? Which clauses do this? Could you please give a detailed explanation. 
[normal]The summary impact assessment refers in error to the inclusion of business rates in the draft Bill. We apologise unreservedly for this error. 
[normal]Legislative competence over business rates is already devolved to the National Assembly for Wales by virtue of the “local government finance” subject in heading 12 (local government) of Schedule 7 to the GoWA 2006. No further devolution of legislative competence is needed to effect the Government’s commitment to “work with the Welsh Government to fully devolve non-domestic (business) rates”
[normal], and so no provision is made in the draft Bill in relation to business rates.
[normal]Changes are needed to the way in which business rates affect the Welsh Government’s budget in order to implement full devolution. At present, changes to the Welsh Government’s budget in relation to business rates are  determined through the Barnett formula, following changes in spending funded by business rates in England, and so revenues generated by Welsh business rates have no direct effect on the Welsh Government’s budget. 
[normal]Discussions are underway between HM Treasury and the Welsh Government so that changes in business rates revenues in Wales directly affect the funds available to the Welsh Government (as is already the case in Scotland and Northern Ireland). This will link growth in the Welsh Government’s budget more closely to the performance of the Welsh economy. 
[normal]The aim of both Governments is to implement these changes as soon as possible.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Could you clarify whether clause 11 means that the Secretary of State has the power to prevent a referendum on income tax devolution even if there has been a vote in favour in both the National Assembly for Wales and the Houses of Parliament?
[normal]Under clause 11 of the draft Bill, the Secretary of State may refuse to lay a draft order following a “trigger” vote passed by two thirds of the Assembly, and must give notice and reasons for that refusal to the First Minister within 180 days of receiving notification from the Assembly. This process is based on the same procedure which led to the referendum in March 2011 which led to full law-making powers for the National Assembly for Wales. Once the Order has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and the Assembly, in practice the Secretary of State has no power to prevent the Order being made by Her Majesty.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Welsh Government’s borrowing capacity will be increased if there is a ‘yes’ vote in a referendum on income tax devolution. In that event, what mechanism is there to decide how much the borrowing capacity should be increased by?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government has set out a principle linking capital borrowing powers to the level of Devolved Administrations’ independent revenue.  This would suggest that the Welsh Government’s capital borrowing limit would be increased if an element of income tax were to be devolved.  The precise increase would be a matter for a future government, but the limit could be increased to slightly more than £1bn using the borrowing/revenue ratios applied in Scotland.  The draft Wales Bill includes the power for the capital borrowing limit to be amended but not to a level below the initial £500m.

[normal] and bolded.  O
[normal]mitted text is struck through.
[normal]This schedule has been prepared by the Wales Office.  It is intended for illustrative purposes only; to assist the reader of the Bill to understand the changes made by the Bill.  Whilst care has been taken in its preparation it may not be full and complete in every respect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The global re-naming change made by clause 4(2) (omitting the word “Assembly” from “Welsh Assembly Government”
[normal] throughout the Government of Wales Act 2006
[normal]) is not included in this schedule as it is self-evident. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]GOVERNMENT OF [bold]WALES[bold] ACT 2006[bold]&#xa0;[bold]PART 1[bold]&#xa0;[bold]NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR [bold]WALES[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3 Ordinary general elections[bold]&#xa0;[bold](1) The poll at an ordinary general election is to be held on the first Thursday in May in the 
[normal]fourth
[normal] 
[normal]fifth[bold] calendar year following that in which the previous ordinary general election was held, unless provision is made for the day of the poll by an order under section 4.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) If the poll is to be held on the first Thursday in May, the Assembly–
[normal](a) is dissolved by virtue of this section at the beginning of the minimum period which ends with that day, and
[normal](b) must meet within the period of seven days beginning immediately after the day of the poll.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) In subsection (2) “the minimum period” means the period determined in accordance with an order under section 13.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) The list must be submitted to the regional returning officer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4) The list must not include more than twelve persons (but may include only one).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](5) The list must not include a person–
[normal](a) who is included on any other list submitted for the Assembly electoral region or any list submitted for another Assembly electoral region,
[normal](b) who is an individual candidate to be an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region or another Assembly electoral region, 
[normal]or
[normal](c) who is a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency.
[normal](c) who is a candidate to be the Assembly constituency [bold]member for an Assembly constituency which is not included in the Assembly electoral region, or[bold](d) who is a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency included in the Assembly electoral region but is not a candidate of the party.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](6) A person may not be an individual candidate to be an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region if that person is–
[normal](a) included on a list submitted by a registered political party for the Assembly electoral region or another Assembly electoral region,
[normal](b) an individual candidate to be an Assembly regional member for another Assembly
[normal] 
[normal]electoral region,

[normal](c) a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency which is not included in the Assembly electoral region, or [bold](d) a candidate of any registered political party to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency included in the Assembly electoral region[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](7) In this Act “regional returning officer”, in relation to an Assembly electoral region, means the person designated as the regional returning officer for the Assembly electoral region in accordance with an order under section 13.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9 Allocation of seats to electoral region members[bold]&#xa0;[bold](1) The first seat for the Assembly electoral region is to be allocated to the party or individual candidate with the highest electoral region figure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) The second and subsequent seats for the Assembly electoral region are to be allocated to the party or individual candidate with the highest electoral region figure after any recalculation required by subsection (3) has been carried out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) This subsection requires a recalculation under paragraph (b) of section 8(3) in relation to a party–
[normal](a) for the first application of subsection (2), if the application of subsection (1) resulted in the allocation of an Assembly seat to the party, or
[normal](b) for any subsequent application of subsection (2), if the previous application of that subsection did so, and a recalculation is to be carried out after adding one to the aggregate mentioned in that paragraph.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4) An individual candidate already returned as an 
[normal]Assembly constituency member or[bold] [bold]Assembly regional member is to be disregarded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](5) Seats for the Assembly electoral region which are allocated to a party are to be filled by the persons on the party's list in the order in which they appear on the list 
[normal](disregarding anyone already returned as an Assembly constituency member, including anyone whose return is void).[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](6) Once a party's list has been exhausted 
[normal]by the return of persons included on it as Assembly regional members by the previous application of subsection (1) or (2)
[normal] 
[normal](by the return of persons included on it as Assembly constituency members or by the previous application of subsection (1) or (2))[bold], the party is to be disregarded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](7) If (on the application of subsection (1) or any application of subsection (2)) the highest electoral region figure is the electoral region figure of two or more parties or individual candidates, the subsection applies to each of them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](8) However, if subsection (7) would mean that more than the full number of seats for the Assembly electoral region were allocated, subsection (1) or (2) does not apply until–
[normal](a) a recalculation has been carried out under section 8(3)(b) after adding one to the number of votes given for each party with that electoral region figure, and
[normal](b) one has been added to the number of votes given for each individual candidate with that electoral region figure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](9) If, after that, the highest electoral region figure is still the electoral region figure of two or more parties or individual candidates, the regional returning officer must decide between them by lots.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11 Electoral region vacancies[bold]&#xa0;[bold](1) This section applies if the seat of an Assembly regional member returned for an Assembly electoral region is vacant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) If the Assembly regional member was returned (under section 9 or this section) from the list of a registered political party, the regional returning officer must notify to the Presiding Officer the name of the person who is to fill the vacancy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) A person's name may only be so notified if the person–
[normal](a) is included on the list submitted by the registered political party for the last general
[normal] 
[normal]election,
[normal](b) is willing to serve as an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region, and
[normal](c) is not a person to whom subsection (4) applies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4) This subsection applies to a person if–
[normal](a) the person is not a member of the registered political party, and
[normal](b) the registered political party gives notice to the regional returning officer that the person's name is not to be notified to the Presiding Officer as the name of the person who is to fill the vacancy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](5) But if there is more than one person who satisfies the conditions in subsection (3), the regional returning officer may only notify the name of whichever of them was the higher, or the highest, on that list.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](6) A person whose name is notified under subsection (2) is to be treated as having been declared to be returned as an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region on the day on which notification of the person's name is received by the Presiding Officer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](7) The seat remains vacant until the next general election–
[normal](a) if the Assembly regional member was returned as an individual candidate, or
[normal](b) if that Assembly regional member was returned from the list of a registered political party but there is no-one who satisfies the conditions in subsection (3).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](8) For the purposes of this section, a person included on the list submitted by a registered political party for the last general election who–
[normal](a) was returned as an Assembly regional member under section 9 at that election (even if the return was void),
[normal](b) has subsequently been a candidate in an election held under section 10 (whether or not returned), or
[normal](c) has subsequently been returned under this section (even if the return was void),
[normal](a) was returned as an Assembly member at that election (even if the return was void), or [bold](b) has subsequently been returned under section 10 or this section (even if the return was void),[bold]is treated on and after the return of the person
[normal], or of the successful candidate at the election,
[normal] as not having been included on the list.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17A Exception from disqualification by virtue of being an MP: recently elected members[bold]&#xa0;[bold](1) A person returned at an election as an Assembly member is not disqualified under section 16(1)(za) (disqualification by virtue of being an MP) at any time in the period of 8 days beginning with the day the person is so returned.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](2) Subsection (3) applies where a person–[bold](a) is returned at an election as an Assembly member,[bold](b) on being so returned is a candidate for election to the House of Commons, and[bold](c) is subsequently returned at that election as a member of that House.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](3) The person is not disqualified under section 16(1)(za) at any time in the period of 8 days beginning with the day the person is returned as a member of the House of Commons.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](4) A person is a “candidate for election to the House of Commons” if the person’s nomination paper for election as a member of the House of Commons has been delivered to the returning officer under rule 6 of Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (parliamentary election rules).[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]17B Exception from disqualification by virtue of being an MP: general election within 6 months[bold]&#xa0;[bold](1) This section applies if–[bold](a) an Assembly member is returned as a member of the House of Commons, and[bold](b) the expected day of the next general election is within the period of 6 months beginning with the day the person is so returned (“the return day”).[bold]&#xa0;[bold](2) The member is not disqualified under section 16(1)(za) (disqualification by virtue of being an MP) at any time in the period–[bold](a) beginning with the return day, and[bold](b) ending immediately before the day of the next general election.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) the expected day of the next general election is to be determined by reference to the circumstances as at the beginning of the return day (“the relevant time”).[bold]&#xa0;[bold](4) Where, at the relevant time, section 5(2) or (3) (extraordinary general elections) applies–[bold](a) if an Order in Council under section 5(4) has been made, the expected day is the day on which the poll is required to be held in accordance with that Order;[bold](b) if no Order in Council under section 5(4) has been made but a day has been proposed under section 5(1), that is the expected day;[bold](c) otherwise, treat the expected day as being within the period mentioned in subsection (1)(b).[bold]&#xa0;[bold](5) For the purpose of determining the expected day, no account is to be taken of the possibility of–[bold](a) an order under section 4 (power to vary date of ordinary general election) being made after the relevant time, or[bold](b) section 5(2) or (3) (extraordinary general elections) first applying after that time.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](6) References in this section to the “day” of the election are to the day on which the poll at the election is held.[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]PART 4[bold]&#xa0;[bold]ACTS OF THE ASSEMBLY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]108 Legislative competence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](1) Subject to the provisions of this Part, an Act of the Assembly may make any provision that could be made by an Act of Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) An Act of the Assembly is not law so far as any provision of the Act is outside the Assembly's legislative competence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) A provision of an Act of the Assembly is within the Assembly's legislative competence only if it falls within subsection (4) or (5).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4) A provision of an Act of the Assembly falls within this subsection if–
[normal](a) it relates to one or more of the subjects listed under any of the headings in Part 1 of Schedule 7 and
[normal], subject to subsection (4A),[bold] does not fall within any of the exceptions specified in that Part of that Schedule (whether or not under that heading or any of those headings), and
[normal](b) it neither applies otherwise than in relation to 
[normal]Wales
[normal] nor confers, imposes, modifies or removes (or gives power to confer, impose, modify or remove) functions exercisable otherwise than in relation to 
[normal]Wales
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4A) Provision relating to a devolved tax (which is listed under the heading “Taxation” in Part 1 of Schedule 7) is not outside the Assembly’s legislative competence by reason only of the fact that it falls within an exception specified under another heading in that Part of that Schedule.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](5) A provision of an Act of the Assembly falls within this subsection if–
[normal](a) it provides for the enforcement of a provision (of that or any other Act of the Assembly) which falls within subsection (4) or a provision of an Assembly Measure or it is otherwise appropriate for making such a provision effective, or 
[normal](b) it is otherwise incidental to, or consequential on, such a provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](6) But a provision which falls within subsection (4) or (5) is outside the Assembly's legislative competence if–
[normal](a) it breaches any of the restrictions in Part 2 of Schedule 7, having regard to any exception in Part 3 of that Schedule from those restrictions,
[normal](b) it extends otherwise than only to 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal], or 
[normal](c) it is incompatible with the Convention rights or with EU law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](7) For the purposes of this section the question whether a provision of an Act of the Assembly relates to one or more of the subjects listed in Part 1 of Schedule 7 (or falls within any of the exceptions specified in that Part of that Schedule) is to be determined by reference to the purpose of the provision, having regard (among other things) to its effect in all the circumstances.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]111 Proceedings on Bills[bold]&#xa0;[bold](1) The standing orders must include provision–
[normal](a) for general debate on a Bill with an opportunity for Assembly members to vote on its general principles,
[normal](b) for the consideration of, and an opportunity for Assembly members to vote on, the
[normal]details of a Bill, and (c) for a final stage at which a Bill can be passed or rejected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the standing orders making provision to enable the Assembly to expedite proceedings in relation to a particular Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](3) The standing orders may make provision different from that required by subsection (1) for the procedure applicable to Bills of any of the following kinds–
[normal](a) Bills which restate the law,
[normal](b) Bills which repeal or revoke spent enactments, and
[normal](c) private Bills.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](4) The standing orders must include provision for securing that the Assembly may only pass a Bill containing provisions which would, if contained in a Bill for an Act of Parliament, require the consent of Her Majesty or the Duke of Cornwall if such consent has been signified in accordance with the standing orders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](5) The standing orders must include provision for securing that the Assembly may only pass a Bill if the text of the Bill is in both English and Welsh, unless the circumstances are such as are specified by the standing orders as any in which the text need not be in both languages.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](6) The standing orders must provide for an opportunity for the reconsideration of a Bill after its passing if (and only if)–
[normal](a) the Supreme Court decides on a reference made in relation to the Bill under section 112 that the Bill or any provision of it would not be within the Assembly's legislative competence,
[normal](b) a reference made in relation to the Bill under section 112 is withdrawn following a
[normal]request for withdrawal of the reference under section 113(2)(b), or
[normal](c) an order is made in relation to the Bill under section 114.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](7) The standing orders must, in particular, ensure that any Bill amended on reconsideration is subject to a final stage at which it can be approved or rejected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](8) References in subsections (4), (5) and (6) of this section and sections 107(2), 109(5)
[normal] and 116(3)
