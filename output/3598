defaultWritten evidence from Philip Lund (HSR 00default7default)defaultHS2 – to Birmingham and Manchester, but who benefits?
defaultA Virgin
default train glide
defaults
default into Manchester 
defaultPiccadilly
default station, just one of 46 trains each weekday doing the journey in as little as 127 minutes.  
defaultThese
default trains stop locally en route, offering those living in the south Manchester suburbs the opportunity to join the trains at one of three stations on two different routes, 
defaultas well as
default providing a fast twice
default-
defaulthourly service to London from Stoke-on-Trent.
defaultThis is the service, much improved by extensive and expensive modifications to the track, 
defaultsigna
defaultl
defaultling
default and other infrastructure over a decade, which the Government is now seeking to supplement by a new 
defaultHS2 
defaultroute, track and service 
default- 
defaultinitially between London and Birmingham, but with one of two spurs extending to provide a High Speed link between Manchester and the capital.
defaultThe distinction between ‘fast’ trains, travelling at speeds up to around 125 mph
default,
default and 
default‘
defaultHigh Speed
default’
default trains is essentially arbitrary, 
defaultbeing different in different countries and even in the EU being dependent on whether the tracks are new or upgraded.  Indeed the current services, which run on upgraded tracks, already achieve speeds for this EU classification 
defaultthough 
defaultthese speeds are substantially lower than those planned for the 
defaultproposed
default new ‘Ultra High Speed’ 
defaultsystem.  This is known as HS2 since Great Britain (Northern Ireland has its own rail system) already has one High Speed rail link – that through the Channel tunnel to Brussels and Paris
default,
default with High Speed connections beyond to other countries and places.  Surely, the argument goes, if other countries have, and are to have, more High Speed trains 
defaultthen 
defaultBritain should not be left behind?
defaultHowever, from a rational - as opposed to 
defaulta 
defaultpolitical – point of view, that presupposes that the geography and demographics of Britain and the other countries are similar.  This is not however the case: certainly in England the distances between the major cities are shorter than in the main comparator countries; and the populations based in and around those cities tend to be more dispersed than elsewhere since – at least outside London – the more affluent members of the population, and hence the more frequent users of such long distance rail routes, tend to live in dormitory suburbs and, increasingly, more rural locations.  Moreover in England there are multiple 
defaultcentres
default of population, not all of which can expect to be served by the proposed High Speed routes. 
defaultThe justification for HS2 on the basis of savings in travel time is based on comparisons of times between the termini rather than for door
default-
defaultto
default-
defaultdoor journeys.  They thus exclude the additional time which many 
defaulttravellers
default would have to spend travelling to and from the terminal stations as opposed to boarding trains at
default 
defaultone of the more local stations currently served by the existing fast routes.  Already
default,
default in the case of Birmingham
default,
default many rail travelers from the south of the city prefer to catch a Chiltern Line service from stations such as 
defaultSolihull
default or Warwick Parkway rather than travel further to catch the faster speed Virgin service from the centre of Birmingham, the airport or Coventry.  If this happens now would there not be the same tendency when the access point is limited to just one station in Birmingham
default?
default 
defaultThis point has apparently been overlooked (or understated) in the cost-benefit appraisals of the case for HS2, with consequent effects on the forecasts of fare revenues and tim
defaulte
default savings.  High ‘public’ benefits have been attributed to the saving in time spent on the main part of the journey – which time is rarely ‘lost’ due to the provision of various business facilities on trains and the opportunity to make use of the time spent on them – whereas account does not seem to have been taken of the greater amount of mainly wasted time taken in reaching city centre termini.  Moreover it can be questioned whether the valuation of time savings as a benefit to the economy as a whole
default (i.e. as an ‘externality’) 
defaultdoes not duplicate 
defaultthe payment for those time savings 
defaultalready incorporated in fares.  
defaultIf HS2 may not be the 
defaultideal
default solution to the forecast need for the provision of more and better rail services is there any other solution
default?
default  
defaultFirst, it
default should be recognized, even by one such as I (who am 
defaultinstinct
defaultive
defaultly 
defaultfavourably
default disposed to rail as a means of transport)
default,
default that there are many journeys for which rail is not, and cannot be
default,
default a convenient form of travel; that it may be unrealistic to project the recent rapid growth in rail passenger numbers far into the future
default;
default and that technological developments, and both the increasing real cost of energy and wider environmental concerns, may result in lower growth in transportation (by all modes) in the future.  
defaultMoreover, e
defaultven leaving these more speculative and longer-term considerations aside
default,
default there are other solutions to the perceived problem of capacity constraints on these major inter-city parts of the existing rail network
default.  The concept of ‘capacity’ is rather nebulous in the case of rail transportation, it being dependent on such factors as train and platform length and 
defaultsignalling
default technology.  Modern technology should allow greater usage of a line, with shorter distances between trains.
default&#xa0;
defaultF
defaultollowing on from the thoughts expressed above, there 
defaultis
default a case for facilitating the use of rail by the provision of more Parkway stations, thus allowing people the convenience of driving from their home to a station without having to encounter the congestion associated with city centre stations.  Those MPs with constituencies in north Cheshire (such as 
defaultTatton
default and Weaver Vale) who 
defaultfavour
default the HS2 proposal – on the grounds of ‘bringing the north and London closer together’ – should try to evaluate what proportion of their constituents would have quicker rail journeys to London by using an HS2 from the centre of Manchester as opposed to 
defaulttravelling from 
defaultstations 
defaultsuch as 
defaultWilmslow
default or Crewe o
defaultn
default the existing services
default (the speed of which is likely to be enhanced by the time HS2 would be operational).
default 
default Such constituents
default would 
defaultprobably 
defaultbe better served by a new Cheshire Parkway station on the existing 
defaultW
defaultest Coast mainline, 
defaultbetween Warrington and Crewe.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultt should also be recognized that not all rail passengers put a high priority on time savings – for some leisure 
defaulttravellers
default, cost and even pleasantly routed journeys are relevant considerations.  Thus any perceived capacity constraint with respect to
default 
defaultrail travel between London and Manchester could be eased by a reopening of the short missing link (between 
defaultChinley
default and Matlock) in the route used regularly whilst the 
defaultW
defaultest 
defaultC
defaultoast mainline was being electrified in the 1960s.  This route would then link in, at Derby, with the existing Midland mainline which is due for the type of improvement already provided on the main routes to its east and west.  Moreover this line terminates at St 
defaultPancras
default,
default thus giving direct access to the HS1 routes to the Continent.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne apparent oddity about the HS2 proposal is that its London terminus 
defaultis to
default be at Euston station rather than St 
defaultPancras
default, the terminus for HS1.  This means that some passengers may have to transit between the two stations 
default(
defaultwhich are 
defaultabout
default 600 yards apart)
default,
default though some services will procee
defaultd directly onto the HS1 route. 
default 
defaultT
defaulthere are other oddities 
defaultin
default the proposed route, for example the location of the proposed Birmingham terminus some distance from the city centre and thus 
defaultat a point 
defaultless convenient for that centre than the existing termini of New Street and Moor Street
default.
default 
default 
defaultAlso the route does not go near the existing main corridor of London – Birmingham transport routes (the M1 and the 
defaultW
defaultest 
defaultC
defaultoast mainline) and thus does not afford the possibility of easy access to the latter if and when required.  In particular the route does not go near Milton Keynes, the main locus of development between London and Birmingham and 
defaultthe most obvious location for any possible 
defaultfuture st
defaultation
default 
defaultserving the south Midlands.
defaultInstead of passing through this already developed
default,
default and thus 
defaultrelatively 
default‘spoilt’
default,
default countryside the proposed route passes through some fine and currently largely 
defaultunspoilt
default countryside, both on the outer fringe of the London commuting area (the Chiltern 
defaulthills
default)
default and 
defaultin
default Warwickshire.  It is thus not surprising that the existing residents of those areas are strongly opposed to the proposal but their concern for their local environment and peace and quiet is not the only reason to be

defaulteptical
default about this proposed enhancement of GB’s existing rail network.  There are other means by which to improve 
defaultthe existing

defaultTransport Select Committee Meeting on 26th November at which Patrick defaultMcLoughlindefault and KPMG are to answer questions on the KPMG Report “defaultHS2: The Regional Economic Impactdefault”default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1.  
defaultThe analysis is based on the estimation and then use of production functions linking regional estimates of output to the normal inputs in such a relationship and also to measures of connectivity. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe method of deriving coefficients for the latter has been 
defaultcriticised
default by Professor 
defaultOverman
default because of 
defaultthe 'non standard'
default method of dealing with the problem of 
defaultmulticollinearity
default between the separate measures of connectivity. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever it is not clear how measures were derived of connectivity, both for the current position and 
defaultfor 
defaultthe hypothetical 'with HS2' position. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCould you please explain this, 
defaultsince
default it would seem that 
defaultthe
default results are dependent also on the figures input for these variables
default?
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLinked to this it might be questioned 
defaultas follows:

default2.  
defaultHave any tests been conducted to examine the sensitivity of your findings to the extent of separation of your local areas
default?
defaultThe relevance of this 
defaultsecond question 
defaultis that HS2 will have fewer stopping places than existing trains and thus measuring connectivity from a central point within a local area and with a prospective HS2 station may tend to overstate the effect on the more

default parts of that same area.
