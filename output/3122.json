The online growth is particularly impressive, growing 26% from a flat position last year. \n&#xa0;\nBBC \nWS audiences were up to 192m\n.  \nA\nudiences to BBC Arabic\n across platforms\n went up to 33m, an increase of 7m, suggesting that audiences gained during the Ar\nab Uprising continue to turn to the BBC for trusted news.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nWorld Service TV:&#xa0;\nWorld Service digital:&#xa0;\nThe BBC’s global TV and digital operations, BBC World News and bbc.com/news, were brought together to form \nt\nhe new business entity GN\n Ltd\n.\n in order to drive bigger audiences\n and greater multimedia working\n. \n \nGN Ltd. \nserves a glo\nbal audience of over 88 million with \nmajor growth in bbc.com/news audiences.\n The website reached one billion page views in August - a major milestone.\nTh\ne\n marked \nincrease in the BBC Global News audience illustrates that there is a growing worldwide audience for impartial, trustworthy journalism.\n&#xa0;\n The World Service is emerging from a very difficult period of funding cuts and the closure of services\n including most re\ncently the \ncessation of Arabic short wave across the Middle East (except to Sudan), and the reduction of Arabic and English medium wave hours to the Middle East\n, but audiences have increased despite this, thanks to the quality of its journalism, and decisi\nons taken to invest in new offers such as TV and online in order to remain relevant to audiences in the growing international media market.\n&#xa0;\n3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTrust and quality measurements&#xa0;\nA new assessment of the global BBC brand shows that \nthe BBC is ahead of all \ncompetitors on all attributes globally, and most closely associated with trust, high quality\n and being unbiased and objective. \n Where the BBC was less strong – on engagement – efforts have been made to increase regular usage and loyalty amongst the global \naudience.\n&#xa0;\nThe ‘Brand Tracker’ was\n established this year to monitor the international brand position of Global News. \n \nResearch \nwas\n conducted in ten markets, and \nr\nesults so far show that the BBC and CNN are clear leaders with the BBC slightly ahead, with bo\nth gaining significantly higher levels of awareness and consideration than the competition. \n&#xa0;\nPerformance varies considerably by market, w\nhilst\n CNN \ni\ns \nthe BBC’s\n closest competitor globally, both Al Jazeera English and Euronews having a strong presence in t\nheir respective primary markets. \n&#xa0;\nIn terms of brand attributes, the BBC is ahead of all competitors on all attributes globally, and most closely associated with trust, high quality\n and being unbiased and objective. There are also indications that the BBC \ngains greater social currency and impact\n from its coverage than key competitors. However, \nthe tracker showed that \nthe BBC \nwas \nnot as strong\n on \nattributes such as \nbeing passionate\n \nand\n dynamic\n \n– \nthis is being addressed through \n‘Live the Story’, the World New\ns, World Service and bbc.com/news \nmarketing campaign \nlaunched to improve the brand image of global news output.  The campaign emphasises that bringing stories to life in an engaging fashion is a key editorial priority for Global News, and new tools and gui\ndelines \nto facilitate this \nwere made available \nto staff \nacross the division.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEditorial highlights&#xa0;\nThis year saw \nall editorial elements of \nGlobal News \n- World Service, World News and bbc.com/news \n- \nbecome more \nunited than ever before when they came \ntogether\n under one roof in New Broadcasting House. This launched the concept of ‘The World’s Newsroom’, enabling editorial collaboration across the news group, both within Global News and between Global News and UK News.  \n&#xa0;\nWS Languages, BBC Monitoring and\n Newsgathering worked closely together to ensure that audiences were able to access the latest information and analysis. \nSome of the highlights included:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTV and digital developments&#xa0;The challenges in reaching global audiences are intensifying. Global state funded and \ncommercial players are investing (\nthe BBC\n estimate\ns\n CCTV’s funding has increased by $2bn per annum, and competitors including CNN and New York Times have a growing multi-lingual portfolio). At a local and regional level, news provision is \nrapidly increasin\ng; Afghanistan, for example, now has 80 terrestrial TV stations and over 175 radio stations. Digital developments are accelerating this change. Short\n \nwave listening continues to decline, with some of \nBBC WS’s\n largest audiences in Nigeria and Burma\n facing p\nressure. \n&#xa0;\nFor the time being, radio is still \nthe W\norld \nS\nervice\n’s\n largest platform and the most cost-effective form of distribution, but as short\n \nwave becomes less relevant to most audiences, \nthe BBC must offer\n a greater multiplatform presence.  \nInvestment\n in new TV programming\n and digital output is a key part of \nWorld Service\n’s\n strategy. Four new language TV bulletins were launched this year, and are now on air:\n&#xa0;\nFocus on Africa: Launched on both BBC W\norld News and on 11 partner TV s\ntations in \neight\n countries. This programme is an extension of \nBBC Africa’s\n strong radio brand into television and represents \na \nunique partnership with \nBBC World News. \nReporting expertise is provided by existing BBC Africa reporters in Africa, complimented by the poo\nl of N\newsgathering staff on the \ncontinent. This \nwas \nthe first stage in Global News’ investment in new content and programming aimed at reaching different audiences around the world who are changing the way they consume their news. \n&#xa0;Diira Ya Dunia: Launched in \nAugust, a 30 minute bulletin aimed at Swahili speaking audiences in East and Central Africa, which airs in Tanzania and Kenya on partner TV stations.\n \n A\n number of\n new partners in DRC and Rwanda \nhave been added \nenabling BBC WS to expand its reach in Africa.\n&#xa0;\nGlobal India: A weekly 30-minute magazine-style show from the Hindi service launched in November on five Hindi news channels on the ETV network in India, at prime time. Each programme gets three playouts on all five channels.\n&#xa0;Sairbeen (Panorama): A th\nrice weekly one-hour TV programme from the Urdu service of regional and global news for audiences in Pakistan launched in February 2013. The programme was increased to five times a week in the run up to Pakistani elections.\n&#xa0;Although audience performance d\nata\n is not yet available\n, several of \nthe\n TV partners have signed-up to the programmes for another year on the same or improved commercial terms. \n&#xa0;\nFeedback from Star TV on \nDiira Ya Dunia\n has been especially positive, with the CEO keen to renew the contract. In addition, in Kenya reaction on social media to editions of \nFocus On Africa\n and \nDiira Ya Dunia\n \nhas been extensive \nand very positive.\n&#xa0;\nWorld Service Digital:This year, the last seven\n \nlanguage \nwebsites \nwere\n updated in accordance with the new and improved visual and presentation style, in line with the ‘feel and look’ of the rest of the BBC sites. 11 Nokia Apps, 5 iOS Apps, and 4 Andr\noid apps have now been released\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeveral World Service websites have now been converted to responsive design including Indonesia, Hausa, Arabic, Vietnamese, Turkish¸ Russian, Hindi, Afrique, Mundo, Brasil and Persian with the conversion of many more languages in progress. Responsive desig\nn is a technology that optimises the mobile browser according to the device used – adjusting the layout to the screen size and connectivity. It is especially helpful for the language services, given the diverse markets they serve and the huge array of diff\nerent phones and technical standards in those markets. \n&#xa0;\nAs mentioned in the \nAudience Figures\n section, these developments have contributed to a 16% increase in World Service digital audience globally.  \n&#xa0;6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMedia freedom update&#xa0;Media freedom issues continue \nto affect the BBC’s ability to reach its audiences.\n&#xa0;\n \nMany of these issues were \ndescribed in detail\n in BBC World Service’s written evidence submitted to the FAC’\ns Human Rights inquiry.  This is a\n brief summary of \nthe \nissues \nBBC WS \nhas faced \nthis year\n:\n&#xa0;\nJournalists’ safety:The BBC has been extremely concerned about the safety of its journalists in several parts of the world. Syria has continued to be a dangerous place to report and violence and pressures on media in Egypt have made it a difficult place t\no work as a journalist. BBC reporter \nMohammed Moalimu, \ncame close to death in Somalia when in July an al-Shabab suicide bomber detonated his explosives just as Moalimu was driving past.\n&#xa0;\n He was wounded by shrapnel in his shoulder.\n&#xa0;\nBut it is not just in c\nonflict zones that journalists’ safety is being threatened. A BBC Tamil reporter, Ponnaiah Manikavasagam, was questioned for hours by anti-terrorist police in Sri Lanka over his phone conversations with two Tamil prisoners. He was not allowed a lawyer duri\nng the interview. BBC WS raised its concern and expressed confidence that all his activities were carried out in pursuit of normal journalistic duties. \n&#xa0;\nIn Turkey, during Gezi\n Park protests, Turkish authorities launched a campaign of intimidation against BBC Turkish reporter, Selin Girit. She had been deployed to Istanbul to cover the protests both for Turkish and English outlets. The mayor of Ankara launched a campaign against\n Selin on Twitter, resulting in a large number of threatening messages being sent to her. In a statement, the BBC called on the Turkish \nauthorities not to intimidate its reporter and to use the established procedures if they have any complaints about BBC o\nutput. \n&#xa0;\nIn Iran, security authorities have continued harassing BBC Persian staff and their families. In the weeks leading to the Iranian presidential election in June, the incidents of harassment increased and the media campaign against BBC Persian staff\n intensified. Although after the election the harassment stopped for a while, in recent weeks a new wave of intimidation of families has started again. Families of several members of staff have been threatened to stop their relatives working for the BBC. \n&#xa0;\nTo highlight the importance of journalists’ safety and the issue of impunity, the BBC is organising a conference next year. It is a follow-up to the conference it co-hosted last October. The conference will bring together senior journalists, NGOs and \nrepresentatives from UN’s relevant bodies and governments\n.\n&#xa0;\n It will examine what international legal bodies could do to prosecute those who are responsible for attacking and intimidating journalists.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;Jamming in China:The jamming of BBC English short wa\nve services by China has occurred since February this year and also affects reception of the service in many other Asian countries.  \nAccess to the BBC Chinese (Mandarin) website has been completely blocked since its launch in 1999.  \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC strongly cond\nemns\n this action, but\n despite \nrepresentations made to the Chinese Ambassador, the regulator, and the Director Global News raising the issue in meetings duri\nng his recent visit to China, the BBC\n has not received a response\n from the Chinese authorities\n.\n&#xa0;Broadcasts suspended in Sri Lanka:BBC WS suspended its broadcasts on SLBC (the Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation) following continued interruption and interference of BBC Tamil programming.\n&#xa0;\n \nDespite requests for discussion about any complaints that SLBC\n might have had about any specific output, the issue has not been resolved.  The BBC took similar action in 2009 when its services were also disrupted.\n \n&#xa0;\nAudiences in Sri Lanka can continue to listen to th\ne BBC on short wave and via \nonline services\n.\n&#xa0;\nTV partnership suspended in Turkey:Following the start of protests in Turkey in June the Turkish service took the decision to suspend its TV partnership with NTV in Turkey, after NTV interfered with its broadcasting. \nBBC Turkish subsequently relaunched its digi\ntal offer with a greater emphasis on mobile, video and social news, and has seen its traffic soar more than 350% in one year alone with nearly 90% of the audience coming from within Turkey.\nProgress in Burma:There were uplifting developments in Burma\n/Myanmar\n where the government has \nstrictly\n controlled  the media over a number of years. \nFor the past nine months BBC Media Action has been helping the state broadcaster - MRTV - to achieve its declared aim of evolving into a public service broadcaster by \nJanuary 2015. As a result of this support MRTV now has its first prime-time politics programme to feature interviews with members of all the parties represented in Parliament, a new radio current affairs programmes featuring differing points of view and an\n emerging newsgathering structure that is more independent than anything the country has known in the past few decades .\n&#xa0;\nIn addition a youth programme is broadcast on the BBC's Burmese Service \nthat informs audiences about governance issues and encourages \ndiscussion and participation and developing other projects to improve livelihoods, health and resilience to natural disasters. \n&#xa0;\nThere have\n also\n been\n a number of distribution break\nthroughs with BBC TV channels including BBC World News now available on the \nSkyNet \nTV platform in Burma\n,\n a \nrebroadcasting deal \nwith \nPadamyar FM\n and another one with key FM station \nShwe\n which covers 98% of the country in the pipeline.  In addition, t\nhe\n Burmese service became the first international broadcaster on the mobile platfor\nm in Burma through the launch of daily audio bulletins, as well as SMS bulletins. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAwards&#xa0;BBC World Service won five awards at this year’s \nSony Radio Academy Awards. \nWitness\n won a Gold in the in the Best Speech Programme category, Paul Woods' \nBombardment of Homs\n documentary also won Gold in the Best News Feature or Documentary category marking his brave and vivid reporting during the Syrian crisis, \nNewshour \nwon Silver in the hugely competitive Best News and Current Affairs Programme category an\nd the BBC also picked up Silver for the outstanding and moving \nAssignment/Crossing Continents: Uzbekistan\n, a co-production between World Service and BBC Radio 4\n on forcible sterilisation in Uzbekistan\n. \nFinally, BBC reporter, \nJon Donnison\n, was \naward\ned a Sil\nver for Radio Journalism\n of the Year.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC won prestigious \nOne World Media awards \nin several categories in May. \nAssignment/Crossing Continents\n \nwas again successful winning\n the Radio Award.\n&#xa0;\n BBC Persian’s Tahir Qadiry\n won the New Voice Award for what the judges called ‘presenting a fresh and \nalternative take on Afghanistan’\n. \n&#xa0;\nBBC News correspondent, \nIan Pannell and cameraman Darren Conway \nwere\n awarded this year’s prestigious \nDavid Bloom Award \nin \nrecognition of their r\neporting from the Idlib province in Syria on BBC World News America. \nL\nater in October Ian Pannell was again recognised for his reports of the conflict in Syria, along with re\nporter Paul Wood and \ncameramen Fred Scott and Darren Conway, when they won a prest\nigious \nEmmy Award.\n \nAnd in the last month, \nBBC World News\n won a \nUnited Nations Association of Australia Media Award for the film \nUnderstanding Yemen: Torture, Trauma and Al-Qaeda\n.\n&#xa0;In July \nBBC \nWS’s Matt Davies, was recognised as Journalist of the Year and journalist, Fiona Graham, won an award for Best \nInformation and Communication Technology\n Feature in the \nDiageo Africa Business Reporting Awards. \n&#xa0;\nThe work of Global News Creative Services Team\n was recognised\n&#xa0;\nat the \nPromax awards in LA \nin June.  \nThe \nBBC World News \nFacebook\n animated \ninfographic\n \nwon Gold, Silver went to the BBC World Service 27 languages print campaign and Bronzes were awarded for the BBC World Service Wimbledon radio promo and BBC World Service 80th anniversary exhibition design. \n&#xa0;\n8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransfer to the licence fee&#xa0;BBC WS is now looki\nng ahead to more stable funding and the benefits of greater integration with BBC News, as a result of the transfer to the licence fee on 1 April 2014. It will join BBC Monitoring which has been funded by the licence fee since 1 April 2013.\n&#xa0;\nOn 25 June 2013\n the BBC Trust published its draft Operating Licence for the World Service, \nsetting out its strategy for World Service in the licence fee, \nfor public consultation. Further context was provided in the accompanying Position Paper “\nBBC World Service – A licen\nce fee funded service\n”.\n The Trust is currently assessing the feedback received during the consultation and will publish its responses in due course. \n&#xa0;\nThe draft Operating Licence defines the Objectives, Priorities and Targets (as agreed with the Foreign \nSecretary), scope of services, funding and performance measurement of the World Service under the licence fee. Any significant change to the Licence will require the approval of the BBC Trust.\n&#xa0;\nThe Policy Position paper makes it clear that the World Servic\ne \nwill \nbe an integral part of the BBC News operation, which provides independent and impartial news and analysis to UK and global audiences. Most importantly, the paper states that the Trust will ensure that the distinctive service offered by the World Ser\nvice is protected, and enhanced. The impact of the World Service will not be diminished as a result of an administrative change in funding. \n&#xa0;\nThe Trust also announced its plan to increase funding for World Service to £245m in 2014/15 (in the 2013/14 financ\nial year the total grant from the UK Government for World Service is £238.5m). Under the terms of the Operating Licence, any planned or actual change in the licence fee-funded content and distribution budget of more than \n10% in real value will be regarded \nas a significant change and require approval from the BBC Trust. The Trust also proposed that in addition to its licence fee budget, World Service should seek non-licence fee sources of funding (including commercial funding) where appropriate and within re\ngulatory requirements.\n&#xa0;\nOn 8 October 2013 the Director-General of the BBC shared his ambition for the BBC. Reflecting the importance and value of the World Service, the announcements included an ambition to double the BBC’s global audience by 2022 from 250\n million users a week to 500 million.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWithin the BBC Executive, the ‘1414 Programme’ has been created to ensure that all aspects of the transition of the World Service to licence fee funding are addressed. The programme is considering ways of integrating the World Service to ensure maximum val\nue for licence fee payers and putting a future strategy in place which offers the best possible service to global audiences. The programme is also considering appropriate accountability and regulatory regimes, working with Government where necessary. \n&#xa0;\nThi\ns programme is progressing to schedule. James Harding, Director News and Current Affairs, assumed the role of Executive Sponsor from September 2013.\n&#xa0;\n22 October 2013\n Available at \nwww.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2013/ws_operating_licence.html\n"
