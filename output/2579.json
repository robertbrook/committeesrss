"WWC0017&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by City Year &#xa0;\nENQUIRY INTO UNDERACHIEVEMENT IN EDUCATION OF WHITE WORKING CLASS CHILDREN&#xa0;\nIntroductionCity Year is a leading youth and education charity and a beacon for a year of voluntary service. We tackle under attainment and the employability skills gap, while empowering young people to ‘be the change’ they wish to see in their communities. \nThrough a \nyear of volunteering in schools in deprived areas, City Year develops 18-to-25-year-olds as value-led leaders, near peer role models, mentors and tutors focused on addressing educational underachievement in communities across London and Birmingham.\nDuring \ntheir volunteer service year, these young people (known as corps members) are not only an invaluable extra adult resource, but their energy, enthusiasm, commitment and example affects the climate of the whole school, helping to create an environment in whi\nch children from disadvantaged backgrounds can excel. Corps members help schools deliver a holistic approach to educational underachievement which reaches out beyond the school into local \ncommunities.\n To\n date, and in addition to the 160 corps members currently serving, more than 250 City Year corps members have already served in schools in disadvantaged communities by giving 325,000 hours of service, which includes supporting around 2,500 focus children, \noften on a one-to-one basis.\nCity Year welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation. \nEducational underachievement is a significant public policy issue that the UK has long been seeking to tackle. The long tail of underachievement has been widel\ny debated and successive Governments have sought to tackle it. Forty years on from National Children’s Bureau ‘Born to Fail’ report, education underachievement remains a serious public policy issue. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSince City Year began in London it has developed stron\ng partnerships with schools. Together \nhead teachers\n and City Year volunteers have a joint mission to tackle educational underachievement. \n&#xa0;\nThrough this on the ground experience and discussion with professionals, City Year has a number of reflections on the\n issues white working class pupils face and the solutions to overcoming their problems. \n&#xa0;\nWhite working class children often have a significant aspiration deficit&#xa0;\nMany white working class children think the \"establishment\" is against them, of which school\n is a part. This is often as a result of poor parental experience at school and current poor employment prospects.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChildren have commented to corps members that \"Mum said I should not read because no one read to her\". Parents have also commented that \ntheir child \"doesn't do education”. \n&#xa0;\nThis aspiration deficit can also be seen by white working class children rarely moving from the area their family have lived in for generations and considering \"what if\n”. \n&#xa0;\nHarriet Owusu-Ansah, Head of Programme, City Year London: \"The corps members help children who never think what if, to start answering the question positively. \n&#xa0;\nThis then helps the pupil approach their learning with purpose.”\n&#xa0;\nThis is in contrast to other\n ethnicities who are far more aware of the importance of education and the consequences of not focusing on their school work. Often other ethnicities have also already faced a challenge by moving to this country. For these children their grandparents, who \nmay have been the first to come over the UK, are viewed as an inspiration. Positive young role models that the children ca\nn relate to and that can tackle\n&#xa0;\na lack of aspiration at home is very important to addressing the aspiration deficit of white working c\nlass children.\n \n&#xa0;\nSupporting children with their ‘ABCs’- attendance, behaviour and curriculum achievement - is key to overcoming underachievement &#xa0;\nCity Year helps schools to tackle three of these key areas through intervention on:\n&#xa0;\na) Attendance and punctuality - By encouraging children to look forward to school and enjoy their learning, following up on absence or lateness and sometimes making calls home or undertaking specific work with families as part of the school’s attendance st\nrategy. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nb) Behaviour - By modelling good behaviour in classrooms, corridors and outside areas, and through structured break time activities, corps members reduce disruptive behaviour and reinforce safe, no bullying-cultures. Teaching staff felt that cor\nps members had a positive impact on pupils’ behaviour in and out of the classroom, reporting they made a difference to the discipline of the class. Two in three pupils (65%) said that City Year corps members helped their class to behave ‘a lot’ better.\n&#xa0;\nc) Curriculum achievement and levels of progress - City Year’s method of engaging children intensively over long periods of time and in all aspects of their school life makes a City Year team a valuable part of the school’s strategy for raising attainment an\nd closing achievement gaps. Corps members committed 90,000 hours of school-based voluntary service during 2011/12 (around 9,000 hours of which were in small groups or one-to-one settings intensively supporting 450 children). \n&#xa0;\nPupils in receipt of fifteen o\nr more hours of one-to-one support from corps members during the school year had higher levels of progress compared to those receiving less support. For those from working class backgrounds this extra one-to-one support helps address areas of potential dis\nadvantage such as when parents or carers with low aspirations or who are unable to provide extra help with school work at home. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDr Jane Keeley, Headteacher of Haggerston School, Hackney: \n“Haggerston school has been delighted to welcome City Year to \nour learning community.\n&#xa0;\n Corps members have supported transition for our new students in year 7, are running literacy and numeracy focussed competitions at lunch time alongside supporting homework, GCSE study club and EAL phonics groups at the end of the s\nchool day.\n&#xa0;\n Corps members model our ethos of developing creative, confident and capable young people and we are excited about seeing the impact on our students over the course of this year.”\n&#xa0;\nMichelle Thomas, Headteacher of Shacklewell Primary School, Hackney: \n\"We have been fortunate to work in partnership with City Year for the last two academic years at Shacklewell. During this time, they have been an instrumental part of our drive for whole school improvement. The academic progress of the children has \naccelerated due to the targeted support they have provided in KS2.\"\n&#xa0;\nYoung role models are much needed in tackling this aspiration deficit &#xa0;\nTo tackle this aspiration deficit, role models from outside the family home, such as teachers and support staff in\n school, are vital. They help create a culture of high expectations in terms of behaviour, learning and future ambitions. This is particularly important as external support, such as from high quality careers advisers, is currently lacking. Many schools use\n their pupil premium funds to support focus groups of underachieving children. As highlighted in their recent Ofsted report, City Year’s focus group intervention has been very effective for the white working class boys at William Ellis School.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOfsted report of William Ellis School\"...the pupil premium for 2012-2013 is funding eleven full-time, ‘City Year’ volunteers. These enthusiastic young adults are working with low achievers, particularly White working class boys. Several low attaining student\ns’ attitudes to school are already much better.\"\n&#xa0;\nSam White, Headteacher of William Ellis School, Camden: \n“We are very excited about our new partnership with City Year. As boys come back to school for the new term they will be welcomed by a team of \nenthusiastic and idealistic young role models that want to help, which is great. At William Ellis School we develop teamwork, creativity and encourage our pupils to have a high self-worth. City Year corps members demonstrate all of these qualities and they\n will provide valuable support as we help each boy achieve their ambitions.”\n&#xa0;\nOften young people relate well to corps members due to their near-peer nature, similar experiences and City Year’s culture of encouraging empathy. City Year actively recruits a \ntruly diverse corps, ensuring that many members can directly relate to challenges being experienced by the pupils they are serving and help them to overcome those challenges which are, or can become, barriers to learning. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Character is a key ingredient in raising achievement and children being ready to learn&#xa0;\nA child's character traits and attitude to his or her learning is the main determining factor of academic results. In Demos’ \nex-curricula report it was \nhighlighted that one in 10 children begin sch\nool without the behaviour needed to be ready to learn. Character is embedded in the expectation of schools but more can be done to develop it more systemically at every stage and age. \n&#xa0;\nBy building character children understand the personal and social beha\nviours needed to succeed at school, in work and life. The volunteering and modelling of the ABC’s by corps members help pupils develop these characteristics themselves over time. They also are inspired by seeing young adults choosing to volunteer for a yea\nr and undertake practical action in the service of others. The corps members are vital additional young, positive adults who have the time to support children not only in their attainment but also in developing these key characteristics that they will need\n to make a successful transition to adulthood and to become engaged citizens themselves. \n&#xa0;\nGordon Higginson, Deputy Head Teacher at Holte School, Lozells: “We are delighted to become partners with City Year for 2013-14 and will take the unique stance of de\nploying the corps members between a primary and secondary school that share one building to ensure the Key Stage 2-3 transition is smooth. \n“Challenge, social skills and personal development are our focus to assist young people to gain high quality \nlearning experiences, facilitating bright futures for all. We will use the City Year ethos and the skills, qualities and attributes of the corps members to add value to our year on year school improvement and our on-going mission to improve the life chance\ns of all our young people.”\n&#xa0;\nCity Year is currently working on developing its dual impact on corps members and children with funders and has a visit to the US planned to develop this further. This will provide interesting data which can focus in on the jo\nurney and key turning points a child makes to be ready to learn, engage and succeed.\n&#xa0;\nNurturing pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development as a whole school approach is key to overcoming the aspiration deficit of the white working class child&#xa0;\nCity Year plays a key part in helping a school create a positive and high expectations culture. \n&#xa0;\nCity \nYear’s \"whole school, whole child\" is a package which allows corps members to boost pupil confidence and learning, improve their academic progress as w\nell as help children feel safe, empowered and happy. \n&#xa0;\nJanice Thomas, Executive Headteacher of Sebright Primary School, Hackney: \n“City Year corps members have been serving at Sebright for three years now. \n&#xa0;\nThey make a massive difference to children’s \nconfidence and enjoyment of school and they do an excellent job supporting teachers to raise standards in English and maths. Heads should be forming an orderly queue to bring City Year into their schools. \n&#xa0;\nThey are certainly helping me deliver the commitme\nnts in our school improvement plan.”\n&#xa0;\nThe package is responsive to the local area, pupil need and head teacher’s preference. \n&#xa0;\nSchools use City Year provision in a range of ways as highlighted by recent school Ofsted reports. For example, City Year was m\nentioned in the outstanding Ofsted reports of King Solomon Secondary Academy and Whitmore Prima\nry School and as part of their \nSMSC development.\n \n&#xa0;\nOfsted, Whitmore Primary School: &#xa0;“City Year provides enthusiastic and appropriately trained young volunteers \nto act as mentors and role models for the pupils. Together with teachers, they help establish and maintain very good relationships between pupils and staff.”\n&#xa0;\nOfsted, King Solomon Secondary Academy:  “The academy’s significant links with other \nOrganisations (for example, City Year) have a highly positive impact on the academy”.\n&#xa0;\nCity Year’s “whole school, whole child” approach has impact across the school community. School staff, parents and pupils are highly positive about the involvement of C\nity Year in their schools; two in three members of staff said the experience of City Year was ‘excellent’. 95% of teaching professionals indicated they would recommend City Year to someone else in their position in another school. \n&#xa0;\nNearly 90% of all school\ns renew their agreements with City Year after seeing its impact on their school’s overall performance. \n&#xa0;\nPenny Smith, Headteacher of Whitmore Primary School, Hackney: \n“City Year corps members are making an invaluable contribution and their energy and drive\n is being felt across the entire\n&#xa0;\nschool. City Year start the day with the children in breakfast club, followed by vigorous PT in the playground. Once the school days starts, City Year can be found supporting children in class, running games at playtime, de\nveloping sports and tutoring children.\n&#xa0;\nAll the staff, parents and children have warmly welcomed City Year to the school.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCity Year would urge the committee to recognise the importance of the aspiration deficit in explaining the underachievement of white working class children. \n&#xa0;\nWe \nhope in its recommendations the Committee will reflect on how holistic, whole school, communit\ny level support can be harnessed. For example, strengthening SMSC requirements as part of Ofsted would help schools focus effort and at\ntention on helping children develop\n the academic behaviours needed to learn throughout their school years. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThrough mor\ne focus on this by schools,\n we will learn to far\n more about the journey a young person take\ns\n to be ready to learn and achieve.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
