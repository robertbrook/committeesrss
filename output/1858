default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the 
defaultopportunity to respond to the select committee's questions as detailed below.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultTo what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? default&#xa0;defaultTo what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?default&#xa0;
defaultLocal authorities organise procurement around the legislation framework in which it has to work i.e. the Public Contract Regulations 2006. The ability to interpret these rules to enable the delivery of value for money, social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy varies not only between local authorities but also between different categories of spend in the same authority. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWaste is an area where environmental impacts are at the core of service delivery. Residents are most likely to contact elected Members with complaints in this area, therefore having a significant impact on the structure of the service as remedial action is taken. Authorities consult with customers to encourage recycling through domestic collections and at bring sites again helping authorities to shape the service. Reduction of carbon emissions from the collection fleet is important and Landfill tax encourages wise disposal of waste e.g. 
defaultCoventry
default and 
defaultSolihull
default have had a shared waste disposal incinerator since the early 1990's 
defaulthttp://www.cswdc.co.uk
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCollaboration at County/ District Council levels are hindered by sovereignty issues e.g. the conflict between waste collection and disposal authorities leads to inflated 
defaultcosts to the tax payer. As an example of this the Disposal authority often has little time to plan treatment for 
defaultbiowaste
default and are therefore paying higher costs through waste travelling longer distances
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial Care is a category where consultation with clients is essential to achieve desired outcomes. With any changes to service delivery, equality impact assessments and consultations are completed which contribute to revised service specifications. Commissioners and procurement staff are developing better working relationships and procurement challenge is helping to introduce commerciality in an area where value for money sometimes got lost in the understandable rush to meet the needs of the client. Procurement helps to ensure that frameworks or contracts are in place to allow practitioners to meet client's needs in an existing commercial context. Market shaping activities and commissioning plans help the provider market better plan how they can meet future needs, although delivery in this area is not consistent. Historically providers have been engaged in regional and national activity on standard contracts for example and there is a view that this balance needs to be addressed as national organisations seem to have had significantly more influence than the local providers who may be more flexible and agile in helping to meet local needs.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Social Value Act came into force in March 2013 and since then local authorities have been considering how they can improve their procurement processes to ensure full consideration of the social implications of service delivery. Some authorities are developing social value policies 
defaultBSSEC » Birmingham City Council adopts ‘social value’ policy
default and many are applying social considerations to all areas of contracting, not just services as dictated by the Act. The Procurement Agency Essex, a collaboration of local authorities and wider public sector partners have produced a “Social Value Toolkit” for use by their members and any other public sector body which explains the methodologies to use and the benefits that can be gained by applying Social Value criteria to public procurement.
default&#xa0;
defaultTraditionally in construction contracts apprenticeships, local supply chains, local employment and environmental impacts have been taken into consideration either formally through the procurement process or through relationship development once the contract has been let. In Solihull MBC Building Schools for the Future, economic development and regeneration staff worked with the successful contractor on local employment, apprenticeships and organised training for the local supply chain to ensure they were bid ready to become sub contractors for the construction project.
default&#xa0;
defaultCoventry CC have developed a "working differently together forum" with the voluntary sector where the council and the voluntary sector have had an opportunity to enter into dialogue on how to achieve co design of services and how to improve procurement processes to give more of a level playing field to organisations who may fail financial assessments, may not be able to afford large insurance policies and may not be able to bid for larger contracts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSCAPE, a partnership of 6 local authorities (see 
defaulthttp://www.scapebuild.co.uk/
default) has a master framework agreement for construction projects which requires the successful supplier to engage with local construction firms and supply chains to encourage the use of local SME companies as close as possible to the point of project delivery.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is possible to develop long term relationships with contractors and to keep those relationships demonstrating value for money. Solihull MBC have had partnering contracts for Building Maintenance and Mechanical and Electrical works since 
default2007
default. Over that time the partners have worked hard to develop shared computer systems, 
defaultco location of staff, shared training and development, local supply chains, local employment, apprenticeships, standardisation of equipment throughout the asset base and many other benefits. The contracts have delivered year on year cost reduction whilst consistently being able to demonstrate high customer satisfaction. The contracts have recently been re let at lower cost and are now open to be used by any authority in the country. The existing contractor won the mechanical and electrical contract and a new contractor was successful for the building maintenance contract. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIn addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local governmentdefault&#xa0;
defaultLocal authorities have been collaborating on procurement through consortia for over 25 years, and have benefited from increased purchasing power and the sharing of best practice as a result of this activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA's National Procurement Strategy recognises that there is currently a mixed economy of collaborative provision which can be confusing for individual authority's and is recommending that national category strategies are developed which will recommend the most appropriate method of procurement, whether national, regional or local for the range of procurement activities within that category. The recommendation is that local authority consortia or central government organisations will let the appropriate frameworks once they are agreed. Three pilots are underway looking at ICT, energy and construction 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently there are concerns or perceptions amongst procurement officers regarding consortia and central government contracts which need to be addressed to ensure better take up of collaborative opportunities. These include:
default&#xa0;
defaultPFI contracts were a useful way to get new buildings built that could not otherwise be afforded. The principle of design, build, fund and operate was sound to encourage the designs to be cost effective and workable as the same bidder would be operating the buildings for the next 25 years. In reality these contracts have proved to be inflexible and expensive whilst sometimes encouraging perverse behaviour. e.g. primary schools where the temperature of the boilers is controlled remotely by "head office" where they contractually are bound to not let the coldest part of the building go 
defaultbelow a certain temperature. This means that the majority of the building is too hot and all the windows are open in the middle of winter.
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil's are under pressure to make year on year savings whereas the unitary charge for a PFI or PPP contract is fixed for the next 25 years. Termination is a real option being considered by local authorities as they would regain control of the assets and the land allowing them to think more innovatively on the regeneration and development of their local economies. The London Fire Brigade terminated their vehicles and equipment PFI contract last November. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a shortage of skilled procurement officers available to local authorities. In the West Midlands, 
defaultCoventry
default, 
defaultSolihull
default and Herefordshire have had difficulties in the last 12 months when trying to recruit category managers and the quality of applications was low. Local authorities are unusual in the breadth of categories they are required to cover and private sector colleagues who may be more likely to have the required skill set, tend not to have the breadth of category experience to meet local authority needs. Persuading and influencing skills are critical in the public sector as often procurement clients or stakeholders are reluctant to take recommended courses of action or are risk averse, whereas in the private sector directorates or departments are mandated to use corporate contracts or agreements. Even though similar salaries to the private sector are now offered, limited applications are received. It is particularly hard to find social care category experts and the only solution is to "grow your own". 
default&#xa0;
defaultProcurement is a transferable skill. If authorities were more disciplined in documenting category strategies and recording market knowledge etc. it would be easier for procurement professionals to get up to speed more quickly in categories where they have had limited experience. In addition electronic flowcharts or decision trees on how to follow EU Directives and comply with individual authority's rules for contracts or standing orders should be readily accessible to all procurement staff. These simple tools could help staff with basic skills develop into effective category managers.
default&#xa0;
defaultContract Management and supplier relationship management skills are more readily available in the private sector than the public sector and these tools are critical in preventing value leakage, waste and ineffective contracts. Relationship management and development to a point where both parties have shared values, trust each other, jointly solve problems and work to achieve shared desired outcomes can improve efficiency significantly. This does not mean that the parties never disagree or challenge each other in fact just the opposite, however the joint problem solving approach means that both parties learn and find ways to taking cost out of the system. It is in this sort of contractual relationship that it is easier to deliver on social and economic benefits as there are often advantages for both parties. Service providers may be struggling to recruit apprentices, whilst the Council may be struggling to find employment for care leavers. Unless the parties are comfortable 
defaultenough to think widely around the problem these beneficial solutions may not be found.
default&#xa0;
defaultProcurement Management information is improving all of the time. Many authorities have used an external provider to provide a one off analysis of third party expenditure. Whilst this is useful for authorities where they have little or no management information, authorities with better information find that the categorisation can be misleading as large chunks of spend could easily categorised inappropriately without further investigation e.g. Serco or Capita could be providing specific service contracts or off the shelf software packages. The 
defaultideal
default is to get to an in house solution where all suppliers are categorised when they are set up on the system and accurate management information produced in house. Significant work has been put in place to get contract registers more up to date and if these registers are aligned with the spend analysis data then category managers are much better informed when writing their category strategies and developing their procurement plans. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the 
defaultCoventry
default, 
defaultSolihull
default and Warwickshire sub region authorities have been working as a shared procurement service to develop category strategies for four years with some success. However work in this area varies between different authorities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain there are pockets of excellence where the client management function is well developed with flexible contracts which allow authorities to meet changing conditions. The forthcoming report from the LGA and the Audit Commission on contract management in local government will give examples of where this good practice can be found including case studies of the good work that has taken place.
default&#xa0;
defaultBuckinghamshire County Council is introducing a new Contract Management Application software system.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThis will go live in September and will, provide a single, council-wide database of all contracts.
default&#xa0;
default It has been described as a ‘ground-breaking system revolutionising the way council contracts are stored and managed’. The system will help with understanding of how well contracts are performing and how well the council is managing contracts and suppliers.
default&#xa0;
default This is important for creating a strong position from which to drive even better value for money from third party spend. Research suggests that good contract management can help an organisation save around 5% of its supply chain costs and the data provided by the system, as well as the more commercial behaviour it encourages, will help to identify savings opportunities and negotiate more effectively.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe system will also collect information of interest to Members and residents, such as compliments and complaints made about Council services directly to third party suppliers and data on key issues such as contract performance and safeguarding.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe venture, which has been developed with ICT strategy partner, 
defaultArcus
default Global, has been set up as a commercial gain share arrangement and it is possible that Buckinghamshire could bring in additional money by selling the software to other local authorities who are already interested in buying it.”
default&#xa0;
defaultSmall local authorities such as districts and boroughs tend to lack the expertise and resources to have effective risk management and client management functions in place. There are no easy answers to this, although partnership can certainly help. In Hertfordshire, the Hertfordshire Waste Partnership works together to agree an appropriate market strategy for county-wide services, such as the selling on of paper 
defaultrecyclate
default, and commissions one of the partners to procure and establish an appropriate contract. This concentrates both expertise and resource effectively, whilst also ensuring that the contract has greater resilience, flexibility and a proportionate approach to risk agreed by all partners.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthorities with procurement services include contract conditions as standard in these areas and structure their procurement processes to reduce the opportunity for fraud. Fraud and whistle blowing policies have been adopted and training has taken place for procurement officers on how to identify fraud. All procurement Officers who are CIPS members have signed up to the CIPS Code of Ethics will be well versed in how they should conduct themselves.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat said there is still a heavy reliance on internal and external audit together with whistle blowing to identify fraud when it happens
default&#xa0;
defaultSome authorities have adopted policies to combat fraud which are published on their websites. Links to Solihull MBC’s policies are below:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough the majority of authorities publish their expenditure over £500 on a monthly basis and publish their contracts on the internet, there are very few queries or issues generated by the public through this route. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal authorities have increasingly recognised the importance of their procurement activity being subject to public scrutiny. In the East of England, 48 of the 52 local authorities have contributed their contracts data to a region-wide contracts database which is freely accessible on-line: 
defaulthttp://contracts.eelga.gov.uk/
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedom of information requests are dealt with within agreed timescales and it is rare for information to be withheld due to commercial sensitivity. To maximise market opportunity, authorities have to maintain a balance between being transparent and having a reputation as an authority that releases commercially sensitive documents they may lose bidders potential commercial advantage. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInternal audit committees and external auditors regularly consider procurement i.e. contracts let, tendering processes and contract management arrangements, making recommendations for improvement where issues are highlighted. 
defaultThe EU Remedies Directive ensures that procurement professionals are always considering whether they are being fair open and transparent at all stages of procurement as they do not want to receive challenges which would mean re running the tender exercise or in extreme cases incurring fines and significant legal costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor procurement under the EU thresholds each Authority has their own Standing Orders/Rules for contracts and Financial Regulations which detail how officers should conduct themselves many of which refer to value for money, Code of Conduct and prevention of corruption. Solihull MBC’s Rules for Contracts are attached for information. 
default&#xa0;
defaulthttp://www.solihull.gov.uk/Attachments/Rules_for_Contract_Council_2010.pdf
default&#xa0;
defaultLikewise, authority’s standard terms and conditions of contract refer to prevention of fraud and corruption explaining contractor’s responsibilities; the code of conduct by which the authority expects its employees to behave and the fact that identified fraud is a termination event. It is accepted that terms and conditions of this nature are generally used by procurement professionals and in some authorities the procurement service’s spend coverage is patchy.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll of the above together with increasing pre procurement engagement with the market (voluntary sector, social enterprises, SME’s and larger private sector organisations) should reassure government that value for money is being delivered by local government procurement professionals.
