Regulation.7. Conclusion.&#xa0;Brief Introduction.&#xa0;   I am an individual who has held a full driving licence since the late 1960's, &amp; has had extensive driving experience in the Middle East and Europe including the UK, during this time I have had no cautions or convictions for any motoring offence, or even a parking fine. Therefore I feel that I have had sufficient experience to comment on the subject being considered by the Transport Committee.   I have no opinions for or against cyclists, nor any support for 'Petrol Heads' or other individuals who believe the car is king. However , there is a growing body of 'cyclist-activists' who wish to claim the roads for themselves. &#xa0;Main Thrust of Discussion.&#xa0;1. Bias in favour of cyclists on the roads.&#xa0;    Once again a cyclist-activist has been on TV (Mr Chris Boardman on the Daily Politics show, Wed 18th Dec. 2013) blaming all cyclist deaths on vehicles. Although it is agreed that city roads tend to be more unsafe than town or rural roads, the blame for cyclist deaths or injuries can not always be blamed on others, and not the cyclist themselves.   When a cyclist-activist appears on/in the media, there is never anyone from the non-cycling section of the community to counter the cyclists claims.&#xa0;2. Safety.&#xa0;   i. Many cyclists do not wear safety helmets, Mr Chris Boardman on the Politics Show was not wearing a helmet, &amp; side tracked the question 'why not?'.&#xa0;   ii. A growing number of cyclists fail to have front &amp; rear lights, even in the dark. Even Mr Boardman did not have them fitted, yes it was daylight but it could have started raining.&#xa0;   iii. Many cyclists do not wear reflective clothing or accessories.&#xa0;   iv. There is no check or requirement for cyclists to have eyesight tests, or inform relevant authority if they have a medical problem.&#xa0;   v. Many cyclists carry rucksacks on their back, this makes for a high center of gravity, and more chance of losing control.&#xa0;3. Training.&#xa0;   i. There is no requirement for a cyclist to be tested on the 'Highway Code', but motorist are.&#xa0;  ii. There is no requirement for cyclists to take a cyclist driving test, unlike motorists. In fact an individual can purchase a cycle and immediately cycle on the road without previously riding a cycle.&#xa0;4. Road Craft.&#xa0;   i. Very often cyclists drive through red lights.&#xa0;   ii. They also cycle across pedestrian crossings to cut through traffic.&#xa0;   iii. Cyclists think that footpaths &amp; pavements are for their use and not pedestrians. If advised by pedestrians, reply with 'F*** Off'. Even in pedestrianised precincts cyclists cycle through with the Police just standing &amp; watching.&#xa0;   iv. More of a problem are the groups of cyclists who ride two &amp; three abreast.&#xa0;   v. Cyclists manoeuvre without hand signals, &amp; change lanes between vehicles.&#xa0;   vi. They ride up centrally behind HGVs, vans, &amp; buses and then attempt to undertake from the blind spot.&#xa0;5. Mechanical Road Worthiness.&#xa0;   There is no requirement for a cycle to be 'tested' to insure that lights, tyres, or brakes are in good condition and working. However, all vehicles &amp; motorbikes have to have an MOT test.&#xa0;&#xa0;6. Regulation.&#xa0;   i. There is no requirement for cycles to be registered and have a visible registration plate. As a motorist, my car has to be registered by the DVLA and my number plates visible &amp; in good condition.&#xa0;   ii. Cyclists are not required by law to have a minimum 3rd Party Insurance to cover damage to other vehicles. Once again for motorists this is a requirement.&#xa0;   iii. Cyclists are not required by law to pay the Annual Road Tax, but are complaining about not enough cycle lanes and many pot holes.&#xa0;   iv. Without registration plates there is no way to curb the poor road craft at junctions and make cyclists liable for breaking the Highway Code.&#xa0;7. Conclusion.&#xa0;   Everyday in Chepstow I see one or more cyclists acting as in Para's 2 &amp; 4 above. In addition there is a purpose built cycle path alongside the A466 Link Road from Chepstow to Junction 2 of the M48. Yet cyclists still insist on cycling along the A466, instead of the cycle path which is clearly marked.   In Bristol (City of the Bike) it is even worse, cyclists ignore cycle lanes, short cut roundabouts using zebra crossings, cycle down roads on the wrong side, &amp; even go down one way streets the wrong way, against oncoming traffic.   Yes, I am a car owner &amp; driver, and admit that some drivers pull some daft manoeuvres on the roads. However, for any small infringement I am liable for an on the spot fine by Police, for example a light going out during the journey.Recommendations.&#xa0;  i. A National Education &amp; Publicity Programme should be implemented to educate cyclists, this is ongoing for motorists to be aware of motorbikes under the 'Think Bike' campaign.&#xa0;   ii. It should be made compulsory by law for cyclists to wear safety helmets &amp; reflective clothing/equipment, and be liable for an on the spot fine by Police. Obviously persons wearing turbans due to religion to be exempt.&#xa0;   iii. It should be compulsory by law that cycles are roadworthy, and the cyclist liable to on the spot fines by Police. This to include tyres, lights, &amp; brakes, an ideal would be for cycles to have to under go an official cycle MOT and be certificated.&#xa0;   iv. The introduction of compulsory minimum 3rd Party Insurance for cyclists.&#xa0;   v. The introduction of an Annual Cycle Road Tax for cycles.&#xa0;Finally.&#xa0;   Mr Chris Boardman is a poor example of a safe cyclist, yes he is a gold medal winner, but that was on track, during the short film on the Politics Show pontificating about safety for cyclists, he had no helmet, no reflective clothing, no lights on his bike (even though it was daylight, it could have started to rain), and even on TV failed to indicate that he was moving off into traffic. Last but not least, it appeared at one stage towards the end he was actually cycling along the pavement.   This is typical of the cycling-activists who rant that vehicles are not in tune with them, but they ignore simple rules. They rant about cyclist deaths, no wants these, but it is never mentioned if &amp; when a cyclist was at fault. Seeing some of the cyclists around, it is a good bet some of these accidents are self imposed.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
