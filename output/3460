These two responsibilities have clear synergies, and enable shared objectives and priorities to be identified and progressed across 
defaultthe two organisations. PHE and FSA have established a joint oversight group to ensure effective and timely liaison and collaboration between the two organisations in relation to food safety and health protection, with the overall aim of ensuring the protection of public health in England through effective collaboration between PHE and the FSA in all matters relating to food safety and health protection.

defaultTo identify joint strategic priorities in relation to food safety and health protection, and to ensure that appropriate working arrangements are in place to deliver those joint priorities.

defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo ensure clear understanding between PHE and FSA of the methodologies
default&#xa0;
default used by each organisation in relation to epidemiological investigations and investigation of the food chain, and the evidence to support action, to enable effective joint working when addressing incidents and outbreaks.
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo develop a joint system of review and learning from incidents and outbreaks that will result in the positive learning of lessons for future joint investigations.
default&#xa0;
default This to include identifying and learning from good practice. Initial issues to be considered are horse meat and cryptosporidium
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCollaboration on science, such as the Global Microbial Identifier Initiative, in order to share knowledge and inputs.
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMapping of communication routes between the two organisations, recognising that both are complex organisations and that we need to identify the best way of ensuring communication between the organisations and with local authorities is effective.
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo agree protocols for the effective sharing of information between organisations, including routine surveillance information, and alerts on food safety and on health protection issues.
defaulth)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo develop and maintain a memorandum of understanding between the organisations to reflect the above.
defaulti)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo consider potential formalised joint working arrangements such as secondments of staff between the FSA and PHE.
defaultj)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo plan and execute joint engagement with Directors of Public Health in England on matters of common interest.
defaultk)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo plan and execute joint engagement with public health bodies in the other nations of the UK on matters of common interest.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe FSA’s reflection on the first few months of operation of these arrangements, and the effective collaboration that has developed between the two organisations for example in the management of food-related outbreaks of illness, is extremely positive.
