"&#xa0;\nChris Truman Davies – Written evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;As a resident of the \nNidderdale\n AONB since 1996, Treasurer/Membership Secretary of the North Yorkshire Fell Club and a regular walker in the Yorkshire Dales, the North Yorkshire Moors and Lake District I have not only witnessed illegal use of off-road vehicles on BOATS, UCRs, Bridleways and even footpaths, but I regularly see evidence of the wilful damage caused by irresponsible use of recreational vehicles. See photographs below.\nBackground and reasonsThe National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Beauty (AONBs) of \nEngland\n and \nWales\n are important assets and valuable parts of our national heritage. They contain landscape and wildlife of international importance. They are treasured for their great beauty and for the opportunities they provide for healthy outdoor leisure activities. They attract large numbers of tourists, both from this country and abroad, creating an important source of income. Many people live and work in the National Parks and the AONBs.\nThe National Parks and AONBs require protection from activities which can damage them or interfere with the above activities. Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the core activities described above and the presence of recreational motor vehicles, mainly four-wheel drives and motor cycles, on unsealed roads and adjacent land.\nAs a member of the North Yorkshire Fell Club I participate in frequent walks in the National Parks and AONBs of northern \nEngland\n. I have direct experience of the damage caused by recreational off-road vehicles on unsealed roads. Serious damage is caused to the surface and ruts several feet deep are created. Drainage is adversely affected and damage progressively spreads over a wide area as the offending vehicles widen their area of activity. Eventually, walking, cycling and horse-riding on these ancient routes become impossible. Areas of the National Parks and AONBs cannot then fulfil their functions as areas for recreation. Tourists are deterred from visiting them and an important source of income is forfeited.\nRecreational vehicle users bring very little income into the National Parks and AONBs. They buy fuel \nelsewhere,\n drive into these sensitive areas, cause damage and leave. Noise, fumes and interference with other activities exacerbate the nuisance which they cause and act as further deterrents to legitimate leisure activities, work and tourism.\nHighways authorities have a responsibility to maintain many of these unsealed roads. As soon as repairs are carried out, the users of recreational vehicles resume their activities and the cycle of damage and repair begins again, at great public expense.\nAttempts by the National Parks and AONBs to control and eliminate this nuisance are expensive and time-consuming and is an unaffordable and unnecessary drain on expenditure.\nThis damaging and anomalous situation arises from archaic laws which were developed before motor vehicles were invented. Their application in a modern situation is inappropriate, damaging and expensive. By revoking legislation which is no longer of practical use, the proposals made above will clarify the responsibilities \nof National Parks, AONBs and highway authorities, solve a serious problem, make substantial savings and promote economic growth.\nSpecific advantages of the proposalsa\n). Environmental improvements and the prevention of serious damage to our National Parks and Areas of outstanding Natural Beauty.\nb). Reduction\n the work of the National Park\n, AONB and highway authorities in investigating legal rights, consulting interested parties, controlling damaging activities and managing repairs to damaged unsealed roads.\nc). \nSaving\n repair costs.\nd). Removing an obstacle to legitimate leisure activities such as walking, cycling and horse-riding.\ne). Encouraging economic growth in the National Parks and AONBs by removing a \ndeterrent to tourism.\n&#xa0;\nI emphatically support the proposals made by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) that the Bill should contain the following provisions:\n&#xa0;\nAll unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATS), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being art of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.&#xa0;When a local Authority declines to impose a Traffic Regulation Order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or to a magistrate.&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                                          Dead Man's Hill - Upper Nidderdale 2 Sept 2011&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                            Dead Man's Hill - Upper Nidderdale 2 Sept 2011&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              Mastiles Lane - Wharfedale 23 May 2005&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                                          High Lane - Wensleydale - 31 May 2009&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                                          Dales Way - Wharfedale - 14 June 2009&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                            Carlton Moor - Coverdale - 25 May 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Picture not published here.\n Picture not published here.\n Picture not published here.\n"
