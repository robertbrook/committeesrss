[[[Structure and Governance of First Trust Bank]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]First Trust Bank is a trade name of AIB Group (UK) p.l.c, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks p.l.c., a Bank incorporated in the Republic of Ireland and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  AIB Group (UK) p.l.c is directly authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and is a dual supervised firm, being supervised on prudential matters by the PRA and on conduct matters by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). As a directly authorised UK firm AIB Group p.l.c has its own governance and management structure distinct from its parent Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c.&#xa0;AIB Group (UK) p.l.c. trades as AIB (GB) in England, Scotland and Wales and First Trust Bank in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;The governance structure for the bank is established at a UK level. AIB Group (UK) p.l.c  has its own Board and Audit Committee. First Trust Bank is represented on the board by the Head of the First Trust Bank business.  Reporting into the board are a number of executive level committees dealing with strategy and business performance, risk issues, customer issues and change management. All of these committees operate on a UK wide basis with representation from First Trust Bank.&#xa0;First Trust Bank and AIB (GB) have their own Leadership Teams responsible for implementing the respective business strategies.&#xa0;AIB (GB) and First Trust Bank have quite different customer bases. AIB (GB) is a niche player in the UK market focusing on the SME market and particularly on businesses with Irish trade links. First Trust Bank offers a mass market retail banking service and also focuses on the SME market with a Business Banking proposition within Northern Ireland.&#xa0;There is no disadvantage to the banks personal or business customers in Northern Ireland as a result of the governance structures outlined above. &#xa0;&#xa0;There have been a number of ‘Access to Finance’ surveys in recent years.&#xa0;These focus on the extent to which lending Demand (customers) and/or lending Supply (banks) issues are contributing to lower levels of lending to SMEs. First Trust Bank has been proactive over the past 18 months in the communication and delivery of its Open for Business agenda/initiatives as follows:- June 2012              £50m First Trust Bank Business Support Fund launched through regional business roadshows and the Key Business Introducer (KBI) network. Transparent terms include a discounted margin/fee package for loans &lt;£250,000, with standard credit application form-              First Trust Bank’s lending pipeline is supported by BBA statistics in terms of customer numbers and transaction values, where participation over the period September 2011 to March 2013 confirms a performance above the bank’s natural market share. This has been against a background of a reducing market (re loan values) over the same period. The First Trust Bank lending pipeline figure also demonstrates a continuous engagement with non-bank customers, with this market segment consistently making up at least 50% of the pipeline.-              Looking ahead we expect to continue to enhance and invest in our SME proposition through:

[[[usiness Lending]]]First Trust Bank is participating in a number of key initiatives identified by the Business Taskforce (launched October 2010):&#xa0;- Credit Appeals&#xa0;Procedures have been put in place to ensure that all eligible applicants are advised of their right of appeal simultaneously to being advised of the decision to decline their application for bank funding. An independent Credit Appeals Officer adjudicates on any appeal lodged of appeal. Statistics on the level and outcome of appeals are advised monthly to the Business Finance Taskforce appointed monitoring authority – Promontory Financial Group. The process is considered fit for purpose and the communication of the right of appeal is clear and timely. &#xa0;-  Business Mentoring&#xa0;Four experienced business lenders were identified in September 2011 providing full geographic coverage of Northern Ireland. They undertook training via Better Business Finance and Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative. In Q1 2012 the four mentors became the points of contact for the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and were available on a reactive basis to liaise with new/established businesses. The mentors are not confined to discussing funding requirements and are available to discuss all matters relating to the business. The service is provided at no cost to the business. &#xa0;&#xa0;-  Enterprise Finance Guarantee&#xa0;First Trust Bank offers funding secured (in part or in whole) by guarantees under the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) Scheme (since April 2009). Our participation in the scheme is regularly advertised to staff members to assist in providing suitable levels of funding for their clients. All guarantees were provided at 75% of the approved funding. The guarantees are provided subject to portfolio caps. The cap is agreed between the lending institution and EFG and is based upon the level of new business written annually. Aggregate amount of guarantees available to First Trust Bank customers is limited to 15% of the first £1,000,000 of new business and 9.25% of any further new business.   &#xa0;Applications for funding are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with eligibility determined by the EFG eligibility criteria. Parameters for EFG are borrowings between £25,001 and £1,000,000. Availability of the funding supported by EFG is accordingly restricted by these amounts and the operation of portfolio caps.&#xa0;&#xa0;
