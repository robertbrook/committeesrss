[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Norfolk [CST0066][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank 
[normal]you for your letter, relating to 
[normal]the Public 
[normal]Administration Select Committee's inquiry into crime statistics
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]share your view that it is essential that we ensure that crimes are 
[normal]recorded properly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Within your 
[normal]letter 
[normal]you ask two questions, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]have 
[normal]included 
[normal]below, 
[normal]together 
[normal]with my response:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What, [bold]if any, [bold]targets do [bold]you set [bold]for [bold]your police [bold]force? What [bold]impact [bold]do [bold]you think [bold]this has [bold]on police [bold]recording [bold]crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My Police and Crime Plan sets out policing objectives, which are one of the ways in which I hold the Chief Constable to account on behalf of those who live; work and visit Norfolk
[normal]. 
[normal]Each objective 
[normal]includes 
[normal]a performance measure. The performance measures that 
[normal]relate to 
[normal]crime statistics 
[normal]link 
[normal]to crimes, which are referred 
[normal]to 
[normal]as 'Priority Crimes
[normal]'
[normal], 
[normal]and are those 
[normal]I 
[normal]have 
[normal]agreed 
[normal]with the Chief Constable are the most serious. 
[normal]This is in the 
[normal]understanding that some crimes, such as hate crimes and sexual offences are under reported and an 
[normal]increase in 
[normal]the recording of these is 
[normal]encouraged. The impact 
[normal]of including performance 
[normal]measures in 
[normal]this way 
[normal]is 
[normal]that resources are focussed on the crimes that present the greatest harm, 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chief Constable holds his staff to account 
[normal]for performance in 
[normal]these areas and the 
[normal]public, in 
[normal]turn, holds me to account.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How [bold]do you assure yourself that the recorded crime [bold]figures [bold]for your area are correct? [bold]To what [bold]extent can [bold]you trust the [bold]crime statistics for [bold]your [bold]area.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In Norfolk, the Crime Registrar 
[normal]has 
[normal]oversight and is the final decision maker for the Constabulary in respect of crime 
[normal]recording. The 
[normal]Registrar and his team work 
[normal]independently 
[normal]from those with investigative roles and 
[normal]reports 
[normal]directly to the Chief Constable. 
[normal]I 
[normal]receive 
[normal]regular 
[normal]written reports from the Chief Constable regarding the Registrar's work in this area and the result of monitoring and audits
[normal]. 
[normal]The Registrar attends 
[normal]my 
[normal]meetings with the Chief Constable when these reports are presented, so 
[normal]I 
[normal]can discuss any concerns 
[normal]that 
[normal]arise with the Chief Constable and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Registrar
[normal]personally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite these safeguards, 
[normal]it 
[normal]is 
[normal]inevitable 
[normal]that 
[normal]from 
[normal]time to time decisions will be made regarding crime recording that others may later 
[normal]review 
[normal]and come to different conclusions with regards to the classification. Audits show that this 
[normal]is 
[normal]on the minority of occasions and when this occurs, 
[normal]interventions 
[normal]are made to rectify emerging 
[normal]issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key to ensuring that statistics are recorded accurately 
[normal]is 
[normal]clear and unambiguous 
[normal]national 
[normal]guidance regarding the 
[normal]record
[normal]i
[normal]ng of crime, so that objective decisions can be made regarding 
[normal]classifications, 
[normal]which are clear for the professionals and for the public to understand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Should you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact me.
