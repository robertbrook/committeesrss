[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Response to [bold]the [bold]C[bold]ommittee’s [bold]questions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]i) the extent to which
[normal] members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii) the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements 
[normal]of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii) the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work revi
[normal]ewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv) the adequacy of the review of electrical wor
[normal]ks carried out by Competent Persons;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]v) the effect of competition between accr
[normal]editation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]vi) the adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes
[normal];

[normal]Annex A[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Section 3: Certification, inspection and testing[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]General[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]For n
[normal]otifiable electrical 
[normal]installation 
[normal]work
[normal],
[normal] one of the following 
[normal]three
[normal] procedures
[normal] must be used
[normal] to 
[normal]certify
[normal] that the work complies with the requirements set 
[normal]out in the Building Regulations.
[normal]a.
[normal]              
[normal]S
[normal]elf-certification by a 
[normal]registered competent person
[normal].
[normal]b.
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]hird-party certification by a 
[normal]registered 
[normal]third-party certifier
[normal].
[normal]c.
[normal]              
[normal]C
[normal]ertification by a
[normal] 
[normal]building control body
[normal].
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]To verify that the design and installation
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]electrical work 
[normal]is adequate
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]that installations will be 
[normal]safe to use, maintain and alter, the electrical work 
[normal]should be inspected and tested in accordance with
[normal] the procedures in 
[normal]BS 7671[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]              [bold]NOTE: [bold]Electrical inspection
[normal] and test forms should be given to the person ordering the work. Build
[normal]ing Regulations certificates should normally be given to the occupier, but i
[normal]n the case of rented properties
[normal] may be given to 
[normal]the person ordering the work and copied to the occupier.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Self-certification by a registered competent person[bold]3.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Electrical installe
[normal]rs 
[normal]who are 
[normal]registered competent person
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]should complete 
[normal]a 
[normal]BS 7671[bold] 
[normal]electrical installation
[normal] certificate 
[normal]for
[normal] every job they undertake. 
[normal]The electrical installer should give 
[normal]the certificate to the 
[normal]person ordering the work
[normal].
[normal]3.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]The installer or the installer’s 
[normal]registration body must
[normal] 
[normal]within 30 days of the work being completed
[normal] do both of the following.
[normal] 
[normal]a.
[normal]              
[normal]Give
[normal] a 
[normal]copy of the 
[normal]Building Regulations compliance certificate
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] the occupier
[normal].
[normal]b.
[normal]              
[normal]Give the certificate, or 
[normal]a copy of the information on the certificate
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to t
[normal]he
[normal] 
[normal]building control body
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Certification by a registered third[bold] [bold]party[bold] [bold]3.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Before work begins, an installer who is not a 
[normal]registered competent person
[normal] may 
[normal]appoint 
[normal]a 
[normal]registered 
[normal]third-party certifier
[normal] to inspect and test the work as necessary
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]3.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]Within 5 days of completing the work, the installer must notify the 
[normal]registered third-party certifier
[normal] who, subject to the results of the inspection and testing being satisfactory,
[normal] 
[normal]should 
[normal]then 
[normal]complete a
[normal]n electrical installation
[normal] 
[normal]condition report
[normal] and give 
[normal]it
[normal] 
[normal]to the 
[normal]person ordering the work
[normal].
[normal]NOTE: [bold]The
[normal] e
[normal]lectrical
[normal] installation condition report should be the model 
[normal]BS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7671[bold] form or one developed specifically for Part P purposes. 
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]The registration body of the 
[normal]third-party certifier
[normal] must
[normal] within 30 days of a satisfa
[normal]ctory condition report being issued do both of the following.
[normal] 
[normal]a.
[normal]              
[normal]Give a copy of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Building Regulations compliance certificate
[normal] to the occupier
[normal].
[normal]b.
[normal]              
[normal]Give the certificate, or 
[normal]a copy of the information on the certificate
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to t
[normal]he 
[normal]building control body
[normal].
[normal]Certificatio[bold]n by a building control body[bold]3.
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]If an installer is not a 
[normal]registered competent person
[normal] 
[normal]and has not appointed a 
[normal]registered third-party certifier
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]then b
[normal]efore work
[normal] begins the installer must 
[normal]notify a 
[normal]building control body
[normal]. 
[normal]3.9
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]building control
[normal] body
[normal] will determin
[normal]e
[normal] the extent of inspection and testing needed
[normal] for it
[normal] to establish that the work is safe
[normal],
[normal] based on the nature of the electrical work and the competence of the inst
[normal]aller. T
[normal]he 
[normal]building control body
[normal] 
[normal]may 
[normal]choose to 
[normal]carry out any necessary 
[normal]inspection and testing
[normal] itself, or 
[normal]it may 
[normal]contract a specialist
[normal] to carry 
[normal]out some or all of the work 
[normal]and furnish it with an electrical installation condition report
[normal]. 
[normal]3.10
[normal]              
[normal]An installer who is 
[normal]competent to carry out inspection and testing 
[normal]should
[normal] give 
[normal]the app
[normal]ropriate
[normal] 
[normal]BS 7671[bold] certificate
[normal] 
[normal]to the 
[normal]building control body
[normal], who will then take the certificate 
[normal]and the installer’s qualifications into account in deciding what further action
[normal], 
[normal]if any
[normal], 
[normal]it needs to take. 
[normal]Building control bodies
[normal] 
[normal]may 
[normal]ask installers for evidence
[normal] 
[normal]of their
[normal] qualifi
[normal]cations
[normal].
[normal]3.11
[normal]              
[normal]This 
[normal]can
[normal] result in a lower building control charge as, when setting its charge, a local authority is required by
[normal] the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 2010 
[normal]to take account of the amount of inspection work that it
[normal] considers it will need to carry out.
[normal]3.12
[normal]              
[normal]Once the 
[normal]building control body
[normal] has decided that, as far as can be ascertained, the work meets all 
[normal]B
[normal]uilding 
[normal]R
[normal]egulations requirements, it will issue to the occupier a 
[normal]B
[normal]uilding 
[normal]R
[normal]egulations completion certificate (if 
[normal]a local authority) or a final certificate (if an approved inspector).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Inspection and testing of non-notifiable work[bold]3.1
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]N
[normal]on-notifiable 
[normal]electrical installation
[normal] work
[normal], like notifiable work,
[normal] should be 
[normal]designed and installed,
[normal] 
[normal]and inspected, tested and certifi
[normal]cated 
[normal]in accordance with 
[normal]BS 7671[bold].
[normal]3.14
[normal]              
[normal]If local authorities find that non-notifiable work is unsafe and non-compliant, they can take enforcement action.
