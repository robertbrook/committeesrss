"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Roger Leary (CYS0009)\n&#xa0;\nMake motorists have a duty of care and change the law so that a motorist involved in an accident is assumed to be at fault and will be prosecuted unless he can reasonably demonstrate the cyclist was behaving badly/unsafely.\neg\n witness confirms cyclist cycled throught red light.\nLaw stating motorists must give cyclist minimum 1 metre clearance when passing - otherwise an offence is committed.\nProsecute cyclists \nmore frequently for transgressions.\nMake it advantageous that a c\nyclist on the Public Highway is insured. If you are injured and you are not insured then any legal damages you are entitled to will be significantly reduced - by perhaps 50%. I don't think compulsory insurance would work/ be enforceable but this might help\n.\ncoi\n - cyclist - recently knocked off my bicycle by blithering idiot. I was behaving 'perfectly'. 2nd serious accident in 4 years, neither avoidable.\nI am insured and member of CTC.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
