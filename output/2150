defaultYorkshire Dales National Park Authority – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultSummary default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultYorkshire Dales National Park Authority supports the submission made by National Parks England, on behalf of English National Park Authorities.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission is intended to provide more detail in relation to the points made in that submission about Traffic Regulation Orders (TRO). 
default 
defaultSpecifically:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultComments on defaultSection 18 Ascertainment of public rights of way: proceduredefault&#xa0;
defaultS
defaultection
default 18
default outlines changes to the procedures for ascertaining public rights of way.  This includes simplifying the process to give clarity where there is agreement
default on changes that should be made to the Definitive Map
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority
default ask
defaults
default that the 
defaultCommittee
default considers including
default, within this section,
default a provision to simplify the process of revoking a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO)
default 
defaultmade in relation to s.22BB(1) of the Road Traffic Regulation 
defaultAct 1984
default.
default  Specifically where it
default prevent
defaults
default use by mechanically propelled
default vehicles, 
defaulton an unsealed route
default, and
default whe
defaultre
default later a Definitive Map Modification Order
default (DMMO)
default is made under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and clarifies that there are no public rights for mechanically propelled vehicles.  At this point the TRO no longer serves its intended purpose.  However
default,
default to revoke the 
defaultTRO
default in these circumstances requires the instigation
default and complete reverse 
defaultof the consultation and advertising procedures laid out in The National Park Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England) Regulations 2007 SI 2007 No 2542.
default  It would be in the spirit of the Bill if a TRO, in these circumstances, could be revoked ‘automatically’ when a DMMO is made as outlined above.  We ask that such a provision be applied retrospectively.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultEvidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority has made 10 TROs which have the effect of preventing public use by 
defaultmechanically propelled vehicles on unsealed route
defaults.  It has recently undertaken a review of these TROs and found them to be very effective in achieving their intended purpose of preserving the amenity, and/or conserving the special qualities of the area through which the routes pass.  (A hyperlink of the Authority’s report of the review is appended for
default defaultbackground information
default default-
default defaultAppendix 1default)
default.  At the time of making the TROs, (most were made in 2008), all of these routes had either proven or possible public rights for motor vehicles.  In respect of two of the routes there have since been Definitive Map Modification Orders that have clarified that those routes do not have public rights for motor
default vehicles 
defaultalong their full length.  Therefore they cannot be used as through routes by recreational motor vehicles and the TROs are no longer needed.  The Authority is seeking to revoke these TROs.  However, the legislation to revoke a TRO, as it currently stands, is very onerous, because of the number that are likely to be received and the staff resource required to undertake the consultations and respond in accordance with the
default 
defaultNational Park Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Proced
defaulture) (England) Regulations 2007.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe hyperlink of the report attached at 
defaultAppendix 2default shows the number and complexity of responses we received when we last made a TRO.  We understand that the Peak District National Park Authority, as part of their more recent TRO consultations, have received ten times this number.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn considering this issue we also draw attention to the need for secondary legislation in relation to the 
defaultNational Park Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England) Regulations 2007 SI 2007 No 2542
default regulation 14.  
defaultBefore deciding whether to make an order, the National Park 
defaultA
defaultuthority must consider
default all representations made under the Regulations.  Within 
default14 days after making an order
default a National Park 
defaultA
defaultuthority must give notice in writing that the order has been made to any person who made representations under regulation 7.  Where a person objected to the Order and the National Park 
defaultA
defaultuthority did not accede to those objections, 
defaultthe National Park 
defaultA
defaultuthority must give its reasons for not so acceding in the notice given to that person. 
default 
defaultT
defaulthe individual nature and complexity of the consultation responses, means 
defaultthat 
defaultwriting to each individual 
defaultaddressing
default the points they had raised
default is the clearest way of discharging this duty
default.  
defaultIt would be much better, however, if the Regulations allowed the National Park Authority to simply point the individual to a summary report.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusion default&#xa0;
defaultIn conclusion, a
defaults part of the commitment to reduce red tape and the deregulatory process 
defaultthe Yorkshire dales National Park Authority
default would like to see measures to simplify the TRO making and revoking process on unsealed routes in National Parks.
