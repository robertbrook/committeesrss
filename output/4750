[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. General information
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I submit these comments in two capacities: as a private citizen and regular cyclist, and as a district councillor representing a village ward 
[normal]whose main population centre is 
[normal]three miles from the nearest town wi
[normal]th railway station. When I say ‘
[normal]regular c
[normal]yclist
[normal]’
[normal], I mean cyclist for the purposes of getting from A to B rather than for leisure or sporting purposes.
[normal] My contact details appear at the end of this submission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] My general premise is that we as a society have a pressing need to encourage respon
[normal]sible cycling. We have a demand for mobility that cannot sustainably be fulfilled by private motorised transport or public/collective transport, so we must do everything we can to encourage people to cycle. Bu
[normal]t with this encouragement must come with 
[normal]an 
[normal]cor
[normal]responding 
[normal]encouragement that cyclists cannot be allowed to wreak havoc with more vulnerable road/street users, notably pedestrians.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Road layout
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In my experience the safest layout for cyclists is a dedicated lane, separated from the main carriageway by a small strip of kerb or a line of bushes. These are not entirely without their drawbacks 
[normal]–
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]cyclist going the opposite way to the traffic can
[normal] be blinded by dipped headlights, and a cyclist on a cycle path segregated from the main carriageway by bushes may feel vulnerable after dark, especially if there are no street lights. So it is not a 100% safe solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Wh
[normal]en asking cyclists why they 
[normal]don’
[normal]t cycle certain routes, the answer I often get is a feeling of vulnerability when sharing roads with traffic doing more than 30mph. I have therefore adopted the unofficial approach of seeking road layout solutions for 30mph zones and segregated cycle l
[normal]anes for roads where traffic can legally do more than 30mph. There is a grey area where traffic is in a 30mph zone but likely to be doing more having just left a much faster stretch of road
[normal] (and thus presents a cause of fear that might deter cyclists)
[normal], but
[normal] this has to be tackled case by case.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is no doubt
[normal] in my mind that cyclists feel a lot safer in 20mph zones, and the greater proliferation of these zones is important. They do not guarantee that cars, vans and lorries will actually drive at 20, 
[normal]but they often mean a vehicle that might otherwise do 35 will feel compelled to do 25, which makes a massive difference for cyclists. The one problem is that many 20mph zones are regulated by road humps or 
[normal]‘sleeping policemen’
[normal], and these act as an obstacle
[normal] to cycling. Ro
[normal]ad layouts where the hump doesn’
[normal]t go right to the end of the road help the cyclist, though care must be take
[normal]n to ensure that doing so doesn’
[normal]t encourage cycling at speeds that endanger the welfare of pedestrians, especially as cyclists would 
[normal]be encouraged to go very close to pavements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Police and traffic wardens must be encouraged to clamp down on parking across cycle lanes, and the few cases where parking across cycle lanes is permitted should be abolished. There is no point investing i
[normal]n cycle lanes, even i
[normal]f they are only a painted line o
[normal]n 
[normal]the surface 
[normal]of 
[normal]a carriageway, if cyclists are regularly going to have to go round parked vehicles 
[normal]–
[normal] it
[normal] 
[normal]takes away the entire reason for having a cycle lane.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] What is very irritating for cyclists i
[normal]s having short stretches of cycle lan
[normal]es in urban areas. If a cyclist
[normal] makes the effort to get onto a cycle lane and then within 200 metres has to get back onto the main traffic carriageway, there seems little point in using the cycle lane in the first place
[normal]. Any short-stretch lanes should be built only 
[normal]if there is a presumption 
[normal]that in the longer term they will form part of a longer cycle lane.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Helmets
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I am a supporter of helmets but a very strong opponent of their being made compulsory. We need to encourage as much cycling as possible, and having cycled in Australia and New Zealand where helmets are a requirement, I have seen how this adds to the h
[normal]assle factor and deters some people from cycling. I have also seen audited figures showing that cycle use has gone down in the immediate aftermath of helmets being made compulsory (around 30% in Australia in the first year, with no obvious recovery). 
[normal]W
[normal]ith 
[normal]compulsory wearing of helmets
[normal], t
[normal]here is also an element of forcing the victim to take evasive action from the aggressor 
[normal]–
[normal] while
[normal] 
[normal]this may be sensible, 
[normal]it is wrong in principle. After all, 
[normal]if we forced women to wear non-provocative clothing to avoid the risk
[normal] of being molested there would be an outcry (and quite right!), so we need to mak
[normal]e the point that cycling is socially and personally beneficial
[normal], and while wearing a helmet may be sensible, it should not be a requirement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For many years the Department
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]or
[normal] Transport adopted a policy of saying it wanted to encourage the wearing of cycle helmets but it w
[normal]ouldn’
[normal]t make them obligatory until usage reached a critical mass. 
[normal]This intrinsically deters those who want to maintain the right not to wear a helmet from
[normal] wearing one in such circumstances as make sense. Therefore, while encouraging the use of cycle helmets
[normal], especially in urban areas, is entirely legitimate, 
[normal]the Department for Transport 
[normal]should make it clear that making helmets compulsory is not on the agend
[normal]a. This may well encourage a greater take-up of helmets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Public information
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The big success of making drinking and driving unacceptable came through public information campaigns, as did other successful campaigns like smoking. 
[normal]The scope for help
[normal]ing the safety of cycling through such public information campaigns is immense. 
[normal]Australia went far beyond Britain with
[normal] some very graphic mock-ups of i
[normal]nconsolable children crying after a parent had been killed due t
[normal]o drink driving (with a slogan ‘If you 
[normal]drink and drive you’re a bloody idiot!’
[normal]). Such campaigns may not need to be so stark, but they could take any number of forms:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Alerting people
[normal] to the need to
[normal] encourage cycling, perhaps highlighting
[normal] the health benefits of cycling as well as ease of 
[normal]parking and reducing congestion and emissions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Alerting motorists to the danger of opening doors without looking (a real fear of many cyclists)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Making motorists aware of the need for a bit of extra space between them and cyclists
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.4
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Enc
[normal]ouraging cyclists to be responsible and not to terrorise pedestrians.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Many angry motorists view cyclists as paras
[normal]ites, because motorists have to 
[normal]pay road tax and fuel duty, while cyclists use state-
[normal]funded road infrastructure for ‘
[normal]free
[normal]’
[normal] (if they
[normal] pay t
[normal]ax, they pay for it indirectly so it’
[normal]s not really free, but to some motorists it feels like it
[normal] is
[normal]). Public information film
[normal]s about the benefits to society of cycling could defuse some of this anger.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] With numerous 10/15-second advertising slots on You
[normal]Tube before a video is played, there is scope for both short internet public information films 
[normal]and slightly longer television ‘
[normal]adverts
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. A fair deal
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The need to encourage cycling does not mean cyclists should be molly-coddled and given special rights. Any message 
[normal]–
[normal] through
[normal] 
[normal]public information films or general government guidance 
[normal]–
[normal] should
[normal] 
[normal]be that with rights come responsibilities, and cyclists shoul
[normal]d be pulled up for inappropriate cycling. 
[normal]The ‘deal’ that provides better infrastructure for cyclists should also include t
[normal]he police 
[normal]being encouraged
[normal] to check bicycles for tyre tread 
[normal]and lights (as long as it doesn’
[normal]t become excessive, given the need to enc
[normal]ourage
[normal] cycling), and it should be acceptable for an officer
[normal] to pull someone up for cycling in a way that intimidates pedestrians. In my experience, most cyclists are responsible, and 
[normal]abhor the reputation of cyclists being tarnished by a few reckless people
[normal] who cycle at great speed through 
[normal]pedestrianised
[normal] shopping centres.
[normal] T
[normal]he few irresponsible ones may not be receptive to public information films and the idea that responsible cycling should be encouraged
[normal], but might become so if stopped by a police officer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Such a deal is not just a matter of fairness, it also buys cyclists some benefits.
[normal] Most urban areas have road layouts
[normal] where a cyclist can cut the length of his/her journey, or perhaps avoid a hill, by doing a short stretch along a pavement or through 
[normal]a 
[normal]pedestr
[normal]ianised
[normal] zone. It is in everyone’
[normal]s interest that cyclists should be allowed to do this, 
[normal]as long as the cyclist is responsible and sensitive, 
[normal]so having a culture whereby it is unacceptable and in some way punishable to cycle inappropriately in areas
[normal] where pedestrians rightly have the priority has to be the way to go.
