default1. General information
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;
default I submit these comments in two capacities: as a private citizen and regular cyclist, and as a district councillor representing a village ward 
defaultwhose main population centre is 
defaultthree miles from the nearest town wi
defaultth railway station. When I say ‘
defaultregular c
defaultyclist
default’
default, I mean cyclist for the purposes of getting from A to B rather than for leisure or sporting purposes.
default My contact details appear at the end of this submission.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;
default My general premise is that we as a society have a pressing need to encourage respon
defaultsible cycling. We have a demand for mobility that cannot sustainably be fulfilled by private motorised transport or public/collective transport, so we must do everything we can to encourage people to cycle. Bu
defaultt with this encouragement must come with 
defaultan 
defaultcor
defaultresponding 
defaultencouragement that cyclists cannot be allowed to wreak havoc with more vulnerable road/street users, notably pedestrians.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. Road layout
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;
default In my experience the safest layout for cyclists is a dedicated lane, separated from the main carriageway by a small strip of kerb or a line of bushes. These are not entirely without their drawbacks 
default–
default a
default 
defaultcyclist going the opposite way to the traffic can
default be blinded by dipped headlights, and a cyclist on a cycle path segregated from the main carriageway by bushes may feel vulnerable after dark, especially if there are no street lights. So it is not a 100% safe solution.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;
default Wh
defaulten asking cyclists why they 
defaultdon’
defaultt cycle certain routes, the answer I often get is a feeling of vulnerability when sharing roads with traffic doing more than 30mph. I have therefore adopted the unofficial approach of seeking road layout solutions for 30mph zones and segregated cycle l
defaultanes for roads where traffic can legally do more than 30mph. There is a grey area where traffic is in a 30mph zone but likely to be doing more having just left a much faster stretch of road
default (and thus presents a cause of fear that might deter cyclists)
default, but
default this has to be tackled case by case.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;
default There is no doubt
default in my mind that cyclists feel a lot safer in 20mph zones, and the greater proliferation of these zones is important. They do not guarantee that cars, vans and lorries will actually drive at 20, 
defaultbut they often mean a vehicle that might otherwise do 35 will feel compelled to do 25, which makes a massive difference for cyclists. The one problem is that many 20mph zones are regulated by road humps or 
default‘sleeping policemen’
default, and these act as an obstacle
default to cycling. Ro
defaultad layouts where the hump doesn’
defaultt go right to the end of the road help the cyclist, though care must be take
defaultn to ensure that doing so doesn’
defaultt encourage cycling at speeds that endanger the welfare of pedestrians, especially as cyclists would 
defaultbe encouraged to go very close to pavements.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;
default Police and traffic wardens must be encouraged to clamp down on parking across cycle lanes, and the few cases where parking across cycle lanes is permitted should be abolished. There is no point investing i
defaultn cycle lanes, even i
defaultf they are only a painted line o
defaultn 
defaultthe surface 
defaultof 
defaulta carriageway, if cyclists are regularly going to have to go round parked vehicles 
default–
default it
default 
defaulttakes away the entire reason for having a cycle lane.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;
default What is very irritating for cyclists i
defaults having short stretches of cycle lan
defaultes in urban areas. If a cyclist
default makes the effort to get onto a cycle lane and then within 200 metres has to get back onto the main traffic carriageway, there seems little point in using the cycle lane in the first place
default. Any short-stretch lanes should be built only 
defaultif there is a presumption 
defaultthat in the longer term they will form part of a longer cycle lane.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. Helmets
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;
default I am a supporter of helmets but a very strong opponent of their being made compulsory. We need to encourage as much cycling as possible, and having cycled in Australia and New Zealand where helmets are a requirement, I have seen how this adds to the h
defaultassle factor and deters some people from cycling. I have also seen audited figures showing that cycle use has gone down in the immediate aftermath of helmets being made compulsory (around 30% in Australia in the first year, with no obvious recovery). 
defaultW
defaultith 
defaultcompulsory wearing of helmets
default, t
defaulthere is also an element of forcing the victim to take evasive action from the aggressor 
default–
default while
default 
defaultthis may be sensible, 
defaultit is wrong in principle. After all, 
defaultif we forced women to wear non-provocative clothing to avoid the risk
default of being molested there would be an outcry (and quite right!), so we need to mak
defaulte the point that cycling is socially and personally beneficial
default, and while wearing a helmet may be sensible, it should not be a requirement.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;
default For many years the Department
default 
defaultf
defaultor
default Transport adopted a policy of saying it wanted to encourage the wearing of cycle helmets but it w
defaultouldn’
defaultt make them obligatory until usage reached a critical mass. 
defaultThis intrinsically deters those who want to maintain the right not to wear a helmet from
default wearing one in such circumstances as make sense. Therefore, while encouraging the use of cycle helmets
default, especially in urban areas, is entirely legitimate, 
defaultthe Department for Transport 
defaultshould make it clear that making helmets compulsory is not on the agend
defaulta. This may well encourage a greater take-up of helmets.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. Public information
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;
default The big success of making drinking and driving unacceptable came through public information campaigns, as did other successful campaigns like smoking. 
defaultThe scope for help
defaulting the safety of cycling through such public information campaigns is immense. 
defaultAustralia went far beyond Britain with
default some very graphic mock-ups of i
defaultnconsolable children crying after a parent had been killed due t
defaulto drink driving (with a slogan ‘If you 
defaultdrink and drive you’re a bloody idiot!’
default). Such campaigns may not need to be so stark, but they could take any number of forms:
default&#xa0;
default4.1.1
default&#xa0;
default Alerting people
default to the need to
default encourage cycling, perhaps highlighting
default the health benefits of cycling as well as ease of 
defaultparking and reducing congestion and emissions
default&#xa0;
default4.1.2
default&#xa0;
default Alerting motorists to the danger of opening doors without looking (a real fear of many cyclists)
default&#xa0;
default4.1.3
default&#xa0;
default Making motorists aware of the need for a bit of extra space between them and cyclists
default&#xa0;
default4.1.4
default&#xa0;
default Enc
defaultouraging cyclists to be responsible and not to terrorise pedestrians.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;
default Many angry motorists view cyclists as paras
defaultites, because motorists have to 
defaultpay road tax and fuel duty, while cyclists use state-
defaultfunded road infrastructure for ‘
defaultfree
default’
default (if they
default pay t
defaultax, they pay for it indirectly so it’
defaults not really free, but to some motorists it feels like it
default is
default). Public information film
defaults about the benefits to society of cycling could defuse some of this anger.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;
default With numerous 10/15-second advertising slots on You
defaultTube before a video is played, there is scope for both short internet public information films 
defaultand slightly longer television ‘
defaultadverts
default’
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. A fair deal
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;
default The need to encourage cycling does not mean cyclists should be molly-coddled and given special rights. Any message 
default–
default through
default 
defaultpublic information films or general government guidance 
default–
default should
default 
defaultbe that with rights come responsibilities, and cyclists shoul
defaultd be pulled up for inappropriate cycling. 
defaultThe ‘deal’ that provides better infrastructure for cyclists should also include t
defaulthe police 
defaultbeing encouraged
default to check bicycles for tyre tread 
defaultand lights (as long as it doesn’
defaultt become excessive, given the need to enc
defaultourage
default cycling), and it should be acceptable for an officer
default to pull someone up for cycling in a way that intimidates pedestrians. In my experience, most cyclists are responsible, and 
defaultabhor the reputation of cyclists being tarnished by a few reckless people
default who cycle at great speed through 
defaultpedestrianised
default shopping centres.
default T
defaulthe few irresponsible ones may not be receptive to public information films and the idea that responsible cycling should be encouraged
default, but might become so if stopped by a police officer.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;
default Such a deal is not just a matter of fairness, it also buys cyclists some benefits.
default Most urban areas have road layouts
default where a cyclist can cut the length of his/her journey, or perhaps avoid a hill, by doing a short stretch along a pavement or through 
defaulta 
defaultpedestr
defaultianised
default zone. It is in everyone’
defaults interest that cyclists should be allowed to do this, 
defaultas long as the cyclist is responsible and sensitive, 
defaultso having a culture whereby it is unacceptable and in some way punishable to cycle inappropriately in areas
default where pedestrians rightly have the priority has to be the way to go.
