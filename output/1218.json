"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Emma Thomson (WSC002)The most obvious issue is that women get pregnant and there is no funding to replace them. When I hired my first post-doctoral assistant, I was acutely aware that she is young and female and might get pregnant. I would be unable to replace her with an alte\nrnative as there is \nadditional \nno funding for this.  \nAs well as issues around pregnancy, there is discrimination against hiring women both by women and men probably because of stereotypes that are present \non TV, in the education system etc. A recent article in Nature highlighted this issue – simply by changing the name of an applicant from male to female reduced the female candidate’s chances\nThis\n means that 50% of the best talent is lost\nProvide \nfunding to replace people on maternity leave.\nSweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway lead the way on this. I understand that they provide paternity leave and maternity leave thus removing the male/female divide: i.e. either parent takes a longer period off work.\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
