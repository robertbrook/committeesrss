defaultI welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Home Affairs Select Committee’s second inquiry into Police and Crime Commissioners.   My submission is based around my own experience as a Police and Crime Commissioner in the areas the Committee has indicated it intends to address.  
default&#xa0;defaultThe effectiveness of Commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police servicedefault&#xa0;

defaultIn Cheshire, I have been working closely with the Chief Constable and his senior leadership team to prevent and reduce crime.  Since the introduction of my Police and Crime Plan in April 2013, there have been over 1,000 fewer victims of crime in Cheshire and a 16% reduction in the number of re-offenders.  In September 2013, the Constabulary recorded the lowest volume of crimes for many years and victim satisfaction with the overall service received has increased to 89%, the fourth highest nationally.   
default 
defaultI have also robustly challenged the Chief Constable in areas where I believe there is a need for improvement.  For instance, I ha
defaultd
default some concern regarding the rate of detections for bur
defaultglary dwelling offences and
default commissioned HMIC to conduct a formal rev
defaultiew of
default burglary investigations.
default  As a result of this
default,
default the Constabulary introduced more rigour to the process which has positively contributed to the crime and detection figures.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI have worked with the Constabulary to introduce strategies which tackle issues highlighted within my 
defaultPolice and Crime 
defaultPlan, for instance a Mental Health Strategy and a Rural, Heritage and Wildlife Crime Strategy. 
defaultThe Mental Health Strategy will increase the confidence and skills of front line officers in dealing with mental health incidents and use this information with the health service, Mental Health Trusts and local authority partners to develop better pathways to help individuals with mental health needs. For those with acute needs, the focus is on ensuring that they are assessed in appropriate places of safety, particularly when under the influence of alcohol and drugs.  The Rural Crime Strategy will ensure that an effective, efficient and proportionate response is provided to crimes and incidents affecting rural communities and Cheshire’s wildlife and heritage assets.

defaultIn terms of delivering an efficient police service, upon taking up office, I instigated a root and branch review of all aspects of policing in Cheshire.  This review has highlighted 
defaultareas for 
defaults
defaultignificant savings including
default: re-evaluating building agreements, procurement of uniforms and diesel for the fleet. The review has also led to a new model of policing being designed.  This will focus on local neighbourhood policing with the right capacity and capabilities to meet the 
defaultpublic’s demand
default,
default supported by lean central capabilities. This emerging model has been costed at £17 million below current costs
default.  It 
defaultwill make a significant contribution to the £3
default4
default million savi
defaultngs required over the next four
default years
default, whilst protecting frontline policing and enabling some police officer recruitment to take place.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI am not complacent and will be seeking further opportunities to increase efficiency and improve services during my term in office.  The transfer of funding to Police and Crime Commissioners to commission services for victims offers a real opportunity for us to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system and ensure that victims no longer fall through the cracks as has happened in the past.  
defaultThrough my engagement with the public
default.  I have been
default informed of cases where victims do not appear to have received an appropriate standard of service from the police or criminal justice partners.  As an elected representative of the people of Cheshire, I have challenged the relevant agency in such cases to ensure that lessons are learnt for the future.

defaultThe role of the Commissioner in holding the Chief Constable to accountdefault&#xa0;default6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI have introduced robust mechanisms to ensure that the Chief Constable is effectively held to account on behalf of the people of Cheshire.  Public 
defaultScrutiny M
defaulteetings are held on a quarterly basis at which the Chief Constable is held to account for performance against the objectives within the Police and Crime Plan and for other aspects of service delivery including financial performance, complaints and human resources.  These meetings are supplemented with monthly private sessions at which I am able 
defaultto 
defaultscrutinise a broader range of more sensitive operational performance matters.  
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI have also appointed a Deputy Commissioner, the former Independent Chairman o
defaultf the Police Authority, who has
default vast experience in holding the police to account.  The Deputy Commissioner’s portfolio includes in depth scrutiny of human resources, complaints, 
defaultand 
defaultprotective services areas of policing
default.  D
defaultip sampling of completed complaints files, firearms incidents, and public order incidents
default is undertaken by the Deputy Commissioner
default.  I believe that the scrutiny mechanisms which have been introduced provide me with a good understanding of the Constabulary’s performance and have helped contribute to the reductions in crime referred to above.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI have sought to build a positive and constructive working relationship with the Police and Crime Panel in Cheshire.   I am committed to personally attending Panel meetings so that the Panel can hold me to account for the totality of policing in Cheshire.  The agenda papers for Decision and Scrutiny Meetings are available via my website so the Panel has easy access to the decisions I have made and the information used to hold the Chi
defaultef Constable to account.  Staff 
defaultwithin my office have provided the officers who support the Panel with training so they are able to interpret the performance data which is considered.

defaultMembers of the Panel regularly attend Scrutiny Meetings to observe the Chief Constable being held to account
default, the Members provide written feedback
default 
defaultto the 
defaultPanel 
defaultwhich gives 
defaulta greater understanding of the challenges faced by the Constabulary and reassurance that I am fulfilling my statutory functions.   I have recently held an informal briefing with the Panel to outline the emerging findings from the root and branch review.  This event was productive and useful for both parties and I have now extended an invitation to the Panel to meet with me informally every six months.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIntensive discussion took place with the Chief Constable over the Summer to agree the shape of the Stage 2 transfer in Cheshire.  Our discussions were based around a set of locally agreed key principles for the transfer which included:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Transfer Scheme which I have submitted meets both the locally agreed transfer principles and those outlined by the Home Secretary. The Stage 2 Transfer Scheme which is currently awaiting the Home Secretary’s determination provides that:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of the stage 2 transfer process, a revised governance structure 
defaulthas been agreed 
defaultwith the Chief Constable 
defaultwhich will see 
defaultdecisions being taken at a Joint Management Board.  The new governance arrangements will reduce bureaucracy and duplication
default and 
defaultenable closer joint working between

default&#xa0;defaultThe role of the Commissioner in budget and precept settingdefault&#xa0;default13)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the current economic climate, a primary consideration for all Police and Crime Commissioners is how to balance the books against a backdrop of reducing financial resources, whilst seeking to maintain and improve services to the public.
default&#xa0;default14)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn setting the budget for 2013/14, I had a shortfall of £8m compared to the budget for the previous year.  I proposed to raise the council tax precept by 1.99% to £153
default for a Band D property
default, for the year 2013/14 and following extensive consultation this was supported by over 80% of the public surveyed. 
defaultThe public saw t
defaulthis increase of £3
default per annum
default, or 6p per week, as a small price to pay
default to maintain policing services in Cheshire
default.
default 
default This rise in precept was supported by the Police and Crime Panel and raised £1.2 million to help meet the shortfall.  
default&#xa0;
default15)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI am now in the process of considering the budget options for 2014/15.  A revised medium term financial strategy for 2014-18 has recently been approved and, following the root and branch review, I am confident Cheshire is on track to meet the required savings over this period.  Consultation has been taking place with the public and people have been asked whether they would be happy to pay another increase in the policing pa
defaultrt of the council tax. Out of 1084
default responses to date, 
default7
default5
default%
default of people said they would be prepared to pay a similar increase to last year. However, I am aware that people across the board are struggling, as the economy comes out of the recession. Taking all the above into consideration, I
default a
defaultm minded not to increase the council tax precept for policing next year.

defaultThe effectiveness of Commissioner’s in promoting local policing prioritiesdefault&#xa0;default16)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA key role of Police and Crime Commissioners is to consult the public on their local priorities for policing to inform the objectives
default contained 
defaultwithin the Police and Crime Plan.  During my election campaign, I listened extensively to the views of the public and took this into account when developing my first Police and Crime Plan.  I am committed to ongoing consultation with the public and recently launched a ‘Victim
default’
defaults Voice’ campaign to find what victims experience and what they expect from the police, victim support organisations and the criminal justice system
default.
default 
defaultThis will 
defaultinform my decisions when I become responsible for commissioning some elements of victims services next year.  My office has also held focus groups with 
defaultmany different victims of crime
default to understand their views on policing including: survivors of domestic abuse
default, people with mental health needs and people from the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender communities and faith groups.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are over 1 million people living in Cheshire, and 238,000 of them are under the age of 18.
default 
default I have appointed a Youth Ambassador to represent their views following consultation with young people about what they wanted from this role.  The Youth Ambassador has already gathered the views of over 1000 young people about personal safety, crime and policing and has been working with a myriad of organisations to provide advice and 
defaultunderstand young people’s views
default. 
default The information obtained will be used to influence my Police and Crime Plan and future policing strategies.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to be accessible to the people of Cheshire, I hold regular surgeries through the County and I have launched the Cheshire Crime Fighter App which enables local people to interact with the Constabulary.    A Crime Prevention Fund has also been launched which allows people to apply for funding to support community projects or initiatives. Since July, I’ve received 40 applications and granted over £58,000. All of the projects aim to improve people’s lives in their local area, by providing services or diversionary activities to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGreater collaboration will be essential to 
defaultensure the police service can provide the best possible service to the public.  T
defaulthe pace of change on collaboration 
defaultis currently 
defaulttoo slow
default and 
defaultI believe Commissioners must start driving this agenda now and look beyond regional collaborations which have prevailed in the past.  A good example of looking beyond region
defaultal boundaries is the successful, innovative 
defaultcollaboration between Cheshire and Northamptonshire to deliver back office support functions whilst reducing costs.
default  In Cheshire, the Constabulary and I are also working with neighbouring forces to explore opportunities for collaboration in respect of both operational policing and back office support functions.

defaultI am a member of the Strategic Police Procurement Board which is working to drive greater collaboration and efficiencies from police procurement practices.  I have also recently met representatives from the Fire &amp; Rescue Service and Ambulance Service to discuss collaboration opportunities between the three services.  Initial discussions have been positive and I am keen that we work together to deliver savings from better joined up working which can be reinvested on the front line.

defaultTransparency of and reporting by Commissioners to datedefault&#xa0;default21)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to be accountable to the public, the decisions and performance of Commissioners must be visible and transparent.  I have strived to ensure that I am open and to demonstrate a high level of transparency.  Since taking up office, agenda papers for Decision Meetings and the notes of these meetings have been published on my website, providing details of significant decisions which have been taken.  Registers of interests and expense claims for myself and the 
defaultDeputy Commissioner are also readily available on the website.   The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire is able to demonstrate a high level of compliance with the statutory requirements to publish specified information.
