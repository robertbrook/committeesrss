&#xa0;Supplementary written evidence from the RAC Foundation (SRN0057)&#xa0;At the Better Roads evidence session yesterday in discussion with Mr Stringer I promised to provide references to specific road schemes.&#xa0;They are as follows&#xa0;http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/providing_and_funding_strategic_roads-arup-071111.pdf&#xa0;(especially the table in Appendix A)&#xa0;http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/providing%20and%20funding%20strategic%20roads%20-%20january%202012%20update.pdf&#xa0;http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/road_programmes_england-smith-june2013.pdf&#xa0;The third of these is the most recent and dates from June 2013.&#xa0; Since then, of course, there have been several further announcements and some of the schemes have been given a firm go-ahead (including the A14).&#xa0; We are in the process of compiling a more up to date list.&#xa0;We very much welcome the Department for Transportâ€™s commitment to create a Roads Investment Strategy and hope that the process of developing that will lead to a coherent government statement of which roads will be improved or built, in what sequence and how they will be paid for.&#xa0;Yours sincerely&#xa0;Stephen Glaister CBE PhD FICE FTRF FCGIDirectorRAC FoundationJanuary 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
