default April 2011 when SCRI (Scottish Crop Research Institute) and the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute joined forces to create one of the world’s leading scientific organisations focusing on 
defaultpeople, 
defaultland, crops, water and the environment. The Institute has a significant programme of inter
default-
defaultdisciplinary research 
default(including social sciences) 
defaulton climate change as it relates to food, water security, and provision of ecosystem services. Staff at the Institute have coordinated and been partners in research projects looking at all aspects of climate change for funders including policy makers such as 
defaultthe 
defaultScottish Government and the EU.

default&#xa0;
defaultResearch undertaken by The James Hutton Institute
default,
default partners 
defaultand 
defaultin the 
defaultbroader literature 
defaultshows that
default:
default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn general, the seriousness of climate change is broadly understood by the public, but not universally accepted (
defaulti.e. 
defaultGILDED European Policy Brief 4
default, COST Action 
default2009
default, Walthall et al 2013
default).
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultP
defaultublic understanding of climate change science 
defaultmay be
default becoming increasingly well understood, 
defaultbut
default this is not necessarily reflected in peo
defaultple’s beliefs and behaviours (IPCC AR4 2007 and comments below).
default1.2.1.
default 
defaultHowever, climate change as a concept and the way it affects 
defaultpeople
default is poorly understood by the public, and is easily confused with other aspects of climate, such as the weather.
default 
default1.2.2.
default 
defaultI
defaultnterviews with the public 
defaultindicate that climate change i
defaults perceived as an abstract, scientific concept. To become 
defaultmore 
defaultmeaningful this concept needs to be translated into actions and images in relation to
default everyday life, e.g.
default anchoring the idea of climate change in the concept of air pollution, and the objectification of this idea as ‘smoking chimney sta
defaultcks’ or fumes from car exhausts. Such 
defaultan approach
default 
defaulttranslates
default climate change into a more concrete, tangible reality that peopl
defaulte can
default relate to
default (GILDED 2012)
default.
default1.2.3.
default 
defaultHowever, this only addresses the perceived ‘visible’ aspect of greenhouse gas emissions as pollution, not from sources like fertiliser applications and resultant N
default2
defaultO
default (GHG and ozone depleting)
default, which the public are generally unaware of.
default1.2.4.
default 
defaultThere is confusion in the terms of 
default[
defaultanthropogenic
default]
default 
defaultglobal warming and climate change.
default 
default1.2.5.
default 
defaultPublic uncertainty about climate change may have remained stabl
defaulte between 2003 and 2008 but
default the extent to which people believed that climate change claims had been exaggerated doubled over that period (Whitmarsh 2011).
default1.2.6.
default 
defaultOur belief is that, t
defaulthrough media coverage
default (particularly of extreme events)
default,
default there is a better understanding of the role of climate features, particularly the northern hemisphere polar jet stream, in influencing the weather.
default1.2.7.
default 
defaultIt is unclear how well the public understand the 
defaultconsequences
default of different levels of projected warming (i.e. 2
default°C, 4°C or
default 6°C)
default 
defaultwhich
default would be better served by scenario examples
default, but we suspect understanding is rather weak
default.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe state of public understanding 
defaultand 
defaultassociated
default 
defaultbeliefs 
defaultis fluid and
default influenced by multiple 
defaultfactors and 
defaultsources:

defaultocal weather 
defaultis 
defaultseen to be representative of global trends, with a disassociation between local weather conditions, anomalies elsewhere (i.e. cold winter of 2010/11 in UK and anomalous high temperatures in Canada
default, Greenland
default and Russia) and 
defaultoverall 
defaultglobal trends.
default1.3.2.
default 
defaultThe LOCAW project has found that there are often large differences in the way people conceptualise environmental problems at home and at work.  In part this is due to the differences in the social context and dynamics of home and work, but there are also important psychological mechanisms explaining this separation.
default1.3.3.
default 
defaultE
defaultxposure to scientific information cannot entirely 
defaultexplain 
defaultthe levels of public concern
default; 
defaultviews on climate change are largely affected by the actions of political groups
default,
default including statements by political leaders (Brechin 2012), or occurrence of extreme events (i.e. Hurricane Sandy in 2012).
default 
default1.3.4.
default 
defaultPeople whose livelihoods have a direct relationship with the climate (i.e. farmers, foresters
default, recreation / tourism
default) are more perceptive of observed changes and likely to undertake changes in behaviour in order to adapt (Matthews et al 2007, Matthews et al 2008, McCrum 2009).
default1.3.4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuch stakeholders can cope with significant complexity (McCrum et al. 2009) but need to be “stepped into” the issues of utilising climate change projections (to inform adaptation options) in a structured way that increases their confidence and enhances the credibility of the projections.
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere appears to be a disconnection between perceptions of risk and understanding of the current rate of greenhouse gas e
defaultmissions, 
defaulti.e. 
defaultrisk of exceeding the 2°C warming limit and 2012 CO
default2
default emissions being 58% greater than 1990 levels (Peters et al
default 2013), and how consumption based economies drive this.
default1.4.1.
default 
defaultIt is likely that there is a lack of awareness of the issue of energy and resource use intensity and extent, i.e. we may use energy more efficiently but overall use more of it 
defaultoverall 
default(Jevons’ Paradox: the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource) (SMILE 2011).

defaultconsumption

default (responses limited to things like tree-planting concerning carbon sequestration efforts (Nijnik et al., 2009; Slee et al., 2012))
default, 
defaultwith little connection made to the

defaultGHG consequences from

defaultbiodiversity,

defaultparticularly climate regulation
default and decreasing carbon sink capacity) and ocean acidification
default (Trumper et al 2009
default, Nijnik and Halder, 2
default012; Dyer
default and Nijnik, in press
default).
default 
default1.5.1.
default 
defaultThere is an absence of awareness by the public on key issues of biodiversity and ecosystem functions
default, their degrading state
default and
default consequences on
default their 
defaultessential 
defaultrole in climate 
defaultregulation or potential as the 
defaultbasis for 
defaultclimate change mitigation and 
defaultadaptation (UNEP 2011
defaulta, b)
default.
default1.5.2.
default 
defaultSimilarly there is 
defaultconfusion between
default the relationships between GHG emissions, climate change and food security (i.e. risks to productivity from impacts, nitrous oxide and methane emissions from agriculture)
default and ecosystem services
default.
default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUncertainty in climate change model projections may be translated into perceptions of uncertainty as to its existence.
default1.6.1.
default 
defaultPeople are increasingly reporting a feeling of being swamped with information, and this will necessarily constrain their ability to process any new information.
default1.6.2.
default 
defaultThe release of the UKCP09 probabilistic projections had limited success in helping inform the public about the range of possible changes.
default&#xa0;
defaultClimate change related to energy:
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultE
defaultnvironmental NGOs and other third sector actors are the most trusted sources of influence in relation to energy saving (GILDED European Policy Brief 4). This is followed by the media, Authorities (e.g.
default Government energy departments
default) and friends, which are ahead of central government and local government, with EU politic
defaultian
defaults and authorities coming last. 
default2.1.1.
default 
defaultTh
defaultis 
defaultsuggest that government, advisers and scientists should concentrate on building the existing consensus, that current resource use is unsustainable, rather than attempting to convince the public of the scientific view on climate change.
default2.1.2.
default 
defaultThe GILDED project provides evidence that individuals show a preference for a lead to be taken by government (at EU, National and local levels) through allowing public bodies and stakeholder partnerships to demonstrate the benefits of action across different sectors, such as infrastructure, transport and energy planning. 
default2.1.3.
default 
defaultInternational policy (e.g. EU) should enable national governments and industry leaders to implement tangible GHG reduction practices alongside policies focused at other levels 
default(Nijnik and Bizikova, 2008), (
defaulte.g. household, individual) in order to engender a sense of shared responsibility for action. 
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence suggests that policymakers and local authorities have a role to play in drawing attention to business models 
defaultthat
default demonstrate continued profits as a result of responding to climate change policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. 
default2.2.1.
default 
defaultPolicy incentives that encourage business leadership are required to build public acceptance of the need to adopt more climate friendly lifestyles. In environments where public funding might be scarce such policies may be the main drivers for achieving overall policy goals relating to addressing climate change. 
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultnformation and advice on climate change policy needs to be clear, consistent and linked to feedback on the impact that collective action is making. Such information needs to relate primarily to tangible goals and behaviours, such as reducing energy or increasing recycling, which are easier for people to relate to than more abstract concepts relating to climate change in general.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn developing communication approaches to improve public understanding of climate change leading to positive behavioural responses, it is necessary to understand the range and variability of individuals
default and communities
default, the motivations that influence them and how they react to information.
default3.1.1.
default 
defaultCommunication of uncertainty should address the range of possible variability and how this might affect people.
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst
default policy and market forces are the primary drivers of behaviour change, social norms and relationships with peers and friends within communities do influence decision-makin
defaultg and uptake of new behaviours.
default3.2.1.
default 
defaultEnvironmental values can be developed from an early age via family, peers, formal and informal education, media including television, books, 
defaultnewspapers, 
defaultma
defaultgazines and 
defaultnew social media
default:
default 
defaultthe internet
default, social networking, blogs etc
default.
default3.2.2.
default 
defaultWhile knowledge on its own is not usually sufficient to drive behaviour change, educational policy that promotes an understanding of the science underlying environment issues means that individuals are better equipped to make future decisions to adopt pro-environmental behaviours.
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStakeholders who mediate between individuals and their communities and regional authorities are recognised as key to building partnerships and networks necessary for coo
defaultrdinated policy implementation.
default3.3.1.
default 
defaultSuch third sector actors (NGOs, community development groups etc.), can be powerful stakeholders because they mediate between households and those implementing policy at different levels and therefore have considerable leverage on the degree to which policies can influence behaviour. 
default3.3.2.
default 
defaultP
defaultublic and private bodies need to continue efforts to engage in network building, showcasing examples of good practice, and these should improve the transmission of information and skills
default (Bizikova et al., 2012)
default. This includes identification of local stakeholders who may become drivers of energy saving and awareness raising, and whose economic interests and moral commitments are associated with energy saving and use of renewable sources.
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSurveys of climate change issues may be problematic in that there is heterogeneity in responses due to 
defaultmotivation and ability to process information in decision strategies (Fischer and Glenk 2011).
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClimate scepticism may be particularly common amongst older people from lower socio-economic backgrounds who are conservative and hold traditional values (Tradition, Conformity, Security). In contrast, climate scepticism was less common among younger people from higher socio-economic backgrounds who hold self-transcendence (Universalism, Benevolence) and environmental values. 
defaultW
defaulthilst those non-sceptical of climate change showed attitudinal certainty, those scept
defaultical of climate change did not, suggesting
default that people who are sceptical might be easily convinced of its true nature. This in turn suggests that public understanding of climate change might be improved by concentrating on changing the attitudes of 
defaultsceptics
default 
default(Poortinga et al 2011)
default.
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe media
default (traditional and new social)
default, along with 
defaultscientists and 
defaultother stakeholders
default (including teachers and education professionals)
default, 
defaultcan
default play a positive role in assisting with information exchange between different levels, building networks of activists and tra
defaultnsferring skills and knowledge.
default3.6.1.
default 
defaultBut this can be reversed 
defaultor distorted 
defaultif powerful sceptics influence the
defaultse
default media
default types
default.
default3.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic understanding could be improved by presenting the public with consistent and accurate messages about what climate change is. Corner et al 
default(
default2012
default)
default found that attitudes towards climate change became significantly more sceptical after reading newspaper editorials that made opposing claims about the reality and seriousness of climate change. 
default3.7.1.
default 
defaultA key iss
defaultue here is the media presenting
default 
defaultrepresentative coverage
default on climate change issues 
default(informed by scientific consensus) 
defaultrather than 
defaultgiving equal weighting to 
defaultopposing (polarised) views.
default3.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultForms of communication and message content needs to be tailored to target audiences.
default3.8.1.
default 
defaultThe use of case studies putting impacts and consequences in terms that people can place into the contexts of their own 
defaultdaily 
defaultlives, i.e. reduced crop yields leading to shortages and price increases.
default3.8.2.
default 
defaultMedia can reduce the perception of isolation of the problem: that individuals acting alone will not be significant.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe James Hutton Institute
default research suggests that public understanding of climate change is 
defaultvery 
defaultimportant in
default developing effective policies:
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a key role for participatory partnerships in developing viable recommendation for policy development (Aquarius 2011).
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence from the GILDED FP7 European project, which looked at individuals’ lifestyle choices and understandings of energy issues, notes that people find climate change itself an abstract idea that is not sufficiently tangible in relation to everyday life and making decisions about behaviour choices. Ideas about more concrete actions, such as waste and energy usage, are more easily understood and as a result more ‘actionable’. 
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDifferent groups within society respond more or less favourable to different policy types, depending on their values and beliefs. Policies and regulation should therefore be perceived as 
defaultgenerally 
defaultequitable and not favouring one group in society over another – most people will not take actions for the common good if others are seen to benefit without cost to themselves. 
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExample
default from climate related flood risk research
default: The results of a Scotland-wide survey show
defaulted that there wa
defaults considerable support among the Scottish public for investments into measures to adapt to floods and low flows in Scotland. Participants’ perceptions of the potential threat of flooding and low flows and the different policy options informed attitudes and willingness to pay for policy measures (Glenk and Fischer 2010).
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolicies requiring little or no personal sacrifice are more likely to be adopted than those requiring individual behaviour change. Politicians seem unwilling to make unilateral changes that they perceive will be unpopular with electorates, but the GILDED study suggests that within households people would like to see increased leadership and solid arguments from those in a position to shift policy away from the current carbon intensive society. 
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe level of importance is likely to be different between mitigation and adaptation based policies.
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence from the FarmP
defaultath project (Sutherland et al. 2012) suggests that farmers will adopt renewable energy production as an instrumental response to enhancing profit, rather than an altruistic response to climate change.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom wider research areas:
default4.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic understanding of climate change appears vital in developing effective climate change policy. Bord et al. 
default(
default2000
default)
default found
default 
defaultthat the key determinant of behavioural intentions to address climate change was a correct understanding of the causes of climate change. 
default4.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLorenzoni et al
default 
default(
default2007
default)
default concluded
default 
defaultthat one of the main barriers to people engaging with climate change is a lack of knowledge about its causes and consequences
default [including scale dependence see 4.8.1]
default, as well as 
defaultunderstanding of the potential solutions
default. They also concluded that uncertainty and scepticism about the causes of climate change, its seriousness, and both the necessity and effectiveness of actions to mitigate climate change, are another mai
defaultn barrier to public engagement.
default4.9.1.
default 
defaultAs an example of specif
defaulti
defaultc
default relationships in causes and consequences
default that are significant but receive little public attention
default, 
defaultThe James Hutton Institute and collaborators research exploring the role of soil microbial communities in driving N
default2
defaultO emissions from arable systems suggests that fungi are important (Herold et al 2012), explain why it has been difficult to link microbial population dynamics with emissions in soil (Giles et al 2012) and demonstrates variation in emission from soil supporting different barley cultivars which may provide a route to mitigation through breeding (Daniell et al unpubl
defaultished
default).
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople who have a poor understanding of climate change, or who do not accept that anthropogenic climate change is happening, 
defaultare less likely to
default be persuaded by scientific or technical arguments to change their behaviour.
default5.1.1.
default 
defaultThere is therefore a need 
defaultfor improved communication and 
defaultto set climate change policies that aim to change behaviour in the context of more tangible environmental issues, such as energy efficiency to reduce rising fuel costs. For example, developing more energy-efficient technologies and switching to renewable energy sources are the most favoured approaches for people with pro-environmental and altruistic values, while cost-saving is more effective for people with hedon
defaultist
defaultic and egoistic values. 
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch suggests that the range of attitudes, beliefs and values among the public must be taken in to account by policy makers and civil society actors in drawing up climate change policy, by targeting different messages to different segments of the population. 
default5.2.1.
default 
defaultThus for those with altruistic and environmental values respond better to policies with an emphasis on personal responsibility, while those with egoistic or hedonistic values respond more positively to policies which have an element of cost saving. For those in-between, messages stressing the need for sustainable resource use and the government’s own commitment and initiatives may strengthen their orientation toward altruistic and environmental values.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst there may be sufficient evidence in the broad range of scientific literature and research expertise in social and behavioural sciences within the UK (and drawing on wider international capabilities) to support the capacity of the government, the cha
defaultllenges lie
default in integrating these across a broader range of science disciplines in order to develop coherent 
defaultand consistent 
defaultmessages to the public and consequential development of relevant policies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo achieve this integration of science disciplines places a large emphasis on within-government communication and collaboration across Departments. There is a need to better understand the consequences and trade-offs of proposed policies across a broad range of science areas (social, behavioural, environmental). Again, this requires inter-disciplinary research. The expertise within government to handle such levels of inter
default-
defaultdisciplinarity is currently not well developed. 
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment Departments and policy development teams can benefit greatly from the inclusion of non-obvious people (internal and external) in the team, to act as cross-disciplinary facilitators.
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBeing mindful of, and acknowledging the importance of, such connections can be useful in terms of designing strategies for formulating effective policy
default.
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUse of consistent messages and language across Departments is vital.
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithin the Scottish Government (RESAS) there is a drive for inter
default-
defaultdisciplinary co-constructed research through more joint policy focussed projects between social and physical scientists.
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team works across Departments and is seen as 
defaulta 
defaultgood example of inter
default-
defaultdisciplinary 
defaultcollaboration and has produced useful documents, i.e
default.
default ‘Behaviour Change and Energy Use’ (Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team 2012).
default6.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, 
defaultcare is needed 
defaultas there may be a tendency for review-based-evidence documents to take on a life of their own, which is potentially unhelpful when it comes to formulating recommendations for a specific policy.  Additional academic expertise is often needed to ensure that what might be called headline-theory within such documents is not translated into policy without being adequately scrutinised.
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYes, valuable lessons can be learned from the experiences of other countries
default 
default(Nijnik and Bizikova, 2008). e.g.
default a study analysing the cases  of Germany, Finland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada shows that these ‘early adapters’ (Bizikova et al., 2012) have an improved regional and national understanding of climatic impacts, and of the risks to agriculture before the initiation of the planning process. 
default7.1.1.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe interplay between bottom-up and top-down initiatives
default w
defaultas crucial in the development of adaptation strategies. The former has provided rich and robust participation in designing, implementing and monitoring adaptations, while the latter was important for prioritizing and legitimizing the development of strategy. It also provided access to high-level decision-makers and funding. 
default7.1.2.
default 
defaultThe results suggest that fosteri
defaultng cross-
defaultsectorial
default collaboration, 
defaultespecially by focusing on broader questions such as the
default role of agriculture in society, 
defaulthas become an important part of adaptation planning. 
default7.1.3.
default 
defaultResults 
defaultstress that adaptation could be enhanced by skills development and mutual learning across stakeholder groups, research and policy-makers, and through the on
default-
defaultgoing interactive development of institutional capabilities.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe challenge will be in understanding the relevant specific details per country (historical and cultural, political economy, climate, resources available etc.) and putting these into a UK context:
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDifferent countries have different cultures, laws, service infrastructures (e.g. options for heating, transportation and food), climates and available resources
default (COST Action
default 2009
default)
default. 
default7.2.1.
default 
defaultIt is therefore relevant to link and coordinate research across countries to identify lessons about public engagement with climate change policy within different governance arrangements. This will enable evidence to show which policies work best overall, and where more specific approaches might be required. For example, there may be important differences between previous Soviet-influenced and capitalist European economies, or between developed and developing countries. 
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEuropean research across different countries shows that across all countries (i
defaultn the GILDED
default study the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Scotland, Hungary and Germany) people think that climate change is a serious problem. However, in some countries people were more sceptical (thinking that climate change is exaggerated) than in others.
default&#xa0;
default7.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExamples:
default7.4.1.
default 
defaultAustralia: has an Emissio
defaultns Trading Scheme linked to the
default ‘Carbon Farming Initiative’ 
defaultto facilitate up-take of good farming practice to reduce GHG emissions and sequest carbon.
default The issue of carbon offsetting and trading has been analysed also with its relevance to the UK (Nijnik et al. 2011).
default7.4.2.
default 
defaultCosta Rica: government supports a range of Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes to support good environmental management for multiple benefits including carbon sequestration.
default However, the majority of PES schemes in Latin America (77%) set the payment levels from top-down decisions rather than from bottom-up stakeholder consultation, which can be problematic since opportunity costs (of sellers) and willingness to pay (of buyers) might need to be met (Martin-Ortega et al. 2012).
