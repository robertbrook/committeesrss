defaultThe British Psychological Society, incorporated by Royal Charter, is the learned and professional body for psychology and 
defaultpsychologists in the United Kingdom. We are a registered charity with a total membership of just over 50,000.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder its Royal Charter, the objective of the British Psychological Society is "to promote the advancement and diffusion of the knowledge of psyc
defaulthology pure and applied and especially to promote the efficiency and usefulness of members by setting up a high standard of professional education and knowledge".  We are committed to providing and disseminating evidence-based expertise and advice, engagin
defaultg with policy and decision makers, and promoting the highest standards in learning and teaching, professional practice and 
defaultresearch.

defaultThe British Psychological Society is an examining body granting certificates and diplomas in specialist areas of professio
defaultnal applied psychology

default2.2  
defaultIn psychology, as 
defaultwith the humanities, there is a leaky pipeline but it occurs l
defaultater on than in the harder STEM
default subjects where it is more a matter of moving women from PhD to 
defaultpostdoc
default to lectureship. 
default2.3 In psychology it operates differently. Nearly all of our undergraduates are female yet that only equates to an average 50/50 split at lecturer/senior lecturer lev
defaultels and then women are again under-represented at the higher levels. In what is a female dominated subject, this gender discrepancy at 
defaultthe higher levels in troubling. 
defaultIt simply becomes harder for women to be promoted there. Some of this can be argued to be
default due to family policies whereby women pay the 'mommy penalty'. However, studies have demonstrated that this doesn't explain it all satisfactorily. 
default2.4 Several reasons ranging from decisions about childcare to bias. However, it would be a mistake to decid
defaulte that interventions at the top of companies/universities will affect attitudes about gender and science. Beliefs about what is/isn’t a possible or suitable career for boys and girls are set in mid-childhood (around 8-10 years).
default2.4 
defaultThe Athena SWAN schem
defaulte and the extended ECU will start to uncover some of these 
defaultproblems across institutions by 
defaultasking institutions to disclose information on application, recruitment and staffing at all levels.
default  We are aware that a number of Departments
default of Psychology have Ath
defaultena 
defaultSwan
default awards and 
defaultprovide a useful network for data-gathering on differing practices
default.
default 
defaultHowever, how the institutions choose to act on this becomes a different matter. Tying it to real consequences is one step in the right direction but we need further 
defaultmoves to ensure that women are represented at senior levels.

defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
default3.1 
defaultOur 
defaultCareers Destinations project (January 2013 report)
default has shown that 
defaultPsychology graduates transition into a wide variety of
default STEM and non-STEM
default careers
default.
default  
defaultSome will go on to become qualified psychologists; others will go into different career areas (such as the 
defaultpolice, armed forces, employment and selection, as well as other areas of employment in which advanced research skills are required – such as the food and drink or pharmaceutical industries).  We believe that this wide transferability of skills obtained fr
defaultom studying psychology is one of the reasons why it is so popular and why its popularity continues to grow.
default 
default3.2 
defaultA
defaultn undergraduate degree in psychology provides graduates with hugely transferrable skills as well as those in
default 
defaultpsychological literacy.  For exa
defaultmple, in terms of 
defaultthe employability skills acquired during 
defaulta psychology degree
default, our own research has shown that  
defaultself management, team-working, problem solving, communication and literacy, application of numeracy, application of information technology 
defaultwere
default 
defaultwell developed
default.  
defaultIn relation to “psychological skills”, 
defaulta basic knowledge of the critical subject matter of psychology, scientific and critical analysis/problem solving, applying psychological knowledge to work, relationships and the broader community, be
defaulthaving ethically, recognising, understanding and fostering respect for diversity, 
defaultand
default being insightful and reflective about one’s own and others’ behaviour and mental processes
default were
default also
default 
defaultwell developed
default 
default.
default3.3 
defaultW
defaulte
default therefore
default welcome and support the usage of t
defaulthese skills in
default different employment sectors both within and beyond STEM.

defaultWe would anticipate th
defaultat those Departments and Institutions that are Athena Swan award recipients will be able to provide the strongest examples of best practice. 
default4.2 Harriet 
defaultTenenbaum
default and Patrick Leman at the University of Surrey have
default 
defaultjust completed a project on mentoring un
defaultdergraduate women in science which has demonstrable positive effects both in terms of academic performance and intentions to pursue careers in science. 
defaultThe outcomes of this research are also applicable to those further along in their academic careers.

defaultIt should 
defaulthave a 
defaultfacilitatory
default role
default. 
defaultImportantly, it needs
default to fund research into the early causes of beliefs about gender and science. The focus on addressing inequalities in post is worthwhile in the short and medium term. But role model women in these areas will not 
defaultgenerate a lasting move towards equality if, 
defaultat school and through childhood, the sense in which some aspects of science are a male domain, becomes ingrained.
