[normal]With the assistance of the British Embassy in Yangon I was asked by Aung San Suu Kyi last New Year’s Eve to take on the rejuvenation of Rangoon General Hospital. This was built by the British in 1905 and had a tradition of providing free healthcare. There are 1,500 beds and it is the country’s hospital of last resort. It is now the main teaching hospital of the country’s premier medical school. Unfortunately the buildings haven’t changed much for the last 110 years and the poor standard of medical care has meant only the poorest Burmese use the hospital.

[normal]Aung San Suu Kyi wanted to show that, even in opposition, she could make a difference to peoples’ lives. She has chosen to try and reopen Rangoon University, which has been closed by the military for 20 years, and upgrade Rangoon General Hospital. She hopes that these two high profile projects will have a beneficial effect on the outcome of the 2015 General Election for her opposition party.

[normal] task was
[normal] to find a British university medical school that would be prepared to rebuild the Hospital’s healthcare system and provide a medical degree course for the brightest Burmese medical students. Having opened discussions with 7 British universities
