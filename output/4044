defaultIn order to judge the plausibility of our provisional £15 billion
default estimate of the impact of HS2 on the GB economy in 2037, this figure needs to be seen against the background of how large the economy is expected to be 
defaultby that date. By 2037 the Office of Budget Responsibility is forecasting total GDP to be more than £3 trillion per annum. Our provisional estimate of a £15 billion increase thus amounts to an increase in GDP of 0.5%. So whilst our estimate is significant
default 
defaultin absolute terms (particularly given it would represent a permanent step up in annual output), it is relatively modest in relation to the size of the economy in 2037. 
defaultii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommentators have wrongly attributed the scale of our provisional £15 billion estimate to the use of significantly higher elasticities than found in the literature. When compared on a like for like basis, our elasticities are not significantly above directly comparable estimates. For example, some commentators have referenced the rail elasticity derived by SERC
default to suggest that our estimated GDP impact is six to eight times too high, but once a proper comparison is made with the rail elasticity we derived, the elasticities are in fact broadly comparable, and if anything our estimates are lower than the SERC work suggests.
defaultiii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore generally, we note that direct comparisons between our analysis for HS2 Ltd and research of the kind undertaken by SERC are potentially misleading. The SERC analysis focuses on the wage impacts (which we suspect are a reasonable first approximation for productivity effects) of rail based improvements in labour connectivity (
defaulti.e.
default between labour and businesses). The analysis then seeks to control for factors such as labour quality and experience which might otherwise result in the benefits of improving rail connectivity to be overstated. While this research is genuinely ground breaking, it is somewhat narrower than our analysis which addresses both the labour connectivity effects addressed by SERC, and the productivity benefits businesses derive from their connectivity to each other, which the SERC work does not address. Unless businesses gain no productivity benefits from improved connectivity to other businesses, we would expect an approach such as ours which addresses both labour market connectivity and business connectivity to produce a higher combined effect than one which only addressed labour market effects, such as that estimated by SERC.
defaultiv)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere has been significant comment on the judgements we made in reducing the rail elasticities used in our report. We made these adjustments in the light of our statistical analysis which showed, for example, that these elasticities could be reflecting the impact of road 
defaultconnectivity, which is often correlated with rail 
defaultconnectivity. As
default we made clear in our original report, these adjustments were based on judgement and experience of similar work, rather than standard statistical methods. We applied these judgements because at that time we had found no statistical technique that did not bring with it equal or greater potential challenges, because judgements (in practice less transparent ones) would still be required. A prime example of this would be an approach based on weighting between rail and road on the basis of market share. A sensitivity test based on this approach is included in our report. It produced a central estimated GDP increase of £8 billion in 2037 on an assumed rail market share of about 15%. While superficially attractive, this approach is heavily reliant on an accurate forecast of the split between rail and road business travel, accurate at the level of the individual places and business sectors most affected by HS2 some 25 years from now. Even small changes in these assumptions would have a significant impact on the forecast GDP impact, with even a one percentage point change in the assumed relevant rail mode share in 2037 changing the forecast GDP impact by £0.5 billion. 
defaultv)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe stand by our judgements, although we continue to investigate alternative approaches. Where judgements are necessary, as is always likely to be the case in this kind of analysis, we believe they should be clear and transparent, as we highlighted in our report, rather than buried out of sight in the modelling. The detailed analysis presented below also shows that once comparisons are made on a like for like basis, the elasticities that our judgements produced are not out of line with those found in the literature, including the SERC study.
defaultvi)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough our elasticities are not a genuine source of difference between our preliminary results and those that emerge from more traditional analysis, the way in which we measure connectivity may well be. Our approach derives measures of connectivity for businesses travel and commuting based on observed behaviour – 
defaulti.e.
default real data from actual travel patterns today. This means in our analysis the relative importance to the economy of longer distance rail journeys compared to shorter distance ones reflects what we see in the data about business travellers’ and commuters’ willingness to accept the higher time and money costs of these longer journeys. This contrasts with approaches typically used in the literature, and by the Department for Transport (“DfT”) in its Wider Impacts methodology, which are derived from analysis of distance based 
defaultmeasures of connectivity, which have subsequently been converted into factors based on travel costs. 
defaultIn order to understand the potential importance of these differences in approach we have compared our “real-data” methodology with the “proxy data” used by the DfT for business connectivity in Manchester. This comparison suggests the DfT approach risks significantly under estimating the importance of longer distance business travel, particularly for the fast growing producer services sector, which is expected to account for nearly 1/3 of economic output by 2037. 
defaultIn our Manchester example, using the DfT method halved the forecast impact of HS2 on rail-based business to business connectivity for the producer services sector compared to our behaviourally-based approach. Other things being equal, this means a halving of the productivity gains forecast for the producer services sector in Manchester, and suggests that estimates based on the standard approach risk significantly understating the impact of investment focused on longer distance business travel.

defaultAs noted in our September report, pending further work, all the results presented, including the £15 billion headline figure, should be treated as provisional. There are eight areas where we currently see potential for significant changes in the £15 billion figure: 
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUpdates to the HS2 and wider network plan. Our work reported in September was based on the 2012 definition of the network. This excluded the now planned station at Manchester airport and was based on early work of the use of freed-up capacity, which has since been 
defaultupdated. We
default would expect the 2013 plan to increase the impact of HS2 on business and labour connectivity compared to that used for our preliminary work. If this is confirmed it would point to an increase in the £15 billion figure;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe inclusion of freight capacity benefits. Rail freight delivers significant productivity benefits to UK businesses by offering, for a proportion of freight movements, a cheaper option than road. Increasing congestion on the rail network risks limiting the extent of these benefits, and the capacity released by HS2 could help to remove this constraint. Other things being equal, making an allowance for these benefits should increase the £15 billion;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInternational impacts, including through improved terms of trade. Our preliminary work was based on the GB economy only, ignoring the 
defaultinternational trade dimension. Including international trade should increase net national GDP impacts;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImpacts over time. Our preliminary work was bas
defaulted on a single year – 2037, and
default we would expect the value of productivity gains to increase over time beyond 2037 as background growth continues, increasing the absolute value of productivity gains delivered by HS2;
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLabour participation impacts. Labour inputs were held constant in our preliminary work, and we would expect relaxing this assumption to affect the overall forecast impact of £15 billion. The SERC work on mobile labour suggests that the principal effect will be to redistribute the £15 billion rather than change it; 
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdjustments to the value of time. The sensitivity testing we carried out as part of our preliminary analysis suggests that GDP impacts are less sensitive to changes in the assumed value of time than conventional transport appraisals, with a 50% reduction in the assumed value of in-vehicle time for business rail travellers only reducing our headline impact estimate by £3 billion to £12 billion. DfT’s recently announced reduction in the business value of time for use in appraisals is less than our 50% sensitivity, but viewed in isolation we would still expect it to reduce the overall 2037 GDP impact figure to somewhere between £13 billion and £14 billion on a like for like basis; and
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther development of the methodology. We are continuing our work on alternative statistical approaches. This work is potentially showing ways through the problem of overlapping impacts (between road and rail and between business and labour market impacts) that do more than simply require one judgement to be substituted for another. At the same time, this work is suggesting that the relationship between connectivity and productivity is in practice non-linear, with a given change in business to business connectivity for better connected places delivering higher impacts than similar proportional changes to less well connected places. This would be consistent with a view that economies adapt to take advantage of higher levels of connectivity, and having adapted then become more sensitive to future changes in connectivity. If confirmed, this could increase the scale of our preliminary estimate of the impact of HS2 on future output, but it could also mean impacts are significantly more concentrated. 
defaultAs part of developing the methodology we will also be seeking to extend our analysis beyond the four business sectors analysed to date (producer services, consumer services, construction and manufacturing). This matters, because by 2037 these sectors’ share of total employment is forecast to dip below 60%. If this work uncovers a positive relationship between connectivity and productivity for this remaining 40%, other things being equal, it could be expected to increase the £15 billion.

defaultUpdates to the underlying transport and socio-economic models and forecasts. Updated modelling can change the expected impact of any scheme, sometimes significantly, and in any direction. As yet we are not aware of any changes that would affect our analysis, but is possible that such changes will emerge as our work continues.

defaultAnnex 1 –default defaultKPMG staff input to the Regional Economic Impacts defaultprojectdefault for HS2 Ltddefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Regional Economic Impacts project for HS2 Ltd was undertaken by KPMG, with assistance from Connected Economics Limited, for a fixed fee of £199,270 excluding expenses and VAT. Including expenses and VAT brought the total invoice to £242,125.86.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe study began in April 2013 and concluded in September 2013 upon publication of the HS2 Regional Economic Impacts report. The table below sets out the number of days, by staff member, that were spent on the project over this period, along with the daily fee rate of those staff members. This is based on the time recorded in KPMG and Connected Economics timesheets. This will exclude certain time spent on the project by senior KPMG staff, as this time is treated as a general overhead of the business and therefore is not recorded in staff timesheets.
