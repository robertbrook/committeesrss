[normal]Written Evidence [bold]from[bold] [bold]POhWER[bold] [PHS0042][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]This submission is made by POhWER, an advocacy charity established over fifteen years ago by service users who felt unequal to the task of voicing concerns about decisions made by public bodies on matters that affected their day to day lives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]We provide NHS complaints advocacy services from the outset. We focus particularly on people who are vulnerable, distressed or drawn from the protected equality groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Last year alone, we handled over 30,000 calls about the NHS complaints process to our information, advice and advocacy centre and provided over 4,000 people with direct advocacy support. We can draw on the experiences of all these clients to provide you with evidence based views on the Parliamentary and Health Service 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]Our focus in this submission is on the second tier of the NHS complaints handling process. 
[normal]T
[normal]he first tier 
[normal]was designed with substantial complainant involvement and feedback from our clients suggests that it has the potential to deliver the 
[normal]kind of approach and the outcomes 
[normal]they seek. However, it 
[normal]suffers from poor implementation and has not kept pace with the recent NHS changes. 
[normal]Unfortunately our experience with the second tier, when cases are taken to the Ombudsman, is not so positive. This is particularly worrying in an organisation that is a specialist complaint handler.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]So far this year, since April 2013, 8% of our NHS cases were referred on to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO). In previous years, we have referred around 15% of cases to PHSO.
[normal] The reason for this seems
[normal] to be a growing reluctance to 
[normal]use the Ombudsman service because of the experiences of others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our clients tell us that they have experienced the following problems:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Delay[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We
[normal] understand that
[normal] [bold]in April 2013, PHSO changed its complaints process in order to be able to investigate more complaints. It also changed its senior management structure and is soon to make 
[normal]significant 
[normal]changes to 
[normal]resources in 
[normal]the structure below
[normal] that level
[normal]. The impact of the
[normal]se changes for our clients appears to have 
[normal]been to lengthen the 
[normal]complaints 
[normal]process
[normal] and make it 
[normal]less customer focused
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e understand that there are over 700 complaints being held in a backlog before a decision to investigate is even made.
[normal] One client has been informed that PHSO will take 40 
[normal]days
[normal] just
[normal] to consider whether to 
[normal]investigate their complaint which mean
[normal]s it will be mid-January before 
[normal]our client will hear from PHSO again. This is a long time for a client to 
[normal]know whether their case is even going to be considered, let alone resolved. 
[normal]And if they are not being communicated with during the process
[normal] (see below)
[normal], it can become extremely frustrating and upsetting for our clients.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Poor service and bias in favour of bodies complained about[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C[bold]lients tell their us that c[bold]omplaints [bold]are being [bold]paraphrased rather than[bold] conveyed to organisations[bold] ‘as put’ by the complainant:[bold] PHSO’s 
[normal]interim casework policy and guidance – section 4: Proposals to investigate
[normal] states that they scope what they are (and are not) proposing to investigate and that 
[normal]a
[normal] decision to narrow the scope of the complaint 
[normal]that has been 
[normal]put to them is theirs. Our clients are reporting to us that this means that
[normal] all too often
[normal] 
[normal]PHSO does not address
[normal] t
[normal]he issues they wanted consider
[normal]ed. C
[normal]ertain aspects 
[normal]are ignored and others are 
[normal]interpreted wrongly or not stated clearly. In one case where our client objected to the summary of her complaint, her case was ‘withdrawn’ 
[normal]by PHSO 
[normal]as she would not consent for her truncated complaint to be sent to the Trust as her complaint.
[normal] This
[normal] appears to run against 
[normal]the
[normal] intention of the
[normal] Health Service Ombudsman Act 
[normal]which states:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Procedure in respect of investigations[bold].
[normal]E+W+S+N.I.[bold](1)Where a Commissioner proposes to conduct an investigation pursuant to a complaint under 
[normal][[bold]F1[bold]section 3(1)
[normal]][bold], he shall afford— 
[normal](a)to the health service body concerned, and 
[normal](b)to any other person who is alleged in the complaint to have taken or 
[normal]authorised
[normal] the action complained of, 
[normal]an opportunity to comment on 
[normal]any allegations[bold] contained in the complaint. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This surely means that PHSO should not paraphrase
[normal] the meaning of a complaint or reduce it to what they think t
[normal]hey can achieve.
[normal] 
[normal]At the very least they need to explain to complainants why they feel no worthwhile outcome can be obtained on the aspects that they propose not to investigate so that complainants have a chance to challenge this.  By the time they have reached the Ombudsman, most complainants are battle weary. They would not be pursuing the case if they did not feel a strong sense of injustice.  The Ombudsman is their last hope –  surely incumbent on her to do her best to investigate or explain fully why she feels there is nothing useful to be achieved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lack of openness with the complainant[bold]: clients tell us that documents that form part of the investigation are shared
[normal] only 
[normal]with bodies
[normal] complained about
[normal]. As a result, complainants cannot confirm whether the information from the body is correct or complete. The impact of this is that complainants feel the process is biased towards the 
[normal]organisation complained about
[normal] and that their views are insignificant 
[normal]in
[normal] the whole process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Poor communication[bold]:
[normal] many of our clients tell us that they are only contacted at the beginning and end of the process but 
[normal]not on an on going 
[normal]basis
[normal]. Therefore, they have no idea about the progress of their complaint, nor are they given an opportunity to clarify or comment on the responses received by the body until the 
[normal]draft report is written. T
[normal]his is 
[normal]usually 
[normal]too late as the Ombudsman is 
[normal]frequently
[normal] unwilling to accept new information or evidence at this stage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lack of integration: [bold]many of our client’s complaints 
[normal]cross the
[normal] health and social care 
[normal]boundaries
[normal]. PHSO does not have the remit to investigate social care complaints and therefore our clients then either need to deal with two Ombudsmen or have their complaint investigated as a ‘joint investigation’. As the two Ombudsmen sit in different locations, have different processes and different remits, this makes it very difficult for our clients and all the problems stated above are exacerbated.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lack of[bold] i[bold]mpact:[bold] [bold]PHSO’s own figures show 
[normal]that, in 2012-2013, they received over 24,000 complaints about the NHS or Government departments. Of these, they completed 384 investigations which 
[normal]was
[normal] less than 2% of all complaints received. Therefore, the learning from complaints is limited to a relatively small number of complaints and the impact is minimised.  
[normal]As noted earlier, this poor level of impact is a key factor in clients ’decisions not to take their case to PHSO. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PHSO and Advocacy[bold]&#xa0;[bold]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our experience shows that advice and advocacy services provide an important and independent link between the service provider and the client. We provide our clients with the confidence and tools to voice their concerns and to ensure improvements are made as a result. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Advocacy and advice can support a complainant, help PHSO with its communication and ensure that the process is balanced and fair. 
[normal]We believe PHSO could benefit from creating stronger links with advice and advocacy providers 
[normal]who are trained in this field. 
[normal]A survey conducted by PHSO in 2
[normal]011 and shared with ICAS providers showed that of all the advice and advocacy organisations they surveyed
[normal],
[normal] knowledge of PHSO and a good understanding of the service it provided was very significantly higher
[normal] in the NHS complaints advocacy service
[normal] than in other advice and advocacy agencies. 
[normal]Furthermore, the take up rate for health cases supported by 
[normal]specialist NHS complaints advocates
[normal] is three times that of the general PHSO take up rate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Currently PHSO provides a link on its website to an organisation calling itself ‘NHS Advocacy Services’. Not only is this link b
[normal]uried in the site and fails to
[normal] appear when you search the site using the term ‘advocacy’, it also links to only one 
[normal]advocacy provider
[normal] cover
[normal]s only a limited part 
[normal]of England. This discriminates against vulnerable clients in all other geographical areas and causes 
[normal]confusion for the complainant as there is no signposting to providers in their area. 
[normal] We have also not been able to meet with the Ombudsman in over a year to discuss how we can work together for the benefit of complainant
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What would make PHSO better?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We feel that PHSO 
[normal]would benefit from
[normal] the following.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Being more customer focused. [bold]A
[normal]t POhWER
[normal],
[normal] we ensure we contact our clients on a regular basis, to keep them updated and to 
[normal]ensure they clearly understand what is 
[normal]happening
[normal]. We also ensure that there is complete transparency and share documentation with our clients whenever possible.
[normal] PHSO would be better if it improved its communication and openness with complainants.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having an [bold]external review of its processes[bold]. [bold]C
[normal]urrently 
[normal]PHSO’s process
[normal] appears to have lengthened the time to investigate, introduced more delays for customers, shows bias towards the body complained about and 
[normal]does not investigate the complaint as stated
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] [bold]An external review of PHSO’s new process
[normal], perhaps involving complainants,
[normal] and determining whether it is actually bringing any benefits to complainants or delivering value for money would be beneficial.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having an integrated approach to health and social care complaints. [bold]A 
[normal]single health and social care investigation process which is clearly signposted and consistent across the boundaries
[normal], mirroring the process at tier 1 would be far more efficient than the current arrangements.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Making better use of advice and advocacy services[bold], and doing more to support vulnerable people[bold]. [bold]Engaging more with advice and advocacy services and better signposting to these providers on their website
[normal] would benefit PHSO, the body being investigated and the complainant and give everyone
[normal] – and especially vulnerable people - 
[normal]an opportunity to make their voice heard.
[normal] This would also reflect the recognition afforded to advocacy support in the Francis Report, the Government’s response and the Clwyd Hart Review.
[normal]  PHSO might also wish to reflect on the lack of advocacy support for people with Parliamentary complaints.  Many of these complainants are drawn from the most vulnerable and distressed populations in the country and the absence of active lobbying for support for their needs (despite evidence of the effectiveness of advocacy).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having a regional presence rather than a national [bold]focus[bold]. [bold]As the NHS has changed and there is a greater emphasis on regional or local knowledge, PHSO would benefit from regional 
[normal]investigators, 
[normal]with greater knowledge and awareness of issues in their area.  This would grow the expertise of the investigators of the bodies within their area and they would be more likely to spot the systemic issues arising on a regional basis than a national one.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We hope that the Select Committee finds this information 
[normal]of use for its inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. There is a great deal more we can say and would be very pleased to assist in any way we can.
