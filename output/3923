default1
default              
defaultThis submission is made by POhWER, an advocacy charity established over fifteen years ago by service users who felt unequal to the task of voicing concerns about decisions made by public bodies on matters that affected their day to day lives.
default&#xa0;
default2
default              
defaultWe provide NHS complaints advocacy services from the outset. We focus particularly on people who are vulnerable, distressed or drawn from the protected equality groups.
default&#xa0;
default3
default              
defaultLast year alone, we handled over 30,000 calls about the NHS complaints process to our information, advice and advocacy centre and provided over 4,000 people with direct advocacy support. We can draw on the experiences of all these clients to provide you with evidence based views on the Parliamentary and Health Service 
defaultOmbudsman
default.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultOur focus in this submission is on the second tier of the NHS complaints handling process. 
defaultT
defaulthe first tier 
defaultwas designed with substantial complainant involvement and feedback from our clients suggests that it has the potential to deliver the 
defaultkind of approach and the outcomes 
defaultthey seek. However, it 
defaultsuffers from poor implementation and has not kept pace with the recent NHS changes. 
defaultUnfortunately our experience with the second tier, when cases are taken to the Ombudsman, is not so positive. This is particularly worrying in an organisation that is a specialist complaint handler.
default&#xa0;defaultParliamentary and Health Service Ombudsmandefault&#xa0;
default5
default              
defaultSo far this year, since April 2013, 8% of our NHS cases were referred on to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO). In previous years, we have referred around 15% of cases to PHSO.
default The reason for this seems
default to be a growing reluctance to 
defaultuse the Ombudsman service because of the experiences of others.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur clients tell us that they have experienced the following problems:
default&#xa0;
defaultDelaydefault&#xa0;default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default understand that
default defaultin April 2013, PHSO changed its complaints process in order to be able to investigate more complaints. It also changed its senior management structure and is soon to make 
defaultsignificant 
defaultchanges to 
defaultresources in 
defaultthe structure below
default that level
default. The impact of the
defaultse changes for our clients appears to have 
defaultbeen to lengthen the 
defaultcomplaints 
defaultprocess
default and make it 
defaultless customer focused
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte understand that there are over 700 complaints being held in a backlog before a decision to investigate is even made.
default One client has been informed that PHSO will take 40 
defaultdays
default just
default to consider whether to 
defaultinvestigate their complaint which mean
defaults it will be mid-January before 
defaultour client will hear from PHSO again. This is a long time for a client to 
defaultknow whether their case is even going to be considered, let alone resolved. 
defaultAnd if they are not being communicated with during the process
default (see below)
default, it can become extremely frustrating and upsetting for our clients.
default&#xa0;
defaultPoor service and bias in favour of bodies complained aboutdefault&#xa0;
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCdefaultlients tell their us that cdefaultomplaints defaultare being defaultparaphrased rather thandefault conveyed to organisationsdefault ‘as put’ by the complainant:default PHSO’s 
defaultinterim casework policy and guidance – section 4: Proposals to investigate
default states that they scope what they are (and are not) proposing to investigate and that 
defaulta
default decision to narrow the scope of the complaint 
defaultthat has been 
defaultput to them is theirs. Our clients are reporting to us that this means that
default all too often
default 
defaultPHSO does not address
default t
defaulthe issues they wanted consider
defaulted. C
defaultertain aspects 
defaultare ignored and others are 
defaultinterpreted wrongly or not stated clearly. In one case where our client objected to the summary of her complaint, her case was ‘withdrawn’ 
defaultby PHSO 
defaultas she would not consent for her truncated complaint to be sent to the Trust as her complaint.
default This
default appears to run against 
defaultthe
default intention of the
default Health Service Ombudsman Act 
defaultwhich states:
default&#xa0;
defaultProcedure in respect of investigationsdefault.
defaultE+W+S+N.I.default(1)Where a Commissioner proposes to conduct an investigation pursuant to a complaint under 
default[defaultF1defaultsection 3(1)
default]default, he shall afford— 
default(a)to the health service body concerned, and 
default(b)to any other person who is alleged in the complaint to have taken or 
defaultauthorised
default the action complained of, 
defaultan opportunity to comment on 
defaultany allegationsdefault contained in the complaint. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis surely means that PHSO should not paraphrase
default the meaning of a complaint or reduce it to what they think t
defaulthey can achieve.
default 
defaultAt the very least they need to explain to complainants why they feel no worthwhile outcome can be obtained on the aspects that they propose not to investigate so that complainants have a chance to challenge this.  By the time they have reached the Ombudsman, most complainants are battle weary. They would not be pursuing the case if they did not feel a strong sense of injustice.  The Ombudsman is their last hope –  surely incumbent on her to do her best to investigate or explain fully why she feels there is nothing useful to be achieved.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of openness with the complainantdefault: clients tell us that documents that form part of the investigation are shared
default only 
defaultwith bodies
default complained about
default. As a result, complainants cannot confirm whether the information from the body is correct or complete. The impact of this is that complainants feel the process is biased towards the 
defaultorganisation complained about
default and that their views are insignificant 
defaultin
default the whole process.
default&#xa0;
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoor communicationdefault:
default many of our clients tell us that they are only contacted at the beginning and end of the process but 
defaultnot on an on going 
defaultbasis
default. Therefore, they have no idea about the progress of their complaint, nor are they given an opportunity to clarify or comment on the responses received by the body until the 
defaultdraft report is written. T
defaulthis is 
defaultusually 
defaulttoo late as the Ombudsman is 
defaultfrequently
default unwilling to accept new information or evidence at this stage.
default&#xa0;
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of integration: defaultmany of our client’s complaints 
defaultcross the
default health and social care 
defaultboundaries
default. PHSO does not have the remit to investigate social care complaints and therefore our clients then either need to deal with two Ombudsmen or have their complaint investigated as a ‘joint investigation’. As the two Ombudsmen sit in different locations, have different processes and different remits, this makes it very difficult for our clients and all the problems stated above are exacerbated.
default 
default&#xa0;
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack ofdefault idefaultmpact:default defaultPHSO’s own figures show 
defaultthat, in 2012-2013, they received over 24,000 complaints about the NHS or Government departments. Of these, they completed 384 investigations which 
defaultwas
default less than 2% of all complaints received. Therefore, the learning from complaints is limited to a relatively small number of complaints and the impact is minimised.  
defaultAs noted earlier, this poor level of impact is a key factor in clients ’decisions not to take their case to PHSO. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPHSO and Advocacydefault&#xa0;default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur experience shows that advice and advocacy services provide an important and independent link between the service provider and the client. We provide our clients with the confidence and tools to voice their concerns and to ensure improvements are made as a result. 
default&#xa0;
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvocacy and advice can support a complainant, help PHSO with its communication and ensure that the process is balanced and fair. 
defaultWe believe PHSO could benefit from creating stronger links with advice and advocacy providers 
defaultwho are trained in this field. 
defaultA survey conducted by PHSO in 2
default011 and shared with ICAS providers showed that of all the advice and advocacy organisations they surveyed
default,
default knowledge of PHSO and a good understanding of the service it provided was very significantly higher
default in the NHS complaints advocacy service
default than in other advice and advocacy agencies. 
defaultFurthermore, the take up rate for health cases supported by 
defaultspecialist NHS complaints advocates
default is three times that of the general PHSO take up rate. 
default&#xa0;
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently PHSO provides a link on its website to an organisation calling itself ‘NHS Advocacy Services’. Not only is this link b
defaulturied in the site and fails to
default appear when you search the site using the term ‘advocacy’, it also links to only one 
defaultadvocacy provider
default cover
defaults only a limited part 
defaultof England. This discriminates against vulnerable clients in all other geographical areas and causes 
defaultconfusion for the complainant as there is no signposting to providers in their area. 
default We have also not been able to meet with the Ombudsman in over a year to discuss how we can work together for the benefit of complainant
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat would make PHSO better?default&#xa0;
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel that PHSO 
defaultwould benefit from
default the following.
default&#xa0;
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBeing more customer focused. defaultA
defaultt POhWER
default,
default we ensure we contact our clients on a regular basis, to keep them updated and to 
defaultensure they clearly understand what is 
defaulthappening
default. We also ensure that there is complete transparency and share documentation with our clients whenever possible.
default PHSO would be better if it improved its communication and openness with complainants.
default&#xa0;default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving an defaultexternal review of its processesdefault. defaultC
defaulturrently 
defaultPHSO’s process
default appears to have lengthened the time to investigate, introduced more delays for customers, shows bias towards the body complained about and 
defaultdoes not investigate the complaint as stated
default.
default 
default defaultAn external review of PHSO’s new process
default, perhaps involving complainants,
default and determining whether it is actually bringing any benefits to complainants or delivering value for money would be beneficial.
default 
default&#xa0;default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving an integrated approach to health and social care complaints. defaultA 
defaultsingle health and social care investigation process which is clearly signposted and consistent across the boundaries
default, mirroring the process at tier 1 would be far more efficient than the current arrangements.
default 
default&#xa0;default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaking better use of advice and advocacy servicesdefault, and doing more to support vulnerable peopledefault. defaultEngaging more with advice and advocacy services and better signposting to these providers on their website
default would benefit PHSO, the body being investigated and the complainant and give everyone
default – and especially vulnerable people - 
defaultan opportunity to make their voice heard.
default This would also reflect the recognition afforded to advocacy support in the Francis Report, the Government’s response and the Clwyd Hart Review.
default  PHSO might also wish to reflect on the lack of advocacy support for people with Parliamentary complaints.  Many of these complainants are drawn from the most vulnerable and distressed populations in the country and the absence of active lobbying for support for their needs (despite evidence of the effectiveness of advocacy).
default&#xa0;default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving a regional presence rather than a national defaultfocusdefault. defaultAs the NHS has changed and there is a greater emphasis on regional or local knowledge, PHSO would benefit from regional 
defaultinvestigators, 
defaultwith greater knowledge and awareness of issues in their area.  This would grow the expertise of the investigators of the bodies within their area and they would be more likely to spot the systemic issues arising on a regional basis than a national one.
default&#xa0;
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe hope that the Select Committee finds this information 
defaultof use for its inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. There is a great deal more we can say and would be very pleased to assist in any way we can.
