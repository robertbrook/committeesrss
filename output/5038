[normal]Written Evidence Submitted[bold] to the EFRA Committee[bold] by t[bold]he Born Free Foundation[bold]14[bold]th[bold] January 2014[bold]&#xa0;[bold]WE understand that t
[normal]he EFRA Committee 
[normal]is seeking written submissions of 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]in regard
[normal] 
[normal]to the following
[normal]:
[normal]We welcome the opportunity to comment, and would be happy to discuss the specific details with the Committee.
[normal]We do not wish to present evidence of the extent of the trade and keeping of prim
[normal]ates as pets within the UK at this stage. 
[normal]We understand that other organisations intend to make submissions covering this point.
[normal]The following comments refer to the keeping of primates by private individuals, distinct from the keeping of primates in licens
[normal]ed zoos or in genuine animal sanctuaries.
[normal]Summary:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]“[bold]They [bold]are wild [bold]undomesticated animals that cannot be house-trained or fully tamed[bold]”[bold]Defra 2009
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The primate Order consists of approximately 
[normal]230-4
[normal]00
[normal]+
[normal] species (depending on classification), ranging in size from mouse lemurs to lowland gorillas. 
[normal]Depending on the species, primate groups in nature range in size from 1 to 800 (
[normal]Chapman
[normal] 
[normal]&amp;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Teichroeb
[normal] 2012) across 
[normal]a range of habitats, from 
[normal]savanna and 
[normal]rainforest
[normal]s
[normal] to montane forests and grasslands.
[normal]Most primates
[normal] are intensely social. Infant primates may be carried constantly by 
[normal]their mothers for weeks, remain in constant 
[normal]proximity 
[normal]for months, and live in family groups for years.  Primates 
[normal]kept as 
[normal]pet
[normal]s
[normal] may be taken
[normal] from their mothers when they are just weeks or even days old. 
[normal]Research 
[normal]dating from Harlow’s controversial experiments in the 19
[normal]50
[normal]s to recent work by Feng et al. (2012) 
[normal]has demonstrated the considerable and long-lasting 
[normal]negative 
[normal]effects 
[normal]on behaviour and we
[normal]lfare resulting from 
[normal]separating infant primates from their mothers.
[normal] 
[normal]A domestic environment places limitations on the size of primate group that is likely to be kept, and as a result p
[normal]rimates may be kept alone
[normal] or with incompatible conspecifics, with associated detrimental effects on welfare.
[normal]Primates are intelligent, agile and strong. 
[normal]Even the smallest primates 
[normal]are equipped with 
[normal]teeth and nails that can inflict injury to humans
[normal] (there is a risk of significant i
[normal]njury from many species)
[normal], and 
[normal]individuals that 
[normal]are apparently accustomed to handling
[normal] by humans 
[normal]remain 
[normal]unpredictable.
[normal]As our closest relatives, nonhuman primates are able to share and transmit many diseases that may infect humans:
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]Nonhuman primates, by vir
[normal]tue of their genetic, physiologic, and sometimes social similarities to humans, are particularly likely sources of infectious agents that pose a threat to humans
[normal]” (Jones-Engel et al. 2005)
[normal]. 
[normal]Such 
[normal]zoonotic 
[normal]pathogens include
[normal] v
[normal]iruses
[normal] 
[normal]such as herpes B (herpesvi
[normal]rus 1)
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]gastrointestinal and pulmonary bacteria
[normal] including 
[normal]Salmonella
[normal], 
[normal]Shigella
[normal] and 
[normal]Streptococcus
[normal] spp. 
[normal]The Code of Practice 
[normal]associated with the 
[normal]Animal Welfare Act 2006 
[normal]currently acknowledges that the 
[normal]conditions
[normal] must be “appropriate to
[normal] the species”. 
[normal]As stated previously, there may be more than 400 species of primate that could potentially be privately kept. 
[normal]Running to
[normal] 
[normal]only 
[normal]24 pages, it is perhaps inevitable that the
[normal] existing C
[normal]ode 
[normal]o
[normal]f 
[normal]P
[normal]ractice
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]generic
[normal] and
[normal],
[normal] in our opinion
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]wholly insufficient to address the varied needs of such a 
[normal]diverse 
[normal]group of animals.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, w
[normal]e 
[normal]are convinced 
[normal]that 
[normal]a system based 
[normal]even 
[normal]on an expanded and 
[normal]more detailed 
[normal]Code 
[normal]of Practice simply cannot 
[normal]gu
[normal]arantee the welfare of primates as pets, as a resu
[normal]lt of the incompatibility between the
[normal] animals’ 
[normal]biology and needs and the domestic environment.
[normal]The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 
[normal](DWAA) 
[normal]requires
[normal] inspection and
[normal] licensing for some species of primate considered to be dangerous. 
[normal]It should be noted that the DWAA is first and foremost public health and safety legislation, and covers animal welfare only 
[normal]secondarily
[normal]. It does not cover the most commonly kept species of primates in the UK. 
[normal]It 
[normal]has been acknowledged 
[normal]that 
[normal]implementation a
[normal]nd
[normal] enforcement of this act is 
[normal]problematic
[normal]:
[normal] “
[normal]Many dangerous wild animals are not kept in public view and therefore there is less chance of the keeping being reported by a third party or the local authority becoming aware of their presence and being able to
[normal] carry out enforcement action
[normal]“.
[normal] (Defra 2009b)
[normal]We consider that the DWAA exemplifies some of the problems associat
[normal]ed
[normal] with licensing the private ownership of non-domesticated animals, and indicates that a similar system for pet primates would be unworkable.
[normal]It should be noted that countries in Europe including 
[normal]Belgium and 
[normal]the Netherlands 
[normal]have 
[normal]implemented 
[normal]legislation that effectively prohibits
[normal] the keeping of primates.
[normal]Approximately half of the states in the USA prohibit 
[normal]the 
[normal]kee
[normal]ping 
[normal]of 
[normal]primates as pets (and there are some forms of restriction in place in many of the other states). In addition, importing primates into the United States for the pet trade has been pr
[normal]ohibited since 1975 on the grounds of risks to health.
[normal]Experts in the field of primatology are united in their concern for primates kept as pets. The International Primatology Society 
[normal]“
[normal]opposes the holding of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educational or 
[normal]non-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in breeding and trading for these purposes
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal] (IPS n.d.)
[normal]An opinion poll was commissioned by the Bor
[normal]n Free Foundation, Captive Animals’ Protection Society and the RSPCA in January 2013. In response to the question “Do you think that keeping primates as pets in the UK should be legal or illegal in the UK?”, the responses were as follows:
[normal]“Should be illega
[normal]l”: 65%
[normal]“Should be legal”: 11%
[normal]“I don’t have an opinion whether it should be legal or illegal”: 24%
[normal](ICM Research, 2000 respondents)
[normal]Exotic animal medicine remains a minor part of the veterinary curriculum
[normal] and 
[normal]specialist knowledge of 
[normal]primate medicine is not widespread among veterinary practitioners
[normal]. It 
[normal]follows
[normal] that primate owners are extremely unlikely to be able to access specialist primate veterinary care at 
[normal]their local veterinary practice, which is an obstacle to providing sufficien
[normal]t and appropriate 
[normal]animal health
[normal] 
[normal]and welfare
[normal].
[normal]Primates are generally long-lived. 
[normal]It is inevitable that situations 
[normal]arise 
[normal]where, unfortunately, owners 
[normal]may 
[normal]no longer wish to 
[normal]or be able to 
[normal]keep their 
[normal]primate
[normal]s: owners
[normal]’ circumstances 
[normal]change,
[normal] animals mature and 
[normal]become 
[normal]difficult to manage
[normal] 
[normal]or develop costly health problems
[normal], for example
[normal]. For companion animals such as dogs and cats, there exists an (admittedly overstretched but) well-established network of shelters, sanctuaries and charitie
[normal]s offering the chance for rehoming and/or lifetime care. Such 
[normal]a support network is
[normal], 
[normal]in effect, 
[normal]all but 
[normal]absent for primates. As a result, 
[normal]there is currently a potential welfare deficit facing primates kept as pets. 
[normal]It has been proposed
[normal] that the keeping of primates be limited to “specialist keepers”: individuals with knowledge and experience of keeping primates. We do not support 
[normal]the 
[normal]keeping 
[normal]of primates by private 
[normal]"specialist keepers"
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here is currently no 
[normal]substantive 
[normal]means by which to 
[normal]determine objectively 
[normal]whether an individual
[normal] is 
[normal]a specialist i.e. 
[normal]suitably qualified and experience
[normal]d
[normal]. 
[normal]Moreover
[normal], such keepers may continue to keep primates in a domestic environment which, we are convinced, cannot offer a suitable condition for primates.
[normal]Con[bold]clusion[bold]:[bold]We wholeheartedly support moves to ban the keeping of primates as pets. At this stage
[normal],
[normal] we do not offer suggestions as to the mechanism by which 
[normal]a ban 
[normal]might be 
[normal]implemented:
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]hether by a ban on keeping and/or a ban on the trade of primates
[normal], under th
[normal]e Animal Welfare Act or by 
[normal]other 
[normal]primary legislation. 
[normal]We would be delighted to present further evidence on these matters to the Committee.
