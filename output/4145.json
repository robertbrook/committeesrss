"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Peter Weitzel [FBB0058]Introduction Thi\ns response is by Peter Weitzel, I am a\n chartered electrical engineer with over 40 years of working in \nthe\n media industry for the BBC and others and with an involvement in Professional Societies in Film and TV engineering, Electronic Engineering &amp; Technology\n, Audio \nand the Television industry at large. \nI wish to particularly comment on the Role if the BBC as \na Public Service Broadcaster in the service that it provides to the UK public and creative industries in the field of Technological advancement, Engineering Standards and \nE\nducation of the \nt\nechnical creative workforce. \n&#xa0;\nWhat should the BBC be for and what \nshould be the purpose of public service broadcasting?\nThe \nBBC has enriched the life of the UK and the world by its cultural output and in the technological \narea has\n provided and should \ncontinue to\n provide leadership \nto broad ranges\n of Industries across the\n world. \nA civilised country requires \nsome\n strong\n \norganisation\n which can embody all of its Culture no matter how diverse and be a \nforce\n for \neducation\n and bringing the country together.  \nThe easiest way of doing is by \nBroadcasting where\n it is beneficial to \nhave some \norganisations whose\n purpose is to promote culture, \neducation,\n \nimpartial\n news for the good of the public at large \n– the PSBs. \nThe BBC has been for historic reasons the leader in Public Service Broadcasting – and, unlike some PSBs, \nhas \nbeen inspir\ned \n by, \nand able to move with\n,\n the technologies th\nus \nensuring that all can access its output in means that the \nindividual listener\n,\n viewer or surfer \nfinds convenient.  \nThis cannot be left to the market alone as we seen by how some PSB have seen their role\n and have not made their \ncontent as available\n as the BBC (or anywhere near it!)  And there is a need for a Commercia\nl\nl\ny\n independent organisation like the BBC in  a world where the  UK Largest broadcaster/platform operator  by Turnover also being the  UKs s\necond largest ISP, and the UK Largest ISP being now a notable provider of TV platforms and content.  \nThis can only get more complex and thus the is a need for a sufficiently  large and influential non-commercial publicly focused (and well-funded) Broadcas\nter within a PSB sector to serve those in our community who cannot afford the cost of Pay TV – and to provide a high quality Universally accessed free at  point of delivery Public service.\nIt should be noticed that despite these large players the BBC whils\nt being a significant player in terms of income is still the largest spender on UK creative content as it has no shareholder to pay. \nThe BBC is one leading organisation which can represent all communities of the UK and be a significant and most influentia\nl part of the Media continuum which is so varied – But only work\ns\n because of the unique scope of the BBC and the way that it has (up to now) have sufficient income in a certain \nindependent \nmanner to carry out its public purpose, and to enrich our lives. \n&#xa0;\n How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?\nAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?\nI \nbelieve\n that \nthe BBC\n Has \nfulfilled\n it public \npurposes\n very\n \nwell\n and I \nthink\n \nthat\n they cover we\nll\n what is \nexpected\n of a \nPSB.\nAs an engineer I would like to point out two \nof the Public \nPurposes where\n I can bring my own experience of the BBC to bear. \n (b) Promoting education and learning; I\n note the great work tha\nt the BBC \ndoes \nThrough the B\nB\nC \nA\ncademy\n to promote learning and best p\nractise \nin the creative and re\nlated \ntechnological industries.  \n I \nwelcome the\n \nestablishment\n of the \nnewly formed \nCollege \nof\n \nTechnology to\n carry on \nthe\n great \ntradition\n of technical \ntraining\n undertaken at BBC Wood Norton. \n \nAs well as the initiatives across \nthe\n BBC to provide apprenticeships in many career paths \nI particularly praise the \nBBC \nTe\nchnology Appr\nent\nices and Trainees\n in cooperation with other companies in the broadcasting field.\n \nA\ns a member of SMPTE - the \nworldwide\n society for the technology of the moving image - I felt that it was typical of the BBC intent and need for collaboration that the College of Technology was launched in the \npresence of\n \nthe \nSMPTE \nE\nxecutive Director and man\ny members at \na \nSMPTE meeting in November\n \nat \nNew \nBroadcasting\n House\n.\n I felt honoured that the BBC had chosen SMPTE to be the forum to announce its new initiative.\nThis activity\n of the \nAcademy specified\n under Section 84 of the \nAgreement supports\n the UK \nindus\ntries in\n a way that no one else can and thus should be an activity which the BBC \ncontinues to\n \np\nrovide.  \nI also would like to point out that there is a great shortage of younger people joining the engineering professions and thus \nI value\n BBC output on Radio TV and the web which explains science, mathematics and technology to the audience particularly to teenagers.\n \n I applaud the BBC intent to promote Coding and hope that this can be as successful in making young people interested in the \ndigital world (which is our future) as the BBC micro was 35 years ago – which raised the awareness of the UK as to Technology being our \ncountries \nfuture.\n (f)in promoting its other purposes, helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services and, in addition, taking a leading role in the switchover to digital television.I\n note the great success of the UK DSO and the contribution of the BBC and other bodies who have been instrumental \n \n in making DSO a great suc\ncess, and the continued work to develop through the air Television such as the widespread emission of HD services.  \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC is the one of the few Broadcasters in the world who has the research and development as wel\nl\n as operational \ne\nngineers and technolo\ngists covering a wide range of areas, and with a \ng\nreat depth of \nk\nnowledge. \n \nAnd\n \nthe commitments \nof the BBC in the setting of \nopen standards \nwhich make the \ntechnology   \nprovide \nan ease and universality of use by the audience.  \nI must record great \ncontribution\n made by BBC R&amp;D whose \nBrief\n is given by \nSection\n 87 of the \nagreement\n.  And also to \nthe contribution made by the BBC \nat \nlarge in\n the drafting, setting, verifying and use \nof \nopen \nstandards. F\nrom personal \nexperience\n I can \nacknowledge on\n the \nexcell\nence\n and \ncollaboration of the BBC staff \non th\nes\ne \nactivities\n – within \nindustry \ngroups\n like \nAMWA,\n \nDPP, DTG, EBU, \nITU\n and SMPTE. \n \n \nAs the Technology gets more complex the contribution of the BBC in standards setting as a means of advancing the technologies of the media is greatly appreciated and should continue. \nRelated to this is the education of the industry in these new technologi\nes and standards as carried out by the College of Technology within \nthe \nBBC Academy and the encouragement to BBC Staff to attend \nand speak at \nmeetings and\n conferences of a technical nature. \nWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? \nShould the BBC\n’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? \nWhat balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?\nAs I outlined earlier –I see the\n creative strength and efficiency of the BBC is that it cover all aspects of the media. Thus it would affects the dynamic of \nthe\n whole of \nthe\n successful UK Media industries which not only provides excellent  entertainment education and  information to the \nUK (and world) public – but also sustains a very successful UK exports industry in Media ; programmes , formats and Technology. \nI welcome the bringing of the BBC \nWorld \nS\nervice\n and \nMonitoring\n \ncloser\n within the BBC \nFamily\n – and \nhave\n noted the \nimprovements\n i\nn \nworld\n \ncoverage to\n \nthe\n UK and \nUK\n \ninformation\n \nto the\n \nworld\n \nthat\n this has \nbrought\n, so meeting a public purpose\nThe \nBBC introducing the WOCC has been of great benefit to the independent sector and has increased they richness on our screens – But it is import\nant for the BBC \nn\not to outsource all its production – because it is essential that the Commissioners have experts to consult and fall \nback on   who can actually do a\n \n(\nclose to\n)\n excellent job if called up on to do.\n \nHowever\n to \nperhaps\n make the WOCC to not more than 35% from the 25% it is now may give the \nlittle\n more encouragement to the Indies without affecting BBC in house production. \nIn \nDigital \nmedia\n and \nRadio\n the \nIndies\n market is less well \ndefined\n \nbut this may grow over the \nnext\n Ch\narter period. \n&#xa0;\n How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for \nlicense\n fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond \n2016?\nThe Role of BBC Worldwide has been batted about by politicians – and has generally been made to fit more the BBC public purposes than making a return which can augment the License fee.  \nThe suggestion to merge BBC Worldwide with Channel 4 was typica\nl of the way in which BBC W is seen as \na\n source of funding to be used as governments see fit. \nI\n \nwould\n like to see BBC World wide take a \nmore commercial\n view – but very mindful of the BBC \nindolence\n and PSB role \n- and\n increase its mission to put \nforward\n the\n UK in the \nworld\n of \ncommercial\n \nmedia\n. \nWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?\nI see that the BBC contains within the one \norganisation \ntechnical staff (who I have had the pleasure of being my colleagues)\n who \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThus the BBC has a range of expert knowledgeable technological staff working for a varied organisation which by its public service requirements \n, \nincluding \nu\nniversal\n delivery\n,\n means that the UK Public and the wider World audience are much cost effectively served to receive and easily access BBC content – by broadcasts and the internet.  \n&#xa0;\nIt would be very foolish to break up an organisation  which has these \nEnd to end\n \ntechnical skills so the BBC Should continue to have the \ncapable \nstaff and authority in its charter to  develop technology and new ways of providing the audience with content. \n&#xa0;\n As a lemma \nI feel that a lot of the Failing of the Digital Media Initiative \nafter its successful \nprototype deployment\n in BBC Scotland by Siemens \nis\n due to the move to IT based staff \nwho\n were not expert in, and did not\n \nhave \nunderstanding of\n, \nc\nontent and its creators or how the wider broadcasting industry had moved\n&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? \nIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?\nWhat comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other \ncountries?\n \nI feel that \nthat the \nsuccesses have been \nachieved\n by the role and \nfunding\n that \nthe \nBBC has had for many \nyears\n, and the \nrole\n that \nthe BBC\n \nhas\n within the \ncomplex\n UK \nMedia\n \nmarkets\n.\n \nAny\n \nLarge \nchange to the scoping \nor\n funding of the BBC \nm\nay cause instability which destroys the UK'\ns unique Media mix.\nI still feel that the license  fee as a method is still the most appropriate as the means of deriving a large part of the BBC income – as BBC services are freely available  for everyone to receive enjoy and benefit from.  \nIt is sad that\n it is such an emotive subject when the average \nhousehold\n spends more than even a \nrealistic\n (say £200/year) LF on each \nof broadband and\n Pay \nTV\n provision\n \n– collectively at about 3 \ntimes\n \nwhat they pay in License fee \n \nAlthough I think it was appropriate that\n the BBC should have funded the DSO Help schemes – I think that the fact that the underspend was returned to the Consolidated Fund was not an honest use of that money.\n \nLikewise while I feel that the UK needs to expand the reach of Broadband to remote communities - This is a matter of wider Public policy that just PSB and this top slicing of the LF to provide this is an abuse of the trust that the viewer has in the licens\ne fee.  \nThe same may be said of the \nstart-up\n \ncost\n of \nLocal\n TV \n \n All of these three \nsubsides\n \nare to with \ntechnological matters – rather than content\n, which \nis\n the \nlife\n blood of the \nBBC and what I think the public thinks that Their license  fees should support. \n So I \ncongratulate the\n way in which \nthe\n BBC though \npartnerships is\n making its money available to partners like the Museums and National Performance orations to promote their w\north though the airwaves and internet. \nLikewise\n the support that the BBC \ng\nives\n S4C MG \nAlba\n and the purchase of material from \nLocal\n \nTelevision\n are useful \ninterventions\n to \nsupport\n the \nnone\n (or less\n) commercial\n \nelement\n of PSB.\nHow should the BBC be governed, \nregulated and held accountable beyond 2016?\nIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?\n \nThe exis\nting Charter has been shown to split responsibility between the BBC Trust and the \nE\nxecutive which is NOT good and has in part been responsible for much of the alleged BBC \ne\nxcesses. \nThus a new charter must give a greater clarity and perhaps a slightly heav\nier touch monitoring of operational management whilst still being an arm’s length controlling body. \nThere is a place for the \nTrust\n to \npreserve\n the public interest and to ensure \nclearly\n \nvisible\n \nindependence\n from \nPolitical\n or \ncommercial\n \npressures\n.  OFCOM as\n \nsolely\n \na\n \nregulator\n cannot do this. \nAs for the period of the \ncharter I\n \nobserve\n that although the communications technical environment appears to be changing fast – many of the techniques are currently known, in many cases due to the pioneering work of the\n BBC whether in DVB-T2 or UHD2, or IPlayer and Television Adaptation Layer. \n&#xa0;\nThe one technological change that will occur over the next ten years is that more content will be delivered over IP to provide a more personal viewing experience – But the very e\nfficient and mass universal reach of through the air Televi\nsi\non will still be the most important delivery platforms. \nThe development cycles of many of these technologies approaches ten years from the first idea being demonstrated to the widespread take up of the technology by the audience and thus a period of much less than 10 years may not provide the forward looking vi\new of \nthe media and its technology. \nA\nlthough\n \nthe \nBBC Is, and should be in the future, an \ninnovative\n \ncontent\n \nprovider\n – over the \nperiod of \n a ten \nyear\n \ncharter\n  \nBroadcasting\n will \nstill\n \nexist\n and the \nb\nreadth of the BBC \no\nffering\n \nas the \nmajority\n TV and web PSB\n and the sole Radio PSB \nsee\nn\n to meet the public good. \nI \nhope\n that the \nnew\n \ncharter\n will give the BBC itself the space and \nincentives\n to develop \nand react\n or lead the changes which the \nPopulation\n of the UK will demand – as they use and \nexploit\n \ntechnology\n fo\nr the public good. \nThe BBC has changed over any period of its life – it must be given the funding and governance to allow it to do so accountably to the Public – of the UK who fund it and the world who use it. \nFinally I recognise the creativity\n,\n determin\nation and impartiality of the BBC staff and contributors who are what have made the BBC over the years – and form the best and very accountable broadcaster and information disseminator in the world. \nIt must not be allowed to be destroyed. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013 \n&#xa0;\n"
