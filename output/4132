[normal]I would recommend making cycling skills part of the normal car licencing
[normal] program. Include a set number of supervised hours in various traffic and cycling conditions. This develops awareness in drivers of the needs and behaviours of cyclists, and could include practical knowledge of the variants of road law that affect cycling.
