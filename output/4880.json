\nthe \npublication in July of \nthe Government’s \nresponse to the public \nconsultation o\nn Schedule 7 which I had recommended in my 2011 report and which was conducted in\n late 2012\n, attracting 395 responses\n;\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe detention in August of David Miranda under Schedule 7 at Heathrow, giving rise to a storm of \nmedia \ncontroversy and a \nc\nlaim for judicial review\n,\n \nnot yet decided, which raised a number of issues including \nthe scope of the Schedule 7 power and its use in relation to \nwhat is said by Mr Miranda to be journalistic material\n;\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe rejection in August by the Divisional C\nourt of a claim by a French national\n, examined at Heathrow, that \nthe application of \nSchedule 7 contravened Articles 5, 6 and 8 of the ECHR\n and EU free movement rules\n;\n&#xa0;\n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na Liberal Democrat conference motion \nin October, \ncalling for further safeguards;\n \n&#xa0;\n(e)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe publication in October of an “\nillustrative\n” draft revised Code of Practice\n for examining officers\n;\n&#xa0;\n(f)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \na report\n in October by the Joint Committee of Human Rights, making a number of recommendations for the further reform of Schedule 7;\n&#xa0;\n(g)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na\n \nSupreme Court \ndictum\n in October\n, in a judgment written by its President and the recently-retired Lord Chief Justice\n and concurred in by five other Justices\n,\n \nexpressing concern \nabout the breadth of the powers given to ports officers by Schedule 7;\n&#xa0;\n(h)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe grant in November of a declaration that the refusal of police officers to await the arrival of a solicitor requested by a person detained under Schedule 7 before putting further questions to him was unlawful\n;\n and\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na ministerial response of 11 November 2013 to the JCHR’s report on the Bill, pp.11-17 of which \nrespond to the Committee’s\n recommendations on Schedule 7.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTHRESHOLDS FOR THE USE OF SCHEDULE 7 POWERS&#xa0;Legal background&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Schedule 7 powers&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe current thresholds&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Powers to stop, question and search&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nSchedule 7 powers are to be used solely for the pu\nrpose of \nallowing for the determination of \nwhether\n the\n person \nexamined \nappears to be\n, or to have been, concerned in \nthe commission,\n \npreparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.  \nThe powers must not be used to stop and question persons for any other purpose.”\n \n&#xa0;\nThe courts will no doubt continue, if necessary, to declare an examination unlawful on the basis that it was not used for the statutory purpose.\n&#xa0;\nPower to detain              &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe examining officer considering (or a senior officer being satisfied) that detention is \nnecessary in order to assist in determining whether a person appears to be \na person falling within section 40(1)(b) [i.e. a \nperson who is or has been concern\ned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism;]\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe examining officer considering (or a senior officer being satisfied) that there are \ngrounds for suspecting that the person appears to be \na person falling within section 40(1)(b); or\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe examining officer considering (or a senior officer being satisfied) that there are \nreasonable grounds for suspecting that the person appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe first \n(“\nnecessary in order to assist in \ndetermining\n”) \nis\n \nlittle more than a statement of the obligation that rests upon any officer whose decision is liable to infringe the Article 8 (or Article 5) rights of another person.  It is based on the existing threshold for the taking of fingerprints or \na \nDNA sample,\n \nwhich the Government does not propose\n to amend, \nand resembles the “\nnecessity\n” threshold that the Bill proposes to introduce for \nauthorisation by the review officer of \ncontinued \ndetention after a so far unspecified period.\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second (“\ngrounds for suspecting\n”)\n would echo the subjective belief standards already present in paragraphs 2(2)(b) and 2(4) of Schedule 7.  It would require the officer to have formed a suspicion\n, \nwhether on the basis of information supplied by others, behavioural assessment or even just intuition\n.  It would however\n \nensure that (in the words of Lord Bingham, in the conte\nxt of a stop and search power) a ports officer\n is not deterred from \ndetaining \n“\na person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his \nsuspicion\n”.\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe third (“\nreasonable grounds for suspecting\n”)\n \nis the default threshold for most stop and search powers, and \nwas \nthe solution favoured\n by the JCHR\n in relation to the detention power\n.\n  It is related to (though not identical to) the proposal in the Bill that strip searches should be conducted \nonly where the examining officer has “\nreasonable grounds to suspect that the person is concealing something which may be evidence that the person falls within section 40(1)(b)\n”.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDetention be permitted only when a senior officer is satisfied that there are grounds for suspecting that the person appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b) and that detention is necessary in order to assist in determining whether he is such a person.&#xa0;(b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n On periodic review, a detention may be extended only when a senior officer remains satisfied that there continue to be grounds for suspecting that the person appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b), and that detention continues to be necessary in order to assist in determining whether he is such a person.&#xa0;&#xa0;\nCopying and retention of electronic data&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFURTHER SAFEGUARDS&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProperty may be detained for seven days, even in the absence of any belief that it may be needed for use as evidence in criminal proceedings or in connection with a deportation decision.  This contrasts with a period of 48 hours for the retention of documents obtained under reasonable suspicion powers such as section 43 of and Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000, subject to a single extension of up to a further 48 hours if an officer of at least the rank of chief inspector is satisfied that the examination is being carried out expeditiously, and that it is necessary to continue the examination to ascertain whether the document is one that may be seized.\n \n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSchedule 7 contain\ns, as the JCHR has pointed out, no \nexpress \nsystem of safeguards for categories of material such as legally privileged material, excluded material and special procedure material\n (including “\njournalistic material\n”).\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe retention of electronic data is liable to be held for very long periods under the MOPI regime, which as I reported in July 2013 has been recently criticised in the courts.\n  The system is in marked contrast to the rules and guidance that exist under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 concerning the retention and use of material (including biometric material gathered from Schedule 7 detainees) for the purposes of national security.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUSE OF EVIDENCE GIVEN UNDER COMPULSION&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“It is one thing to conclude that the Schedule 7 powers of examination neither engage nor violate a defendant’s Art. 6 rights; it is another to conclude that there is no room for improvement.  For our part, we would urge those concerned to consider a legislative amendment, introducing a statutory bar to the introduction of Schedule 7 admissions in a subsequent criminal trial.  The terms of any such legislation would require careful reflection, having regard to the legitimate interests of all parties but, given the sensitivities to which the Schedule 7 powers give rise, there would be at least apparent attraction in clarifying legislation putting the matter beyond doubt.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;CONCLUSION&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;DAVID ANDERSON Q.C.Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation               \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n  \n2\n0\n November 2013\nSUMMARY OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWER’S RECOMMENDATIONS&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

Anderson, \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012\n, July 2013, chapter 10; \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2011\n, June 2012, chapter 9; \nReport on the operation of the Terrorism Acts in 2010\n, July 2011, chapter 9: all freely available on my website \nwww.terrorism-legislation-reviewer.independent.gov.uk\n. \n \n              \nSee, most recently, my report of July 2013 at 10.48-10.80.\n \n              \nAs was noted in \nBeghal\n v DPP\n, Schedule 7 was introduced in 2000 but derived from a temporary power introduced in 1974, at the height of the Troubles: [2013] EWHC 2573 (Admin), [36].\n \n              \nReview of the Operation of Schedule 7: A Public Consultation\n, Home Office, July 2013.\n \n              \nBeghal\n v DPP \n[2013] EWHC 2573 (Admin) (Gross LJ, Swift and \nFoskett\n JJ).  The court is understood to have certified points for a possible appeal to the Supreme Court.\n \n              \nQuoted in \nSchedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000\n, House of Commons Library Standard Note SN/HA/6742 (Joanna Dawson), 11 October 2013.\n \n              \nDraft Code of Practice for examining officers under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000\n, Home Office October 2013.\n \n              \nJoint Committee on Human Rights, \nLegislative Scrutiny: Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill\n, Fourth Report of Session 2013-2014, HL Paper 56 HC 713, 11 October 2013, chapter 4.\n \n              \nR v \nGul\n [2013] UKSC 64, (Lords Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Hope, Lord \nMance\n, Lord Judge, Lord Kerr, Lord Reed), [63]-[64].  Having remarked on the broad prosecutorial discretion where terrorist offences are concerned, the Supreme Court continued: “\nWhile the need to bestow wide, even intrusive powers on the police and other officers in connection with terrorism is understandable, the fact that the powers are so unrestricted and the definition of ‘terrorism’ is so wide means that such powers are probably of even more concern than the prosecutorial powers to which the Acts give rise.  Thus, under Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act, the power to stop, question and detain in port and at borders is left to the examining officer.  The power is not subject to any controls.  Indeed, the officer is not even required to have grounds for suspecting that the person concerned falls within section 40(1) of the 2000 Act (\nie\n that he has ‘committed an offence’ or he ‘is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism’), or even that any offence has been or may be committed, before commencing an examination to see whether the person falls within that subsection.  On this appeal we are not, of course, directly concerned with that issue in this case.  But detention of the kind provided for in the Schedule represents the possibility of serious invasions of personal liberty.\n”  \n \n              \nR (\nElosta\n) v MPC \n[2013] EWHC 3397 (Admin): Bean J.  I had expressed my own concerns on this point in \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2011\n (June 2012), 9.66.\n \n              \nApplication no. 32968/11 \nMalik\n v United Kingdom\n, declared admissible on 28 May 2013. \n \n              \ne.g. \nFiaz\n v GMP and SSHD\n, a damages claim alleging discrimination in the application of Schedule 7.\n \n              \nR v \nGul\n [2013] UKSC 64, [63]-[64].\n \n              \nGillan\n and Quinton v UK\n (2010) EHRR 45.\n \n              \nMcVeigh v UK\n (1981) 5 EHRR 71 (\nECommHR\n); \nBeghal\n v DPP \n[2013] EWHC 2573 (Admin), [89]-[91]; Application 26291/06 \nGahramanov\n v Azerbaijan, \nECtHR\n 15 October 2013\n, [39]-[40]\n.\n \n              \nSchedule 7, paras 2-3, 5.\n \n              \nSchedule 7, paras 7-9.  The Bill proposes to prohibit intimate searches.\n \n              \nSchedule 7, para 6.\n \n              \nSchedule 8, paras 6-9.\n \n              \nSchedule 8, paras 10-14.  The Bill proposes to remove the power to take an intimate sample.\n \n              \nOn this issue see D. Anderson, \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012\n, July 2013, 10.65-10.73.\n \n              \nSchedule 7, para 2(1); section 40(1)(b).\n \n              \nAs in \nCC v MPS and SSHD \n[2011] EWHC 3316 (Admin), [34].\n \n              \nSchedule 7, para 6(1).\n \n              \nSchedule 7, para 8.\n \n              \nSchedule 8, para 10(6)(b).\n \n              \nSchedule 8, para 6A(b).\n \n              \nD. Anderson, \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012\n, 10.50-10.62.\n  The reasons given at 10.58 include the need to preserve a deterrent against the use by terrorists of “\nclean skins\n”, the need not to alert a traveller to the fact that he is under surveillance and the need to question the unknown companion of a known terrorist.  I also gave (at 10.59) examples of positive results which have been derived from untargeted no-suspicion stops.\n \n              \nRules based targeting involves the “washing” of carrier data against intelligence-led indicators (or rules), so as to flag those passengers most closely matching the chosen rules. A rule might, for example, be used in the counter-terrorism context to identify\n \ntravellers with a profile similar to those of known terrorists travelling on routes of concern.\n \n Such targeting will not be enough to engender suspicion of each individual who is targeted: but it provides an entirely rational and potentially very useful way of identifying persons whom it may be appropriate to question, and if necessary to search, in order to d\netermine whether they are concern\ned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.  See further John Vine QPM, “\nExporting the border? An inspection of e-borders October 2012-March 2013\n”.\n \n              \nJCHR\n report, fn 10 above, \npara 110.  The JCHR did however recommend a reasonable suspicion requirement before information on personal electronic devices could be accessed or searched: para 122.\n \n              \nHome Office, \nDraft Code of Practice for examining officers under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000\n, October 2013, para 19.  The passage cited should however be moved above the sub-heading “\nExamination period\n”, since it belongs under the previous sub-heading “\nExercise of Examination Powers and Selection Criteria\n”.\n \n              \nAs in the case of \nCC v MPS and SSHD \n[2011] EWHC 3316 (Admin).\n \n              \nD. Anderson, \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012\n, June 2013, 10.7.  For context, it may be recalled that some 245 million passengers travel through UK airports, seaports and international rail terminals in 2010/11: \nibid\n.\n, 10.8(b).\n \n              \nJCHR report, \nfn 10 \nabove, paras 112-114.\n \n              \nSchedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000, para 10(6)(b).\n \n              \nSchedule 8 to the Bill, para 7(3).  The necessity is there linked to “\nexercising a power under paragraph 2 or 3 of that Schedule\n”: I prefer the more direct formulation suggested here.\n \n              \nGillan\n and Quinton \n[2006] UKHL 12, para 35.  It appears that a requirement of subjective suspicion in section 44 might have gone part of the way at least to satisfying the European Court of Human Rights which stated of section 44 in the same case, \nGillan\n and Quinton v UK  \n[2010] EHRR 45: “\nNot only is it unnecessary for [the officer] to demonstrate the existence of any reasonable suspicion; he is not required even subjectively to suspect anything about the person stopped and searched\n”.\n \n              \nSchedule 8 to the Bill, para 3(3) at 5(b).\n \n              \nI am conscious that the courts were historically “\nloath to subject to any searching analysis the basis of police claims that they had reasonable suspicion\n”: D. Feldman, \nCivil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales\n, 2\nnd\n \nedn\n. 2002, p. 334.  But it would be unsatisfactory to rely on the courts adopting an over-permissive interpretation of the reasonable suspicion standard.  As the same author acknowledges, \nECtHR\n case law, given domestic effect by the Human Rights Act 1998, “\nmakes it clear that the reasonableness of a constable’s suspicion must be carefully assessed\n”.\n \n              \nUnder the reasonable suspicion power in section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\n \n              \nReplacing the test in Schedule 8 to the Bill, para 7(3)\n at \n(3).\n \n              \nSee most recently, D. Anderson, \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012\n, July 2013, 10.59-10.60 and 10.65-10.80. \n \n              \nSchedule 7, para 8(1).\n \n              \nSchedule 7 paras 8, 9.\n \n              \nThis would allow a copy to be retained for as long as is necessary for the purpose of determining whether a person falls within section 40(1)(b), or while the examining officer believes that it may be needed for use as evidence in criminal proceedings or in connection with a decision by the Secretary of State whether to make a deportation order under the Immigration Act 1971.\n \n              \nCounter-Terrorism Act 2008, section 5.\n \n              \nJCHR report, \nfn 10 above, \npara 125.  These concepts are defined in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, sections 10-14.\n \n              \nD.
