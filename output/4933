[normal]Introduction
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Sunderland City Council welcomes the opportunity to provide 
[normal]to the Committee 
[normal]comments 
[normal]on 
[normal]how f
[normal]iscal and financial powers could be devolved to cities and City Regions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]These comments are provided in addition to the comments of the Key Cities Group (of which the council is a founder member) submitted on behalf of the Group by Wakefield City 
[normal]Council
[normal] 
[normal]and which the City Council fully supports
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] City Council considers that
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential implications
[normal] from greater Scottish autonomy should be borne in mind as part of 
[normal]any 
[normal]further considerations on
[normal] how fiscal and financial powers could be devo
[normal]lved to 
[normal]and beyond 
[normal]cities and City Regions
[normal] in England
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0
[normal]              
[normal]Evidence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The scale of economic competit
[normal]ion 
[normal]currently provided by Scotland is an issue which the cou
[normal]ncil wishes to respond to
[normal].  R
[normal]esearch 
[normal]has already been undertaken by organisations
[normal] such as the Association of North
[normal] East Council
[normal]s in this regard,
[normal] in terms of 
[normal]both competing
[normal] and 
[normal]engagi
[normal]ng with Scotland
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]An un-level playing field currently exists between England and Scotland in respect of devolved fiscal and financial powers.  
[normal]Scotlan
[normal]d already has power over many of the key determinants of economic development including infrastructure, skills, education and industrial development and could become more attractive for inward investment if it acquires greater fiscal powers, to the detrime
[normal]nt of areas in the North East and Cumbria
[normal] in particular
[normal].
[normal]  For example, Scotland has the ability to vary taxes and incentives to its advantage but the North East and Cumbria doesn’t have the ability to take countervailing measures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he different instit
[normal]utional frameworks and capacities 
[normal]on each side of the border 
[normal](particularly
[normal] 
[normal]since the abolition of 
[normal]the 
[normal]R
[normal]egional 
[normal]D
[normal]evelopment 
[normal]A
[normal]gencies 
[normal] and the Government Offices) place the North East and Cumbria at a
[normal] disadvantage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Both are
[normal] institutional
[normal]ly weaker 
[normal]follow
[normal]ing the abolition of regional structures leaving them 
[normal]with reduced power and autonomy
[normal].  Scotland, in contrast, 
[normal]already has
[normal] powerful political and eco
[normal]nomic 
[normal]d
[normal]evelopment organisations 
[normal](
[normal]including 
[normal]Scottish Local Authorities, Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish 
[normal]Funding Council and Skills Scotland)
[normal] forming a more effective institutional framework with the capacity to 
[normal]speak with a single voice
[normal] directly to the First Minister for Scotland and colleagues on a regular basis
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]The Scottish Independence Referendum to
[normal] be held on 18 September 2014 and is 
[normal]very 
[normal]likely to result in Scotland acquiring substantial new powers either through independence, or the ‘Devo Plus’ or ‘Devo Max’ options.  Regardless of the actual result, the acquisition of new powers by Scotland 
[normal]can b
[normal]e ex
[normal]pected to have substantial economic development impl
[normal]ications for the rest of the UK, and especially 
[normal]for the North East and Cumbria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]Increased autonomy for Scotland, is therefore not just a matter for Scotland.  A
[normal] resurgent Scotland 
[normal]will pose
[normal] a thr
[normal]eat to economic de
[normal]velopment south of the border, but there is also the potential for
[normal] economic development in the North East and Cumbria 
[normal]to 
[normal]b
[normal]enefit from a more autonomous Scotland.  
[normal]The City Council 
[normal]recognis
[normal]es that t
[normal]here are both potential threats and oppor
[normal]tunities
[normal] but they do not necessarily balance out
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]It is Sunderland
[normal] City Council’s consideration that 
[normal]without greater fiscal devolution to and beyond cities and City Regions 
[normal]a
[normal]reas like Sunderland are at risk of being caught between “a rock and a hard p
[normal]lace”
[normal],
[normal] between an increasing autonomous and confident Scotland and a
[normal]n increasingly
[normal] prosperous and powerful London an
[normal]d the South East
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]An example of the type of incentives for growth which the City Council would seek to have devolved to relevant local authorities would include the ability to 
[normal]put together a package of incentives that would be equivalent (but not identical) in financial ter
[normal]ms to that which Scotland/Scottish authorities would be able to muster.  The City Council 
[normal]recognis
[normal]es that for instance, varying Corporation Tax within the rest of the United Kingdom would not be possible, financial devolution could allow the North East and
[normal] Cumbria to assemble a competitive financial offer.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Conclusion
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The issue of Scotland’s competitive advantag
[normal]e now 
[normal]and after the 
[normal]i
[normal]ndependence referendum 
[normal]must
[normal] i
[normal]nform considerations by 
[normal]government
[normal] 
[normal]in respect of maxi
[normal]mizing economic impact and the 
[normal]poten
[normal]tial to improve services and reduce costs through fiscal devolution to and beyond cities and City Regions in England.
