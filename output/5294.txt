[[[Summary]]]The Committee did not explicitly ask for views on the role of helmets in cycling safety. However, while British I have been resident in New Zealand for some years and have first hand experience of how wrong and counterproductive promoting or legislating bicycle helmets is. It is important than the UK does not make the same mistakes.

[[[Bicycling is Beneficial]]]7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Does the safety risk of cycli]]]

[[[ng outweigh the health benefits?]]]7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The answer is, quite clearly, no: the actual risk of cycling is tiny. There is one cyclist death per 33 million kilometres of cycling, while being sedentary presents a much greater risk. Over 50,000 people die in the UK each year due to coronary heart disease related to insufficient physical activity, compared to around 100 cyclists killed on the road. Research suggests that safety risks are outweighed by the health benefits by a factor of around twenty to one.8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The individual choosing to cycle wins; they gain a health benefit, they reduce their transport costs, etc. Cyclists on average live longer.8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Society also benefits; there is less demand on health services, reduced congestion on the roads, lower environmental pollution (which incidentally is a significant killer), etc.8.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Business also benefits; healthier people are happier, and healthier happier people are more productive –&#xa0;some countries have run schemes where employers donate bicycles to their employees if they use them a few times a week to ride to work, and businesses have participated because it makes financial sense to do so.

[[[Why Bicycle Helmet Legislation And Promotion Is Bad]]]14.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It creates the false impression that the costs of bicycling outweigh the benefits, while the reverse is true, however much effort is put into avoiding this problem.14.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Helmet promotion has therefore, wherever undertaken, over sold the minimal protection that helmets provide in order to counter the false impression of the dangers of bicycling.14.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overselling any safety device is counterproductive, due to risk compensation.14.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The result is that the, already minimal, benefit is negated.14.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Bicycle helmets are commercial products; marketing is up to the manufacturers not the Government.14.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However as safety devices there marketing must be controlled, that is where the Government has a role –&#xa0;in avoiding specious claims etc.15.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; You start with an activity where the benefits outweigh the costs and yet argue that participants are somehow irresponsible if they don’t wear helmets.15.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Today in Australia and New Zealand it is a common view among the public that un-helmeted bicyclists should not be covered by national health care.15.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Yet those bicyclists are reducing Society’s costs.15.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; And are invariably the victims when serious injuries or deaths occur.

[[[Conclusions]]]&#xa0; Active Travel Strategy, Department for Transport/Department of Health, UK, 22 Feb 2010 These standards are by no means new, we find them in liberalism in the 17C:… the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so … because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil, in case he do otherwise.from On Liberty, John Stuart Mill, 1859Echoes of these ideas are found in our present day views on human rights, discrimination and justice. The New Zealand Government, when working on an active transport strategy, once stated that they had “shot ourselves in the foot” with the promotion of bicycle helmets. Bicycle helmets are designed, due to unavoidable limitations, for cycle-only incidents below about 10mph. For example the New Zealand Government chose the slogan “Bare head, Knucklehead”… with obvious connotations. But what could they have chosen without negative connotations?&#xa0;January 2014
