[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Guide Dogs [bold](TIC 065)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.0 About Guide Dogs[bold]1.1 Guide Dogs provides mobility and rehabilitation services
[normal] for
[normal] blind and partially sighted people in the UK
[normal], 
[normal]delivered through 20 local 
[normal]mobility teams. T
[normal]he guide dog 
[normal]service involves the training and provision of assistance dogs to blind and partially sighted people, working with both guide dog and owner to create a successful partnership through which the individual can become as indep
[normal]endently mobile as possible
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]2 Alongside our mobility work we campaign to break down physical and legal barriers to 
[normal]help
[normal] blind and partially sight people to get around on their own. 
[normal]Current estimates suggest 
[normal]two million people with sight loss in the UK of which around 360,000
[normal] are regi
[normal]stered as blind or partially sighted.
[normal] We do not have
[normal] absolute
[normal] 
[normal]figures
[normal] of the proportion of blind and partially sighted 
[normal]who live in isolated communities 
[normal]across the UK 
[normal]but an analysis of the 
[normal]Guide Dogs user 
[normal]data we hold for Scotland 
[normal]indicates 
[normal]that 4.5% of b
[normal]lind and partially sighted people in Scotland live in the 
[normal]isolated communities of 
[normal]Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney 
[normal]Islands and
[normal] Shetland Islands.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]P
[normal]ublic transport is 
[normal]extremely 
[normal]important
[normal] to the independent mobility of blind and partially sighted people 
[normal]as the nature of their disability means they
[normal] are unable to drive.
[normal] 
[normal]Research has revealed that although disabled people travel less often than non-disabled people, they are more likely to use bus services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0 [bold]To what extent are the needs of different [bold]groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]The needs of blind and partially sighted passengers are not sufficiently taken int
[normal]o account
[normal] by local authorities or transport providers
[normal] in isolated communities
[normal]. The following areas cause significant problems for blind and partially sighted people
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 Limited Availability [bold]of Services[bold]Limited serv
[normal]ices in isolated areas can make the difference between people with sight loss
[normal] going
[normal] out and integrating with their community or remaining 
[normal]isolated and 
[normal]immobile
[normal] in their homes. Guide Dogs has received indications 
[normal]from service users 
[normal]that 
[normal]public transport provision 
[normal]in rural areas 
[normal]is declining, with serious consequences for people’s independence: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2
[normal].1.1 
[normal]“There isn’t a bus into Brecon
[normal] anymore; it costs over £20 to get a taxi, so we have to rely on our family for lifts to go shopping. My wife is deaf blind and has depression, it’s very hard for us now as my sight is failing and we want to carry on doing things for ourselves, we’ve raise
[normal]d a family together here in Llangorse, we’ve always lived in the village, but they say the little shop is closing now so I don’t know what we’ll do” Mr R, Llangorse 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].1.2 
[normal]“There aren't enough buses locally. I only have the choice of one bus to get me to 
[normal]work and that only runs term time. Next year this service will stop
[normal],
[normal] meaning I am totally reliant on others.
[normal]”
[normal] Guide Dog Owner, Dorset
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].1.3
[normal] 
[normal]“I stopped driving in 2001 due to severe sight loss.  At that time, the 
[normal]Post Bus came through Scethrog 
[normal]and other 
[normal]ru
[normal]ral communities …
[normal] It meant that I was able to retain a level of independen
[normal]ce …
[normal].  
[normal]I
[normal]t was always popular and well used.  About 2007 the service was withdrawn.  I now rely on my husband, and taxis
[normal]…
[normal] I really miss the Post Bus which was reliable, did not requir
[normal]e booking and was efficient. " Mrs S, Scethrog
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 [bold]Unmanned[bold] Train[bold] Stations[bold]1 
[normal]U
[normal]nstaffed stations, of which there are 220 in Wales, 33 in Northern Ireland and 209 in Scotland,
[normal] 
[normal]present particular difficulties.
[normal] 
[normal]U
[normal]nmanned stations in rural areas 
[normal]cause problems 
[normal]for blind and partially sighted people in purchasing tickets
[normal], 
[normal]getting the information and suppor
[normal]t they need from station staff,
[normal] 
[normal]and embarking and disembarking
[normal] 
[normal]safely 
[normal]from trains
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]Stepping from the platform to the train and vice versa is potentially d
[normal]angerous 
[normal]as t
[normal]he gap between 
[normal]train and platform 
[normal]varies b
[normal]oth horizontally and vertically.
[normal] Pr
[normal]ovision of 
[normal]appropriate
[normal] color-
[normal]contrasted tactile warning strips 
[normal]at platform edges 
[normal]is inconsistent and often absent
[normal]. 
[normal]A blind or partially sighted person may not be able to 
[normal]use 
[normal]an unstaffed station unless they are absolutely certain of their route from 
[normal]the train to the platform and from 
[normal]the 
[normal]platform 
[normal]to the 
[normal]station 
[normal]exit
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]ew designs of automated ticket vending machi
[normal]nes 
[normal]require 
[normal]use of a touch screen 
[normal]which gives 
[normal]no tactile or audible feedback. Partially sighted people report problems with the size and tonal contrast of text on the screens and glare caused by reflective light sources. Whilst journeys can be pre-
[normal]booked o
[normal]nline, it is still necessary to use a credit card and enter a pin number on the ticket machine to retrieve tickets. This is impossible for blind people to do without help from staff. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.3
[normal] 
[normal]Passenger 
[normal]Assistance
[normal] is generally useful for disabled travelers
[normal]. 
[normal]However, Guide Dogs has
[normal] received anecdotal evidence 
[normal]from our service users 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]faxes 
[normal]used to alert
[normal] station staff to the need for passenger assistants are sometimes 
[normal]sent to unmanned stations where they are not
[normal] picked up
[normal] 
[normal]until after 
[normal]the requested time o
[normal]f departure
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This results
[normal] in 
[normal]passengers disembark
[normal]ing
[normal], expecting to be met by staff
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]find
[normal]ing
[normal] themselves alone in an unmanned station
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold] [bold]Access[bold] to embarkation points[bold]The ability of people to use public transport depends on them being 
[normal]able to access 
[normal]the embarkation and disembarkation points. The Department for Transport has recognised this, stating 
[normal]“
[normal]we need to focus on improving the entire door-to-door journey.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]Options for public transport
[normal] 
[normal]in isolated communities are more limited
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]han in most metrop
[normal]olitan areas
[normal], leaving blind and partially sighted people fewer 
[normal]places 
[normal]to 
[normal]access public transport
[normal] 
[normal]or interch
[normal]ange between modes of transport
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.1 
[normal]Safe access to bus stops and stations 
[normal]can be adversely affected by cars parked inappropriately, poor lighting, 
[normal]poor infrastructure
[normal] design
[normal], poor maintenance of hedges a
[normal]nd verges, isolated stops, 
[normal]and a lack of safe place
[normal]s
[normal] to cross
[normal] roads
[normal]. 
[normal]The ability to walk to and from stops and stations depends
[normal] also upon pavement quality. Kerbed
[normal] footways clearly delineate b
[normal]etween pedestrian and traffic
[normal] areas, indicate a safe place to walk
[normal],
[normal] and deno
[normal]te the positioning of bus stops and
[normal] shelters. 
[normal]Some c
[normal]ountry roads 
[normal]do not have 
[normal]formal 
[normal]kerbed footways, making it diffi
[normal]cult for blind and partially sighted people to reach public transport embarkation points.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.2 
[normal]"Pengam railway station in Glan-yr-Nant has a busy crossroads with no pedestrian crossing over the main Bargoed to Ystrad Mynach
[normal] road or the road leading to Fleur-de-Lys.”
[normal] 
[normal]Rehabilitation Officer, Wales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.3
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal][the bus service is] 
[normal]just not suitable for people with sight loss living in rural areas. Need taxis to and from bus depots/stops.” G
[normal]uide 
[normal]D
[normal]og 
[normal]O
[normal]wner,
[normal] N
[normal]orthern 
[normal]I
[normal]reland
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.4
[normal] 
[normal]“There is one bus an hour into Chepstow, but the road I have to walk to get to the bus stop has no pavements. At one point there are high walls on both sides and the 
[normal]Lorries
[normal] that go by frighten me. My guide dog and I have to push ourselves back against the
[normal] wall if we get c
[normal]aught there, I really dread it” 
[normal]Mrs G, Guide Dog Owner, Caerwent
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 [bold]Information[bold] availability[bold] [bold]Timetable and service information should be available to passengers in their preferred format. A lack of 
[normal]accessible
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]accurate and timely info
[normal]rmation is a 
[normal]major deterrent to blind and partially sighted p
[normal]eople using public transport in isolated communities. 
[normal]Audio and visual announcements 
[normal]on buses and bus stops
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] essential
[normal] to disabled people in helping them to understand their location and proximity to 
[normal]their 
[normal]destination. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.1
[normal] 
[normal]“I live in a rural community, none of my busses have audio announcements, which makes it difficult for me to sometimes travel alone feeling entirel
[normal]y comfortable and free of anxiety, particularly during quieter times of the day, and especially when not knowing if the bus stop is a "request" only stop.” Guide dog owner, Kent
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.2
[normal] 
[normal]“Recently when going home 
[normal]…
[normal] I missed my stop and had to go to the end o
[normal]f the route and come back. This would not have happen
[normal]ed
[normal] if audio visual announcements were on the bus. It would be great to see some movement on getting some audio visual on some routes
[normal]” 
[normal]Guide dog owner, 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5[bold] Staff [bold]training[bold]Where informati
[normal]on is not freely available, s
[normal]taff can be 
[normal]a key point of
[normal] 
[normal]information during journeys and at stops. 
[normal]This means that, particularly in rural areas, d
[normal]rivers’ attitudes and role in providing effective and timely information 
[normal]and support
[normal] 
[normal]is critical. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.1
[normal] 
[normal]Drivers need to be given disability awareness training to ensure they are aware of the needs of disabled passengers by, for example, pulling up next to the 
[normal]kerb 
[normal]or 
[normal]providing 
[normal]assistance.
[normal] Guide Dogs Road to Nowhere Report found that only 25% of blind and par
[normal]tially sighted people reported that bus drivers always pulled up to the kerb. Only 
[normal]55% reported that drivers always say the number of the bus 
[normal]when asked, and
[normal] 
[normal]as few as 
[normal]17% 
[normal]reported that drivers 
[normal]always wait for blind or partially sighted passengers to find 
[normal]a seat before pulling off.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.2
[normal] 
[normal]“Some of the bus drivers drive so fast and then have to jam on the brakes hard when they see someone is waiting, on the rural journey from Cirencester to Cheltenham and back.  It makes me feel sick and my guide dog slide
[normal]s along the floor towards the front of the bus if I don't grab her.

[normal]2.5.3
[normal] 
[normal]“I rely heavily on rural transport to get to the bus stop in my local town which causes me more problems. In my local town there is no bus 
[normal]stati
[normal]on, so the buses pull up on the street and could be double parked or 2 ft away from the 
[normal]kerb
[normal]. I can't tell which bus is the one I want and ne
[normal]ed to rely on other passengers… 
[normal]I don't have confidence in travelling by bus at night or in the dark evenings.” G

[normal]2.5.4
[normal] 
[normal]Guide Dogs recommends that the Department for Transport reassess its decision to postpone the implementation of the disability awareness training for drivers 
[normal]required 
[normal]by EU Regulation 181/2011.
[normal] 
[normal]The Regulation
[normal]’s 
[normal]implementation
[normal] would 
[normal]ensure that 
[normal]drivers in isolated areas 
[normal]properly 
[normal]take the needs of blind and partially sighted passengers into account. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold].0 [bold]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on ta[bold]xis and other demand-responsi[bold]ve [bold]transport services?[bold]B
[normal]lind and partially sighted people 
[normal]can 
[normal]rely
[normal] 
[normal]on 
[normal]taxis to bridge the gap
[normal] in public transport provision
[normal] and avoid dangerous situation
[normal]s. This is particularly relevant in isolated areas where 
[normal]public transport
[normal] 
[normal]services 
[normal]are 
[normal]more limited or 
[normal]harder to access.
[normal] Visually impaired people
[normal] 
[normal]may have to use
[normal] taxis in place of public transport 
[normal]at significant additional c
[normal]ost to them, especially as many
[normal] qualify for free or heavily discounted public transport.
[normal] The Road to Nowhere report showed that 67% of 
[normal]blind and partially sighted respondents spent money on taxi fares because they didn’t trust their local bus services.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].1 
[normal]“
[normal]Unfamiliar areas cause great difficulties for me and I don't know where to get off the bus, so tend to rely on taxi travel, rather
[normal] than take the bus.” G

[normal]reland
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].2 
[normal]However, frequent taxi use is expensive
[normal]. 14% of Road to Nowhere respondents spent between 
[normal]£30 and £50 on taxis a month and 10% spent more than £50 a month. 
[normal]Additionally, 
[normal]demand-responsive transpor
[normal]t services may not always be readily available in isolated areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].3
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]Taxis are not an option as the local operators cover the school runs so none available to get me to work. My DLA is under threat so I will not be able to afford to pay for a taxi 
[normal]anyway.”
[normal] 
[normal]Guide Dog Owner, Dorset
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].4
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]There is a Dial a Ride service but I am very conscious that a 16-seater minibus travelling from Brecon to pick me up is neither cost effective nor environmentally friendly.  It also has to be booked a few days in adva
[normal]nce and therefore does not cope with spontaneous trips.

[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he law 
[normal](Equality Act 2010
[normal] in England, Scotland and Wales and the Disability Discrimination Act in Northern Ireland) 
[normal]states that the driver of a licensed taxi or private hire ve
[normal]hicle cannot refuse to carry a guide dog, or other registered assistance dog, unless the driver has a medical exemption
[normal]. However,
[normal] 
[normal]Guide Dogs receives 
[normal]regular 
[normal]reports of 
[normal]cases
[normal] 
[normal]where guide dog owners have been 
[normal]refused access by taxi drivers. Due to the natur
[normal]e of their disability, blind and partially sighted people may not be able to get the
[normal] license plate number
[normal] 
[normal]of the taxi or driver 
[normal]registration 
[normal]and so many such incidents go unreported
[normal], or local authorities fail to take actio
[normal]n because of a lack of evidence
[normal]. W
[normal]hilst guide dog owners continue to be refused access to taxis, 
[normal]it is unreasonable to
[normal] expect
[normal] them to rely upon taxis as a means of transport in isolated communities
[normal] because of the commercial imperative in decision making relating to public transport
[normal].
