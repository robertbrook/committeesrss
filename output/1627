default blind and partially sighted people in the UK
default,

defaulthe guide dog

defaulthelp
default blind and partially sight people to get around on their own. 
defaultCurrent estimates suggest 
defaulttwo million people with sight loss in the UK of which around 360,000
default are regi
defaultstered as blind or partially sighted.

defaultbut an analysis of the 
defaultGuide Dogs user 
defaultdata we hold for Scotland 
defaultindicates 
defaultthat 4.5% of b

defaulto account
default by local authorities or transport providers
default in isolated communities
default. The following areas cause significant problems for blind and partially sighted people
default:

defaultices in isolated areas can make the difference between people with sight loss
default going
default out and integrating with their community or remaining 
defaultisolated and

default in their homes. Guide Dogs has received indications 
defaultfrom service users 
defaultthat 
defaultpublic transport provision 
defaultin rural areas 
defaultis declining, with serious consequences for people’s independence:

default.1.1 
default“There isn’t a bus into Brecon
default anymore; it costs over £20 to get a taxi, so we have to rely on our family for lifts to go shopping. My wife is deaf blind and has depression, it’s very hard for us now as my sight is failing and we want to carry on doing things for ourselves, we’ve raise
defaultd a family together here in Llangorse, we’ve always lived in the village, but they say the little shop is closing now so I don’t know what we’ll do” Mr R, Llangorse 
default&#xa0;

default.1.2 
default“There aren't enough buses locally. I only have the choice of one bus to get me to 
defaultwork and that only runs term time. Next year this service will stop
default,
default meaning I am totally reliant on others.

default“I stopped driving in 2001 due to severe sight loss.  At that time, the

defaultHowever, Guide Dogs has
default received anecdotal evidence

defaultsent to unmanned stations where they are not

default2.3default defaultAccessdefault to embarkation pointsdefaultThe ability of people to use public transport depends on them being 
defaultable to access 
defaultthe embarkation and disembarkation points. The Department for Transport has recognised this, stating 
default“

default Guide Dogs Road to Nowhere Report found that only 25% of blind and par

defaultThere is a Dial a Ride service but I am very conscious that a 16-seater minibus travelling from Brecon to pick me up is neither cost effective nor environmentally friendly.  It also has to be booked a few days in adva

default 
defaultGuide Dogs receives 
defaultregular 
defaultreports of 
defaultcases
default 
defaultwhere guide dog owners have been
