[[[SUPPLEMENTARY WRITTEN EVIDENCE BY DEFRA ]]]

[[[THE EFRA ORAL SESSION ON 22]]]

[[[ND]]]

[[[ OCTOBER 2013]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Correction:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]During the hearing the Permanent Secretary stated that she thought the latest figure for the SPS cost per claim indicator for 2012/13 was £621 per claim. This figure is actually £691 per claim.

[[[Questions raised: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Detailed below are Defra’s responses to the questions raised at the Select Committee Hearing on 22nd October 2013 as detailed in the email from the Second Clerk. &#xa0;

[[[EA staff costs – what are Other Staff related costs? How much of the £30 m increase to staff costs is covered by the additional funding for flood defences?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Other staff related costs comprise primarily of staff allowances and pension contributions to the closed pension scheme. The contributions to the active pension scheme are categorised separately in note 3. The Agency intends to categorise the closed pension payments separately in the next ARA to enhance the reader’s understanding. The staff allowances include standby and call out payments for frontline staff relating to flood incident management. In addition, other staff costs include small discretionary payments made to staff not entitled to overtime or unsociable hour payments in recognition of their substantial contributions made to incident management.  &#xa0;The £30m staff cost increase arose primarily in the delivery of specialist frontline non flood projects, as well as flood incident management in 2012, with a lower proportion corresponding with the increased flood defence funding which was largely capital expenditure. This was funded through the additional budget provided to the Agency during the year.&#xa0;

[[[How many Off-payroll staff does Defra still have, at what cost? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We assume that this question is related to the disclosure of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees, ARA page 37. The Treasury review of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees (published 23 May 2012) requested information from central government departments and their arm’s length bodies, in relation to all individuals engaged off payroll as of 31 January 2012, where the cost to the department is in excess of £58,200 per annum (the Senior Civil Service minimum).&#xa0;Defra's review identified 144 off-payroll engagements that were in place at 31 January 2012. With the exception of 3 individuals, all either left or Defra renegotiated their contract to be compliant with HMT requirements. The current position is that two individuals have provided assurance for the relevant period. The third person left Defra in June 2013. HM Treasury required these contracts to be amended only to the extent that the work involved represented value for money for the taxpayer.&#xa0;W

[[[hy has the cost of fees and commissions almost doubled? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The amount charged to administration costs in 2012-13 was £17m, 2011-12 £9m. This increase of £8m was mainly due to:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Why did Defra make an additional payment to NuStar (£413,000) in 2012-13]]]&#xa0;The original payment made reflected the outcome of the contractual dispute between RPA and NuStar, which was formally settled at mediation under the terms of a full and final settlement. A further special payment of £413,000 was made in 2012-13 related to RPA’s agreed contribution towards the final outstanding site cleanup costs.  This was cleared through HM Treasury. &#xa0;&#xa0;
