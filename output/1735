default&#xa0;defaultSummarydefaultDetaildefault&#xa0;
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGlobal progress with CCS has been slow compared to estimates by national governments and inter-governmental bodies. Nevertheless, Bloomberg New 
defaultEnergy Finance data show that public and private organisations have channelled $26.8bn into CCS commercialisation since 2000. Government grants make up 54% of that total. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGlobal investment in projects has remained steady since 2009 at around $2.8bn a ye
defaultar (BNEF, 7 March 2013). That investment has produced seventeen medium- to-large CCS projects operating, or under construction, with another 55 at the planning stage (GCCSI).
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK is one of the leading countries in terms of developing an effective CCS 
defaultpolicy framework, despite slow progress with its attempts to fund demonstration projects (2006-11).  A new approach has emerged in the form of the CCS Commercialisation Programme and the Electricity Market Reform (EMR). This has the potential to match UK C
defaultCS rhetoric and delivery on the ground.   
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDECC’s Commercialisation Programme has selected two projects – White Rose and Peterhead - to enter negotiations for Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies, with a view to making final investment decisio
defaultns in 2015.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhite Rose is a cost effective, realistic and deliverable project, which offers an excellent opportunity to establish the commercial future of the technology. The project is 
defaultEurope’s only CCS project being considered for NER300 funding
default (for f
defaulturther details on the project see the attached slide pack.) 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that the momentum is maintained in the Commercialisation Programme, so that two projects can enter operation in the 2018-2020 timeframe
default. 
defaultAs the Committee on Climate Change has said: 
default&#xa0;
default‘It will be important that the Government continues to learn the lessons of the earlier failed CCS Competition, including the need for rapid progress and avoiding traditional procurement processes unsuited to
default a complex first-of-a-kind project.’ 
default(CCC Carbon Budget Progress Report 2013.)
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe strongly agree with that view, in particular the need for Government to take a more innovative and collaborative approach, rather than relying on a traditional procurement 
defaultmodel. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur answers to the Committee’s questions are as follows:
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another?default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are currently three main technology options for capturing CO2: pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTwo of the partners in the White Rose project - 
defaultAlstom
default and 
defaultLinde
default (BOC) – have already participated in a number of pilot projects:
default&#xa0;
defaultAlstomdefault: projects using oxy-combustion, chilled ammonia, advanced amines or second-generation technologies. 
defaultFive units
default have completed tests in the USA &amp; Europe; while 
defaulteight units are in operation or in commissioning.
default&#xa0;
defaultLindedefault (BOC):default has built an advanced amines-based pilot plant and an oxy-combustion related pilot plant in Germany and is involved as part of a consortium de
defaultveloping a potential pre-combustion plant in the USA.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe pilot and validation plants have shown that the technology works. The next step is to establish the commercial credentials of the technology at large-scale with full CCS chain. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat defaultcontribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPower generation accounts for approximately a third of the UK’s CO2 emissions, or 182 million tonnes of CO2 a year (DECC
default 2013)
default&#xa0;
default Capturing and storing that carbon could reduce emissions from fossil fuel power stations by as much as 95%
default (ETI, 2013). As the Prime Minister said in a recent Liaison Committee meeting: 
default&#xa0;
default‘
defaultdecarbonisation targets only really make sense when you 
defaultknow what is going to be possible in terms of carbon capture and storage….
default If not, you are in quite serious water, because you would be only relying on nuclear and renewable.’ 
default(Liaison Committee, 11 December 2012)
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAnalysis
default 
defaultby the Government and the Commi
defaultttee for Climate Change shows that up to 0.6 GW of CCS could be delivered in the UK by 2020; 5-10 GW by 2030 and up to 40 GW by 2050. The CCS Association has argued that 20–30 GW is possible by 2030. The exact number will depend in large part on the succes
defaults of the current Commercialisation Programme and whether the first two projects, including adequately sized initial CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, can be delivered on time.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith the expected growth of intermittent renewable generation (rising 
defaultfrom 9% of electricity today to 32% by 2030) and the continued contribution of inflexible nuclear generation, it will be important for the UK to maximise the use of flexible, fossil fuel generation. CCS can be designed to enable that flexibility to be real
defaultised, whilst ensuring emissions are reduced effectively.   
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the longer term, CCS combined with biomass is the only low carbon technology that could remove industrial quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere and permanently store it in deep geological for
defaultmations. CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere during the natural growth process of biomass. Following combustion of the biomass the CO2 is captured and permanently stored providing a net carbon removal from the atmosphere, or ‘negative emissions’. These neg
defaultative emissions could be used to offset emissions from other harder to decarbonise 
defaultsectors. This view was strongly supported by the Committee on Climate Change’s 
defaultBioenergy
default Review (2012). 
default&#xa0;
defaultAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS tdefaultechnology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s CCS Roadmap estimated benefits of between £3-6.5 billion a year by the late 2020s to UK-based firms, sustaining between 70,000-100,000 jobs.
default 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA report by CO2Sense (October 2012) estimated that the development of a CCS cluster in Yorkshire &amp; Humberside could provide a major boost to the UK economy, delivering £1.3bn and 4,000 skilled-jobs.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe report stated that ‘Yorkshire and Humber is the be
defaultst strategic location in Europe to build a CCS cluster’ and that ‘putting this funding into the region will increase the area’s economic output by 0.8% per year, attract as much as £11billion in foreign investment and a further 11,000 jobs’.  The cluster w
defaultould also have the potential to make a sizeable reduction to the UK’s carbon emissions by transforming one of the UK's highest emitting regions.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Energy Technologies Institute has estimated that the deployment of CCS at scale could cut the UK’s cost o
defaultf meeting climate targets by around 1% of GDP, equivalent to £30–40 billion annually in 2050. (ETI, Mobilising Private Sector Financing report) 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEnhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHCR) could also deliver benefits to the UK in terms of energy security, balan
defaultce of payments, tax revenues, deferred decommissioning costs and increased employment as well as helping to move CCS down the cost reduction curve.
default&#xa0;defaultWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing lardefaultge-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has a number of key advantages which make it ideally suited for the deployment of CCS, including:  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe main barriers in the UK and internationally are economic and political. We agree with much of the analysis in the Governmen
defaultt’s CCS Roadmap and the 
defaultCCS Cost Reduction Taskforce report. The CCS Roadmap outlined three broad challenges: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce added some further detail in highlighting several key steps:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that the Commercialisation Programme and the Contracts-for-Difference under EMR should go a long way to addressing the financial and economic challenges for CCS on power generation. Delivery under those mechanisms will require a stable policy fr
defaultamework and a consistent political approach. 
default&#xa0;defaultIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that, with a sensible, co-operative approach to delivering the Commercialisation P
defaultrogramme and the reforms offered through the Electricity Market Review, the UK is well placed to make progress. There is no other country in Europe with such a comprehensive CCS offer: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe key test now is to translate that offer into successful projects on the ground. That will help to prove the techno
defaultlogy’s commercial credentials and help in keeping up the momentum on cost reduction. T
defaulthe CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce 
defaultreport explains how the 
defaultlevelised
default cost of CCS power generation could fall from around £160/
defaultMWh
default for projects with a final investment decisi
defaulton (FID) in 2013, to below £100/
defaultMWh
default for FID in 2028. Cost reduction is separated into three broad categories: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe broadly agree with these conclusions.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith 75% of cost reduction coming from lowering the cost of capital and delivering CO2 infrastructure, it is very clear why the current Commer
defaultcialisation 
defaultProgramme is so important. The Programme is central to convincing investors that cost and risk reductions can be delivered.  
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBeyond the first two projects, the Government should set out its approach to supporting further projects to become o
defaultperational in the early 2020s at the latest. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAt the national level, the Energy Technologies Institute has concluded that: 
default&#xa0;
default‘Without a national CCS infrastructure, the cost of reaching UK Climate Change targets will double from a minimum of around £30bn per year in 2050. This is the equivalent of an additional 2p per kWh on all UK energy use in 2050. Therefore the economic priz
defaulte of CCS to the UK is potentially considerable. Our calculations show that each five years of delay in implementing CCS until 2030 will add the equivalent of £4bn per annum to the total cost of the compliant UK energy system’.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2030 scenarios in DECC’
defaults Delivery Plan (July 2013) show that if CCS is not commercially available by then, the UK will need greater contributions primarily from nuclear and offshore wind. There has to be question marks over whether those technologies could deliver at the require
defaultd higher scale, at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer and provide enough generation flexibility.  
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Committee’s letter to the Secretary of State (30 November 2011) sums up the position very well:
default&#xa0;default‘…CCS is a vital technology for the low-carbon 
defaulttransition. There would be serious international and economic implications if we were not able to make this technology available. Without it, we may face an impossible trade-off between our environmental objectives and energy security.’
default&#xa0;
defaultBackground about defaultCapture Powerdefault&#xa0;
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe White Rose partners – 
defaultAlstom
default, 
defaultDrax
default and BOC – are planning to build a 426MW oxy-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration project. The project will comprise a state-of-the-art coal-fired power station that will be equippe
defaultd with full CCS technology. It will be built at the existing 
defaultDrax
default power station site, near Selby, North Yorkshire, and will capture around 90% of emissions. Around two million tonnes of CO
default2
default will be transported through the proposed National Grid pipeline fo
defaultr permanent undersea storage in the North Sea.
