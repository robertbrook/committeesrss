[normal]The White Rose CCS project is 
[normal]one of two preferred bidders in the UK Government’s CCS 
[normal]Commercialisation
[normal] 
[normal]Programme
[normal] and Europe’s only CCS project being considered for EU NER300 funding.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]Detail[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Global progress with CCS has been slow compared to estimates by national governments and inter-governmental bodies. Nevertheless, Bloomberg New 
[normal]Energy Finance data show that public and private organisations have channelled $26.8bn into CCS commercialisation since 2000. Government grants make up 54% of that total. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Global investment in projects has remained steady since 2009 at around $2.8bn a ye
[normal]ar (BNEF, 7 March 2013). That investment has produced seventeen medium- to-large CCS projects operating, or under construction, with another 55 at the planning stage (GCCSI).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK is one of the leading countries in terms of developing an effective CCS 
[normal]policy framework, despite slow progress with its attempts to fund demonstration projects (2006-11).  A new approach has emerged in the form of the CCS Commercialisation Programme and the Electricity Market Reform (EMR). This has the potential to match UK C
[normal]CS rhetoric and delivery on the ground.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DECC’s Commercialisation Programme has selected two projects – White Rose and Peterhead - to enter negotiations for Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies, with a view to making final investment decisio
[normal]ns in 2015.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]White Rose is a cost effective, realistic and deliverable project, which offers an excellent opportunity to establish the commercial future of the technology. The project is 
[normal]Europe’s only CCS project being considered for NER300 funding
[normal] (for f
[normal]urther details on the project see the attached slide pack.) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is essential that the momentum is maintained in the Commercialisation Programme, so that two projects can enter operation in the 2018-2020 timeframe
[normal]. 
[normal]As the Committee on Climate Change has said: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘It will be important that the Government continues to learn the lessons of the earlier failed CCS Competition, including the need for rapid progress and avoiding traditional procurement processes unsuited to
[normal] a complex first-of-a-kind project.’ 
[normal](CCC Carbon Budget Progress Report 2013.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We strongly agree with that view, in particular the need for Government to take a more innovative and collaborative approach, rather than relying on a traditional procurement 
[normal]model. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our answers to the Committee’s questions are as follows:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are currently three main technology options for capturing CO2: pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Two of the partners in the White Rose project - 
[normal]Alstom
[normal] and 
[normal]Linde
[normal] (BOC) – have already participated in a number of pilot projects:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alstom[bold]: projects using oxy-combustion, chilled ammonia, advanced amines or second-generation technologies. 
[normal]Five units
[normal] have completed tests in the USA &amp; Europe; while 
[normal]eight units are in operation or in commissioning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Linde[bold] (BOC):[bold] has built an advanced amines-based pilot plant and an oxy-combustion related pilot plant in Germany and is involved as part of a consortium de
[normal]veloping a potential pre-combustion plant in the USA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The pilot and validation plants have shown that the technology works. The next step is to establish the commercial credentials of the technology at large-scale with full CCS chain. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What [bold]contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Power generation accounts for approximately a third of the UK’s CO2 emissions, or 182 million tonnes of CO2 a year (DECC
[normal] 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Capturing and storing that carbon could reduce emissions from fossil fuel power stations by as much as 95%
[normal] (ETI, 2013). As the Prime Minister said in a recent Liaison Committee meeting: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘
[normal]decarbonisation targets only really make sense when you 
[normal]know what is going to be possible in terms of carbon capture and storage….
[normal] If not, you are in quite serious water, because you would be only relying on nuclear and renewable.’ 
[normal](Liaison Committee, 11 December 2012)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Analysis
[normal] 
[normal]by the Government and the Commi
[normal]ttee for Climate Change shows that up to 0.6 GW of CCS could be delivered in the UK by 2020; 5-10 GW by 2030 and up to 40 GW by 2050. The CCS Association has argued that 20–30 GW is possible by 2030. The exact number will depend in large part on the succes
[normal]s of the current Commercialisation Programme and whether the first two projects, including adequately sized initial CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, can be delivered on time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]With the expected growth of intermittent renewable generation (rising 
[normal]from 9% of electricity today to 32% by 2030) and the continued contribution of inflexible nuclear generation, it will be important for the UK to maximise the use of flexible, fossil fuel generation. CCS can be designed to enable that flexibility to be real
[normal]ised, whilst ensuring emissions are reduced effectively.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In the longer term, CCS combined with biomass is the only low carbon technology that could remove industrial quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere and permanently store it in deep geological for
[normal]mations. CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere during the natural growth process of biomass. Following combustion of the biomass the CO2 is captured and permanently stored providing a net carbon removal from the atmosphere, or ‘negative emissions’. These neg
[normal]ative emissions could be used to offset emissions from other harder to decarbonise 
[normal]sectors. This view was strongly supported by the Committee on Climate Change’s 
[normal]Bioenergy
[normal] Review (2012). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS t[bold]echnology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s CCS Roadmap estimated benefits of between £3-6.5 billion a year by the late 2020s to UK-based firms, sustaining between 70,000-100,000 jobs.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A report by CO2Sense (October 2012) estimated that the development of a CCS cluster in Yorkshire &amp; Humberside could provide a major boost to the UK economy, delivering £1.3bn and 4,000 skilled-jobs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The report stated that ‘Yorkshire and Humber is the be
[normal]st strategic location in Europe to build a CCS cluster’ and that ‘putting this funding into the region will increase the area’s economic output by 0.8% per year, attract as much as £11billion in foreign investment and a further 11,000 jobs’.  The cluster w
[normal]ould also have the potential to make a sizeable reduction to the UK’s carbon emissions by transforming one of the UK's highest emitting regions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Energy Technologies Institute has estimated that the deployment of CCS at scale could cut the UK’s cost o
[normal]f meeting climate targets by around 1% of GDP, equivalent to £30–40 billion annually in 2050. (ETI, Mobilising Private Sector Financing report) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHCR) could also deliver benefits to the UK in terms of energy security, balan
[normal]ce of payments, tax revenues, deferred decommissioning costs and increased employment as well as helping to move CCS down the cost reduction curve.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing lar[bold]ge-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK has a number of key advantages which make it ideally suited for the deployment of CCS, including:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The main barriers in the UK and internationally are economic and political. We agree with much of the analysis in the Governmen
[normal]t’s CCS Roadmap and the 
[normal]CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce report. The CCS Roadmap outlined three broad challenges: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce added some further detail in highlighting several key steps:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that the Commercialisation Programme and the Contracts-for-Difference under EMR should go a long way to addressing the financial and economic challenges for CCS on power generation. Delivery under those mechanisms will require a stable policy fr
[normal]amework and a consistent political approach. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that, with a sensible, co-operative approach to delivering the Commercialisation P
[normal]rogramme and the reforms offered through the Electricity Market Review, the UK is well placed to make progress. There is no other country in Europe with such a comprehensive CCS offer: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The key test now is to translate that offer into successful projects on the ground. That will help to prove the techno
[normal]logy’s commercial credentials and help in keeping up the momentum on cost reduction. T
[normal]he CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce 
[normal]report explains how the 
[normal]levelised
[normal] cost of CCS power generation could fall from around £160/
[normal]MWh
[normal] for projects with a final investment decisi
[normal]on (FID) in 2013, to below £100/
[normal]MWh
[normal] for FID in 2028. Cost reduction is separated into three broad categories: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We broadly agree with these conclusions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]With 75% of cost reduction coming from lowering the cost of capital and delivering CO2 infrastructure, it is very clear why the current Commer
[normal]cialisation 
[normal]Programme is so important. The Programme is central to convincing investors that cost and risk reductions can be delivered.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Beyond the first two projects, the Government should set out its approach to supporting further projects to become o
[normal]perational in the early 2020s at the latest. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]At the national level, the Energy Technologies Institute has concluded that: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘Without a national CCS infrastructure, the cost of reaching UK Climate Change targets will double from a minimum of around £30bn per year in 2050. This is the equivalent of an additional 2p per kWh on all UK energy use in 2050. Therefore the economic priz
[normal]e of CCS to the UK is potentially considerable. Our calculations show that each five years of delay in implementing CCS until 2030 will add the equivalent of £4bn per annum to the total cost of the compliant UK energy system’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 2030 scenarios in DECC’
[normal]s Delivery Plan (July 2013) show that if CCS is not commercially available by then, the UK will need greater contributions primarily from nuclear and offshore wind. There has to be question marks over whether those technologies could deliver at the require
[normal]d higher scale, at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer and provide enough generation flexibility.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Committee’s letter to the Secretary of State (30 November 2011) sums up the position very well:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘…CCS is a vital technology for the low-carbon 
[normal]transition. There would be serious international and economic implications if we were not able to make this technology available. Without it, we may face an impossible trade-off between our environmental objectives and energy security.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background about [bold]Capture Power[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The White Rose partners – 
[normal]Alstom
[normal], 
[normal]Drax
[normal] and BOC – are planning to build a 426MW oxy-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration project. The project will comprise a state-of-the-art coal-fired power station that will be equippe
[normal]d with full CCS technology. It will be built at the existing 
[normal]Drax
[normal] power station site, near Selby, North Yorkshire, and will capture around 90% of emissions. Around two million tonnes of CO
[normal]2
[normal] will be transported through the proposed National Grid pipeline fo
[normal]r permanent undersea storage in the North Sea.
