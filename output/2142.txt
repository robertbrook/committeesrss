[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;Arco is the UK’s leading health and safety equipment distributor. The company is steeped in occupational health and safety, providing expert advice and safety solutions through its regional sales offices, on-site centres and forty-two strong trade counter network to 110,000 customers across the UK and internationally. This presence is supported by its in-house training and consultancy division which also provides other services such as project support, site surveys and other specialist services. Arco is committed to the future of the business and its customers, and therefore invests heavily in product innovation, its supply chain, distribution network, the communities in which the company operates and its people. &#xa0;Arco is the expert in its field with 125 years’ experience in health and safety, and the business is driven by its purpose to keep people safe at work. Arco already has a number of connections with the Health and Safety Executive and knows its work well. The business is, for example, directly involved with the HSE’s Construction Dust Partnership Team (which works to raise awareness of hazardous dusts within the construction industry) and has in the past participated in Expert Groups on hearing and slips, trips and falls.&#xa0;Given Arco’s expertise in the health and safety industry, this submission will focus on the aspects of the draft Bill that focus on health and safety.
