defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;
defaultOur submission does not attempt to give a full response to the Inquiry theme, for the reasons here explained.
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn the long term the primary solution needs to be infrastructural, and the UK should be building towards that end as from now.  In that respect we fully support the submission by the
default Cycling Embassy of Great Britain
default and we therefore need not discuss infras
defaulttructure in this response.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt must be recognised however that this solution will take significant time and funding to become widespread on the ground across the nation.  Indeed, at present the Scottish Government invests a mere 1% of its transport budget 
defaultin cycling
default - a hopeless sum given their professed intent that 10% of all trips should be by bike by 2020 -
default and we suspect the figure at UK level is no better.  And whilst Britain could move much faster now in the light of European experience, nonetheless 
defaultthe 'Copenhagenizing' of Copenhagen took from the 1980s to the present.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, as the
default Promoting Walking and Cycling
default research report (also quoted in the Cycling Embassy response) states in its concluding chapter, “
defaultphysical infrastructure … is not 
defaulton its own sufficient.
default”   Wide cultural change is needed and, in particular, “
defaultit is necessary to change the image of cycling and walking
default” … “
defaultcampaigns to promote walking and cycling as normal … and not dominated by super-fit or committed specialists, shoul
defaultd also be adopted
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultRather than attempting a comprehensive response to the Inquiry, our response covers one particular aspect of safety relating to the above paragraph, and where we feel we have something distinctive to say about current approaches to cyc
defaultling safety.  We highlight some areas where research is inadequate - and one area in particular where we feel that many agencies supposedly promoting cycling and/or cycling safety suffer from head-in-the-sand syndrome, unwilling to take seriously evidence 
defaultwhich challenges their preconceptions. They may even inadvertently be causing unnecessary casualties.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, we urge the Inquiry to rely on evidence rather than on supposition, and to institute research where current knowledge is inadequate in terms of 
defaultproviding effective policy guidance.

defaultCycle usage, cycling safety and the image of cycling presented by official agenciesdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe facts needing to be explained …default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the last few years in the UK (and Scotland and Edinburgh) serious cycling casualties have 
defaultceased their long-standing downward pattern, and flattened out or started to rise
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn most cases,
default the rise in casualties is greater than any rise in cycle usedefault
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn most cases,
default the rise in casualties is greater than for other road user groupsdefault, including pedes
defaulttrians.  Indeed, whilst cycling casualty rates have started to rise, those for motor vehicle occupants have continued their long-standing downward trend.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is happening exactly over the same few years when cycling safety gear, notably helmets, is being 
defaultextensively promoted and is becoming widespread.  Thus either such safety gear is not in fact preventing many deaths and injuries or, if it is, then cycling danger is (very surprisingly) even more out of kilter with other safety trends than the bullet poin
defaultts above suggests.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese are vital issues which must be understood and tackled if cycling is to grow and to be as safe as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultConventional explanations for the new casualty patterns do not work – or, at best, provide only partial answers.  'More 
defaultcasualties because more cyclists' is clearly not the answer, given that casualties are rising faster than cycle use.  Traffic speeds and use of hands-free or hand-held phones are serious dangers, but do not explain cyclists being differentially affected in
default the casualty figures.  Inadequate infrastructure means higher overall casualties than necessary but does not explain the recent differential trend in cycling casualties.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not have the answers to these difficult questions, but we have ideas and there
default is some limited evidence.  In contrast, the agencies involved in promoting cycling safety seem willing only to pursue their traditional avenues, and not to countenance or investigate theories which do not fit existing views.   Reasoned emails on this topi
defaultc from Spokes to bodies such as British Cycling, Brake and Transport for London either have been ignored or have received anodyne responses which restate existing positions and do not engage with the arguments.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our view the questions and theories belowdefault need urgently to bedefault taken seriouslydefault - because some existing approaches to safety and/or promotion may be inadvertently discouraging cycle use and may even be increasing danger.default  The answers to these questions could havedefault significant implications for policy on cycling promotion and cycling safetydefault.  If adequate evidence is already available, policy and its application may need to change urgently.  If more evidence is needed, targeted research should be rapidly instigated todefault provide a guide for policy (and not as a delaying tactic).default&#xa0;defaultQ1. Is the composition of Britain's cycling population changing?default&#xa0;defaultIs there
default more cycling on faster roads or for faster journeys (for example, commuting) and less on quiet and side roads (for examp
defaultle, to the local shop)?  Is there more cycling by faster more confident people, usually males, and less by women or the elderly?  Given the
default massive
default crash risk differentials of different road types
default, the differing crash statistics for different age and sex 
defaultof cyclist, and the probable impact of differing cycling speeds,
default changes in the cycling population could very easily explain why injuries are increasing without cycle-use increasing
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecent Norwegian research
default suggests changes in the cycling population as
default a reason why widespread helmet use in a country may not reduce overall cyclist casualties, though some people are helped in some crashes.  The proportion of cyclists who cycle fast and fully equipped, for example commuting on faster roads, may rise; where
defaultas the traditional slower and unequipped use of bikes for local trips becomes rarer.  See also Q3 below.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ2. Tying in with the above, is the image of cycling in Britain changing –default and being changeddefault?default&#xa0;
defaultThe image of cycling portrayed by official messages an
defaultd agencies
default and often by the media is almost always that it is vital to dress up in safety gear to use a bike.  You can drive or walk to your local shop without dressing up, but to cycle there you need helmet and hi-viz.  Surely the message to the average 
defaultcitizen is that cycling is a dangerous way of getting around.  This could deter the more cautious person, or maybe the average person, even if in practice local conditions are very safe – and, indeed, everyday cycling is a safe activity
default - and often very s
defaultafe on local roads and for most types of cyclist [Q1].
default&#xa0;
defaultMeanwhile those people who do decide to cycle, if they follow the safety messages presented by official agencies, dressed up in safety gear to face the challenges of the road, may feel prepared to tac
defaultkle roads faster or busier than they would otherwise consider.  In a self-reinforcing negative circle the public sees more and more cyclists dressed in safety gear, so the image of cycling becomes one of special equipment and of danger.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is not to say
default that hi-viz should not be used in current conditions, especially in the dark and/or on fast commuter roads.  But it should certainly not be made to seem an essential requirement for everyday cycle trips, particularly on local roads and for trips such as d
defaultown to the local shops in broad daylight.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3. Do helmets (and perhaps safety gear in general) make crashes more likely?default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst helmets help in some crashes (primarily slow speed, such as falling off your bike), if they also make crashes more likely this 
defaultcould help explain why increasing helmet use has been paralleled by increasing injuries.
default&#xa0;
defaultMechanisms by which helmet-use might bring about higher crash and/or injury rates have been raised often, but inadequately researched and not taken seriously by cycli
defaultng agencies and those with an interest in selling or promoting helmets.   At best the potential cyclist is told that wearing a helmet is a 'choice' – but a choice in which there are only benefits
default to making the choice.   
defaultYet even for the cyclist who choose
defaults to be helmeted, an awareness of the potential risk factors would enable them to cycle more safely
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome mechanisms by which helmet-wearing might increase crashes and/or injuries are...
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMotorists may pass closer to cyclists who appear to be safe and 
defaultcompetent because helmeted
default.  Passing closer may in extreme cases mean a crash - resulting from a wing-mirror clip or a snagged rucksack strap or, perhaps more commonly, the cyclist being forced closer to potholes etc.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclists may, often unwittingly, take
default greater risks if they feel safer – for example choosing a faster road, or cycling faster.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are as many anecdotes supporting such theories as there are widely quoted anecdotes of the “a helmet saved my life” variety.  For example the cyclist who tol
defaultd us of a fast 'A' road, “
defaultI wouldn't use that road without my helmet
default” or the London taxi driver who said, “
defaultI make sure to give Boris cyclists a wide berth
default.”  In other words, the helmeted cyclist takes on greater risk, whereas the unhelmeted Boris hire-cycl
defaultist takes on less – anecdotes which tie in with the low injury rates reported for Boris cyclists as compared to all London cyclists.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPolicy implicationsdefault&#xa0;
defaultIf some or all of the above theories are valid, there are important implications for cycling policy
default, which would need promulgated through national and local government, the police, organisations such as British Cycling and  Cycling Scotland and charities such as Brake.   For example...
default&#xa0;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycling should be promoted as an everyday activity, like walking or
default jumping into a car, so that you can hop on your bike to go down to the shops without first donning special equipment.  The bulk of promotional material on official websites should show people cycling in their everyday clothing, as in Europe – rather than 
defaultdressed up in special cycling gear.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclists and potential cyclists should be made aware of the huge differences in safety of different road  types ('A' roads versus local roads, and rural versus urban roads). This is a far bigger contributor to safe cycli
defaultng and, conversely, to the likelihood of serious injury, than is what you are wearing – and yet official and media messages cover only the latter, suggesting you are safe anywhere if dressed up.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvice on helmets in official documents, handouts, bike shops
default, helmet boxes, etc should, for the safety of potential purchasers, be required to give equal prominence to the pros and cons of helmet use, so that potential users can make
default not a choice but an informed choice.
default  For example, to make people aware that whils
defaultt a helmet may help in a slow-speed fall, motor traffic may pass closer if you are helmeted, and that being helmeted does not mean you are safe to use a faster road than you otherwise would.

defaultHelmet promotion results in changing cycling population   www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847812000587
default Edinburgh Council's Road Safety Section, for example, and the local Police, who jointly promote cycling at community road-shows and festivals, will only print leaflets in which every cyclist is helmeted.  Interestingly, another section of the council, dea
defaultling with cycling infrastructure, and with cycle-use targets as a high priority, intentionally uses pictures which show unhelmeted or mixed helmet-use cycling.   Cycling Scotland, the government-funded body promoting cycling within Scotland, has a policy r
defaultecommending helmet choice – yet pictures on their website http://www.cyclingscotland.org/  are overwhelmingly of 'fully-equipped' cyclists.

defaultIn fact, a recent
