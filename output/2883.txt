[[[Introduction]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The English Community Care Association (ECCA) is the leading representative body for community care in England. Our members provide a wide range of services for adults with care and support needs including residential and nursing settings, homecare, housing and community-based support. Our members also deliver specialist care home services such as rehabilitation, respite, palliative care and mental health services.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome the opportunity to give written evidence to the HSC in advance of the forthcoming accountability hearing with CQC. We are very supportive of the changes being proposed by CQC in principle and the leadership being demonstrated by David Prior, David Behan and the team of senior staff at CQC. &#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However we would need to see far more detail with respect to social care and we look forward to seeing the consultation on proposals for new sets of standards in relation to social care. We are encouraged that CQC intend to oversee the changes to social care in co-production with the social care sector.&#xa0;

[[[New Methodology]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe it sensible for the Commission to regulate different services in ways that reflect the nature of the services, the settings in which they are delivered and the impact they have on the quality of care, rather than being bound by single inflexible regime. However, as we have said before, there are common issues that cut across services – safeguarding, for example – in which the Commission must act consistently, regardless of the setting in which the care is being delivered, or by whom.&#xa0;2.2               There is a proposal for acute hospitals to have a risk adjusted inspection frequency, eg an outstanding rating would warrant an inspection only every 3 to 5 years. Should the same proposal be put forward for care homes then we would want to see a proper consideration of the consequences and understand what safeguards will be put in place for an inspection taking place sooner, in the event of adverse feedback or other risk factors. In addition, it should be remembered, that it was the move to a less frequent inspection for high ratings under CSCI, which led councils as commissioners to institute their own more rigorous monitoring regimes.&#xa0;These have mushroomed to the extent that they represent a significant extra administrative burden on providers and can duplicate the efforts of the regulator – see below.&#xa0;2.3               We question the need for “fundamentals of care” to be detached from “expected standards” in the manner proposed. We are not confident that members of the public will be able to understand the qualitative difference that is intended to separate fundamentals from expected standards.&#xa0;2.4               Required improvements will be brought about not by re-categorising standards but by changing providers’ organisational cultures and ensuring that regulators have the expertise and experience relevant to their responsibilities.&#xa0;

[[[Measures of Success]]]

[[[              ]]]3.1               In addition to the current KPIs for registration, compliance and enforcement, some further indicators of success could be:&#xa0;

[[[Assessment of Council and CCG Commissioning]]]&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Adequate levels of public funding are critical to the delivery of quality care. Commissioning systems must be fit for purpose. We remain concerned about the tacit assumption that it is legitimate to keep asking more of providers – to continuously improve the quality of the care they provide – without factoring in the need for them to be provided with appropriate resources. CQC (under its original remit) and its predecessor body, CSCI, both had responsibility for assessing the quality of local authority commissioning of adult social care services. Since CQC was relieved of the responsibility for monitoring local authority commissioning, there has been no oversight of this area of council activity.&#xa0;4.2 We had hoped that the Care Bill would allow CQC, to review and assess the performance of the provision and commissioning of adult social services by English local authorities on a routine basis. Instead at Bill report stage (9th October 2013) it became clear that any hope of CQC carrying out routine monitoring of LA commissioning is dead in the water. The Minister described it thus:"There is a role for regulation. We are therefore proposing an amendment that will make it clear that the CQC may, with approval from both Secretaries of State of DH and DCLG, undertake a special review of local authority commissioning of adult social services in cases of systematic failure. Subsequent to any such review, CQC could issue an improvement notice in the event of a non-substantial failing and recommend special measures to the Secretary of State in the event of substantial failings. We also intend to issue statutory guidance specifically on local authority commissioning. This will be a valuable opportunity to influence local practice. In particular, we will include in this guidance clear examples of high-quality and poor-quality commissioning practices to support local authorities to develop and improve their own approach."&#xa0;There is much in the amended Bill about the LA's duty to have regard to people's wellbeing in their commissioning, but nothing about how they will be held accountable – apart from that above. However past guidance on commissioning such as ‘Building Capacity and Partnership in Care’ (DH October 2001) has not been followed by LAs, as the recent Judicial Reviews brought by independent care providers have demonstrated. This is not just about issues of zero-hours contracts and 15 minute visits. These practices are a symptom of more fundamental problems within council commissioning and for which councils are not being held accountable.4.3               We believe it worth noting the comments Robert Francis QC has made on NHS management:“… there’s been an increasing emphasis on management doing a systems business, which is balancing the books, following various policies and so on. And I think it’s quite easy in those pressured circumstances, particularly perhaps when resources are under challenge, to forget what the whole purpose of the system is, which is to help patients.” The mind-set described is equally prevalent among local authorities.&#xa0;

[[[Costs of regulation and CQC Fees charged to providers ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1               Obviously, the rising costs in CQC’s personnel budget, contingent upon the move to expert-led inspections and the introduction of a more rigorous inspection methodology will knock on to possible increases in regulatory fees for providers. ECCA is a member of the Fees Advisory Panel and appreciates the early discussions around possible changes to CQC regulatory fees in the future. We expect that the data and information on which CQC bases its decisions on fees will become more detailed and comprehensive and so allow providers a transparent understanding of why fees are at the level proposed.&#xa0;5.2               This brings us to the recent proposal that from April 2014 the fees for all providers be increased by 2.5%. We regret this decision for a number of reasons. Firstly, this was not discussed as an option by the CQC Fees Advisory Panel but was instead introduced at a very late stage prior to the release of the current consultation on 2014/15 fees.&#xa0;5.3               We support the direction of travel within CQC and are encouraged by the proposed modus operandi of co-production but the reality is that the CQC has still to deliver changes and for a sustainable amount of time. In other words we object to a fee increase when the improvements promised by CQC are still to be delivered consistently. This coupled with the further proposed changes in social care (which are still to be consulted on) means there will be a great deal of change over the coming year creating the potential for the basics to take a back seat. However providers are to be charged more for this time of change and possible upheaval.&#xa0;5.4               Finally the aim is we understand to see full cost recovery from the different regulated sectors. The fee increase is seen as a means of achieving this. The fact is however that fees to the social care sector already deliver 85% cost recovery while other sectors eg NHS has 75% and primary medical care services 50% yet the fee increase is to be general across the board.&#xa0;

[[[6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Duplication]]]6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We absolutely support the general aim of using better data and evidence in regulating services. We expect that providers will remain engaged by CQC as this develops and that feedback is regularly sought on how the new ways of working are impacting in practice. We would expect the ability of providers to be able to appeal and challenge how and what data has been used and for what purpose.6.2               The importance of seeing a greater confidence in evidence based inspection cannot be emphasised enough when we consider the number of local authorities who have developed their own ‘quasi’ inspection teams to monitor provider services. These council inspections duplicate the role of CQC. Such local initiatives are often justified by councils who feel they cannot ‘trust’ CQC to inspect services adequately. We would want to see evidence that the resulting additional cost and resource burden to the system (providers and commissioners) had been examined and was justified in terms of better outcomes for people receiving services in independent care settings.

[[[              ]]]6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would welcome an assurance that in the course of the “constructive relationships” that CQC means to build with local authorities and CCGs the Commission will make determined efforts to encourage these agencies to avoid the duplication referred to above. We must point out that such efforts to date have not been successful in this respect. In addition any system put in place around sharing of information should ensure that providers will know what information is being shared about them and the circumstances and framework for sharing.7.1&#xa0;&#xa0; CQC will take on new responsibilities which will impact on social care providers in terms of processes, resident outcomes and costs of care delivery namely:In addition to the methodology changes proposed these new responsibilities will need to be worked through with the sector in detail.7.2               One particular area for more thought within the new methodology and of course the star ratings is what “requiring improvement” really means is the service compliant but requires improvement or is it simply not compliant? It will be really important to make a clear distinction because there will be significant implications to a provider’s business where a service is rated as non-compliant and requiring improvement. The implications to the business of a service being rated as compliant but still requiring improvement should be nowhere near as severe.October 2013&#xa0;
