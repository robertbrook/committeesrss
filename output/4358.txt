[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              In this submission we argue that there is no evidence that sponsored academies have proved more effective than maintained schools in raising standards. Anecdotes about individual schools do not constitute evidence. We further argue that there is evidence to suggest that sponsored academies have not contributed to closing attainment gaps but that by making possible (as own admission authority schools) more socio-economic selection they are likely to make this situation worse. We agree with the recent statement by 

[[[Andreas Schleicher]]] that 

[[[“]]]

[[[The UK demonstrates that increasing school choice and competition does not improve standards”]]]&#xa0;1.2              We maintain that the process of academy conversion and the establishment of free schools has been characterised by a serious democratic deficit, by a substantial waste of public money and by entirely unproductive levels of conflict within local communities.&#xa0;1.3              We consider that the Secretary of State’s approach to intervention is wholly inadequate and demonstrates a failure to understand how the process of school improvement actually works. We consider that there is much more to be learned from the success of collaborative programmes such as the London and City Challenges.&#xa0;1.4              The Committee’s terms of reference assume the continuation and the further expansion of the academy programme. SEA argues that this is not a sustainable position and that a new settlement is required which addresses the confusion and fragmentation that now characterises the English school system.&#xa0;

[[[The impact of academ]]]

[[[ies on attainment]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1              There is now ample evidence which shows that there is no significant difference between the performance of sponsored academies and similar maintained schools – both in absolute terms and in their rate of improvement. Attempts to argue otherwise, including those by the DfE, are consistently flawed because they do not compare sponsored academies with similar schools. The work of Henry Stewart  demonstrates this very clearly. It has also been demonstrated that improvement in a significant number of sponsored academies has been achieved only through the use of non GCSE qualifications (e.g. by the recent NFER/LGA analysis of academy school performance)3.2               Recent research by Stephen Machin and Olmo Silva has demonstrated that academies have not contributed to “closing the gap”, arguing that “Schools that converted to academies between 2002 and 2007 improved their overall GCSEs results by further raising the attainments of students in the top half of the ability distribution, and in particular pupils in the top 20%. Conversely, we find little evidence that academies helped pupils in the bottom 10% and 20% of the ability distribution. Finally, we find little evidence that late converters (2008 and 2009) had any beneficial effects on pupils of any ability.”3.3              In SEA’s view, one important reason for the failure of the school system to close the gap between the lowest achievers and the rest has been the level of socio-economic segregation that persists in the English school system. There has never been a genuinely level playing field for schools in England. Subtle (or not so subtle) variations in governance, admissions policies, specialisms, religious affiliation etc. have helped to create a local pecking order of schools.  The advent of academies and free schools has made this situation worse. Too many schools manipulate their admissions to gain a more favoured intake to the advantage of “sharp-elbowed” parents who know how to work the system. The scale of this problem has just been confirmed by the research of Stephen Gorand at Durham University who concluded that:“any differentiated type of school - including faith-based, foundation, and fee-paying - tends to be linked to higher local levels of segregation. On the other hand, maintained, non-selective, 'bog-standard' schools are strongly and unambiguously linked to both lower segregation and a further decline in segregation of all types over time. If you want less segregation, do not have different types of school”.3.4              We know that a key issue for English schools is the tail of underachievement. In 2012 OECD identified a number of system level issues that contribute to this kind of underachievement. Of particular relevance here are the recommendations to “avoid early tracking (i.e selection, setting and streaming) and defer student selection to upper secondary” and to “manage school choice to avoid segregation and increased inequities”. Although in theory there is equal access to schools for all, in practice we are seeing more selection and social segregation in the English school system. In OECD’s view this will lead to lower levels of achievement in the system as a whole. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Establishing Academy and Free Schools]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              SEA argues that the process of establishing academies and free schools has been characterised by a very serious democratic deficit, by a substantial waste of public money and by entirely unproductive levels of conflict within local communities. 

[[[4]]]

[[[.2]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[The Democratic Deficit]]]Opportunities for local communities to have any meaningful say in how schools are planned and run have been substantially and unacceptably reduced. Decisions on opening, closing and changing the nature of schools are now taken largely by central government. It is sometimes forgotten that education is of concern to the whole of society and is not just a matter for those directly involved. The process is often secretive and is open to the charge of cronyism. It seems to be geared primarily to meeting political targets – i.e. the number of academy conversions and the number of free schools regardless of quality. It is very clear that some promoters/ sponsors of schools have been inadequate and driven by inappropriate ideological or commercial considerations.The proposals of particular interest groups (often a minority group) are often accepted regardless of their effect on others – as long as they are politically acceptable

[[[. ]]]The presumption is that market forces will decide which schools succeed and which do not. 

[[[However it is not possible to run an education system as a market ]]]without having a damaging impact on some schools and pupils. This is why school systems need to be planned through a democratic process in which all views can be heard.There is also a growing democratic deficit within schools. In many academy chains, schools are subject to the central management of the chain in ways that would be entirely unacceptable in local authority schools. They are not always permitted to have their own governing body and consequently the role of parents and local communities in governance is significantly diminished. This downgrading of the place of parent governors can be found in other academies and free schools.

[[[Waste]]]The most obvious example of wasting resources is the opening of free schools where there is already a surplus of places. At a time when there is a growing shortage of primary places in parts of the country, this is inexcusable.The Public Accounts Committee has clearly documented the waste of public money by the Academies programme amounting to about £1 billion. A significant part of this was in effect bribes to schools to convert. It also arose from the creation of duplicate management systems – for example much of the funding work of the EFA could be done by local authorities at little extra cost. There have also been notorious examples of inappropriate extravagance by some academy chains and indeed by some individual schools where there is no longer any real oversight in place.&#xa0;

[[[Conflict]]]Arguments over school status have distracted schools, parents and teachers in many areas from their core business. Relationships have been damaged and time and energy has been wasted in unproductive arguments, leading in some cases to industrial action. At times it can feel that such conflict is welcomed by government because it enables it to denigrate those who disagree – the “enemies of progress” argument. The deliberate provoking of conflict across the country seems however an inappropriate way for a government to carry on.&#xa0;

[[[5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Intervention by the Secretary of State]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The secretary of state is now directly responsible for the performance of about three thousand academies and free schools across the country. This includes responsibility for not just their academic performance but their financial probity, a range of issues relating to individual pupils and families and their adherence to a wide range of regulations. 5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All this is widely accepted as unsustainable in both practical terms and in terms of the unacceptable centralisation of power in a single person’s hands. It means that there is no way for the voice of parents and local communities to be heard – as can be seen in the way opposition to forced academisation and to particular sponsors has been consistently ignored5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is now the situation that many schools are effectively accountable to no one but themselves. They are formally accountable to the Secretary of State but it is clear that the DfE does not have the capacity to identify issues at an early stage – this takes local knowledge drawn not just from data but from regular contact with local communities and agencies. Nor is it in a position to provide what David Wolfe QC describes as “a more subtle and supportive regime of external intervention to encourage school improvement.” Ofsted and the DfE can only offer intervention of a very crude and high level kind as has been demonstrated by the recent issue of warning notices to failing academies. These show no capacity to engage with schools at any detailed level nor any desire to understand their issues in detail. DfE intervention seems to be confined to a threat to enforce a change of governance and/ or sponsor.  5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent proposals by the Secretary of State to establish 8 regional commissioners to be responsible for monitoring academies and free schools will be in no way adequate. With an average of 400 schools each (a figure that is presumably expected to rise they will be no more effective than the DfE is now. It seems remarkable, at this time of financial stringency, to establish a whole parallel bureaucracy working only with some schools.5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On the ground, the provision of support for school improvement has been seriously undermined in recent years. Partly this has been a result of cuts in funding. But it has also been based on a belief that schools can and should manage their own improvement, if necessary in collaboration with other schools. 5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no doubt that teachers can and do learn a lot from one another. But it is not realistic to expect schools to keep up with both all current research and debate and with best practice across the country. There is therefore a need for people and institutions that are in a position to take a broad view based on research and experience of a wide range of schools. This could traditionally be found in local authority services and in higher education. Both of these are now under sustained attack.

[[[5.7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also clear that school to school initiatives are patchy. The RSA Academies Commission found that many outstanding schools are not making the contribution to school improvement that is expected of them. The distribution of teaching schools is also patchy with no certainty that a school in need of support can access it.

[[[6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Middle Tier]]]6.1              We would argue that managing the establishment and monitoring of all schools requires a democratically accountable local tier of governance. This needs to be responsible not for running schools but for the key functions of planning, commissioning and monitoring. None of these are now being done effectively by central government. Privatising these functions to unaccountable chains and sponsors has been shown to be inimical to the concept of public service and open to abuse. The purpose of this middle tier should be to take functions away from Whitehall and exercise them at a local level and not to reduce levels of school autonomy that have been in place now for many years.6.2               The key purpose of a democratically accountable middle tier is to provide broad educational leadership across an area. It should champion the interests of children and families and should ensure that the vested interests of schools do not obstruct the delivery of an educational entitlement for all children and young people. It should:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; identify and plan to meet changing demand for school places -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ensure that their areas have the range of schools that will meet the needs and aspirations of all local people.  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; commission post 16 provision across both school and college sectors working with and through school/college partnerships . -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ensure that a common admissions system provides fair access for all.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; monitor the performance of schools including academic performance, financial systems and adherence to national standards including equalities duties.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; with schools, establish and implement a fair funding formula covering all state funded schools in their area.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; intervene where there is clear evidence of inadequate performance including requiring changes in the governance and leadership of schools if other interventions have been unsuccessful.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; promote school improvement in collaboration with School Partnerships.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; identify pupils with additional needs and ensure that these are met by schools. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; provide for all pupils independent specialist careers advice and guidance. 6.3              Academy chains cannot themselves be a middle tier authority. They cover only a minority of schools, range from just a couple of schools to well over 50, have no geographical unity and are wholly unaccountable to either parents or voters. We would argue that 

[[[all schools should be]]]

[[[ independent legal entities]]]

[[[ (]]]

[[[which is not the case for sponsored academies]]]

[[[)]]] and that all schools should be free to identify external support from any appropriate source. An academy chain could then be one of these options. But we doubt that chains working with only a very small number of schools actually have much to offer.

[[[7]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Alternatives to Sponsored Academy Status]]]7.1              As at present 44% of secondary and 46% of primary sponsored academies are either inadequate or require improvement, it is difficult to maintain the view that sponsored academy status is a uniquely effective route to improvement. There have clearly been successful sponsored academies but to argue purely by anecdote is not enough.7.2              SEA would argue that the most effective path to school improvement is through the support of successful local schools that are facing similar challenges. We would also argue that the engagement of an experienced adviser with both the time and the ability to work with the school in depth can make an important contribution. This is the message of the London and City Challenges which had a huge effect on standards in important parts of the country. It was also the message of the Select Committee’s recent report on school partnerships. We suggest that there is much in that report which is relevant to this inquiry as well.7.3.              There are also examples of tighter school partnerships and federations which have been effective in raising standards. We are not opposed to external partners making a contribution to school improvement either with individual schools or with partnerships.  But we do not think that schools and their local communities are best served by being required to adopt the status of sponsored academy, with the loss of democracy and autonomy that this involves.

[[[8]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Fragmentation ]]]8.1              We would also ask the select committee to consider how the English school system is being fragmented in a number of damaging ways. A significant proportion of schools are now governed by funding agreements with the secretary of state. The exact arrangements vary and are “based on the particular circumstances and political climate at the time and the reasons for the school’s creation”. The consequence is that anyone seeking to raise an issue with a school (e.g.  admission appeals, SEN places, exclusions etc.) needs to identify exactly what provisions apply to the school in question. It has become more difficult for parents and children to get issues addressed locally. They may have to go to the Secretary of State for a decision.8.2              In addition local collaborative arrangements between schools are breaking down in many    areas. In practice this means that arrangements for the placement and support for disadvantaged and at risk pupils are no longer working properly. It also means that local planning designed to secure a broad 14 to 19 offer across an area is being undermined.
