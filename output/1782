default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the opportunity to submit views to the Transport Select Committee on this matter.
default&#xa0;
default Our association is an independent voluntary body for train and bus users in eastern Suffolk.
default&#xa0;
default Apart from Ipswich in the south and Lowestoft in the north, this are
defaulta has no large towns; but is characterised by market towns, small resorts and villages and some parts of it are lightly populated. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe therefore have many years of experience of dealing with the needs of people in isolated communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe coastal area
defaults have attracted retired people who cane become increasingly dependent on public transport. People of working age in the countryside often have to travel further to find work than in the days when most of them worked in agriculture. Young people also have 
defaultto travel further to school, college or training courses.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is therefore vital to have good reliable train and bus services into the main centres of population; and, where appropriate, integration between train and bus or other road-based transport.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthis sometimes requires modest investment.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThanks to investment in resignalling the Ipswich - Lowestoft rail line and provision of a new passing loop at Beccles, an hourly train frequency is now provided on weekdays (2-hourly on Sundays)
default&#xa0;
default and this has att
defaultracted additional passengers.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBuses now connect with trains at Halesworth, providing improved transport to and from Southwold and the Blyth Valley. There is scope for similar integrated for bus services to Leiston, Aldeburgh and possibly Framlingham.
default&#xa0;
default I
defaultt must be accepted that some bus services may require a modest subsidy and County Councils must be adequately resourced for this.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a role for Community Transport and an efficient service operates in the Halesworth area - significantly it is based
default at the railway station.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main problems facing
default&#xa0;
defaultintegrated transport are that tenders for sponsored bus services are only effective for a year at a time; and from April to March, which is out of kilter with train operators whose timetables change in D
defaultecember and sometimes in May.
default&#xa0;
default Some harmonisation is needed here.
default&#xa0;
defaultPeople are also more likely to change for cars to public transport if they can rely on the services
default&#xa0;
default - especially bus services - being
default&#xa0;
defaultguarenteed for more than 12 months.
default&#xa0;
defaultDemand Responsi
defaultve Transport exists in several areas between Woodbridge and Beccles. It has a role to play - perhaps best as supplementing
default&#xa0;
default or feeding into rather than replacing scheduled services
default&#xa0;
default For example, at busy times a timetabled bus should run; off-peak DRT may b
defaulte the best solution.
default&#xa0;
default We believe that the Department for Transport should commission a study into the experience so far of DRT - has it fully answered the needs of those iusolated communities which it serves; what proportion of demands from would-be travel
defaultlers have actually been fulfilled; has it contributed to modal shift away from the motor car?
default&#xa0;
defaultFor some journeys there is little alternative to the car - and that applies sometimes for access from isolated rural communities to the nearest rail station. Al
defaultmost all stations on the Ipswich - Lowestoft line have well-used car parks. Such facilities must be encouraged.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll stations between Ipswich and Lowestoft have been unstaffed for many years. It is important that uses are found for redundant station build
defaultings, and both central and local government can use their influence to ensure that this happens.
