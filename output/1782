[normal]Written evidence from East Suffolk Travellers Association (TIC 08
[normal]6
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome the opportunity to submit views to the Transport Select Committee on this matter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Our association is an independent voluntary body for train and bus users in eastern Suffolk.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Apart from Ipswich in the south and Lowestoft in the north, this are
[normal]a has no large towns; but is characterised by market towns, small resorts and villages and some parts of it are lightly populated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We therefore have many years of experience of dealing with the needs of people in isolated communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The coastal area
[normal]s have attracted retired people who cane become increasingly dependent on public transport. People of working age in the countryside often have to travel further to find work than in the days when most of them worked in agriculture. Young people also have 
[normal]to travel further to school, college or training courses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is therefore vital to have good reliable train and bus services into the main centres of population; and, where appropriate, integration between train and bus or other road-based transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]his sometimes requires modest investment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thanks to investment in resignalling the Ipswich - Lowestoft rail line and provision of a new passing loop at Beccles, an hourly train frequency is now provided on weekdays (2-hourly on Sundays)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] and this has att
[normal]racted additional passengers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Buses now connect with trains at Halesworth, providing improved transport to and from Southwold and the Blyth Valley. There is scope for similar integrated for bus services to Leiston, Aldeburgh and possibly Framlingham.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I
[normal]t must be accepted that some bus services may require a modest subsidy and County Councils must be adequately resourced for this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a role for Community Transport and an efficient service operates in the Halesworth area - significantly it is based
[normal] at the railway station.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The main problems facing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]integrated transport are that tenders for sponsored bus services are only effective for a year at a time; and from April to March, which is out of kilter with train operators whose timetables change in D
[normal]ecember and sometimes in May.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Some harmonisation is needed here.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]People are also more likely to change for cars to public transport if they can rely on the services
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] - especially bus services - being
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]guarenteed for more than 12 months.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Demand Responsi
[normal]ve Transport exists in several areas between Woodbridge and Beccles. It has a role to play - perhaps best as supplementing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] or feeding into rather than replacing scheduled services
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For example, at busy times a timetabled bus should run; off-peak DRT may b
[normal]e the best solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We believe that the Department for Transport should commission a study into the experience so far of DRT - has it fully answered the needs of those iusolated communities which it serves; what proportion of demands from would-be travel
[normal]lers have actually been fulfilled; has it contributed to modal shift away from the motor car?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For some journeys there is little alternative to the car - and that applies sometimes for access from isolated rural communities to the nearest rail station. Al
[normal]most all stations on the Ipswich - Lowestoft line have well-used car parks. Such facilities must be encouraged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All stations between Ipswich and Lowestoft have been unstaffed for many years. It is important that uses are found for redundant station build
[normal]ings, and both central and local government can use their influence to ensure that this happens.
