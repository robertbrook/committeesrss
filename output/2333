[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]A
[normal]ll these cases
[normal] of 
[normal]malpractice relied on secrecy o
[normal]ver company ownership 
[normal]and lax regulation
[normal], in both the UK and in its Crown Dependencies and Over
[normal]eas Territories
[normal]. This has made the UK an accessory to international crime and
[normal], 
[normal]by allowing the looting of some of the world’s poorest countries, 
[normal]has undermined the effectiveness of UK aid.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The case for change is clear. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Policy recommendations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]The British Prime Minister has called for public registries of the “beneficial owners” – that is, the people who ultimately own companies – as a means of combating tax evasion and fraud. In a letter from April of this year, 
[normal]Mr Cameron
[normal] calle
[normal]d
[normal] for the “
[normal]avail
[normal]ability of beneficial ownership information through central public company registries
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]The Department for Business Innovation and Skills 
[normal]has been 
[normal]holding a public consultation on this matter, examining whether 
[normal]a UK
[normal] registry should be public or not. Global Witness is firmly of the opinion that 
[normal]a public register would provide the surest safeguard against corruption.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal]An open registry would be cheap, would allow companies to know who they are doing business with 
[normal](a
[normal]nd thus reduce due diligence costs) 
[normal]and would enable citizens to hold companies to account.
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. 
[normal]Global Witness believes that 
[normal]the UK should also ensure publish registers are adopted in its
[normal] Overseas Territories (OTs) and Crown Dependencies (CDs).[bold] The UK h
[normal]as the right to impose this decision on the OTs and CDs.
[normal] A number of these territories are jurisdictions of choice for criminals setting up anonymous companies to hide their identity. While in many cases, trust and company service providers (TCSPs) are required to collect beneficial ownership information on com
[normal]panies incorporated in the OTs and CDs, the accuracy and completeness of this information is often doubtful. The 
[normal]“
[normal]offshore leaks
[normal]”
[normal] work carried out by the International Centre for Investigative Journalism has shown that in some cases TCSPs in the OTs and CD
[normal]s simply have not collected beneficial ownership information.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]I
[normal]n the final declaration
[normal] at Loch Erne
[normal], G8 members pledged to publish national Action Plans which would, among other matters, require companies “to obtain and hold information on their be
[normal]neficial owner
[normal]s
[normal]hip, and to ensure that this information is available in a timely fashion to law enforcement, tax collection agencies and other relevant authorities as appropriate …for example, through central registries”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]Section 1504 of the 
[normal]US
[normal] Dodd-F
[normal]rank 
[normal]Act 
[normal]and the EU Accounting 
[normal]and Transparency 
[normal]Directive
[normal]s
[normal] require American and 
[normal]European 
[normal]extractive companies to report on payments to governments on a project-by-project basis without exemptions. 
[normal]The UK Government should fulfil the Prime Minister’s commit[bold]ment for “swift implementation” of the [bold]D[bold]irective[bold]s[bold] made at the G8 [bold]summit[bold] by committing to a date during 2014 for transposition into UK law[bold], such that companies commence their discl[bold]o[bold]sures no later than fiscal year 2015[bold].[bold] [bold]Prompt
[normal] 
[normal]transposition 
[normal]of the Directive
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] improve the UK as a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. [bold]UK [bold]companies including [bold]Shell and BP should dissociate themselves from the A[bold]merican [bold]P[bold]etroleum [bold]I[bold]nstitute[bold] lawsuit against the [bold]US Securities and Exchange Commiss[bold]ion’s [bold]implementing [bold]rule for Dodd-Frank Section 1504, which, along with[bold] the[bold] EU Directives, form the basis for a global standard [bold]for [bold]revenue disclosure.  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]13. [bold]Shell should equally desist from lobbying actively to delay and/or weaken UK[bold] and EU implementation of the Accounting and Transparency Directives. The UK Government should make it clear to extractive companies that a global mandatory transparency standard, without reporting exemptions, is here to stay and that it will not consider [bold]company special pleading. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]14. [bold]As partners with[bold] [bold]c[bold]ivil [bold]s[bold]ociety and [bold]c[bold]ompanies in the EITI process[bold],[bold] the UK Government should advocate for UK EITI reports to meet high standards by including a publicly available register of the beneficial owners of companies [bold]involved and public disclosure of extractive contracts and licences. During 2015 the Government should publish its first EITI report.  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]15. [bold]The UK Government should use its position on the International Board of the EITI to strongly support the move to ma[bold]ke beneficial ownership and contract transparency EITI requirements (rather than just encouragements) by 2016. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Other
[normal] policy recommendations
[normal] linked to specific cases
[normal] are included in the 
[normal]section
[normal] below

[normal] and are, as above, picked out in bold.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case studies[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]ENRC[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Russian Trading Structure
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. 
[normal]ENRC is a company with Kazakh origins 
[normal]that 
[normal]is largely controlled by its trio of founding shareholders: Patokh Chodiev, Alijan Ibragimov and Alexander Mashkevitch.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17. 
[normal]Global Witness has investigated
[normal] corruption concerns around the company’s business in the DRC and has also reviewed audits which, among other matters, show how the trio siphoned money out of its Kazakh factories. The evidence not only demonstrates the importance of the UK
[normal] authorities pur
[normal]suing their current
[normal] investigations into ENRC to their conclusion but also raises serious regulatory questions for the Stock Exchange authorities – including 
[normal]why
[normal] ENRC 
[normal]was allowed 
[normal]to list in the first place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. 
[normal]To comply with the word limit here, we focus
[normal] on the most damning of these audits. We would be glad to offer supplementary material, oral or written
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal] 
[normal]A September 2007 audit by the law firm Herbert Smith explains how the trio skimmed most of the profits from mineral sales to Russia in the years p
[normal]receding ENRC’s London listing in December 2007. The audit examined how, from 2004 to 2006, four factories in Kazakhstan sold $870 million of coal, iron ore and other minerals to Russia through layers of anonymously owned intermediary companies, collective
[normal]ly referred to
[normal] in the audit
[normal] as the Russian Trading Structure (RTS). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal] 
[normal]The factories concerned – majority-owned by the trio – were incorporated as separate entities from 2004 but were grouped under the ENRC umbrella in December 2006. Seventy per cent of
[normal] all profits went personally to the three founder shareholders in cash, the 
[normal]audit
[normal] said.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal] 
[normal]The RTS was “based on entirely illegitimate objectives”, wrote Pieter Hamelink, a Dutch tax lawyer who headed ENRC’s Audit Committee, in a 6 April 2006 e-mail cite
[normal]d by the auditors. 
[normal]The audit said that 
[normal]ENRC’s smaller shareholders could have been “prejudiced by the transfer of profits away from the plants”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal] 
[normal]“The plants received, via bank transfer, a payment for their products,” said the audit. “This did not represent the total amount of payment as the RTS would also pay a cash element in respect of each transaction… for the benefit of Messers Chodiev, Ibragim
[normal]ov and Machkevitch.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal] 
[normal]Patokh Chodiev’s nephew, Olim, was the trio’s “treasur
[normal]er” tasked with collecting the
[normal] cash, 
[normal]according to the audit
[normal]: “Olim Chodiev told us that he did not see any documentation in relation to the RTS arrangement and would simply co
[normal]llect the money.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24. 
[normal]While two senior officials told Herbert Smith that the RTS structure was independent of the trio, the 
[normal]audit
[normal] provides substantial evidence that this was untrue. For example, one key firm in the RTS, Ugolenergoimpex, was “ultimately, b
[normal]eneficially owned by the Majority Shareholders [the trio]”, according to the head of the Moscow branch of ENRC Marketing, Anatoliy Tulyakov. Mr Tulyakov was a director of Ugolenergoimpex and was thus in a position to know about its ownership.  Evidence in 
[normal]the audit from 
[normal]Mr Hamelink
[normal] and from ENRC’s Swiss tax advisers also indicate that the trio beneficially owned companies in the RTS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal] 
[normal]As well as skimming
[normal] profits, RTS companies also took 
[normal]extra commission
[normal]s
[normal]. If the
[normal] trio
[normal] were the beneficial owners of the RTS companies, the
[normal]ir
[normal] cut of the profits may have been above 70%.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26. 
[normal]From reading the 
[normal]audit
[normal], it 
[normal]appears to Global Witness that
[normal] th
[normal]e RTS
[normal] arrangement could have been fraudulent, with the trio siphoning off profits from ENR
[normal]C in cash through anonymously owned companies 
[normal]to
[normal] the expense of ENRC’s other shareholders.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal] 
[normal]Much potential evidence has vanished. Key ENRC officials in Moscow had “not provided us with an honest account” when questioned about deleting data about the R
[normal]TS, while other officials refused to answer questions, Herbert Smith wrote. Prior to the Herbert Smith analysis, PwC was sent falsified information as 
[normal]it
[normal] sought to audit company revenues. During a later investigation, the UK law firm Dechert wrote in a let
[normal]ter to ENRC of 12 April 2013 that a false office was even created in Kazakhstan. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal] 
[normal]It was not until the end of 2006 that the RTS system was closed down. In 2006, sales from ENRC’s Kazakhstan plants to Russia involved UK-registered Tekmark Consulting Lt
[normal]d 
[normal], which the auditors “
[normal]understand is a company put forward by the RTS”. Tekmark signed “commission agreements” with ENRC subsidiaries, formally giving it a role in selling metal to Russia.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal] 
[normal]The agreements with Tekmark appear to have made no fundamental difference to the RTS structure, with Herbert Smith saying “we understand that during 2006 the Majority Shareholders continued to receive the cash from the RTS in Moscow”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal] 
[normal]Tekmark
[normal] appears 
[normal]to been have no more than a shell: “Given that Tekmark is recorded as being a dormant company at the time when the services are being provided with assets of £300 it seems unlikely, in practice, to have provided any services whatsoever,” the audit said. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal] 
[normal]The people who own Tekmark are unknown, as documents filed at UK Companies House show its sole shareholder as a being another anonymously-owned company: Vestro Development, registered in Gibraltar.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal] 
[normal]Despite the extremely serious findings of the aud
[normal]it, ENRC 
[normal]was able to
[normal] go ahead and list o
[normal]n the London Stock Exchange less than three months
[normal] after it was submitted. Membership of the FTSE100 ensured that UK pensioners would automatically buy its stock through tracker funds. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal] 
[normal]ENRC’s
[normal] Initial Public Off
[normal]ering (IPO) prospectus declared the RTS as a “risk factor” and recognised that it paid out $111 million to the trio. Yet the details the IPO provided of the RTS are contradicted by Herbert Smith. ENRC professed general ignorance about 
[normal]how the RTS was struc
[normal]tured and about 
[normal]the “agency” organising
[normal] it (ENRC said it believes th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]agency
[normal]…
[normal]was neither owned or legally controlled by the Group or its shareholders
[normal]”)
[normal]. However, the audit cites Johannes Sittard, then the CEO of ENRC, saying that every three to six month
[normal]s “there would be a special presentation made… concerning money which had been earned by the Majority Shareholders from RTS sales. This presentation would be restricted to the Majority Shareholders and Dr Sittard… During these presentations Ilmir Masgutov 
[normal][a consultant to the factories] would hand out documentation which set out the results of the RTS trading.”  The audit shows that several officials working for the trio and its companies had a detailed knowledge of the RTS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34. 
[normal]Global Witness has put deta
[normal]iled questions to ENRC about the Russian Trading Structure but
[normal] the response simply 
[normal]referr
[normal]ed
[normal] us back to a general statement of corporate principles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b) The 
[normal]DRC
[normal] acquisitions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35. 
[normal]In 2009 ENRC began buying mining assets in the DRC from Dan Gertler, a friend 
[normal]of President Joseph Kabila
[normal]. Mr Gertler
[normal] 
[normal]had 
[normal]secretly bought the assets at steeply undervalued prices and quickly sold them on for huge profits – in one case “flipping” a mine to ENRC for five times the original value paid. In the process ENRC paid hundreds 
[normal]of millions of dollars to companies registered anonymously in the British Virgin Islands. The resulting scandal has contributed to a rapid descent in its share price.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]36. 
[normal]Global Witness has published several reports on the “secret sales scandal” since May
[normal] 2012, and a May 2013 report by the Africa Progress Panel gives further valuable analysis.
[normal] Representatives of Glencore and of Mr Gertle
[normal]r
[normal] have repeatedly denied there was any
[normal] corruption in their Congolese deals
[normal], with Mr Gertler’s spokesmen challenging the 
[normal]valuation data used 
[normal]by 
[normal]us 
[normal]and the Africa Progress Panel
[normal]. 
[normal]ENRC has issued a general statement, saying that 
[normal]it “
[normal]has a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37. 
[normal]The SFO began “discussions” with ENRC over corruption allegations in the DRC and Kaza
[normal]khstan by December 2011. Yet ENRC was allowed to “self-report” to the SFO for
[normal] the next
[normal] 16 months before the agency finally opened a criminal investigation
[normal] in April 2013
[normal]. 
[normal]David Green, who 
[normal]took over as 
[normal]as Director of the SFO in April 2012, sa
[normal]ying
[normal] that he was against “cosy deals”
[normal] and favoured a tougher approach
[normal] than his predecessor
[normal]; the announcement of the crim
[normal]inal investigation 
[normal]suggests he may have been
[normal] living up to his promises.
[normal] 
[normal]However, Global Witness encourages the Select Committee to examine w[bold]hy the SFO took so long to launch a formal investigation[bold], and whether the self-reporting has been effective.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]38. 
[normal]Meanwhile, t
[normal]he Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) was alerted to corruption
[normal] risks
[normal] when ENRC filed 
[normal]at least two 
[normal]Suspicious Activity Report
[normal]s 
[normal]through its lawyers H
[normal]erbert Smith in 2010
[normal], relating to a major mining deal in the DRC
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39. 
[normal]Global Witness
[normal] has seen a leaked copy of the 
[normal]second 
[normal]of these reports, 
[normal]from
[normal] August 2010.
[normal] In it, 
[normal]ENRC 
[normal]request
[normal]s
[normal] permission to seal a $175 million deal with a British
[normal] Virgin Islands company
[normal] associated with Mr Gertler
[normal] – just eight days before the deal was due to be formally announced. The report noted a risk that the mine concessions that ENRC was to buy from the BVI-registered Highwind Group “may have been obtained by 
[normal]corruption”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]40. 
[normal]Global Witness believes ENRC misled Soca about when it became aware of the corruption risks and what it knew about the ownership of the assets. 
[normal]We encourage the Select Committee to examine this [bold]Suspicious Activity R[bold]eport and Soca’s response as a means of gaining insight into how the extractives industry is policed in the UK.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]41. [bold]We also encourage the Select Committee to examine what UK regulatory authorities knew and should have known about corruption[bold] concer[bold]ns surro[bold]unding ENRC – including those detailed in the Herbert Smith audit – as the company sought permission to list.[bold] The case of ENRC helps illustrate why the the London Stock Exchange and relevant authorities should be obliged to perform more stringent due dili[bold]gence before allowing companies to list.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]42. 
[normal]The trio is now seeking to delist the company by buying out minority shareholders and
[normal] it is reported that there are plans to 
[normal]reregister the company in Kazakhstan. This could pose a serious threat to the complet
[normal]ion of the SFO’s criminal inquiry, a matter of deep public interest. 
[normal]UK authorities should block the delisting or, should this prove impossible, prevent associated transactions and the re-registration of the company outside the UK until the inquiry is comp[bold]lete.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Shell and E[bold]ni[bold]: the case of OPL245[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]a) Payments to a convicted money launderer for an oil block
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43. 
[normal]For over a year now
[normal] Global Witness 
[normal]has been 
[normal]piec
[normal]ing 
[normal]together detailed court documents and other evidence that expose how 
[normal]Shell and Italian oil giant
[normal] Eni agreed to pay US$1.092
[normal] billion for one of Nigeria’s most potentially lucrative oil blocks, OPL245. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]44. 
[normal]The payment was made by Shell and Eni
[normal] to the Nigerian government, which
[normal] had a separate agreement to pay the same amount to Malabu Oil and Gas, a 
[normal]N
[normal]igerian 
[normal]company widely believed at the time to be controlled by convicted money-launderer and former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45. 
[normal]In July 2013, a British High Court court ruled that Etete was indeed the owner of Malabu. As Etete had awarded the oi
[normal]l block to Malabu whilst 
[normal]petroleum
[normal] minister during the regime of the corrupt dictator General Abacha, he had effectively given himself one of the most lucrative oil blocks in Nigeria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]46. 
[normal]Shell and Eni deny paying any money to Malabu. However, High Court 
[normal]proceedings and other evidence seen by Global Witness reveal that in reality Shell and Eni were aware an
[normal]d in agreement that the deal would
[normal] benefit Malabu, and had even met with 
[normal]Etete face-to-face on several occasions. In fact, testimony heard during the ca
[normal]se indicates that an official from Shell previously negotiated directly with Etete over “iced champagne” and that Eni officials had enjoyed a luxurious dinner at a 5-
[normal]s
[normal]tar 
[normal]h
[normal]otel in Milan with Etete.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]47. 
[normal]Global Witness believes that the deal was structure
[normal]d 
[normal]through the Nigerian government
[normal] primarily to allo
[normal]w Shell and Eni to claim that they
[normal] had not struck a deal with Etete or Malabu. Yet in making these payments, Shell and Eni had effectively bought the block from Etete for over a billion dollars, there
[normal]by
[normal] “m
[normal]onetising” an asset that was originally acquired by Malabu
[normal] in highly suspicious and proba
[normal]bly illegal circumstances.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]48. 
[normal]Documents seen by Global Witness also indicate that the deal resulted in over $801 million of the m
[normal]oney transferred to Malabu
[normal] being 
[normal]passed on 
[normal]to five 
[normal]Nigerian 
[normal]shell companies with
[normal] hidden owners, raising concerns as to who ultimately benefitted from this deal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]49. 
[normal]Despite Nigeria’s abundant oil wealth, Nigerians remain among the world’s poorest people
[normal] and the country is set to receive just under £1 billion from the Department for International Development from 2011 to 2015
[normal]. In a country that continues to be plagued by corruption the need for citizen oversight of payments to governments for their natura
[normal]l resources is as important as ever. Currently, and as this case demonstrates, detailed information of this nature only comes to light through the accident of court cases in London and New York.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]50. 
[normal]Opaque deals like OPL245 illustrate why it is so important that the UK sticks to its G8 commitment to swiftly implement the EU Accounting Directive, 
[normal]through transposition into UK law during 2014.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b) 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s courts used to settle the proceeds of corruption
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]51. 
[normal]Of the $1.1 billion that Shell and 
[normal]Eni paid for OPL245, $21
[normal]5
[normal] million was frozen in a UK court, pending the result of a commercial case brought by 
[normal]Energy Venture Partners. EVP, registered in the British Virgin Islands
[normal], 
[normal]argued
[normal] that it helped
[normal] Malabu sell
[normal] the block to Shell and 
[normal]Eni. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]52. 
[normal]In July 2013, the British High C
[normal]ourt ruled that EVP was owed 
[normal]at least 
[normal]$
[normal]110 million of this
[normal] for its services in arranging the sale of the block
[normal]. Th
[normal]e result of this judgment is that, in theory, $105 million should be paid o
[normal]ver to Malabu – and hence to Mr Etete - and it has been suggested that EVP should be entitled to the r
[normal]emaining $110 million
[normal], held by the High Court. As of the date of this submission, this case now awaits appeal. 
[normal]A separate arbitration case brought by another party that alleged it assisted 
[normal]in 
[normal]the sale of OPL245 
[normal]h
[normal]as 
[normal]recently been concluded behind closed doors. The terms of th
[normal]at
[normal] settlement have not been revealed but could result in a further $
[normal]75
[normal] million of 
[normal]frozen 
[normal]fun
[normal]ds 
[normal]being 
[normal]transferred to Malabu. Those frozen funds are currently held in an account at JP Morgan 
[normal]Chase 
[normal]in London
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]53. 
[normal]Whether the 
[normal]money is returned to Malabu
[normal] or paid out to the brokers
[normal], the funds are
[normal] the proce
[normal]eds of corruption, given that they
[normal] result fro
[normal]m 
[normal]the
[normal] sale of an asset 
[normal]that was 
[normal]obtained in 
[normal]highly questionable and 
[normal]corrupt
[normal] circumstances in 
[normal]the first place. 
[normal]UK authorities should urgently intervene to ensure that UK Courts are not being used to determine the beneficiaries of the proceeds of crime.  Rat[bold]her this money should be frozen[bold] immediately[bold] and returned to the people of Nigeria.  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]54. [bold]The UK is the leading centre for private dispute resolution. It should use its position to [bold]make[bold] arbitration proceedings[bold] transparent[bold] in cases where there is a significant public interest, such as OPL245. [bold]Above all, courts should not decide arbitration proceedings prior to determining whether the funds in question could be the proceeds of crime – otherwise they risk [bold]facilitating[bold] state l[bold]ooting. [bold]Citizens sho[bold]uld not be kept in ignorance of d[bold]ecisions which have serious implications for them.  Details of such proceedings should be made public and their outcomes should be published. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]55. 
[normal]The cases discussed above amply illustrate the huge cor
[normal]ruption concerns surrounding extractives companies listed and registered in the UK
[normal], and the damage this is doing to the UK’s reputation for probity. Opacity around resource deals and company ownership is a central part of the problem. For matters to improv
[normal]e the UK will have to introduce new laws and take firmer action against corporate misbehaviour. To start with, the UK should follow through on its promises, putting in place a public register of beneficial ownership and transposing the EU Transparency and 
[normal]Accounting Directive into UK law. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]56. 
[normal]As noted above, Global Witness would be glad to expand upon its recommendations and investigative findings in oral evidence to the Committee.
