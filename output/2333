defaultThe British Prime Minister has called for public registries of the “beneficial owners” – that is, the people who ultimately own companies – as a means of combating tax evasion and fraud. In a letter from April of this year, 
defaultMr Cameron
default calle
defaultd
default for the “
defaultavail
defaultability of beneficial ownership information through central public company registries
default”
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultThe Department for Business Innovation and Skills 
defaulthas been 
defaultholding a public consultation on this matter, examining whether 
defaulta UK
default registry should be public or not. Global Witness is firmly of the opinion that 
defaulta public register would provide the surest safeguard against corruption.default&#xa0;
default8. 
defaultAn open registry would be cheap, would allow companies to know who they are doing business with 
default(a
defaultnd thus reduce due diligence costs) 
defaultand would enable citizens to hold companies to account.

default&#xa0;
default9. 
defaultGlobal Witness believes that 
defaultthe UK should also ensure publish registers are adopted in its
default Overseas Territories (OTs) and Crown Dependencies (CDs).default The UK h
defaultas the right to impose this decision on the OTs and CDs.
default A number of these territories are jurisdictions of choice for criminals setting up anonymous companies to hide their identity. While in many cases, trust and company service providers (TCSPs) are required to collect beneficial ownership information on com
defaultpanies incorporated in the OTs and CDs, the accuracy and completeness of this information is often doubtful. The 
default“
defaultoffshore leaks
default”
default work carried out by the International Centre for Investigative Journalism has shown that in some cases TCSPs in the OTs and CD
defaults simply have not collected beneficial ownership information.

default13. defaultShell should equally desist from lobbying actively to delay and/or weaken UKdefault and EU implementation of the Accounting and Transparency Directives.

default14. defaultAs partners withdefault defaultcdefaultivil defaultsdefaultociety and defaultcdefaultompanies in the EITI processdefault,default the UK Government should advocate for UK EITI reports to meet high standards by including a publicly available register of the beneficial owners of companies defaultinvolved and public disclosure of extractive contracts and licences.

defaultThe Russian Trading Structure
default&#xa0;
default16. 
defaultENRC is a company with Kazakh origins 
defaultthat 
defaultis largely controlled by its trio of founding shareholders: Patokh Chodiev, Alijan Ibragimov and Alexander Mashkevitch.
default&#xa0;
default17. 
defaultGlobal Witness has investigated
default corruption concerns around the company’s business in the DRC and has also reviewed audits which, among other matters, show how the trio siphoned money out of its Kazakh factories. The evidence not only demonstrates the importance of the UK
default authorities pur
defaultsuing their current
default investigations into ENRC to their conclusion but also raises serious regulatory questions for the Stock Exchange authorities – including 
defaultwhy
default ENRC 
defaultwas allowed 
defaultto list in the first place. 
default&#xa0;
default18. 
defaultTo comply with the word limit here, we focus
default on the most damning of these audits. We would be glad to offer supplementary material, oral or written
default.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default 
defaultA September 2007 audit by the law firm Herbert Smith explains how the trio skimmed most of the profits from mineral sales to Russia in the years p
defaultreceding ENRC’s London listing in December 2007. The audit examined how, from 2004 to 2006, four factories in Kazakhstan sold $870 million of coal, iron ore and other minerals to Russia through layers of anonymously owned intermediary companies, collective
defaultly referred to
default in the audit
default as the Russian Trading Structure (RTS). 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default 
defaultThe factories concerned – majority-owned by the trio – were incorporated as separate entities from 2004 but were grouped under the ENRC umbrella in December 2006. Seventy per cent of
default all profits went personally to the three founder shareholders in cash, the 
defaultaudit
default said.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default 
defaultThe RTS was “based on entirely illegitimate objectives”, wrote Pieter Hamelink, a Dutch tax lawyer who headed ENRC’s Audit Committee, in a 6 April 2006 e-mail cite
defaultd by the auditors. 
defaultThe audit said that 
defaultENRC’s smaller shareholders could have been “prejudiced by the transfer of profits away from the plants”.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default 
default“The plants received, via bank transfer, a payment for their products,” said the audit. “This did not represent the total amount of payment as the RTS would also pay a cash element in respect of each transaction… for the benefit of Messers Chodiev, Ibragim
defaultov and Machkevitch.” 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default 
defaultPatokh Chodiev’s nephew, Olim, was the trio’s “treasur
defaulter” tasked with collecting the
default cash, 
defaultaccording to the audit
default: “Olim Chodiev told us that he did not see any documentation in relation to the RTS arrangement and would simply co
defaultllect the money.”
default&#xa0;
default24. 
defaultWhile two senior officials told Herbert Smith that the RTS structure was independent of the trio, the 
defaultaudit
default provides substantial evidence that this was untrue. For example, one key firm in the RTS, Ugolenergoimpex, was “ultimately, b
defaulteneficially owned by the Majority Shareholders [the trio]”, according to the head of the Moscow branch of ENRC Marketing, Anatoliy Tulyakov. Mr Tulyakov was a director of Ugolenergoimpex and was thus in a position to know about its ownership.  Evidence in 
defaultthe audit from 
defaultMr Hamelink
default and from ENRC’s Swiss tax advisers also indicate that the trio beneficially owned companies in the RTS.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default 
defaultAs well as skimming
default profits, RTS companies also took 
defaultextra commission
defaults
default. If the
default trio
default were the beneficial owners of the RTS companies, the
defaultir
default cut of the profits may have been above 70%.
default 
default&#xa0;
default26. 
defaultFrom reading the 
defaultaudit
default, it 
defaultappears to Global Witness that
default th
defaulte RTS
default arrangement could have been fraudulent, with the trio siphoning off profits from ENR
defaultC in cash through anonymously owned companies 
defaultto
default the expense of ENRC’s other shareholders.
default 
default&#xa0;
default27.
default 
defaultMuch potential evidence has vanished. Key ENRC officials in Moscow had “not provided us with an honest account” when questioned about deleting data about the R
defaultTS, while other officials refused to answer questions, Herbert Smith wrote. Prior to the Herbert Smith analysis, PwC was sent falsified information as 
defaultit
default sought to audit company revenues. During a later investigation, the UK law firm Dechert wrote in a let
defaultter to ENRC of 12 April 2013 that a false office was even created in Kazakhstan. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default 
defaultIt was not until the end of 2006 that the RTS system was closed down. In 2006, sales from ENRC’s Kazakhstan plants to Russia involved UK-registered Tekmark Consulting Lt
defaultd 
default, which the auditors “
defaultunderstand is a company put forward by the RTS”. Tekmark signed “commission agreements” with ENRC subsidiaries, formally giving it a role in selling metal to Russia.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default 
defaultThe agreements with Tekmark appear to have made no fundamental difference to the RTS structure, with Herbert Smith saying “we understand that during 2006 the Majority Shareholders continued to receive the cash from the RTS in Moscow”.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default 
defaultTekmark
default appears 
defaultto been have no more than a shell: “Given that Tekmark is recorded as being a dormant company at the time when the services are being provided with assets of £300 it seems unlikely, in practice, to have provided any services whatsoever,” the audit said. 
default&#xa0;
default31.
default 
defaultThe people who own Tekmark are unknown, as documents filed at UK Companies House show its sole shareholder as a being another anonymously-owned company: Vestro Development, registered in Gibraltar.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default 
defaultDespite the extremely serious findings of the aud
defaultit, ENRC 
defaultwas able to
default go ahead and list o
defaultn the London Stock Exchange less than three months
default after it was submitted. Membership of the FTSE100 ensured that UK pensioners would automatically buy its stock through tracker funds. 
default&#xa0;
default33.
default 
defaultENRC’s
default Initial Public Off
defaultering (IPO) prospectus declared the RTS as a “risk factor” and recognised that it paid out $111 million to the trio. Yet the details the IPO provided of the RTS are contradicted by Herbert Smith. ENRC professed general ignorance about 
defaulthow the RTS was struc
defaulttured and about 
defaultthe “agency” organising
default it (ENRC said it believes th
defaultis
default 
default“
defaultagency
default…
defaultwas neither owned or legally controlled by the Group or its shareholders
default”)
default. However, the audit cites Johannes Sittard, then the CEO of ENRC, saying that every three to six month
defaults “there would be a special presentation made… concerning money which had been earned by the Majority Shareholders from RTS sales. This presentation would be restricted to the Majority Shareholders and Dr Sittard… During these presentations Ilmir Masgutov 
default[a consultant to the factories] would hand out documentation which set out the results of the RTS trading.”  The audit shows that several officials working for the trio and its companies had a detailed knowledge of the RTS.
default&#xa0;
default34. 
defaultGlobal Witness has put deta
defaultiled questions to ENRC about the Russian Trading Structure but
default the response simply 
defaultreferr
defaulted
default us back to a general statement of corporate principles.
default&#xa0;
defaultb) The 
defaultDRC
default acquisitions
default&#xa0;
default35. 
defaultIn 2009 ENRC began buying mining assets in the DRC from Dan Gertler, a friend 
defaultof President Joseph Kabila
default. Mr Gertler
default 
defaulthad 
defaultsecretly bought the assets at steeply undervalued prices and quickly sold them on for huge profits – in one case “flipping” a mine to ENRC for five times the original value paid. In the process ENRC paid hundreds 
defaultof millions of dollars to companies registered anonymously in the British Virgin Islands. The resulting scandal has contributed to a rapid descent in its share price.
default&#xa0;
default36. 
defaultGlobal Witness has published several reports on the “secret sales scandal” since May
default 2012, and a May 2013 report by the Africa Progress Panel gives further valuable analysis.
default Representatives of Glencore and of Mr Gertle
defaultr
default have repeatedly denied there was any
default corruption in their Congolese deals
default, with Mr Gertler’s spokesmen challenging the 
defaultvaluation data used 
defaultby 
defaultus 
defaultand the Africa Progress Panel
default. 
defaultENRC has issued a general statement, saying that 
defaultit “
defaulthas a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption
default”
default,
default&#xa0;
default37. 
defaultThe SFO began “discussions” with ENRC over corruption allegations in the DRC and Kaza
defaultkhstan by December 2011. Yet ENRC was allowed to “self-report” to the SFO for
default the next
default 16 months before the agency finally opened a criminal investigation
default in April 2013
default. 
defaultDavid Green, who 
defaulttook over as 
defaultas Director of the SFO in April 2012, sa
defaultying
default that he was against “cosy deals”
default and favoured a tougher approach
default than his predecessor
default; the announcement of the crim
defaultinal investigation 
defaultsuggests he may have been
default living up to his promises.
default 
defaultHowever, Global Witness encourages the Select Committee to examine wdefaulthy the SFO took so long to launch a formal investigationdefault, and whether the self-reporting has been effective.default&#xa0;
default38. 
defaultMeanwhile, t
defaulthe Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) was alerted to corruption
default risks
default when ENRC filed 
defaultat least two 
defaultSuspicious Activity Report
defaults 
defaultthrough its lawyers H
defaulterbert Smith in 2010
default, relating to a major mining deal in the DRC
default.  
default&#xa0;
default39. 
defaultGlobal Witness
default has seen a leaked copy of the 
defaultsecond 
defaultof these reports, 
defaultfrom
default August 2010.
default In it, 
defaultENRC 
defaultrequest
defaults
default permission to seal a $175 million deal with a British
default Virgin Islands company
default associated with Mr Gertler
default – just eight days before the deal was due to be formally announced. The report noted a risk that the mine concessions that ENRC was to buy from the BVI-registered Highwind Group “may have been obtained by 
defaultcorruption”. 
default&#xa0;
default40. 
defaultGlobal Witness believes ENRC misled Soca about when it became aware of the corruption risks and what it knew about the ownership of the assets. 
defaultWe encourage the Select Committee to examine this defaultSuspicious Activity Rdefaulteport and Soca’s response as a means of gaining insight into how the extractives industry is policed in the UK.default&#xa0;
default41. defaultWe also encourage the Select Committee to examine what UK regulatory authorities knew and should have known about corruptiondefault concerdefaultns surrodefaultunding ENRC – including those detailed in the Herbert Smith audit – as the company sought permission to list.default The case of ENRC helps illustrate why the the London Stock Exchange and relevant authorities should be obliged to perform more stringent due dilidefaultgence before allowing companies to list.default&#xa0;
default42. 
defaultThe trio is now seeking to delist the company by buying out minority shareholders and
default it is reported that there are plans to 
defaultreregister the company in Kazakhstan. This could pose a serious threat to the complet
defaultion of the SFO’s criminal inquiry, a matter of deep public interest. 
defaultUK authorities should block the delisting or, should this prove impossible, prevent associated transactions and the re-registration of the company outside the UK until the inquiry is compdefaultlete.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultShell and Edefaultnidefault: the case of OPL245default&#xa0;
defaulta) Payments to a convicted money launderer for an oil block
default&#xa0;
default43. 
defaultFor over a year now
default Global Witness 
defaulthas been 
defaultpiec
defaulting 
defaulttogether detailed court documents and other evidence that expose how 
defaultShell and Italian oil giant
default Eni agreed to pay US$1.092
default billion for one of Nigeria’s most potentially lucrative oil blocks, OPL245. 
default&#xa0;
default44. 
defaultThe payment was made by Shell and Eni
default to the Nigerian government, which
default had a separate agreement to pay the same amount to Malabu Oil and Gas, a 
defaultN
defaultigerian 
defaultcompany widely believed at the time to be controlled by convicted money-launderer and former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete.
default&#xa0;
default45. 
defaultIn July 2013, a British High Court court ruled that Etete was indeed the owner of Malabu. As Etete had awarded the oi
defaultl block to Malabu whilst 
defaultpetroleum
default minister during the regime of the corrupt dictator General Abacha, he had effectively given himself one of the most lucrative oil blocks in Nigeria.
default&#xa0;
default46. 
defaultShell and Eni deny paying any money to Malabu. However, High Court 
defaultproceedings and other evidence seen by Global Witness reveal that in reality Shell and Eni were aware an
defaultd in agreement that the deal would
default benefit Malabu, and had even met with 
defaultEtete face-to-face on several occasions. In fact, testimony heard during the ca
defaultse indicates that an official from Shell previously negotiated directly with Etete over “iced champagne” and that Eni officials had enjoyed a luxurious dinner at a 5-
defaults
defaulttar 
defaulth
defaultotel in Milan with Etete.  
default&#xa0;
default47. 
defaultGlobal Witness believes that the deal was structure
defaultd 
defaultthrough the Nigerian government
default primarily to allo
defaultw Shell and Eni to claim that they
default had not struck a deal with Etete or Malabu. Yet in making these payments, Shell and Eni had effectively bought the block from Etete for over a billion dollars, there
defaultby
default “m
defaultonetising” an asset that was originally acquired by Malabu
default in highly suspicious and proba
defaultbly illegal circumstances.   
default&#xa0;
default48. 
defaultDocuments seen by Global Witness also indicate that the deal resulted in over $801 million of the m
defaultoney transferred to Malabu
default being 
defaultpassed on 
defaultto five 
defaultNigerian 
defaultshell companies with
default hidden owners, raising concerns as to who ultimately benefitted from this deal.
default&#xa0;
default49. 
defaultDespite Nigeria’s abundant oil wealth, Nigerians remain among the world’s poorest people
default and the country is set to receive just under £1 billion from the Department for International Development from 2011 to 2015
default. In a country that continues to be plagued by corruption the need for citizen oversight of payments to governments for their natura
defaultl resources is as important as ever. Currently, and as this case demonstrates, detailed information of this nature only comes to light through the accident of court cases in London and New York.
default&#xa0;
default50. 
defaultOpaque deals like OPL245 illustrate why it is so important that the UK sticks to its G8 commitment to swiftly implement the EU Accounting Directive, 
defaultthrough transposition into UK law during 2014.  
default&#xa0;
defaultb) 
defaultUK
default’s courts used to settle the proceeds of corruption
default&#xa0;
default51. 
defaultOf the $1.1 billion that Shell and 
defaultEni paid for OPL245, $21
default5
default million was frozen in a UK court, pending the result of a commercial case brought by 
defaultEnergy Venture Partners. EVP, registered in the British Virgin Islands
default, 
defaultargued
default that it helped
default Malabu sell
default the block to Shell and 
defaultEni. 
default&#xa0;
default52. 
defaultIn July 2013, the British High C
defaultourt ruled that EVP was owed 
defaultat least 
default$
default110 million of this
default for its services in arranging the sale of the block
default. Th
defaulte result of this judgment is that, in theory, $105 million should be paid o
defaultver to Malabu – and hence to Mr Etete - and it has been suggested that EVP should be entitled to the r
defaultemaining $110 million
default, held by the High Court. As of the date of this submission, this case now awaits appeal. 
defaultA separate arbitration case brought by another party that alleged it assisted 
defaultin 
defaultthe sale of OPL245 
defaulth
defaultas 
defaultrecently been concluded behind closed doors. The terms of th
defaultat
default settlement have not been revealed but could result in a further $
default75
default million of 
defaultfrozen 
defaultfun
defaultds 
defaultbeing 
defaulttransferred to Malabu. Those frozen funds are currently held in an account at JP Morgan 
defaultChase 
defaultin London
default.
default&#xa0;
default53. 
defaultWhether the 
defaultmoney is returned to Malabu
default or paid out to the brokers
default, the funds are
default the proce
defaulteds of corruption, given that they
default result fro
defaultm 
defaultthe
default sale of an asset 
defaultthat was 
defaultobtained in 
defaulthighly questionable and 
defaultcorrupt
default circumstances in 
defaultthe first place. 
defaultUK authorities should urgently intervene to ensure that UK Courts are not being used to determine the beneficiaries of the proceeds of crime.  Ratdefaulther this money should be frozendefault immediatelydefault and returned to the people of Nigeria.  default&#xa0;
default54. defaultThe UK is the leading centre for private dispute resolution. It should use its position to defaultmakedefault arbitration proceedingsdefault transparentdefault in cases where there is a significant public interest, such as OPL245. defaultAbove all, courts should not decide arbitration proceedings prior to determining whether the funds in question could be the proceeds of crime – otherwise they risk defaultfacilitatingdefault state ldefaultooting. defaultCitizens shodefaultuld not be kept in ignorance of ddefaultecisions which have serious implications for them.  Details of such proceedings should be made public and their outcomes should be published. default&#xa0;
default55. 
defaultThe cases discussed above amply illustrate the huge cor
defaultruption concerns surrounding extractives companies listed and registered in the UK
default, and the damage this is doing to the UK’s reputation for probity. Opacity around resource deals and company ownership is a central part of the problem. For matters to improv
defaulte the UK will have to introduce new laws and take firmer action against corporate misbehaviour. To start with, the UK should follow through on its promises, putting in place a public register of beneficial ownership and transposing the EU Transparency and 
defaultAccounting Directive into UK law. 
default&#xa0;
default56. 
defaultAs noted above, Global Witness would be glad to expand upon its recommendations and investigative findings in oral evidence to the Committee.
