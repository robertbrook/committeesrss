"              \n              \nDIS 58 \n&#xa0;VSO Submission to International Development Select Committee Inquiry into Disability and Development.Introduction VSO is an international development agency with 55 years’ experience of addressing poverty and disadvantage through our unique approach of working through volunteers. By working closely over time with carefully selected partners – from grassroots organisations to government ministries\n – \nvolunteers provide the right support to help ensure that local development efforts deliver greatest impact and lasting change\n. \nVSO aims to support disabled people to participate as equal members of their families, communities and societies. Volunteers are supporting local agencies and governments to identify strategies that promote disabled people's human rights, such as education, employment and healthcare.  We do this by supporting disabled people's groups to raise awareness of issues that affect disabled people, and working to improve the accessibility and quality of mainstream and special services provided by both the government and by non-governmental organi\ns\nations. \nWe welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to this inquiry. VSO is a member of the Global Campaign for Education\n (GCE UK)\n, and supports \nits\n submission to this inquiry. \n&#xa0;DFID’s commitments on disability &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPromoting Inclusive education &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe importance of engaging disabled people in programming &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Post 2015 international development process &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-pledge-to-help-tackle-the-great-neglect-of-disability\n As defined in, for example, \nin DFID (2000), \n‘Disability, poverty and development’\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227184/Health_Position_Paper_final_formatted_version.pdf\n&#xa0;\n DFID have committed to train 190,000 teachers by 2015.
