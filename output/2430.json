"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nPublic Transport Users\n’\n Committee\n for Wales\n (TIC 110)\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe Public Transport Users’ Committee for Wales (PTUC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this inquiry.  \n1.2\n              \nThe PTUC is a committee which offers advice to Welsh Ministers about strategic issues relating to public transport services in Wales from the perspective of users’ experiences and needs.\n1.3\n              \nThe present arrangements relating to Wales are that although much of the control over rural transport has been devolved to Wales there remains a degree of overall regulation and statutory frameworks that \nare\n the remit of Westminster. We felt it was thus \nappropriate \nfor PTUC (Wales) to make a submission on this issue.\n1.4\n              \nIn terms of rural transport, especially in terms of the bus and community transport sectors, the detailed specifications and funding streams are within the remit of Welsh Government, and it is mainly at this level that service frequencies, connections and much in the way of quality of provision is specified. \n1.5\n              \nRural transport is of critical importance because of its impact on health and well-being, and the positive impact improved connectivity can play in promoting economic renewal and \nhelping reduce\n poverty. Rural public transport \npromotes \nsocial inclusion, while having a role to play in reducing the environmental cost of transport.\n It is our view that at present users are not at the heart of service delivery and this can lead to services that are optimised around provider needs rather than around the needs of the user.\n1.6\n              \nWales is a predominantly rural nation, and a major concern is that the provision of rural public transport \nrelies heavily on\n community transport, which is patchy and generally not developed strategically.\n1.7\n              \nThe regulation of bus services in rural areas and anti-competitive laws act in a way to reduce co-ordination of low frequency services. Regulations which may well have a place in an urban setting\n,\n where competition occurs between commercial service providers, is wholly unsuited to rural and deeply rural regions with a mix of low frequency commercial and \nsupported \nservices. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe focus is\n on existing users who may have a voice for example \nthrough\n \nBus Users UK \nand \ntheir bus surgeries. Non-users tend not to be considered, and public transport planning, especially in rural areas\n,\n is likely to be reactive rather than proactive when new developments occur\n. P\nublic transport is usually considered after the location of a new development has been \nfinalised,\n rather than \nseeking the optimum location on the basis of\n public transport access.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nIn\n rural Wales\n,\n for example\n,\n there are some bus services that run once per week on a market day in the nearest town. These are designed around access for shopping and medical appointments. Outside of school and college transport\n,\n little consideration \nis given to \n the needs of young people. Similarly, little consideration is given to running late evening buses to allow visits to cinemas, concerts etc. There are instances where service timetables are based around operator convenience rather than users, so there may not be a late bus on a Friday or Saturday or to meet an evening train \ndue to\n a lack of flexibility in drivers hours etc. There remains a concern that some vehicles remain inaccessible for disabled passengers. Or that space on vehicles is taken up by others, such \nas passengers with \n child buggies, which can lead to conflict.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nIntegration between modes and between different operators is critical. Rural public transport timetables will generally be low frequency\n;\n possibly two hourly or worse. The robustness of connections is then far more important than journey time. Regulation and anti-competitive requirements prevent many operators from co-ordinating services so that an appropriate service can be provided at an economic cost.\n4.2\n              \nUncertainties about longer-term revenue support also \nraise\n issue\ns\n. People will make employment, educational or home location decisions based upon public transport timetables and routes\n. A\n change to these could seriously affect the continued viability of such decisions. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nCommunity transport \nis usually locally based and \ncan be very patchy, with some excellent examples. Publicity tends to be focused on local, regular users. A big issue in the sector remains how to get non-users to \nrealise \nwhat is available, and that the service is \navailable \nfor \ntheir use\n. The variable and local nature of community transport makes it difficult for \npotential \nusers from outside the area to make use of the \nservices\n. Spreading good practice to areas with less community transport needs to be considered\n.\n  \nWorkshops, \nwhere practitioners and potential users could develop and understand what is available\n,\n \nare a useful tool\n to release the potential in this sector.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nDevelopment of demand\n-\nled services such as bwc-a-bus in Carmarthenshire is one possible solution. Consideration needs to be \ngiven \nto existing users of timetabled services\n, if these are to\n be replaced by a demand\n-responsive \nsystem. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nUnit costs of traditional public transport are high, and policies that act against integration of public transport services have pushed many rural inhabitants towards the private car. This has reduced the viability and thus the service frequency of many bus routes, \nand removed \nmany rural railway stations from the network.  Increasing usage will make services more financially viable and this requires a concerted effort to target\n current\n non-users. For this group\n,\n information on service timetables, access, how to purchase tickets, inter-availability of tickets and accurate, updated information \nin case\n of delay\ns\n are critically important.  \n7.2\n              \nC\noncerns about road congestion, which are a major driver of increased public transport use in urban areas, are less of a driver in rural areas.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nAt present\n,\n with devolved Governments in Wales and Scotland having differing levels of responsibility over transport, there is an uncertainty over transport planning. For instance rail infrastructure in Wales remains the responsibility of \nthe UK Government, \nwhile \nthere is some Welsh Government input into \nservice levels \nfor the\n Arriva Wales franchise l. Bus services \nin Wales \nare funded via \nfour \nregional transport consortia in alliance with local Authorities for funded services\n,\n while the market determines service timetables on commercial routes. The lack of an overarching view is thus a major issue when integration is considered. \n8.2\n              \nWales has seen the development of a demand\n-\nled rural bus service, called bwc-a-bus, which has replaced previously very infrequent timetabled services in some areas. The scheme has been designed to be more responsive to passengers\n’\n needs. The introduction of bwc-a-bus has seen some inertia by users of the previous timetabled services, and the move from a sparse timetabled service to a bwc-a-bus type demand\n-\nled service needs to win the hearts and minds of \nboth existing \nusers (and potential ones. \n8.3\n              \nA number of recent\n \nreport\ns\n \nhave highlighted the issue of the rising \npercentage of \nthe \npopulation \nfacing transport poverty\n,\n meaning \nthat the rising cost of transport leaves people excluded and isolated, unable to access opportunities, from jobs to healthcare, that many take for granted. \n8.4\n              \nConsideration also needs to be given to younger people. As motoring costs rise\n,\n many young people are now delaying driving tests for cost reasons, particularly the high cost of insurance for younger drivers. In rural areas this results in youngsters having to rely on sparse public transport, which seriously restricts \naccess to \nemployment \nopportunities\n. A recurring theme is the lack of evening bus services in rural areas \nreducing opportunities for evening activities such as visits to the cinema or friends\n, while also removing the chance of working in sectors involving \nevening or \nshift work. \n8.5\n              \nConsideration should be given to the wider impact of rural passenger transport. Community transport is a lifeline for many users. It enables some users to remain living in their own homes for longer, reducing costs for health and social services. Similarly, for people with disabilities, removal of rural public or community transport could well result in increased healthcare or social services costs.\n8.6\n              \nAs health services become ever more \ncentralised \nin specialist units\n,\naccessibility to these services needs to be \ncarefully \nconsidered. We already see in Wales that \none hour public transport \njourneys to the local general hospital\n,\n by can \nbe replaced by the need for very lengthy journeys involving multiple c\nhanges and unfamiliar locations.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
