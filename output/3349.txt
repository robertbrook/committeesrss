[[[ritten evidence from the Financial Ombudsman Service]]]

[[[ [PHS0032]]]]Thank you very much for your letter dated September 2013 inviting written evidence to your Committee's inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).

[[[about us]]]I thought it might be helpful for me to set out the nature and context of our work to begin with. Although our organisation shares the title of `ombudsman' with the PHSO, our private sector remit in respect of financial services inevitably (and rightly) means that our focus and operation is somewhat different.As you know, the Financial Ombudsman Service was established under the Financial Services and Markets Act to resolve disputes between financial businesses and their customers. It brought together a number of predecessor ombudsman schemes under one roof to create a `one stop shop' for financial services disputes. The service deals with complaints involving banks, insurers, advisors and other businesses regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), as well as those made against consumer credit businesses currently licensed by the Office of Fair Trading. In total we cover more than 100,000 businesses ranging from the major banks to sole traders.Our statutory remit is therefore somewhat different from the PHSO's. Unlike the PHSO, we have a statutory obligation to both look at and resolve all complaints referred to us directly by consumers, except in quite limited circumstances — giving rise to significant volumes of complaints (around 500,000 currently received per year). Our role also has to be understood in the context of a wider regulatory regime for financial services — including a statutory regulator of industry conduct — the Financial Conduct Authority — from whom we are operationally independent but with whom we work closely. So while we share our insight with both regulators and businesses, our focus is primarily on resolving individual complaints, rather than necessarily looking at wider issues of commercial practice or behaviour in the market. Another important difference is that, unlike the PHSO, if a consumer accepts our decision then it is binding on the business concerned and enforceable in court subject to an upper limit on binding awards of £150,000 a case.Those sorts of distinctions (there are of course many others) reflect the core policy purpose behind our organisation — namely as part of a wider set of regulatory architecture, to correct market failure in financial services by removing the asymmetries of power between businesses and consumers when engaged in disputes. So while there are a number of analogies between our services, we operate in a very different context from the PHSO — whose purpose is so closely tied to the wider delivery of public services and Parliament's role in holding the executive to account. Our evidence is therefore inevitably presented though that lens.In terms of the complaints that come to us, in 2012/13 we handled 2,161,439 initial enquiries in 55 languages. 508,881 enquiries were taken on as new cases (an increase of 92% on the year before) of which just under three quarters were about payment protection insurance. Almost two thirds of last year's complaints (62%) related to the four major high street banking groups.

[[[your questions]]]Turning to the specific questions you raised in your letter: Harmonisation of Ombudsman schemes1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How do you share good practice with other ombudsmen, to improve processes and customer service?We engage with our fellow UK ombudsman schemes in a regular, structured way through the well-established Ombudsman Association, of which Caroline Wayman (our Principal Ombudsman and Legal Director) is an executive committee member. We also share best practice with other financial ombudsman schemes across the world, through both informal and formal networks. Ombudsman Association members regularly co-operate on issues of shared interest, for example the recent work on managing the impact of Alternative Business Structures (ABS) regulations.We also enjoy warm and co-operative bilateral relationships at senior staff and board level with a number of ombudsman schemes — including financial ombudsman schemes across the world.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are your views on the creation of a single access point for complaints to all ombudsmen?There is certainly opportunity to improve access to ombudsman services across the UK. And it is true that the fact that there are different schemes can cause consumers confusion.We regularly research consumer behaviour, as whatever access mechanism we have needs to meet consumer needs. The findings we have, however, show that consumers don't search for `ombudsmen' — they look for specific resolution of their issue. So, if they have an issue with their bank, they are likely to contact us, or a debt charity, whereas if they have an issue with their NHS provider they are likely to contact advice agencies, patient groups or the PHSO. In our case regulatory rules require clear signposting of the ombudsman by financial businesses when they handle complaints.So, while a single access point for all complaints to all ombudsmen might appear an attractive option, we would be concerned that it would simply add a new cost (of running a new infrastructure) for a service which consumers would be unlikely to use, or see benefit from. A single portal for ombudsman schemes may also (however inadvertently) limit the consumer's understanding of non-ombudsman options available to them such as Citizen's Advice, trading standards or in some cases alternative mediation schemes. Of course, one could add those services to the portal too, but that risks becoming unwieldy.The existing ombudsman schemes are good at cross-referring consumers to one another on the occasions when that is necessary. With over two million customer contacts last year, some of which end up being directed to other schemes, we have particularly strong experience of this. It's also worth noting that the EU online portal for ombudsman services — which is being implemented in parallel with the ADR directive — will offer a single entry point for consumers who have bought goods or services online.We cannot see the benefit of another 'single' portal.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services ombudsman in England, as there is in Scotland and Wales?While we see the intellectual case for economies of scale and ease of access on the one hand, and the benefits of specialisation on the other (see also question 6 below), in the end this is a matter that is wholly outside our jurisdiction and we have no particular view on it.European Directive on Alternative Dispute Resolution4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU Directive on ADR and are you taking any action in response?We are pleased to note that the Directive was based to a significant extent on UK best practice, and believe that its implementation in the UK should build on the strong existing arrangements for ADR of which our service is part.The ADR Directive is of course significant for us. We have been closely engaged with its development, and we broadly welcome its provisions. We are looking at whether any adjustments to our operations will be required as a result of the legislation which transposes it into UK law.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To what extent do you believe the Directive will allow better and meaningful comparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?The Directive has two functions: the first is to harmonise basic standards and the second is to improve access. Given the very varied types of ADR provision both within the UK and the EU we think the publication of data mandated by Directive itself is unlikely to aid meaningful comparisons between different providers.It's also important to remember, as noted in the introduction to our evidence, that variation is not necessarily bad: different ombudsman schemes are — for good reasons — designed in different ways, meaning that even where comparison may be possible it may not always be meaningful or instructive, either for the consumer or other interested parties. We think the numbers can be useful — but they rarely tell the whole story.&#xa0;That said, we do place a premium on transparency (we now publish ombudsman decisions, and have always been very open about the basis on which we make decisions, and about the trends in complaints by issue and by firm) and we welcome any encouragement to transparency in ADR provision. If not telling in themselves, published data can really help in bringing understanding to our work.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To what extent do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?The ADR Directive is certainly an opportunity to look at the system we have and decide whether it's the sort of system that parliament wants for the UK. And there is no doubt that overlaps and shortfalls exist. For example, if you're buying a house then your lawyer will be covered by one ombudsman, your mortgage provider another, and your estate agent by yet another. There are gaps too — no ombudsman, for example, covers advice to switch occupational pension schemes.We do have a good record of addressing these gaps and overlaps, in collaboration with other ombudsman schemes where necessary. Overall, the UK's ADR system functions fairly well and the Directive won't necessarily force reform either.That said, the Directive and the domestic legislation it spawns do represent a good opportunity for the government to take stock of the ADR landscape, and to ask some questions about what approach we think is best for consumers and industry. There is a case for the current landscape, characterised by a large number of discrete and specialist ombudsman services to whom regulators and the industry can relate and develop close relationships, and most of whom operate in a way that looks a little like the courts. We can see the appeal of this network of smaller, specialised schemes.But we can also see the logic of a landscape in which networks of fewer and larger schemes operate. As well as being easier to navigate for consumers, they benefit from economies of scale that give them increased versatility and resilience to peaks (and troughs) in demand — including those caused by mass complaints like PPI and changes in market or consumer behaviour, which can be hard to forecast. Bigger schemes can also apply their learning and expertise across sectors and invest in outreach and insight, while adjusting more easily to changes in scope and jurisdiction.Our own experience suggests that some of the best of both worlds may be possible. With work spanning two regulators, we have experience of managing work from more than one jurisdiction, tailoring rules and approaches where necessary depending on the relevant regulatory environment, and more generally handling the technical and cultural differences between sectors described elsewhere in this evidence. Other ombudsman schemes have similar experience.Finally, in terms of the Directive, it's important to note that its provisions on access are geared towards the relationships between consumers and traders. We don't have the experience to comment on far its approach might usefully translate to the slightly different context of public sector ombudsmanry.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How can those involved in dispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who are covered by it?&#xa0;As stressed in my answer to question 5, it's important to note that different ombudsman schemes do different things. Some resolve business-to-business disputes, while others handle consumer-to-business ones. Some deal with very complex cases requiring specialist knowledge and detailed research, while others handle relatively straightforward matters (and of course some — like us — do both). Some are obliged to handle all complaints that come to them, while others are not. Some (like PHSO and us) have an obligation to share their insights with regulators and others, while others don't. And every scheme has different stakeholders with often very different requirements and expectations.Therefore, while high standards across the board are important for all of us, it isn't clear that one could or should impose precise definitions of what constitutes high standards for application across the full range of schemes. Instead, it makes sense for the Directive to impose basic standards at a high level — which is exactly what it does. Then, more detailed standards should be determined by the relevant authority on a sector-by-sector basis, through the specification (and, where applicable, tendering) of individual ombudsman schemes. This specific standard-setting will be the real driver of standards, and will apply just as much to schemes outside the scope of the Directive as within it.It's also important that flexibility should be shown within individual schemes as well as between them: a simple case can and should be dealt with quickly, whoever is dealing with it, while more complex cases should get the time and attention they need. Ultimately this is in the consumer's interest: inflexible standards will always have to be set at a level that's reasonable for the slowest, most complex cases, which would be unacceptably frustrating for consumers and businesses involved with simple complaints.8. How can the government ensure against the proliferation of excessive numbers ofdifferent dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing so)?In my answer to question 6, I said we believe the overall approach taken by Government to shaping the ADR landscape should depend on what factors it wishes to prioritise in the provision of ADR services for consumers. Relative proliferation might be desirable if we thought consumers would benefit most from specialised services, with strong but narrow industry and regulator relationships. Alternatively, consolidation may be best if we thought consumers would benefit most from a marketplace that shared learning, was more resilient to mass complaints and could achieve economies of scale.In any case, if Government does take the opportunity to re-shape the ADR landscape it must be careful to preserve the one overriding principle of all ombudsmen — i.e. their independence. As with any quasi-judicial body, an ombudsman relies on there being confidence (among both consumers and traders) that the scheme is genuinely impartial. So in contemplating any future changes to the ADR set up, it's essential that services are not subject to any funding structures that incentivise partisanship, or the perception of it. An ombudsman must not give the impression of having been captured by a financial interest to find in favour of one group or the other.&#xa0;Therefore, while a polluter-pays model which provides good value for money remains the most desirable approach, the use of competition as a means of achieving value for money needs to be considered carefully. For example, any competitive process whereby ombudsmen compete to handle an individual business's complaints is likely to lead to a race to the bottom as far as consumers are concerned. Even if there is no change in the substance of decisions, it's clear that a service's processes and approaches will be geared to suit its customer (the business) rather than the consumer, which risks deterring consumers from complaining. It would also introduce incentives against an ombudsman making tough decisions which are unpopular with the industry concerned.I hope these answers are useful for your inquiry. &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
