Written evidence from Ron Hogg, Police and Crime Commissioner, Durham [CST0039][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Please find below response from Mr Ron Hogg- Durham Police and Crime Commissioner. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1/ [bold]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Durham Constabulary incident and crime data is reviewed on a regular basis, internally and also externally by HMIC (Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its most recent report the HMIC noted there were “strong arrangements at a senior level around securing good quality incident and crime data, supported by helpful plans, policies and strategies.” And an internal audit carried out earlier this year against national crime recording standards found 95% of our incidents, and 98% of crimes were being correctly recorded. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Durham Constabulary sets a high standard when recording crimes and incidents in a consistent and accurate manner and staff are made fully aware of their responsibilities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I remain open to any scope for improvement but I am confident our recording methods are robust and accurately reflect what is happening in our communities.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2/ [bold]&#xa0;[bold]What, if any targets do you set [bold]&#xa0;[bold]for your [bold]&#xa0;[bold]police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I do have some concerns about ‘hard measures’ which I take to mean for example, to reduce crime by 10%. My concerns are heightened about such an approach when the National Statistics Office questioned the accuracy of police crime figures, when public confidence in police figures is low and when NHS are criticised for focussing on figures rather than care and corrupting figures to meet targets around waiting times for instance. It is for this reason that I wish to shift dependence towards direct feedback from the public regarding levels of satisfaction with and confidence in local policing. Throughout my policing service, I have always felt these to be much more meaningful indicators rather than crime statistics A set of performance questions have been developed to hold the Force to account and clear success criteria is defined in our priority areas.
