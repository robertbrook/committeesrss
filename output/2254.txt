[[[Conclusion]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is the national governing body for cricket in England and Wales. Our vision is to inspire the nation to choose cricket. &#xa0;Our responsibility is to promote and develop the game at all levels and in recent years we have invested a great deal of expertise and resource into modernising our structures to ensure that we can effectively support and develop cricket at all levels of the game, including women’s and girls’ cricket.&#xa0;Sixteen years ago the ECB took over responsibility from the Women’s Cricket Association as the National Governing Body for women and girls cricket In this time we have made tremendous progress in growing and promoting the women’s and girls’ game at all levels.  Women’s and girls’ cricket is more organised, better funded and has wider exposure than ever before with more people participating not only as players but in many different roles – including coaching, umpiring and volunteering.One of the most significant achievements is that women’s cricket is now fully integrated within the ECB, from international level to development programmes.  The women’s game sits inside the same structures with the same reporting lines.  It is completely embedded in the organisational structure and has become an integral part of the cricket family within the ECB’s Cricket Partnerships and England Cricket Departments. At present there are two women on ECB’s main Board: former Chief Constable Jane Stichbury who is an Independent Director providing strategic support to our anti-corruption unit and Baroness Rachel Heyhoe-Flint OBE DL, a former high profile England International and Women’s Cricket representative who has championed the women’s game for many years.As with the men’s game, the vast majority of our investment is focused into developing grassroots opportunities, developing player pathways and top-class support structures for elite players.  This approach ensures we have a “product” from the elite end to the very grassroots which is compelling, competitive and sustainable.On the international stage, ECB investment and on-going commitment has seen the England Women’s team secure continued success including lifting the ICC World Cup in Sydney in 2009, retaining their number one world ranking from 2009 to 2013 and this summer beating Australia to regain the Ashes – and win the inaugural multi-format Women’s Ashes Series (which comprised one Test match, three NatWest ODIs and three NatWest T20s). At the grassroots level, the last ten years has seen a 507% increase in the number of cricket clubs with a Women’s and/or a girl’s section (from 93 to 565).  We have had huge success in attracting young girls to the sport and we have exciting plans to retain a greater percentage of them through their teenage years and into adulthood and ultimately, for those with the ability, into a clearly defined and maturing talent pathway.Not only has ECB made women’s cricket part of its core business so too have the 39 County Cricket Boards (CCBs).  The CCBs are the game’s local delivery network and with support and investment from both ECB and Sport England in recent years the women’s game is now central to their strategic plansThere remains a significant challenge to secure wider media coverage and commercial value for women’s cricket.  The ECB will continue to pioneer new formats and invest directly to achieve these aims, building on the success we have had already in promotional activity including “double headers” where international women’s Twenty20 fixtures are played immediately before the men’s match, investing in broadcasts of non-televised matches on YouTube and creating a new points based multi-format series to widen and sustain interest throughout the summer.In this submission we highlight some of the successes to date, some of the challenges we face and set out how we are committed to ensuring that women’s cricket continues to thrive and provide women and girls with outstanding opportunities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Children should be introduced to physical activity opportunities (physical literacy) at an early age as part of their personal and emotional development and then in time to competitive sport. It is vital that this development process is driven within the school system.  We believe that young girls should be given the same opportunities to play and try sport without any stigma that the sport is only ‘for boys’.&#xa0;Our priority is to ensure delivery of as many opportunities as possible for girls to develop a lasting interest in cricket and continue to play the sport for years to come.  To deliver this the ECB has invested millions of pounds over the last few years into partnerships with other cricket bodies and the private sector to build programmes that help grow cricket in schools, especially state schools, and make full use of the facilities they offer. Each partnership programme offers a fantastic opportunity for girls to participate in cricket from a young age either through offering both mixed sessions and/or specific courses for girls. 2.1              Asda Kwik CricketThe ECB’s flagship grassroots schools initiative is Kwik Cricket, in its 8th year of sponsorship with Asda.  It provides children at primary school a fun, inclusive, fast-paced introduction to the game of cricket and offers both mixed sessions along with a programme designed specifically for girls. The current competition boasts participation figures of 140,000 with over 50% of all primary schools entering the competition.  The girls’ only programme had over 30,000 girls play in 2013, a 38% increase from 2012.The main aim of the competition is to inspire children to play cricket through the means of a national competition framework delivered by our 39 CCBs.  The programme provides teachers with a range of resources including skills demonstrations, ideas to play the game, an interactive web site, equipment and resources and certificates and badges.2.2              Chance to ShineThe Chance to Shine programme is run by the Cricket Foundation charity and is currently in its 8th year of delivery and is part funded by the ECB.  It has delivered cricket lessons to over two million children in 7,000 schools across the UK.  The aim of the programme is to reintroduce cricket into state schools and use cricket as a tool for the wider developmental issues like behaviour, attainment, team work and life skills and values.Chance to Shine supports the wider development of girls and cricket by working in partnership with the ECB to place girl’s cricket development at the forefront of every project.  There are approximately 160,000 girls playing cricket in school annually through the Chance to Shine programme and it will reach the one millionth girl to have gone through the programme during this school term. The programme will continue to expand its reach into both Primary and Secondary Schools (with a new focus on 14-16 year olds based on Sport England funding) offering more girls the chance to receive high quality coaching and the ECB will be looking to increase the numbers entering the club network on the back of this. The project has partnerships with 1,004 local cricket clubs, and qualified cricket coaches provide coaching and competition to local primary and secondary schools.&#xa0; Of those children going on to join a local club, 31% of these were girls. Seven members of the current England’s Women Cricket Team, including the captain Charlotte Edwards MBE, are employed by the Cricket Foundation as Chance to Shine Coaching Ambassadors and have made an enormous impact as positive role models in schools and clubs.&#xa0; The Ambassador programme has been running since 2008 and so far 11 England Women have worked inside both schools and community programmes. 15,000 school girls were coached by the seven England Women ambassadors last year.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.3              Lady TavernersECB have benefitted from a ten year relationship with the Lady Taverners, a funding arm to the Lord’s Taverners, to promote the participation of teenage girls playing cricket in education and at cricket clubs

[[[. ]]]Since its inception the outcomes of the girls’ only programme has: In 2013, the indoor competition had entries of 1500 teams (a 32% increase on 2012) from the U13 and U15 age groups; whilst the club competition had circa 400 entries from a variety of soft and hard ball formats ranging from U11 to U15.  The competition has engaged with over 110,000 girls since its introduction in 2003.The competition is administered centrally by ECB but supported locally by 39 CCBs and provides girls with the opportunity to play regular cricket at a local level and progress through to County, Regional and National Finals.  The National schools competition culminates in a Final held in the indoor school at Lord’s every May.2.4              Future School Sport FundingECB welcomes the additional funding from DfE and support from DCMS into school sport and the commitment that this will be ring-fenced and reviewed by Ofsted. It is vital that the school sports programme, including the national curriculum, underpin school sport provision.  The scale of the school system is far too big for any NGB to cover the entire infrastructure and training that is required. &#xa0;If we are to tackle the decline in some areas of sport and physical activity and deliver the wider social benefits sports brings there has to be more focus on this activity at school, particularly for young girls who play less sport than boys.  We are aware that 24% of girls aged 2-15 don’t do enough physical exercise yet 74% would do more if the offers to them were more suitable. &#xa0;Whatever the positives or the negatives of the previous system, it did provide NGB’s with support and strategic assistance to help us to effectively assist school sport so that our engagement offers greater economies of scale and return on investment.&#xa0;Organisations that can provide specialist coaching and training such as NGBs require support and advice on how to access schools which do not currently run any cricket programmes or training.  The Youth Sport Trust has a tremendous network but there are thousands of schools still not being given the chance to draw upon our resources.  There needs to be a one stop shop at a county level, such as County Sport Partnerships, to have the necessary resources and expertise to help identify demand and where needed help co-ordinate delivery.

[[[&#xa0;]]]ECB’s strategic plan for the development of grassroots cricket is mapped out in our Whole Sport Plan, a partnership arrangement with Sport England. The development of women’s cricket is integral to this plan and a key priority for the ECB. Whole Sport Plans have transformed the way Cricket approaches its delivery both nationally and at local level. Stability in the sector is crucial to allow sports to deliver the agreed plans with Sport England to achieve the current long-term targets.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;Our key focus is on:&#xa0;&#xa0;Women’s Club Cricket has seen considerable growth over the last ten years. Previously 90 ECB affiliated clubs had a women’s and/ or girl’s sections and by 2012 this had increased to 565:&#xa0;&#xa0;Our ambition is to ensure the game maintains this level of growth and as such we are in the process of putting together a new strategy which will see the women’s cricket embedded across our CCB network to sustain and grow our network of clubs and increase the level of participation. &#xa0;Each of our 39 County Cricket Boards now has a performance pathway in place that provides opportunities for girls and women to compete in county cricket.&#xa0;In 2012 the ECB also introduced a new women’s club competition structure in which the pinnacle of club cricket was expanded to increase the number of top level clubs, and other leagues link to the linear structure. Counties are now investing in running and developing their own junior and senior leagues to meet demand. Leagues are run throughout the week or at weekends.  3.1              Coaches The number of female coaches has grown from 556 in 2003 to 2,756 in 2013.Eight CCBs are involved in project 500, a County Sport Partnership / UK Sport project which is working with 5 NGB’s to develop programmes and opportunities for female coaches in their sports. The ECB will develop this programme nationally and roll it across our CCB network.ECB are in the process of developing new courses and resources to further improve coaches’ soft skills to help them engage more effectively with women and girls.3.2              Officials As part of our integrated approach the ECB is committed to offering opportunities to women across all sections of the game including offering and providing training to those who want to become umpires and scorers within a membership arm called the ECB ACO (Association of Cricket Officials). Several counties have begun to provide female only courses in support of the growth of female umpires.  Further steps have been taken to source female official role models from the success of the England Women’s teams.   Active promotion of female officials is one of the main priorities for the ECB ACO and recent work has been undertaken to identify and remove the key barriers to females following the officials’ pathway through to all levels of the game. Female umpires are becoming more prominent – within the last few years female umpires have been appointed to umpire both Minor Counties and County Second Eleven cricket and further examples exist in Premier Leagues. Late in 2012 ECB ACO launched a national initiative to develop and engage more females in umpiring.  Having established a robust pathway for all umpires to follow, it is now open to all umpires of the appropriate ability, irrespective of gender and race, to attain appointments at all levels of the game.  This includes developing Umpires at the very highest level of the game and ECB is about to launch an inclusive scheme to provide top level female umpires with opportunities to demonstrate their umpiring ability and to progress towards involvement in the professional game.There are currently female scorers involved at all levels of the game (including international level), and the intention is to mirror this in the umpiring arena.&#xa0;

[[[Case Study – ]]]

[[[female umpires in the ]]]

[[[Northumberland Cricket League ]]]In 2011 Officials Gillian Woodley and Sarah Lee have become the first two women to take charge of a match in one of the North’s top leagues. Gillian is a fully qualified umpire having attained her Level Two qualification last year. Sarah previously scored for Blyth Second XI and this is her second season umpiring, after passing her Level One from the English Cricket Board’s Association of Cricket Officials.Gillian, from Gosforth, Newcastle, said: “I admit I once hated the sport but I was becoming a cricket widow because my husband loves it. I had to grow to like it just to see him at weekends.   I started as a scorer and got hooked so I decided to get my qualifications at the same time as Peter. It’s a fascinating sport and I love it now. I think I’ve gained respect from the men players.  It was difficult at first when I did my first matches four years ago because I think some men found it hard to accept decisions from a woman.  But I think now I’ve shown I can do it and it’s something I very much enjoy.  It would be lovely to see more women doing it. There’s a great team spirit among the umpires, but it’s always nice to see a few women walking out there.”Sarah, from Blyth, Northumberland, is studying A-levels at Newcastle College but spends her weekends at cricket matches across the county.  She first attended a cricket match aged just three months with her dad, a keen player.(Case study used from the local paper – the Chronicle live) 3.3              Capital Investment into FacilitiesThrough the last Sport England funding period the ECB have targeted women’s and girls’ participation through capital investment – identifying where access to facilities are barriers and require investment to increase participation. Over the 4 year period the ECB invested £5.4m to specifically support women and girls cricket. This totalled 57 awards across approximately 26 projects with the majority of these going to our recreational clubs. Supporting this capital investment, first class counties and clubs ensured revenue funding was aligned to support growth in women’s cricket. Initial statistics have seen increases in participation across the awards with a 72% increase amongst 5 – 15 year olds and 40% increase in participation of 16 – 24 year olds. In addition to this targeted funding, other revenue and capital investment is made available to support club programmes and the wider network to support women and girls cricket and clubs within England and Wales.3.4              Protection of Local Authority and School pitchesIn order for Women and Girls’ participation to continue to grow they must have access to decent local facilities and pitches.  Over 40% of cricket is played on local authority pitches and Central Government must make sure that local leisure provision is a key criterion by which local authorities are held to account for their spending by the Department for Communities and Local Government.  As sport is not a statutory service it too often a soft option for cuts. &#xa0;ECB welcomed the enhanced protections outlined in the Government’s National Planning Policy framework but remains very concerned at the on-going threat to the infrastructure of pitches and facilities available to sports within the local authority framework which is under extreme budgetary pressures.  Playing fields are also under threat from developers on certain sites such as Civil Service grounds.&#xa0;Greater effort needs to go into provision of pitches and facilities.  Whether these are maintained by local authorities, volunteer groups or cricket clubs on-going support needs to be given to addressing the poor state of pitches and increasing quality standards.&#xa0;Recently all of the major pitch sports have jointly with Sport England, revised the planning model for local authority playing pitch strategies.  Through this model all pitch sports have committed to collaborating and working with Local Authorities on the strategic provision of sport.  Supply, demand, disposal and quality are all measured through this process.

[[[International and Elite programme development and facilities  ]]]For many years there were envious glances from all UK NGBs to the facilities and research centres and programmes in other countries. Cricket was no&#xa0;different.  Cricket Australia's centre of excellence was always seen as the benchmark in this regard. &#xa0;However, in 2003 the National Cricket Performance&#xa0;Centre at Loughborough&#xa0;University was&#xa0;opened&#xa0;by Her Majesty The Queen,&#xa0;and has&#xa0;now established itself as the leading cricket centre in the world. &#xa0;The centre employs&#xa0;25 full time staff&#xa0;and delivers world class programmes in terms of cricket and areas such as science and medicine and provides the game in England and Wales with leading edge research.  The coaching courses created and the science and medicine innovations&#xa0;permeate throughout the game and the centre itself is used by a wide range of teams from grassroots school levels to the England elite squads.&#xa0;  Indeed the Elite Coach development Programme is recognised as the foremost cricket coach education programme in the world.  It has also provided an elite coaching benchmark which other UK sports have sought to follow by seeking advice directly from the ECB.&#xa0;All England Women’s Cricket Pathway programmes (players and staff) benefit from this world-leading resource: from the England Women’s Development Programme U15 through to the full England Women’s Programme.  All winter training camps ate staged at the National Cricket Performance Centre with matches also staged at Loughborough during the season.&#xa0;Each County Cricket Board delivers an Emerging Players Programme (EPP) to support players who Counties believe have talent and potential at ages 13 – 16 in preparation for potential future academy programmes and elite England programmes. There are currently over 150 girls in EPP programmes across the country, and some counties now run specific EPP programmes for their talented females. &#xa0;First Class County Academies are completely supportive with more Academies now offering places to females who are identified as talented through ECB’s England Women’s Development Programme (EWDP) –many of the current England team and England Women’s Academy players have benefitted from time spent on County Academies, Universities and MCCYA – girls into these programmes. &#xa0;4.1              Sustained success on the International StageThe England Women Squad has secured unprecedented success on the international stage in recent years culminating in being ranked the world number one ODI team from 2009 to 2013 and regaining the Ashes with a resounding victory against Australia, the new world champions, in August 2013.This success comes as a result of the full integration of elite women’s cricket into the England Cricket Department at ECB. This integration has yielded more of the support services needed to perform at a world class level – specialist coaching, medical screening, bespoke strength and conditioning programmes and access to the very best facilities.The England Women’s squad players are now semi-professional and benefit from membership of the PCA – the Professional Cricketers’ Association. The England Women’s team play their internationals at some of the finest grounds in the country.&#xa0; The 2013 Ashes matches were played in all corners of the country including Lord’s Cricket Ground, Ageas Bowl (Southampton), ICG Emirates Durham, Chelmsford, and Hove.&#xa0; &#xa0;Whilst the majority of women’s internationals are staged at First Class County grounds, ECB also takes international women’s cricket to out-grounds and to festivals such as Truro CC (Cornish Festival of Cricket 2012) and Louth CC, Lincolnshire (SO Festival 2013).&#xa0; The vision here is that international women’s cricket can have a huge impact in the more remote parts of the country and in acting as a catalyst for growth in the female game.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 1 game at Lord’s, Ageas Bowl, ICG Emirates Durham, Chelmsford, Wormsley, and Louth CC;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 2 games at Hove;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 3 at Loughborough University.&#xa0;&#xa0;In total, 38,621 watched a Women’s Ashes match this summer (20,500 of which were at ‘double headers’ before the England men played Australia).&#xa0;&#xa0;Attendance: 6,300 across the 4 days (peak of 2,500 on Day 1).Prices £1-15

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2              ICC framework for promoting Women’s Cricket              The ICC Females in Cricket Strategy (which sits within ICC’s Strategic Plan) has set a target of a minimum of 1 million women participants across the world by the end of 2015.  The current estimate suggests there are some 650,000 players around the world.&#xa0;The ECB were lead proponents of the decision taken by the ICC that the World Twenty20 tournaments in 2009, 2010 &amp; 2012 were to be joint men’s and women’s events - generating increased profile and exposure for the women’s game around the world. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3              Targeting Sustained Success &#xa0;ECB has set itself the target of developing the world’s best players to win the ICC World Twenty20 in 2014, 2016 and 2018 and the ICC Women’s World Cup in England in 2017.  One of our key ambitions is to for the England Women’s Academy to develop an effective supply of players capable of performing for England from 2014 and at world’s best level from 2018.&#xa0;The England Women’s Development Programme U19 is designed to develop an effective supply of players to the England Women’s Academy from 2014 capable of performing for England from 2017 and at world’s best level from 2021. Both the England Women’s Development Programmes at U19 and U15 level and the inaugural England Women’s U19 overseas tour (South Africa) is to become an annual event.&#xa0;Underpinning this development the ECB in partnership with Sport England invest into the further development of a robust Talent ID system to detect the country’s highest potential players from within Counties.  There is a mentoring Programme implemented for England Women’s Academy to be rolled out with all England Women’s Development Programme U19 players from 2014 alongside the implementation of regional skills based coaching sessions delivered by Lead Specialist Coaches for all England Women’s Cricket Pathway fast bowlers, spin bowlers, wicket-keepers and batters.&#xa0;One of the most challenging areas in trying to develop and grow women’s cricket is securing an increased media profile to help drive public interest and commercial success.There is still a long way to go and the reality is that women’s cricket is still subsidised from revenues generated by the men’s international game and requires cross promotional support and subsidy in the commercial field and targeted public sector investment. ECB’s commercial strategy is to centralise all England team sponsorships – meaning all England teams (Men, Women, Lions, development sides, Disabilities) share the same Team Sponsor.  From 2014, Waitrose will be the main Team Sponsor with kit provided by adidas.  From a perception point of view it is important for the women’s team to have an association with these premium, well-known brands as it helps reiterate and promote the professionalism of the game.However, whilst our current view is that the teams should share the Team Sponsor, the ECB will longer-term continue to explore additional standalone commercial deals for the women’s team – and has employed a new business manager devoted specifically to targeting these opportunities. This summer, the ECB secured its first “stand-alone” sponsorship for the Women’s team - Kia Motors came on board for the Women’s Ashes Series providing the team with cars for the duration of the Series.  Whilst the deal did not have any significant financial benefit for the team nor organisation, it shows that there is an appetite from brands to be associated with successful women’s sports teams –albeit on a much smaller scale.  For comparison, Jaguar – the men’s team car supplier – provides cars in addition to £300k in sponsorship monies.England Women tend to play a mixture of One Day Internationals (ODIs; 50 overs) and Twenty20 matches (it is only in the Women’s Ashes Series where they also compete in one four-day Test match). In previous years, these formats have been sponsored by NatWest – as they also sponsored the men’s ODIs and T20s.  From 2014, NatWest will become the title sponsor of all T20 cricket (men’s, women’s and grassroots). The ECB is currently sourcing a new sponsor for the ODI format, who we envisage will become the game-wide sponsor of the one-day format, including Women’s ODIs.We are also optimistic that the ICC Women’s Committee will create a bi-lateral programme amongst the top 8 teams over the next 3 years to enable us to market international women's cricket with a longer lead time and therefore give the ECB Commercial team more to work with and much stronger assets to sell. &#xa0; For comparison in the cricket world, Cricket Australia adopt a similar strategy by ‘bolting-on’ women’s sponsorships onto the men’s team packages. CA have not been able to secure any stand-alone sponsorships for the women’s team. &#xa0;The one major difference between ECB and CA is their choice of branding and communications strategy for the Women’s team - the Australia Women’s team is branded as the ‘Southern Stars’ and have their own social media channels.  For reference, Southern Stars twitter feed has 8,700 followers compared to the CA’s overall following of 223,200. &#xa0; Whilst the ECB is exploring separating its digital media channels for each team or competition, our current view is that sending women’s messages to our entire database (circa 1.5m across all channels) does more to boost the profile of women’s cricket/ the England team, than sending to a smaller, targeted audience as CA choose to do.  Both approaches have their merits and we keep this area under close review in order maximise our reach.The profile of women’s cricket will only grow through sustained, mass media interest leading to increased spectator following and commercial income. Securing mass media coverage remains a challenge, but the ECB notes and welcomes the further progress made by broadcasters and the media since the London Olympics. Sky’s viewing figures of the recent Women’s Ashes were the best ever for international women’s cricket in this country and Sky described 2013 as “a breakthrough summer for women’s cricket”.The ECB itself continues to heavily invest in marketing activity to help profile the Women’s team and fixtures as highlighted in case study 5.The ECB provides rights-free imagery to media for every match (through Getty), and after every day’s play and training session - a player is put up for media interviews. If media cannot attend these sessions, ECB records interviews and sends to them via our Audioboo site.  In addition, video highlights of every women’s international – regardless of whether it’s televised or not – are posted on the ECB’s digital platforms.In addition to this ‘business as usual’ activity, ECB arranged 4 ‘life-style’ photo-shoots to present the team in a different light – one as part of a promotional shoot for suit maker TM Lewin, one taken at Wormsley Cricket Ground (before the Women’s Ashes Test), one at Brighton sea-front (before the NatWest ODI at Hove), and another beneath the Angel of the North – with the Women’s Ashes Series trophy in shot.During ECB promotional activity for the grassroots game – a women’s player is always offered up to media alongside a men’s player. For example, in April 2013 Charlotte Edwards joined Alastair Cook at Harrow Town CC to promote NatWest CricketForce – a nationwide initiative where 2,000 clubs hold an event to prepare their ground for the season ahead.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1              Media partnershipsThe ECB’s two major broadcast partners – Sky Sports and BBC Radio – are committed supporters of the women’s game, and their increased coverage reflects the increasing interest in women’s cricket. Sky Sports began broadcasting women’s cricket seventeen years ago (June 1996 v New Zealand), and aired four of the seven Women’s Ashes Series matches live this summer.  Sky have aired the majority of England women’s home T20 matches live during the past 5 years, including the team winning the ICC Women’s World Cup and World Twenty20 in 2009. Sky routinely undertake player interviews and broadcast promotional events on Sky Sports News and Cricket AM, as well as background pieces featuring key players during the intervals of men’s internationals. BBC Radio covered the first ever England Women’s T20 match at Hove in 2004, and have reported on every Women’s World Cup.  Earlier this year, for the first time they broadcast all of England’s games in a World Cup – as well as sending a network TV crew and a reporter for BBC Online to India the host country.  BBC Radio also covered the Women’s Ashes in 2005 and 2009, and this summer carried ball-by-ball commentary on all seven Women’s Ashes Series matches.On a smaller scale, The Times is the ECB’s Official Newspaper partner, and the ECB promoted the Women’s Ashes Series with a ticket promotion in-paper and online a few months prior to the matches – giving away 100 tickets for three games, helping to raise awareness of the Ashes Series. National newspapers continue to support the women’s game, but like other sports no doubt share our frustration, space given is minimal. Coverage for Women’s cricket peaks during Ashes matches and World Cups. The Women’s Ashes Series format was announced on 13 May, and since then 11 matches have been played (four against Pakistan, and seven against Australia). These matches generated 86 items of national print coverage – reaching a total audience of 44.1 million.The ECB looks toward Government to place greater focus on public service broadcasters to cover women and girls sport within their schedules, including magazine and coaching programmes, as part of their broadcast licence arrangements. Additional pressure on Sports Editors would also be welcomed.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The ECB approach, as documented in this submission, is to create a fully accessible sport at every level of the game to ensure that we continue to grow the sport and make the right interventions to remove as many of the barriers to playing as possible.There are many well documented reasons for a drop out in sport - physical, environmental and social factors all can play their part to greater or lesser extent and the ECB is keen to understand more and to make sure our programmes adapt and meet the needs and requirements of those women and girls wanting to participate in the sport. In reality it is the same barriers that prevent women playing as men. One of the key interventions a National Governing Body (NGB), such as the ECB, can make is to promote physical literacy at an early age, as part of a young person’s personal and emotional development and then in time provide the right opportunities to play competitively. It can provide teachers with the necessary training and coaching support to help young people begin to develop a habit for life. In our view it is vital that this development process is driven within the school system, to allow sports such as cricket to create a development journey from childhood to adulthood with different opportunities to play to meet the demand.As outlined, the ECB through its partnerships has well established programmes at primary school level such Asda Kwik Cricket which has a huge reach offering both mixed and programmes focused specifically on girls. Since receiving a major National Lottery investment from Sport England in April 2013, the Cricket Foundation is also embarking on a change in the way they work and a shift in priority to secondary schools.  Through Chance to Shine, they have begun creating strong links between community sports clubs and schools with the help of County Cricket Board. Local cricket clubs are enabled to work closely with coaches, young people and teachers to set up a satellite cricket club on school sites; making it easier for young people to make the transition to clubs in the community. It has already recently reached the milestone of its 500th school-based or ‘satellite’ cricket club.  Pupils are at the heart of the decision-making and influence how their school club is run.  Activity at the clubs range from extra-curricular coaching and forums to discussions on club activity, organising social events and ambassador visits.  The aim of the scheme is two-fold: first, to help reduce the number of children leaving the game when they move from primary to secondary school and, second, to contribute to a lower drop-off rate in sport among teenagers, especially in the 14 to 16 year age group.  Over the next three years Chance to Shine will look to work with 1250 secondary schools to establish Satellite Clubs to improve the transition from school to community cricket.To gain a greater understanding of participation across all ages, the ECB has recently commissioned a significant research project called Eureka! that seeks to give specific insight from current, lapsed and non-players.  This will be used nationally and locally to better inform planning and programme design for women and girls. Early indications suggest that young people will continue to play more cricket with better signposting of opportunities at local clubs and teams with proactive contact in schools to establish these links.  This places more focus on expanding our school club links going forward.There is significant potential to grow even further the game for women over the age of 14 and will be looking to provide a different range of options based on this insight and in both cricket clubs and a range of different environments. &#xa0;ECB has also recently established a dedicated programme to work with further and higher education institutions to ensure that the drop off rate after leaving school is reduced and is working in partnership to deliver new programmes such as Last Man Stands.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Since taking over the Women’s game, the ECB, along with its key partners, has transformed women’s and girls’ cricket at every level of the game.  Women’s cricket is now fully integrated within our structures from international level to our development programmes, and has become an integral part of the cricket family within the ECB’s Cricket Partnerships and England Cricket Department.The international team has access to the best facilities and we promote their outstanding success through every means possible.  There has been a huge level of investment into the development of the women’s game that has helped rebuild cricket in schools, grow a thriving community club network and to ensure we continue to develop the pathway to elite success. We cannot be complacent as there are many challenges facing us as we continue to grow and develop the game and we are continually exploring new ways getting more people to play cricket and make sure that once they do, they continue to play the game for life.  On a wider level the Government has its part to play working in partnership to ensure school sport is co-ordinated, protect our local facilities, encourage media promotion and continue its vital investment into sport. Our ambition is clear, we want women’s cricket to build on its outstanding success, deliver best practice in all areas of the game and inspire the nation to choose cricket. &#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
