[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LONDON CHALLENGE[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The NUT believes that the London Challenge provides an example of a sustainable 
[normal]approach to 
[normal]school improvement 
[normal]that has resulted in the capital’s schools, one suffering a poor reputation, being highly regarded and a model for others. The NUT 
[normal]has 
[normal]set out 
[normal]its case in its 
[normal]evidence to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Education Committee Inquiry into ‘School Partnerships and Cooperation
[normal]. 
[normal]A summary of the record of the challenge by the DfE Evaluation Report’s lead author is also available on the NUT website.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]London Challenge was not only
[normal] highly successful; it was also, unlike the academies programme, extremely cost effective. O
[normal]ver three years the funding for City Challenge was £160 million, considerably cheaper than the £8.5 billion reportedly spent on the academies programme over two yea
[normal]rs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ignoring cost-effective school improvement options and promoting costly and contentious one
[normal]s
[normal] should not be countenanced by Ministers at a time when budgets are under pressure.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]FREE SCHOOLS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The NUT believes that the process for approving and 
[normal]establishing free schools lacks transparency, ignores the evidence on the need for new school places locally and fails to take account of the impact of free schools on neighbouring schools.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NUT’s 
[normal]evidence to support this view are set out 
[normal]its recently 
[normal]published document, ’Free Schools, Free for All’
[normal] which is available 
[normal]on the NUT’s website.
