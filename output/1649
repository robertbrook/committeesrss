[normal]Carbon capture and storage by photosynthesis and [bold]thermochemical conversion[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In the remainder of this submission we discuss one such technology, biochar,  to illustrate the principles.
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] + H
[normal]2
[normal]O + sunlight → O
[normal]2
[normal] + 
[normal](
[normal]HCOH
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]That is, u
[normal]sing sunlight energy and releasing oxygen
[normal], p
[normal]lant
[normal]s
[normal] combine water and 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]to form 
[normal]sugars and 
[normal]large structural molecules
[normal] (HCOH representing one link in a long
[normal]-chain polymer such as cellulose
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]  Respiration by animals and microbes (including bacteria and fungi) reverse
[normal]s
[normal] this process.
[normal]  
[normal]These annual natural flows of 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] to and from the atmosphere are 
[normal]very 
[normal]large compared to anthropogenic emissions but photosynthetic fixation and respiration are nearly in balance.  
[normal]Preventing
[normal] the re-oxidation of 
[normal]some of 
[normal]the carbon temporarily fixed by photosynthes
[normal]is, could 
[normal]shift the balance towards sequestration
[normal].
[normal]This chemical transformation of pla
[normal]nt material by the action of heat, py
[normal]rolysis
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]can be
[normal] 
[normal]deployed
[normal] 
[normal]on a large scale 
[normal]to convert 
[normal]agricultural residues 
[normal]and other biomass wastes 
[normal]that are presently 
[normal]not 
[normal]used, or used
[normal] only
[normal] inefficiently.  Even if confined to this subset of plant materials, the process could
[normal] potentially
[normal] increase net withdrawal of atmospheric 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal], by about 3.7 billion (3,700,000,000) tonnes annually, or
[normal] 
[normal]1/8 
[normal]th
[normal] of current 
[normal]global 
[normal]anthropogenic emissions
[normal].
[normal]  This
[normal] 
[normal]corresponds
[normal] to 1 Gt (1 billion tonnes) of carbon.
[normal]The carbon content of a 
[normal]bio
[normal]char can be determined reliably and cheaply by chemical analysis.
[normal] 
[normal]Recently
[normal] techniques have been developed to assess
[normal],
[normal] with growing confidence
[normal],
[normal] the resistance of 
[normal]bio
[normal]chars to biological and 
[normal]non
[normal]-biological oxidation
[normal], so that they can act as a stable
[normal] 
[normal]store of carbon for periods 
[normal]far 
[normal]greater than 100 years
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Combining these techniques permits the quantity of carbon stored
[normal] permanently by a project or on-going business
[normal] 
[normal]to be
[normal] measured.
[normal]New businesses
[normal] might emerge
[normal], specialising in the selection and sourcing of CRS
[normal] units for onward sale to fuel suppliers.
[normal]The i
[normal]mposition
[normal] of post-emission CCS obligations on primary suppliers of petroleum-derived transport fuels would 
[normal]modify
[normal] the working of the carbon markets.  Those with C
[normal]R
[normal]S obligations would only be 
[normal]allowed
[normal] to purchase certain 
[normal]products within the carbon markets to meet their responsibilities.  Other market participants – those needing to buy units to stay within their cap
[normal] – could buy existing emission permits
[normal],
[normal] or the new C
[normal]R
[normal]S units.   Th
[normal]is might raise demand 
[normal]for the CR
[normal]S units above that needed to 
[normal]retract
[normal] emissions from mobile sources, but only if
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The CRS units were cheaper than
[normal] the surplus emission permits; or
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The CRS units were sought preferentially by companies to burnish their environmental credentials.
[normal]The
[normal] first is unlikely until governments tighten the emission
[normal]s
[normal] caps significantly.  The second applies to some ex
[normal]tent already because 
[normal]Bioc
[normal]har-CR
[normal]S units are traded in the 
[normal]voluntary carbon markets 
[normal]in 
[normal]small
[normal] volumes.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e anticipate that larger
[normal],
[normal] more liquid markets 
[normal]would be highly competitive.  
[normal]A second supposition – that the fuel supplier 
[normal]would
[normal] be
[normal] 
[normal]liable 
[normal]for the full cost of producing the biochar – is only worth investigating if biochar
[normal] proved to be the cheapest of the
[normal] ‘negative energy’ technologies competing in the carbon markets
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Biochar producers can draw on several income streams
[normal] in addition to 
[normal]the
[normal] carbon-credit price. 
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]is presently difficult to make a representative estimate
[normal] 
[normal]of biochar’s 
[normal]value as a soil improver 
[normal]because it depends strongly on
[normal] 
[normal]soil characteristics
[normal] and constraints
[normal] and crop
[normal] types and
[normal] values
[normal].  The 
[normal]other 
[normal]pyrolysis 
[normal]products, a
[normal] combustible gas stream or a liquid fuel, may be sold for electricity generation or space heating.
[normal]  It i
[normal]s highly unlikely that the income from carbon credits, even in a functioning carbon market with an effective 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] price, will drive a bio
[normal]char industry
[normal], but rather that the costs will be borne by several income streams depending on the installation
[normal].  
[normal]The ful
[normal]l cost of making bioc
[normal]har cannot be confidently 
[normal]specified
[normal] at present because the industry is in its infancy
[normal], but an estimate of £160 per tonne has been suggested for production from some sources in the UK.  That cost would add 10.7p to the price of gasoline
[normal] per l
[normal]itre
[normal], but we stress we consider this case to be remote and unlikely.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Once incorporated into soil the material is effectively immobilised.  In some situations a fraction of the small char particles may be transported by water. Those particles will be deposited somewhere, often in deep-s
[normal]ea sediment.  These natural processes occur already.  Forest fires have put char pieces and particles onto and into the world’s soils for the past 500 million years.
[normal]Production of biochar needs to be done in properly-designed kilns that avoid the release o
[normal]f gaseous pollutants.  Registration of schemes for market access
[normal] offers a means of control.
[normal]The IBI and other organisations have drawn up and published quality standards for biochar that specify maximum safe limits for potential soil contaminants such as h
[normal]eavy metals, polycyclic aromatics and dioxins.
[normal]Biochar is s
[normal]howing promise as a component of horticultural growing media that 
[normal]could substantially reduce
[normal] the damaging extraction of peat
[normal] from environmentally-sensitive areas.
[normal]  There is a large market for such products in the UK.
[normal]Biochar may be effective as a delivery 
[normal]medium for chemical fertilizers and as a means of controlling the rate of release of nutrients to crops.
