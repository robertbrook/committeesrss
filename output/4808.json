These are derived from clothes, hygiene products and nappies. \n&#xa0;\nMicro-plastics are not therefore necessarily derived from plastic bags \nn\nor even from packaging of all types\n- which normally use polyethylene and polypropylene.  Nor have they\n been \nshown \nto absorb toxins to any greater extent than other particles in the \nsea\n.\n&#xa0;\nOxo-biodegradable plastics do not contribute to pollution - on the contrary, they are bioassimilated into the bio-background.  This is because the material descends to \nlow molecular-\nweight materials much more quickly than normal plastic.  At that sta\nge they are no longer plastics and have become biodegradable in the same way as a leaf\n or seaweed\n. They do not therefore float around in the sea for decades absorbing other materials.\n&#xa0;\nFor degradation in the marine environment see report dated 16.8.12 from\n Station d'Essais de Viellissement Naturel de \nBandol\n, available at\n \nhttp://www.biodeg.org/files/uploaded/Bandol%2016.8.12.pdf\n&#xa0;\nO\nxo-biodegradable plastics are not intended to deal with\n litter in \nhomes and \noffices.  They are designed to biodegrade in the open environment when exposed to natural phenomena such as wind, rain, sunlight, etc and to do so in a synergistic relationship to micro-organisms naturally occurring in the open environ\nment.\n&#xa0;\nThe theory of absorption of toxins by micro-plastics is still a theory. At the University of Washington Tacoma seminar (Autumn 2008)\n Prof. Thompson was reported as using the language of opinion rather than fact;-\n“Thompson’s research and various st\nudies have \nsuggested\n that plastic specks in the water column and sediment \nappear\n to absorb highly toxic and pervasive pollutants, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and pesticides such as DDT (once commonly used to eradicate agricultural and forest p\nests, and now banned in the United States and other countries). As one \ntheory\n goes, if the oceans’ smallest organisms are dining on plastics dosed up with toxins, then highly concentrated chemicals \ncould possibly\n accumulate up the food chain.”\nDiscussion1-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) had been widely used globally up until the early 1970’s as additives in many product groups such as plastics, lubricating oils, greases and electrical installations. Their properties of low conductivity, high heat resistance\n and chemical stability has meant that they had been known to persist in the environment, but they have now been banned in many countries. One reason for the ban was the persistence of such toxins in the sea surface micro layer of the marine environment. \n&#xa0;\n2-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following\n summary review demonstrates that it is highly improbable for oxo-\nbio\ndegradable plastic materials to adsorb and accumulate these toxins in the marine environment. \nReview3-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSeveral studies have been \ndone\n, including those by Pascall \net al,\n Takad\na \net al\n, Mato \net al\n and Teuten \net al\n, which demonstrate that \nconventional \npolymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene will readily adsorb PCB and other toxins. \nThis is because the polymers are inherently non-\npolar and hydrophobic in nature, \nand\n with a \nlow Tg (glass transition temperature), their rubbery nature allows for greater segmental mobility, pore-size, free volume, diffusion and partition coefficients. This means that hydrophobic organic toxins such as PCB \ncan\n \nin theory \nadsorb to the polymers (th\nrough Van Der Waals attractive forces) from the aqueous environment. \n&#xa0;\n4-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe increased pore-size and free volume also means that \nif\n the toxin is adsorbed to the polymer, it will not readily desorb, \nand \nthus over \nlong \nperiods of time the polymer will  break\n \nd\nown by shear, friction and weathering, \nand\n \nthe \npotential for the plastic material to adsorb \ntoxins is present\n. Takada \net al\n demonstrated that in\n a field experiment in Tokyo Bay \nconventional \nplastic fragments collected from the bay had \nadsorbed up to 892 \nng\n/g. This \nsuggest\ned\n that t\nhe plastic had persisted in that\n area for at least \ntwenty-\nseven years (assuming a linear uptake profile).\n&#xa0;\n5-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPascall\n et al included polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene in their study. The results from their field experiments demonstrated a significantly lower adsorption uptake of PCB toxin. The difference in chemical structure resulting in differing polarity of the polym\ner, more rigid packing (demonstrated by higher Tg) resulting in restricted segmental mobility, and restricted pore size explains the reduced adsorption observed.\n&#xa0;\n6-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis information helps to build a picture of what would be expected for oxo-\nbio\ndegradable pol\nymer materials. Under the action of oxygen, UV light, and \nmoderate \nheat, polyethylene and polypropylene containing oxo-\nbio\ndegradable additives will change their \nmolecular structure \nand break down by a mechanism analogous to that shown in Figure 1.\nFigure\n 1, Chiellini, 2\nnd\n CEEES Workshop (2005)\n \nConfederation of European Environmen\ntal Engineering Societies\n&#xa0;\n7-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFigure 1 demonstrates how hydroperoxy intermediates are readily formed in the initial phase of degradation, \nand \nimmediately there is a change in chemica\nl structure and increase in polarity. The formation of these oxygenated species already makes the polymer \nless attractive to adsorption of\n PCB and related hydrophobic toxins. Lower diffusion and partition coefficients result from increased cohesive forces,\n reducing segmental mobility and pore-size. The highly polar functional groups that are formed\n will not interact with the non-\npolar toxins either through chemical reaction or intermolecular interaction.\n&#xa0;\n8-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second stage of degradation is the molecular-wei\nght reduction of the hydroperoxy intermediates (with the vicinal form proceeding more rap\nidly) to \n&#xa0;\n9-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nintermediate and short-\nchain aldehydes, ketones, esters, and hydroxyl and hydrocarbon radicals. These will proceed further to carboxylic acids which will be\n readily bioassimilated by \nmicro-\norganisms. \n&#xa0;\n10-\n \nIn summary the constantly \nprogressing\n chemical breakdown of the polymer results in species with increased hydrophilic character that will readily solubilise and emulsify in the ocean environment. It would, ther\nefore, not be possible for hydrophobic toxins such as PCB to accumulate on oxo-degradable plastic materials\nConclusion&#xa0;11-\n \nIt is \nsometimes suggested \nthat plastic materials, in particular polyethylene and polypropylene, will adsorb and accumulate hydrophobic toxins that can be found in the sea surface micro layer. \nHowever i\nn this \nreview \nit has been \n&#xa0;\n12-\n \nshown\n that such plastics when treated with additives \nsuch as d\n2\nw will change their chemical and physical properties during degradation and that hydrophobic toxins will not be readily \nad\nsorbed. \n&#xa0;\n13-\n \nThere is, therefore, no reason why oxo-\nbio\ndegradable plastic materials would provide a route for hydrophobic toxin\n accumulation and the potential to harm marine life\n-\nforms, or provide an entry route for these chemicals into the human food chain. No experimental evidence has been published that links oxo-\nbio\ndegradable plastic materials with the accumulation of persiste\nnt hydrophobic toxins in the \noceans.\n&#xa0;\n14-\n \nOxo-biodegradable plastics can therefore play a useful role in reducing plastic pollution of the oceans. Indeed if all the plastic had been made with oxo-biodegradable technology there would be no ocean garbage patches\n.\nWork referenced in the Discussion&#xa0;Uptake of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) from an Aqueous Medium by Polyethylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polystyrene Films.  MELVIN A.

The fragments found in the oceans, an\nd those found to have been ingested by birds and fish are fragments of ordinary plastic.\n&#xa0;\nOxo-biodegradable plastic does NOT contain heavy metals.  It is designed so that it will NOT degrade in anaerobic conditions and will NOT therefore generate methane.\n&#xa0;\nThere is no justification for the claim that ox\no-biodegradable plastics should \nbe phased out of the market or banned outright, as soon as possible before 2020 or at all.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYours sincerely,\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMICHAEL STEPHEN\nChairman\n&#xa0;\n6 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Professor Gerald Scott, DSc, FRSC, C.Chem, FIMMM , Professor Emeritus in Chemistry and Polymer Science of Aston University, UK; Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Oxo\n-biodegradable Plastics Association; Chairman of the British Standards Institute Panel on Biodegradability of Plastics.\n \nLusher, A.L., et al.
