"&#xa0;\nBNI0008&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Alan Ritchie&#xa0;\nThe views presented here are entirely my own. They are informed by over 30 years\n \nexperience in a NI based bank, an element of academic challenge and a long term interest in current affairs,\n b\nusiness &amp; \nbanking.\n \n&#xa0;\nFrom the late 1980’s to 2000 when I retired I worked on a number of projects including what became Post Office Financial Services, the joint venture between Bank of Ireland and Post Office. As part of the work-based element of\n \nOpen Unive\nrsity\n \nMBA I also documented several other change initiatives which I was involved in.\n \n&#xa0;\nMy starting point is that \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorthern Ireland is not a discrete nor self\n-\n contained marketplace,\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\ninancial institutions do not require a physical presence in NI to service either personal or business/corporate customers. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe essentially personal/ micro-small business nature of the marketplace is not attractive to ‘challenger’ banks -Barclays came to N\nI when it re-branded Woolwich Building Society, my recollection is that HSBC similarly re-branded another existing group business.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOf the 4 major high street banks currently operating in NI 3 -Allied Irish/First Trust, Bank of Ireland &amp; Ulster Bank are eff\nectively zombies and the 4\nth\n a poorly performing subsidiary of a Danish bank\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe future structure &amp; governance of banking in NI will be\n largely \ndictated by the outworking of EC/EU State Aids programmes, not solely by bank management or national politicians\n.\n Local politicians will struggle to find effective voices.\n&#xa0;\nThe structure &amp; governance of banks in Northern Ireland&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe four major high street banks operating in NI all are owned externally. \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal management\n has limited discretion and is more likely to be involved in administering Group /Corporate policy set in Dublin, Copenhagen or London/Edinburgh. \n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCore policy making such as Group Credit Risk management/ IT infrastructure / capital allocation across busine\nss units/ customer segmentation &amp; marketing\n \npolicies \nare all in effect set outside NI\n.\n \n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThree of the four\n high street banks \nare subject to EC/EU State Aid restructuring programmes restricting \nor constraining their freedom of action at \npolicy making\n level\n.\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough Santander for example has a high street presence its NI business customers will have their accounts handled by business banking centres in Glasgow or Newport or London in exactly the same way as any other customer anywhere in the UK and su\nbject to exactly the same terms &amp; conditions, charges eligibility &amp; lending criteria. \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe major issue in NI banking is that, bar the Progressive Building Society, there are no locally headquartered \nfinancial services business and therefore no local contro\nl of policy.\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NI banking market has traditionally operated on the basis of cross-border / all-Ireland structures. \n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis model is \nnow \neffectively dead \nlargely\n for reasons of politics &amp;\n economic nationalism arising out of the need for EU/ECB funding to rescue both the Irish banks &amp; state. \n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis situation arose out of a failure of regulation leading Irish banks to over-extend themselves \nboth \ndomestically &amp; externally.\n10)\n&#xa0; \nThis mistake will no\nt be repeated, \npolitical and public opinion will not tolerate \nregulators in ROI\n allowing the\n major \ntax-payer rescued \n‘pillar’ banks allocating scare capital to support business in \noutside the state\n a\nt the expense of business &amp; individuals within the state.\n11)\n&#xa0; \nThere will \nalso be political, business public &amp; social pressure on ROI banks to focus on their domestic market and support local economic growth and development. This is not a narrow political point. In the UK we see the mirror image of this in the withdr\nawal of RBS/Lloyds for example from overseas markets and market segments nationally &amp; internationally.\n12)\n&#xa0; \nWe must also recognize the different political &amp; legislative trajectories within &amp; between the UK &amp; Ireland and specifically issues arising from \nregulatory developments within the Eurozone sub-set of countries within the EU and the UK focus on re-negotiations/ opt-outs/ subsidiarity etc.\n13)\n&#xa0; \nThe practical consequences for NI are likely to be concentration\n of banking in fewer players, l\ness choice, less \ncompetition and higher costs. \n&#xa0;\nThe possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank.&#xa0;14)\n&#xa0; \nResolution of this issue is not solely or even substantially in the hands of RBS management nor UK politicians - \nsomething which seems almost entirely missing from much public debate! \n15)\n&#xa0; \nYou should note that the EC has recently allowed Bank of Ireland to retain an insurance operation in Republic of Ireland which it had previously decided should be disposed of as a cond\nition of State Aid. The EC rationale for this was that there were no realistic buyers for the business in the market.\n16)\n&#xa0; \nThe quid pro quo is that BOI must shed its corporate &amp; business banking activities in GB either through run-down or by sale\n \nalthough it i\ns able to\n \nretain\n \nthose in NI.\n \nThe NI businesses are now exposed in that there will be loss of scope &amp; scale in service provision.\n17)\n&#xa0; \nIt should also be noted that the BoI is now focusing on serving \npersonal business only \nin GB through Post Office Financial \nServices (POFS)\n \ndelivered through PO branches &amp; supported by centralised deposit &amp; lending administration and on-line banking\n \n18)\n&#xa0; \nThe precedent has also been set &amp; the next revision of State Aid for BoI (&amp; there will almost inevitably be one) could require \nthe disposal of its NI corporate &amp; business banking. This would leave the rump of its personal business which could be serviced via POFS. \n19)\n&#xa0; \nThe bank stake in POFS is a saleable asset in the last resort &amp; is now a hostage to fortune in that disposal may be m\nandated by EC/EU. The possibility of BoI exiting NI is no longer unthinkable.\n20)\n&#xa0; \nI cannot comment on the status of Allied Irish/First Trust businesses other than to note that there were apparently no buyers when the business was put on the market a number of \nyears ago. Given that Allied Irish remains subject to EC/EU State Aids considerations then that business may also be vulnerable\n regardless of public positions taken by management.\n21)\n&#xa0; \nIn this context the price of future State Aid approvals for RBS may well be \ndisposal of at least \nthe Ulster Bank business in RoI regardless of the ‘good bank/bad bank’ arguments propounded by politicians/RBS executive management/board.\n22)\n&#xa0; \nEC rules cannot \nhowever \nprevent individual customers opting to remain with their \ncurrent bank regardless of whether or not ’their branch’ is sold. \n23)\n&#xa0; \nThe best forward-looking solution would seem to be to encourage the full absorption of the Ulster Bank NI business into RBS proper w\nhere it would benefit from the full resources of RBS unmediated by a ‘local’ headquarters.\n24)\n&#xa0; \nGiven the lack of buyers for more substantial branch networks being disposed of by\n both\n Lloyds &amp; RBS disposal \nof the Ulster Bank business in NI would not seem to be \na realistic option.\n&#xa0;\nThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation&#xa0;\n25)\n&#xa0; \nI do not know enough about this issue to comment but difficult to see as a significant forward-looking issue\n, \nunfortunate as it may be for the individuals involved. Matters would seem to revolve around employment law &amp; the basis on which Anglo Irish/IBRC operated in the UK \n&#xa0;\n4 Access to finance particularly for SME’s, 5 Lack of effectiveness of national initiatives to help aid economic recovery6 Lack of availability of detailed regional lending data&#xa0;\n26)\n&#xa0; \nI regard these issues as being intimately linked. \n27)\n&#xa0; \nMy recollection is that the NI banks were never more than ‘bit players’ in national ’trade’\n bodies such as British Bankers Association/APACs etc.\n28)\n&#xa0; \nGiven their scope &amp; scale they would tend to be policy takers rather than makers.\n29)\n&#xa0; \nFor that reason I suspect that national initiatives would receive only ‘lip service’ - the minimum necessary &amp; no more.\n Stats will show that use of for example SFLGS by NI banks was pathetic\n,\n the preference being to focus on own in-house products rather than develop the processes &amp; practices &amp; staff training\n \nnecessary to support such initiatives, \nsuch lack of support \nin t\nurn stifle\nd\n demand - a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy in a sense!\n30)\n&#xa0; \nMy understanding is that much business lending remains in effect asset backed lending\n, security over assets first then looking at profitability &amp; repayment capacity\n \n31)\n&#xa0; \nFor so long as there is a significant overhang of property, whether warehoused in \nNAMA or elsewhere, then property values will remain under pressure and represent a significant constraint on business lending. \n32)\n&#xa0; \nIn these circumstances access to national init\niatives based for example on partial Govt guarantees for otherwise unsecured \n&amp; cash-flow based \nbusiness lending will remain essential. \n33)\n&#xa0; \nThe overwhelming proportion of businesses\n \nin NI are in the micro to small category and more likely to benefit from or re\nquire cash-flow based rather than asset backed lending. Past experience of SFLGS does not offer much comfort in this respect.\n34)\n&#xa0; \nI think the point needs to be made that ‘SME’s’ are not a single market with common needs. \n35)\n&#xa0; \nMany SME’s in the micro to small categ\nory will be largely locally orientated with substantial demand for transaction handling services - cash/ cheques/card payments - which are expensive to provide and largely unprofitable for banks\n36)\n&#xa0; \nAny borrowing requirements\n \nwill be relatively small and only\n marginally profitable once all admin &amp; overhead costs are considered \n37)\n&#xa0; \nParadoxically many large businesses operating in NI will have similar profile - transaction-based needs for electronic payments of salaries &amp; wages, suppliers, &amp; receipt of payments wit\nh minimum local overnight balances with borrowings /deposits\n \nlargely managed by corporate treasury &amp; held in GB based branches\n38)\n&#xa0; \nBusinesses in the small to medium category are likely to have the more complex needs not just for transaction services but cash \nflow lending (overdrafts) and capital investment (term loans/ equity/venture capital finance, trade related financing. \n39)\n&#xa0; \nThis should /could be a profitable mix for banks but unfortunately banks have spent the last 20 years or so paying extolling the virtues\n of relationship banking whilst at the same time promoting financial promiscuity - by which I mean offering stand-alone products to non-current account holders\n.\n40)\n&#xa0; \nWhilst this promiscuity does bring competition to the market it also fractures the ‘relationshi\np’ model with no \nbank having a clear overall picture of business needs hence driving the imperative for asset based lending and even then there may be differing views as to which lender has prior claim over which assets, all of which acts to constrain lend\ning limits\n41)\n&#xa0; \nThere is no excuse for excluding lending from the proposed post code reporting. How will direct banks with no physical presence in NI report their figures? \n42)\n&#xa0; \nIf Santander/Tesco/Sainsbury /M&amp;S/First Direct/ for example all report their UK \nlending \nby post code then the ’unclassified’ stuff could be considered NI by default (I know it won’t be that simple but deduction by exception is possible!) \n43)\n&#xa0; \nRegional lending data must be made available otherwise \npublic policy making \nwill occur in a partial vacuu\nm and risks being uninformed. \n44)\n&#xa0; \nLikewise banks themselves will be acting in a vacuum, making assumptions about the potential market for financial services which may not be realistic (there are both upsides &amp; downsides to this)\n&#xa0;\nAccess to banking in rural communities&#xa0;45)\n&#xa0; \nThis is I am afraid essentially yesterday’s issue.\n46)\n&#xa0; \nBranches have been closing for years &amp; the trend - visible across the UK &amp; Europe - will continue and indeed is accelerating. I believe that recent stats based on research \nb\ny a UK university confirm this but may not show that rural communities are being anymore affected by this than deprived urban communities.\n47)\n&#xa0; \nIt needs to be recognized that t\nhe role of the branch has changed over the years, currently configured largely as ‘sa\nles outlets’ even that function is becoming redundant with much marketing/sales /account servicing being done remotely by phone /on-line or social media. Salaries &amp; wages &amp; benefits have been paid electronically for decades\n. It is stated Govt policy to enc\nourage payment into accounts – the basic bank account is an outrun of this. \nFinancial inclusion policy is about bank accounts for all not dependence on cash transactions.\n48)\n&#xa0; \nAn increasing number of transactions are by card &amp; card technology is changing almost\n by the day. No-one any more has a need to visit a branch\n49)\n&#xa0; \nRecent entrants to the NI personal financial services market - Tesco, Sainsbury &amp; M&amp; S for example- use their supermarket outlets as service points.\n50)\n&#xa0; \nThe example of the BOI /Post Office joint venture\n is relevant here with cash transactions available through Post Offices/ATM‘s etc, not branches.\n \n51)\n&#xa0; \nAll other services including accounting transaction processing, credit scoring for personal lending including mortgages, personal loans &amp; credit cards can be\n centralised &amp; handled remotely.\n52)\n&#xa0; \nEven business lending seems increasingly based on ’credit scoring’ principles.\n53)\n&#xa0; \nIt is strange to note however than in respect of investment advice ‘past performance is no guarantee of or guide to future performance’ whereas \nbehaviour based credit \nscoring relies precisely on extrapolating past performance to predict future behaviour\n54)\n&#xa0; \n‘Relationship banking’ no longer seems to require face to face contact being replaced by contact by phone/internet/social media channels - the tra\nditional branch has no future and only a limited lifespan.\n55)\n&#xa0; \nThe issue should really be about adapting to new reality rather than preserving the past.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
