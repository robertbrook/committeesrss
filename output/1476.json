"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nCommunity First (TIC 030)\n&#xa0;Wiltshire Council \nis \ncurrently consulting with local Area Boards, Community Area Partnerships Parish Councils, users and local transport providers about changes to local bus services in a an effort to meet local needs in a cost-effectiv\ne way.\nWiltshire Council \nis \nalso undertaking surveys of existing bus service use in order that changes to the bus service network can be made according to demand.\nTo mitigate against the effects of changes to local bus services, Wiltshire Council ha\ns\n also consulted with Community First (who in turn canvassed opinions form Community Transport groups) regarding the establishment of a Community Transport business growth social enterprise (established in 2012 called Accelerate) and a Community Transport d\nevelopment fund.\nLastly\n t\nhe Council \nis \nresponding\n to consultation on rail matter\ns\n undertaken in 2011/12 having submitted a successful bid to the \nDfT’s Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) to improve Wiltshire’s rail offer.\nAs part of the early development of Wiltshire Councils’ Third Local \nTransport Plan (LTP3) Wiltshire Council invited various stakeholders and other interested parties to attend one of four consultation workshops to discuss the development of the LTP3.\nWiltshire Council \nalso \nhas\n current\n links with the Wilts\nh\nire and Swindon U\nser’s Network (\na user-led organisation representing people who use health and social services locally) an\nd \ny\noung people’s transport issues via the Wiltshire Assembly of Youth\n. Wiltshire Council also undertakes regular consultations with\n&#xa0;\nlocal residents and\n service users, with many of these surveys carried out in partnership with other\n&#xa0;\nlocal public service\n&#xa0;\nbodies (see for more details: \nhttp://www.intelligencenetwork.org.uk/consultation/\n)\n&#xa0;In relation to bus services the challenges are often related to funding. As the market is de-regulated the scope for private bus operators to look beyond the sustainability of their own \noperations\n is lim\nited despite some useful initiatives\n such as Quality \nBus \nPartnerships\n and Better Bus Areas.\nThere is however a broader issue of the marketing of bus services to encourage bus use more generally. Locally bus users tend to be mainly older people and those on low incomes. If there was a \nsustained \nnational \nmarke\nting \ncampaign to promote bus \nuse \n- \nfor instance as a wise \nfinancial\n as well as environmental choice\n -\n this would make \nthe economics of bus use far easier. In \nsome other European countries\n such campaigns \nseem\n prevalent and unnecessary car use seems to becom\ning culturally less \nacceptable\n \nas a result.\nIn relation to rail services, it is vitally important that smaller stations are not disregarded by train companies in order to improve performance to larger rail hubs and that rail line electrification is conside\nred carefully in this respect. Please see \nhttp://www.pewseytrainwatch.co.uk/\n ; \nhttp://www.bedwyntrains.org.uk/\n and \nhttp://www.westburytrainwatch.org.uk/\n for more details.\nLastly in relation to rail, whilst \nWiltshire Councils’ successful bid to the DfT’s Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) to improve Wiltshire’s \nrail offer will help to provide better and more consi\nstent rail services locally, \nit\n is\n important that rail services \nresulting from this connect with bus services to \nprovide passengers with integrated journey\n options.\n&#xa0;Based on the most recent data available, there were 10.4 million passenger trips undertaken by bus in Wiltshire compared to 260,000 passenger trip\ns undertaken by Community Transport (CT) schemes in Wiltshire. \nThere are\n however over 60 CT\n schemes across Wiltshire\n but these groups are mainly fairly small in scale and scope. \n To make a real impression in addressing the needs of passengers in isolated \ncommunities (e.g. to support local CT schemes to respond to changes in local bus services) sustained support funding is needed for infrastructure organisations such as Community First.\nWhilst the DfT Supporting Community Transport (CT) funding is welcome, \nit is relatively modest and also appears to be ‘one-off.’ Sustained investment (e.g. over 5 years or so) from the Government is needed in the CT sector in order for it to grow to the level required to make a significant difference in addressing the needs o\nf passengers in isolated communities.\nL\nocal \nCT support \nfunding differences \nalso \nneed to be addressed – for instance w\nhilst Community First receives funding from Wiltshire Council to provide support to CT schemes in Wiltshire, there is no funding for this s\nupport provided by Swindon Borough Council.\nIn addition investment in simple car sharing initiatives / support for \nfacilitating \ncar sharing at the local level could have a significant impact in addressing the needs of passengers in isolated communities. Th\nere is already evidence locally of car sharing happening ‘under the radar’ but having proper investment in local car sharing could realize both accessibility \n(\nand environmental\n)\n objectives relatively straightforwardly.\n&#xa0;\nTaxis could be used as an important part of the transport mix in addressing the needs\n of passengers in isolated communities. For instance if taxis are used to provide a failsafe option as part of a car sharing scheme\n \n(e.g. through taxi vouchers or similar) then they could have a useful role to play. Similarly a web-based live portal for ta\nxi operators to use to advertise ‘dead’ journeys may also be useful in advertising journey opportunities / bring down journey costs for passengers.\nDemand responsive transport (DRT) services will only become cost effect\nive (to both commissioners and users)\n if they are widely used. This will only come about if they are marketed extremely well and the law around pre-booking these services is relaxed. \n \nOtherwise the cost of providing these services as things currently stand is likely to lead to their demise.\n&#xa0;The main challenges are related to the fact that there are fewer passengers available to be carried and often th\ney are spread over a larger geographical area than in urban areas.\nSolutions\n, however, \ndo not have to be expensive. Community Transport schemes and initiatives such as car sharing are cost effective to run and are therefore affordable for passengers. More \ninvestment in these services\n and the marketing of them\n is therefore needed.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
