[normal]the [bold]Home[bold] Office[bold] [CT 0[bold]4[bold]e[bold]][bold]Letter from [bold]Charles Farr[bold], [bold]Director General, [bold]Office for Security and Counter Terrorism[bold], to the Chair of the Committee, [bold]6 January 2014[bold]CONTEST[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Thank you for your letter of 29 November asking the following further questions following my appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 12 November. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Two years on from the 2011 review of CONTEST, are you satisfied that the planning assumptions upon which the strategy is based are still relevant? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. I am satisfied that our planning assumptions in 2011 continue to be relevant. They do not mention Syria specifically though they do refer to the likely increase in activity by Al Qaida affiliates and their exploitation of instability in the Middle East. Syria of course reflects these broad trends. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria still the priority countries for our counter-terrorism work overseas? What about Syria? What is the risk regarding the conflict in Syria? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria remain priority countries for our counter-terrorism work overseas. Syria has also become a priority. We face the threat of a terrorist attack conducted against this country and our interests overseas from Syria based groups; these groups may make use of foreign fighters (including - but not only - people from this country); foreign fighters, particularly those returning to this country, may also pose a threat to us in their own right. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One assumption from the 2011 strategy is that there will continue to be isolated individuals who engage in terrorist activity in the name of extreme right or left-wing views but they will not present as high a risk as AQ. Is that still the case in light of the 
[normal]Pavlo
[normal] 
[normal]Lapshyn
[normal] case? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. We believe this assumption remains valid. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overseas Capacity Building [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]How many overseas capacity building projects are the UK involved with? Please provide us with a list of countries and a brief description of the purpose and activity of each of the projects with reference as to how they are funded i.e. fully by UK Govt or jointly between UK and EU, jointly between UK and US etc. Please give us a detailed case study of a capacity building project including its objectives and how its effectiveness would be measured. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. We do not publicly disclose the location, number or purpose of all our counter terrorist capacity building projects overseas because they very often have a counter terrorist operational purpose. UK and third country personnel working in these projects may be at risk from terrorist groups. 
[normal]6. Capacity building is coordinated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and concentrated in countries from where there is a terrorist threat to the UK or to UK 
[normal]interests. In general these projects aim to strengthen the capacity of these countries to investigate, detain, prosecute and convict terrorists in a manner which meets our human rights obligations. Programmes are mainly funded from the FCO CT Programme Fund which in 2013/14 is £30m. 
[normal]7. Many of the projects are part of the Government’s Justice and Human Rights Partnership programme, which was announced on 14 February in a speech by the Foreign Secretary. I am aware that you have written separately to the Foreign Secretary about that programme in the context of your inquiry into counter-terrorism. 
[normal]8. While you will understand that I cannot go into details of the programme, one example is the CAPRI (Counter-Terrorism Associated Prosecutorial Reform Initiative) programme in Pakistan, which aims to increase the number of terrorism convictions in Pakistan by developing an effective CT legislative framework and improving capacity within the CT criminal justice system, working with the Pakistani police, prosecutors and judiciary. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Foreign Fighters [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Would the draft EU PNR directive improve our abilities to monitor those who we suspect to be foreign fighters and, if so, what work is the UK doing to ensure that the EU PNR directive is passed by the European Parliament? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. The Justice and Home Affairs Council has made clear that tackling the issue of foreign fighters is a priority for the EU and we are working closely with our European partners and meeting frequently to discuss means of practical co-operation. The Government considers that PNR (including intra European PNR) and API can support work on foreign fighters and continues to lobby for PNR at the European Parliament. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How many UK foreign fighters in Syria are thought to have joined the al Qaeda linked groups 
[normal]Jabhat
[normal] al Nusra and ISIS? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. We believe that more than 200 UK-linked individuals have travelled to Syria to join the fighting. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To date, how many UK nationals/residents have returned to Britain after fighting in Syria? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. Many people who have been to Syria have returned to this country. I am unable to provide details in this letter. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What actions have been undertaken by government agencies to identify returning foreign fighters? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. This is an operational issue and you will understand that I am unable to provide any details. Doing so would clearly undermine our work to identify foreign fighter in future. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Has the Government developed a mechanism for assessing the risk posed by returning UK nationals who have participated in the Syrian civil war? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. As you would expect it is a routine part of the counter terrorist work of the agencies and of JTAC to identify and assess all types of terrorist threat to this country, including the threat from people who have returned to the UK after fighting in Syria. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the government's plans for dealing with returning British foreign fighters? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. You will understand why I am unable to provide specific details of all of the actions that are being taken for these purposes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Communications Data [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Has GCHQ collected communications data relating to communications between people within the UK, where such communication was routed outside the UK? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. All data collected by GCHQ is acquired and handled lawfully, in accordance with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. The Intelligence and Security Committee is briefed in detail on GCHQ’s activities and capabilities and their legal basis and I am unable to provide any further detail in this letter. As I have stated in my evidence on 12 November GCHQ has never provided and can never provide the communications data necessary to address the communications data capability gap, for which the Government has proposed legislation 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Court cases [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In the past month we have seen the collapse of prosecutions against Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed and others and against Dr 
[normal]Shajul
[normal] Islam and others due to the CPS not presenting a case. What are the barriers to presenting such cases and are you satisfied that the CPS have the capacity to prosecute trials such as these? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. The CPS decided to discontinue the prosecution against Mohamed and two other TPIM subjects for suspected tag tampers because, in their view, challenges to the forensic evidence meant there was no realistic prospect of conviction. In the case against Dr 
[normal]Shajul
[normal] Islam the prosecution was unable to call either victim to give evidence. Both of these decisions were based on the evidence available and CPS resources were not a factor. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please could you send us an update regarding the CPS work on the attempt to stay Mr Mohamed’s legal applications against the Government? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17. Mr Mohamed has two ongoing cases against the Government. The first is an appeal against his control order and TPIM notice, and the second is a civil damages claim. We continue to keep these cases under review. While his abscond is not in itself a ground to stay his litigation, Mr Mohamed is under an obligation to meet the requirements set by the court for pursuing that litigation and his lawyers may only act on his behalf as far as they have instructions. It is for the court to determine whether these requirements are met and ultimately, whether these cases should proceed. These are civil cases and are therefore not dealt with by the CPS.
