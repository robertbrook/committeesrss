defaultIs the government taking the right approach to reduce heat ene
defaultrgy demand?
default&#xa0;
defaultQualitatively - yes. Quantitatively - probably not. In terms of heat loss from buildings the rumoured relaxation of Part L of the Building Standards is unhelpful. The construction and testing of new buildings to meet the current Part L require
defaultments is not of sufficient rigour to ensure that the completed buildings meet the design heat loss levels. Insulation and draught proofing that will last the lifetime of a building are the most cost effective way of reducing a building
default'
defaults heat demand. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt 
defaultis acknowledged that there are still far too many UK households where there has been a failure to install loft and/or cavity wall insulation, and draught stripping measures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny learning from the recent Retrofit for the Future programme should be evaluat
defaulted and disseminated.  The most cost effective measures in terms of heat and carbon reduction should be rolled out as soon as possible. Significant carbon reductions were achieved in many of the properties. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe use of night storage heating should be re-ex
defaultamined. It was introduced in a different era to provide for baseload operation of nuclear stations. However, it leads to a wastage of heat, increased energy usage, and when driven by fossil fuel electricity, higher carbon emissions.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst this document 
defaultspeaks to heat demand reduction - there is minimal referenc
defaulte to waste heat elimination and
default/or recovery. Greater attention should be given to the possible use of all varieties of heat pumps to deliver waste heat recovery in industrial processes. 
defaultEncourag

defaultBiomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives.
default&#xa0;
default What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent 
defaultan accurate picture?
default&#xa0;
defaultEverything!
default There must be a true reflection of the lifetime carbon emissions associated with the use of biomass as a heating fuel.
default I currently have difficulty with 
defaultfigures reported by DEFRA, DECC and the Carbon Trust. The current Carb
defaulton Trust guidelines f
defaultor different methods of heating
default buildings attribute a very low carbon value to biomass.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition the dynamics / lifetime of the carbon cycle needs to be accounted for. We sh
defaultould only be burning biomass fro
defaultm alre
defaultady sustainable 
defaultsources. Ideally, given the currently dangerous levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, biomass carbon emitted in year one, should be re
default-
defaultabsorbed by new biomass in a
default matter of years - not decades.
default&#xa0;
default •
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go f
defaultar enough?
default&#xa0;
defaultSee previous paragraph.
default&#xa0;
default •
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNot able to comment quantitatively.  Presumably will be dependent on the e
defaultmission standards required for these units. Uncontrolled use will lead to blue haze!
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?
default&#xa0;
defaultAt current tariff 
defaultlevels, efficient mains gas boilers can offer some of the lowest running costs for the delivery of heat - particularly in older buildings (compared to say heat pumps). 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow likely this will last depends on future UK gas prices and availability. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe enor
defaultmous, past, investment in the availability and capacity of the UK gas grid, means that it is currently able to handle peak winter heating demands (as long as there is sufficient supply and storage capacity). However, gas has little to offer in terms of 
defaultfut
defaulture 
defaultcarbon reduction, until and if 
defaultcarbon neutral 
defaultbiogas becomes widely available. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the investment in the U
defaultK gas grid, encouragement could
default be given to the development
default and roll out
default of gas fired, domestic
default,
default 
defaultair and ground source heat pumps. These offer some reduction in gas consumption and carbon emissions - and may be one of the 
defaultinterim 
defaultsolutions for high density urban housing. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNote that DECC's objective of combining electrically driven heat pumps with progressively lower carbon electricity leads to the ultimate decarbonisation of 
defaultheat - and the release of invalua
defaultble liquid and gaseous fuels for far better utilisation than the pr
defaultov
defaultision of heat, ie
default/eg process industry, feedstock, and transportation. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?
default&#xa0;
defaultA long story. We do not have a cultural history of using community heating. There are all sorts of development barriers
default. An example in Cornwall is where there is the opportunity for the development of one of Europe's largest minewater heating systems in the Camborne/Pool/Redruth Redevelopment Scheme.  It will not be realised because there is no fin
defaultancing or structural capa
defaultbility within the municipal
defaultity/ scheme developer to install the infrastructure. Development plots will be let to individual commercial developers - who will not be prepared to finance/install/develop the communal infrastructure. There are various in
defaultstituti
defaultonal barriers as well. I
defaultn a totally free energy market,
default the developer cannot guarantee uptake of the heating supply by future occupiers. It is now an issue on the Southampton District heating scheme - where new occupiers are questioning whether they have t
defaulto and/or will make use of the communal distr
defaultict heating /cooling scheme.  Th
defaulte widespread adoption of community heating schem
defaulte
defaults in countries in Europe us
defaultual arises through the participa
defaulttion of the "municipality" as the developer / owner. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is interesting to note that in Sweden, with a history of municipality developed heating schemes, the recent privatisation is apparently leading to the dismantling of some schemes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother issue is that the lack of recent installations in the UK means 
defaultthat there is a dearth of information regarding the true installed costs. 
default&#xa0;
default •
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?
default&#xa0;
defaultNo idea. 
default&#xa0;
default  •
default&#xa0;
defaultShould the government take any further any specif
defaultic actions in relation to cooling?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should encourage the adoption of high efficiency cooling technology, and the use of passive cooling whenever possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn considering the energy use and carbon emissions of buildings, thought should be given to the f
defaultact that highly insulated buildings now give rise to cooling demand in. (Many new office buildings in the UK are now cooling 
defaultdominated). The objective is not necessarily to prevent the use of cooling - the objective should be to minimise the overall use of
default energy, and reduce the overall carbon emissions, over the whole year comfort cycle. 
default&#xa0;
default  •
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?
default&#xa0;
defaultI am not sure how yo
defaultu have come to this conclusion. 
defaultIt has taken 
defaultalmost 
defaultfour years for the RHI to come
default 
defaultto pass - and is only now being
default offered in any seriousness (Still yet to happen in anger - ie next Spring (perhaps?)
default)
default. This has caused utter mayhem in the supply industry and amongst consumers. Time will only tell whether the almost agreed levels of RHI t
defaultariff will now lead to great
defaulter
default heat pump rollout. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the non-domestic sector it should be bore in mind that the gestation period for a new building can be anywhere between 1 and 5 years - it is not a case of just retro-fitting a few so
defaultlar panels to a bui
defaultlding.  Given
default that there is still no pre-approval process for non-do
defaultmestic RHI
default, it will be interesting to see whether the availability of a possible RHI tariff once the building has been
default constructed and commissioned 
defaultwill induce developers to commit to 
defaultrenewable heat technologies - let alone heat pumps. 
default&#xa0;
default  •
default&#xa0;
defaultHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?
default&#xa0;
defaultWho knows !
default It will take some time for the supply industry to put together the trained personnel to deliver in significant numbers and to the newly required MCS standards.  Quite how the customers will react to the offer of RHI is impossible to gauge. Given the respo
defaultnse to FIT, 
defaultit will all depend on the percei
defaultved attractivenes
defaults of the offering. It should al
defaults
defaulto
default be appreciated that the replacement of a heating system is significantly more complex than the installation of say, PV panels.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultThermal storage is a potential
default useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.
default&#xa0;
default What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is funding a few possible thermal storage technologies through the DECC Ene
defaultrgy Entrepreneurs Schemes and the DECC Thermal Storage Innovation Scheme. The perception that mass installation of electrically driven heat pumps will give rise to peaking problems on the U grid means that attention should be given to innovations that can 
defaultsmooth out peak heating demand.  Once the current hiatus over the use of ground source thermal storage schemes for non-domestic heating and cooling is overcome, we should see greater adoption of this technology - which has been stalled for the last four ye
defaultars.  Increased attention should be paid to long lasting, cost effective
default,
default phase change materials.
