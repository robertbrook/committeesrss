[normal]Most of my comments are related to the use of heat in buildings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat ene
[normal]rgy demand?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Qualitatively - yes. Quantitatively - probably not. In terms of heat loss from buildings the rumoured relaxation of Part L of the Building Standards is unhelpful. The construction and testing of new buildings to meet the current Part L require
[normal]ments is not of sufficient rigour to ensure that the completed buildings meet the design heat loss levels. Insulation and draught proofing that will last the lifetime of a building are the most cost effective way of reducing a building
[normal]'
[normal]s heat demand. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It 
[normal]is acknowledged that there are still far too many UK households where there has been a failure to install loft and/or cavity wall insulation, and draught stripping measures. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any learning from the recent Retrofit for the Future programme should be evaluat
[normal]ed and disseminated.  The most cost effective measures in terms of heat and carbon reduction should be rolled out as soon as possible. Significant carbon reductions were achieved in many of the properties. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The use of night storage heating should be re-ex
[normal]amined. It was introduced in a different era to provide for baseload operation of nuclear stations. However, it leads to a wastage of heat, increased energy usage, and when driven by fossil fuel electricity, higher carbon emissions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst this document 
[normal]speaks to heat demand reduction - there is minimal referenc
[normal]e to waste heat elimination and
[normal]/or recovery. Greater attention should be given to the possible use of all varieties of heat pumps to deliver waste heat recovery in industrial processes. 
[normal]Encourag
[normal]e
[normal]me
[normal]nt should be given to the use 
[normal]of newer low temperature heat-to-electric
[normal]ity devices, and planners should
[normal] be encouraged to prom
[normal]o
[normal]te t
[normal]he use of cascaded waste heat utilisation either from power stations and/or industrial process plant.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What progress is t
[normal]he government making on reducing the demand for heat?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Not able to comment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Biomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent 
[normal]an accurate picture?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Everything!
[normal] There must be a true reflection of the lifetime carbon emissions associated with the use of biomass as a heating fuel.
[normal] I currently have difficulty with 
[normal]figures reported by DEFRA, DECC and the Carbon Trust. The current Carb
[normal]on Trust guidelines f
[normal]or different methods of heating
[normal] buildings attribute a very low carbon value to biomass.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition the dynamics / lifetime of the carbon cycle needs to be accounted for. We sh
[normal]ould only be burning biomass fro
[normal]m alre
[normal]ady sustainable 
[normal]sources. Ideally, given the currently dangerous levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, biomass carbon emitted in year one, should be re
[normal]-
[normal]absorbed by new biomass in a
[normal] matter of years - not decades.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go f
[normal]ar enough?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]See previous paragraph.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Not able to comment quantitatively.  Presumably will be dependent on the e
[normal]mission standards required for these units. Uncontrolled use will lead to blue haze!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At current tariff 
[normal]levels, efficient mains gas boilers can offer some of the lowest running costs for the delivery of heat - particularly in older buildings (compared to say heat pumps). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How likely this will last depends on future UK gas prices and availability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The enor
[normal]mous, past, investment in the availability and capacity of the UK gas grid, means that it is currently able to handle peak winter heating demands (as long as there is sufficient supply and storage capacity). However, gas has little to offer in terms of 
[normal]fut
[normal]ure 
[normal]carbon reduction, until and if 
[normal]carbon neutral 
[normal]biogas becomes widely available. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the investment in the U
[normal]K gas grid, encouragement could
[normal] be given to the development
[normal] and roll out
[normal] of gas fired, domestic
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]air and ground source heat pumps. These offer some reduction in gas consumption and carbon emissions - and may be one of the 
[normal]interim 
[normal]solutions for high density urban housing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Note that DECC's objective of combining electrically driven heat pumps with progressively lower carbon electricity leads to the ultimate decarbonisation of 
[normal]heat - and the release of invalua
[normal]ble liquid and gaseous fuels for far better utilisation than the pr
[normal]ov
[normal]ision of heat, ie
[normal]/eg process industry, feedstock, and transportation. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]  •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A long story. We do not have a cultural history of using community heating. There are all sorts of development barriers
[normal]. An example in Cornwall is where there is the opportunity for the development of one of Europe's largest minewater heating systems in the Camborne/Pool/Redruth Redevelopment Scheme.  It will not be realised because there is no fin
[normal]ancing or structural capa
[normal]bility within the municipal
[normal]ity/ scheme developer to install the infrastructure. Development plots will be let to individual commercial developers - who will not be prepared to finance/install/develop the communal infrastructure. There are various in
[normal]stituti
[normal]onal barriers as well. I
[normal]n a totally free energy market,
[normal] the developer cannot guarantee uptake of the heating supply by future occupiers. It is now an issue on the Southampton District heating scheme - where new occupiers are questioning whether they have t
[normal]o and/or will make use of the communal distr
[normal]ict heating /cooling scheme.  Th
[normal]e widespread adoption of community heating schem
[normal]e
[normal]s in countries in Europe us
[normal]ual arises through the participa
[normal]tion of the "municipality" as the developer / owner. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is interesting to note that in Sweden, with a history of municipality developed heating schemes, the recent privatisation is apparently leading to the dismantling of some schemes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another issue is that the lack of recent installations in the UK means 
[normal]that there is a dearth of information regarding the true installed costs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]No idea. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Should the government take any further any specif
[normal]ic actions in relation to cooling?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It should encourage the adoption of high efficiency cooling technology, and the use of passive cooling whenever possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In considering the energy use and carbon emissions of buildings, thought should be given to the f
[normal]act that highly insulated buildings now give rise to cooling demand in. (Many new office buildings in the UK are now cooling 
[normal]dominated). The objective is not necessarily to prevent the use of cooling - the objective should be to minimise the overall use of
[normal] energy, and reduce the overall carbon emissions, over the whole year comfort cycle. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am not sure how yo
[normal]u have come to this conclusion. 
[normal]It has taken 
[normal]almost 
[normal]four years for the RHI to come
[normal] 
[normal]to pass - and is only now being
[normal] offered in any seriousness (Still yet to happen in anger - ie next Spring (perhaps?)
[normal])
[normal]. This has caused utter mayhem in the supply industry and amongst consumers. Time will only tell whether the almost agreed levels of RHI t
[normal]ariff will now lead to great
[normal]er
[normal] heat pump rollout. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the non-domestic sector it should be bore in mind that the gestation period for a new building can be anywhere between 1 and 5 years - it is not a case of just retro-fitting a few so
[normal]lar panels to a bui
[normal]lding.  Given
[normal] that there is still no pre-approval process for non-do
[normal]mestic RHI
[normal], it will be interesting to see whether the availability of a possible RHI tariff once the building has been
[normal] constructed and commissioned 
[normal]will induce developers to commit to 
[normal]renewable heat technologies - let alone heat pumps. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Who knows !
[normal] It will take some time for the supply industry to put together the trained personnel to deliver in significant numbers and to the newly required MCS standards.  Quite how the customers will react to the offer of RHI is impossible to gauge. Given the respo
[normal]nse to FIT, 
[normal]it will all depend on the percei
[normal]ved attractivenes
[normal]s of the offering. It should al
[normal]s
[normal]o
[normal] be appreciated that the replacement of a heating system is significantly more complex than the installation of say, PV panels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] •
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thermal storage is a potential
[normal] useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is funding a few possible thermal storage technologies through the DECC Ene
[normal]rgy Entrepreneurs Schemes and the DECC Thermal Storage Innovation Scheme. The perception that mass installation of electrically driven heat pumps will give rise to peaking problems on the U grid means that attention should be given to innovations that can 
[normal]smooth out peak heating demand.  Once the current hiatus over the use of ground source thermal storage schemes for non-domestic heating and cooling is overcome, we should see greater adoption of this technology - which has been stalled for the last four ye
[normal]ars.  Increased attention should be paid to long lasting, cost effective
[normal],
[normal] phase change materials.
