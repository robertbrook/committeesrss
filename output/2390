Written evidence submitted by [bold]Helen[bold] [bold]Mountfield[bold] QC[bold],[bold] (LAI 0015)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]OVERVIEW[bold]1.  
[normal]I am a QC in private practice 
[normal]specialising in administrative and constitutional law.   I was called to the Bar in 1991 and took silk in 2010.   Before taking silk I was on the Treasury A Panel.   I have appeared bo
[normal]th for and against public authorities
[normal]  in 
[normal]all courts of
[normal] England and Wale
[normal]s, the CJEU and the ECtHR.   For example, I represented the Lord Chancellor in  
[normal]Wilkinson v Kitzinger (Lord Chancellor &amp; Attorney General Intervening) 
[normal] 
[normal][2006] EWHC 2002 
[normal]Fam as to the compatibility of the Civil Partnerships Act 2005 with human rights legisl
[normal]ation
[normal].   I sit as a civil recorder and a Deputy High Court judge in the Administrative Court.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]This 
[normal]paper is my 
[normal]personal 
[normal]submiss
[normal]ion on the implications 
[normal]of the government's civil legal aid proposals, set out in its response to the consultation exercise
[normal], 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].  In my view, the proposed changes
[normal] to legal aid
[normal] are a serious thre
[normal]at to the rule of law
[normal].  They will, if introduced, undermine
[normal] the right of
[normal] access to justice
[normal]: 
[normal] in particular, access to justice to challenge improper state action, for some of society's most vulnerable people, and those most vulnerable to abuse of state power (for example, those in its custody).
[normal]4
[normal].  
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] declared premise of the 
[normal]Transforming Legal Ai
[normal]d Proposals 
[normal]&#xad;
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]that a fair justice system with 'fair outcomes' is essential in our democratic society, and that legal aid is the 'hallmark of a fair, open justice system'.
[normal]  The same has long been recognised by the European Court of Human Rights and other
[normal] European constitutional courts
[normal].   Access to legal aid as a gateway to access to justice  is especially important when litigation is brought by a subject of st
[normal]ate action, to challenge the legality of it
[normal].   Since 
[normal] 
[normal]judicial review is the means by which cour
[normal]ts restrain the executive when it acts outside the law, access to judicial review is essential to the rule of law and executive accountability.
[normal]5.   The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 
[normal](LASPO) 
[normal]already severely limits legal aid fo
[normal]r judicial review.  The government acknowledges that the scope for further savings is very small.  Nevertheless, only eight days after LASPO came into force, the Ministry of Justice published proposals which would further remove legal aid for judicial 
[normal]revi
[normal]ew, in ways and to a point at which would undermine the effective availability of judicial review and its constitutional purpose
[normal].
[normal]  These changes have not been significantly amended, in response to overwhelming concern expressed in response to the consulta
[normal]tion.
[normal]6
[normal].  
[normal]A serious feature of the proposals is their intention to remove access to legal aid (and by necessary implication, access to the courts) for groups of people defined by status.   
[normal]A
[normal]nother serious feature is their apparent 'ideological' 
[normal]opposition 
[normal]to
[normal] judicial review which underpin
[normal]s the proposed changes
[normal], and the apparent desire to put much state activity beyond court scrutiny by way of judicial review
[normal].   It has not been disputed that the measures will
[normal], even on the Ministry of Justice's most 
[normal]optimistic view, save very little (£6 million).  Careful figures illustrating that the 'reforms' will
[normal] cost far more than they will save
[normal] have not been disputed
[normal].  (Indeed the cost of implementing a test where a recipient of legal aid services must prove a pe
[normal]riod of past lawful residence will be almost unworkably complex and costly).  
[normal]7.  
[normal]The 
[normal] principal purpose of the civil legal aid proposals appears to be the 
[normal]Secretary of State's intention to cut down on use of judicial review
[normal].  However, the means chosen to
[normal] achieve this end are not aimed at the cases with low prospects of success, but at particular categories of case, chosen by reference to characteristics of intended litigants, and measures which will prevent 
[normal]any 
[normal] case, no matter how meritorious, from being
[normal] pursued at a profit. Public statements by the Secretary of State indicate that he perceives judicial review to be 
[normal]improperl
[normal]y used as a tool of political opposition.    This is 
[normal]based on a misunderstanding of the approach taken by the courts, which are astu
[normal]te to 
[normal]keep within their proper constitutional realm, but are an essential check upon misuse of public power where it is exercised unlawfully or improperly.
[normal]7
[normal].  
[normal]The proposals - particularly when read in conjunction with the parallel consultation 
[normal]Judicial Re
[normal]view: Proposals for Further Reform 
[normal] (6 September 2013)  mean that the base of specialist legal suppliers of social welfare law is likely to be removed.   
[normal]These are not 'fat-cat' lawyers: the equity partners in many successful London legal aid practices are
[normal] paid less than teachers or senior nurses.   
[normal]The proposed legal aid changes are likely to lead to whole-sale exit from the market, and the experience and expertise lost  will not, therefore, be capable of being replaced  if, 
[normal]as seems likely, 
[normal]many suppliers
[normal] cease to provide
[normal] such services altogether 
[normal]in the light of the proposed
[normal] changes
[normal].
[normal]8.  The 
[normal]obvious adverse impact of the 
[normal]proposals 
[normal]for operation of our justice system has
[normal] generated serious concern across the profession, including from 
[normal]those who act primarily
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal] public authorities
[normal], and judges
[normal].
[normal] It is not insignificant that former House of Lords and Supreme Court judges have expressed themselves in such anxious terms in relation to the proposals
[normal].  Lord Brown (a former Treasury Devil) questioned whether the p
[normal]roposals were compatible with the Lord Chancellor's duties under section 1 Constitutional Reform Act; Lord Hope (the recently retired Vice President of the Supreme Court) said that 
[normal]              
[normal]"I find it hard to believe that a government which truly respected the ru
[normal]le of law - 
[normal]              
[normal]which had taken the trouble to understand what that phrase really means, and to 
[normal]              
[normal]study the
[normal] 
[normal]consequences of what it has in mind - would have contemplated 
[normal]              
[normal]introducing the [civil legal aid proposals]".
[normal]Lord Scott said that respect for the rule of law is 
[normal]"cultural ... it is not to be found in every country and it is not immutable. ... Respect for the rule of law is capable of being forfeited and lost if excessive cuts are made affecting potential litigan
[normal]ts .. It cannot be taken fo
[normal]r granted by the Government that that will not happen and I hope they will keep that in mind".
[normal]9.   It is also almost inconceivable that the government's proposals are compatible with EU law
[normal] (Article 47 of the Charter of Rights),
[normal] Articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights
[normal] and Article 15 of the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
[normal].  Adoption of these proposals 
[normal]would undermine the existence 
[normal]of the justice system which our constitutional 
[normal]tradition and our international law obligations demand.
[normal]10.   In short, the implications of the proposals to ref
[normal]orm civil legal aid
[normal] amount, in many cases, to effective removal of access to 
[normal]mechanisms of redress against unlawful state action
[normal].  The
[normal] 
[normal]proposals
[normal] 
[normal]undermine 
[normal]acc
[normal]ess to justice
[normal], public accountability and the rule of law.  These 
[normal]form 
[normal] the
[normal] roots of a democratic society
[normal], and the proposals, in undermining these, undermine democracy
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]THE RESIDENCE TEST[bold]11.  The proposal is to exclude from  civil legal 
[normal]aid
[normal] eligibility
[normal] those who cannot show twelve months lawful residence and those not lawfully present in the United Kingdom.    Note that the onus will be on the person seeking help - perhaps urgently - to demonstrate
[normal] eligibility
[normal], by
[normal] providing documentary pr
[normal]oof
[normal].
[normal]   Anyone who cannot demonstrate the requisite period of lawful residence 
[normal] 
[normal]will be unable to access legal advice or representation, no matter how 
[normal]urgent or 
[normal]acute their need for help
[normal].
[normal]12.  The
[normal] proposal
[normal] to introduce a residence test
[normal] undermines the
[normal] principle of equality before the law:  
[normal]"Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws.   There is no distinction between British nationals and others.  He who is subject to English law 
[normal]is entitled to its protection"
[normal] per Lo
[normal]rd Scarman in 
[normal]Khjawaja 
[normal] [1984] AC 74 at 111G. 
[normal]13.
[normal]  T
[normal]he proposed exceptions to application of the residence test are very narrow, and leave many obvious injustices and lacunae.   
[normal]14.  
[normal]Contrary to some media reports, 
[normal] 
[normal]no 
[normal] general exception 
[normal]is proposed 
[normal]for 
[normal]'vulnerable persons' or cases concerned with liberty
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]Thus:
[normal]* 
[normal]Asylum seekers are included 
[normal] 
[normal]but only while they are seeking asylu
[normal]m
[normal];
[normal]* Current immigration detainees are included 
[normal]but only while they remain detained, and only in relation to challenging the 
[normal]fact of their detention
[normal].   Challenges to mistreatment in detention or discrimination in detention are therefore excluded.  'Tanja', whose case concerning sexual assaults by Serco officers at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre was recently reported  in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Observer
[normal] 
[normal]newspaper
[normal]  would not be eligible for legal aid in relation to such complaints.
[normal]* Those who can show reasonable grounds that they are trafficking victims are included 
[normal]but only in rela
[normal]tion to immigration claims, some 
[normal]employment claims and 
[normal]damages claims against the alleged trafficker
[normal].  In relation to any other advice or challenge (eg concerning eligibility for welfare benefits
[normal], community care
[normal] or mental health support) 
[normal]such a person 
[normal]would be out of scope.
[normal]* Victims of domestic violence are i
[normal]ncluded 
[normal]but 
[normal]again only in relation to limited categories of claims
[normal].
[normal]15.   Those who will be excluded from eligibility for legal aid (and hence access to justice) by the residence test include:
[normal]* those who have suffered serious abuse of power by UK state ag
[normal]ents but who reside abroad (for example
[normal] Baha Mousa'
[normal]s family, a person extraordinarily rendered to Guantanamo Bay
[normal]);
[normal]* children who have resided in the United Kingdom for most or all of their lives, and
[normal] who would be eligible for formal leave to remain, but
[normal] w
[normal]hose parent
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] failed to regularise their immigration status
[normal].
[normal]* children without parental support who cannot provide evidence of twelve months' lawful residence.
[normal]*  disabled people and mentally ill people who cannot provide proof of twelve months' lawf
[normal]ul residence will be unable to access even emergency help.
[normal]16.   There will 
[normal]thus 
[normal]be categories of people who
[normal], irrespective of the extent of their needs or the merits of their case 
[normal] are effectively outside the reach of the rule of law.
[normal]   These people are di
[normal]sproportionately likely to be female, or children, or disabled.  Yet the equality consequences of these proposals do not appear to have been considered adequately or at all.  T
[normal]hey are likely to breach article
[normal] 15 of the UN Convention on the Elimination o
[normal]f D
[normal]iscrimination Against Women and articles 12 and 13 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
[normal]17.  Lest it be suggested that the 'exceptional funding' provisions under s10 LASPO provide an adequate safety net, it is clear that the exc
[normal]eptional funding mechani
[normal]sm does not work.   Section 10 LASPO
[normal] provides a theoretical entitlement to assistance if failure to provide it would breach human rights or EU law rights.  However, 
[normal]after six months of the scheme's operation, research showed
[normal] that only 233 applications have been received, and 
[normal]of these only six had been granted.   The form is 17 pages long, and there is no funding for solicitors to complete it.  One street homeless man with learning difficulties was refused exceptional funding 
[normal]to 
[normal]help him 
[normal]regularise his immigration status so as to enable him to become eligible for community care help
[normal].
[normal]18.  Nor does it appear that the lacuna could be filled by a public interest body - such as Child Poverty Action Group or Medical Justice - could
[normal] bring a representative claim in relation 
[normal]to an area of wider public interest, since the parallel consultation 
[normal]Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform 
[normal] (06/09/2013) proposes removing standing from such bodies.
[normal]19.  It is unlikely that the 
[normal]introductio
[normal]n of a 
[normal]residence test will save money.  In addition to the costs of administering it, 
[normal]there are likely to be significant costs incurred by local authorities dealing with the destitute
[normal].  T
[normal]he likelihood is that there will be significantly more self-represen
[normal]ting litigants in the Administrative Court list.  The costs of this - to other litigants, 
[normal]to the reputation of the British justice system, in creation of delays, and to the administration of courts - are enormous.    They do 
[normal] not appear to have been factor
[normal]ed in to the ostensible costs savings.
[normal]   See the observations of Lord Justice Ward in 
[normal]Wright v Michael Wright Supplies Ltd 
[normal] [2013] EWCA Civ 234 at [2]:
[normal]"What I find so depressing is that the case highlights the difficulties increasingly encountered by the 
[normal]judiciary at all levels when dealing with litigants in person. Two problems in particular are revealed. The first is how to bring order to the chaos which litigants in person invariably – and wholly understandably – manage to create in putting forward thei
[normal]r claims and defences. Judges should not have to micro-manage cases, coaxing and cajoling the parties to focus on the issues that need to be resolved. Judge Thornton did a brilliant job in that regard yet, as this case shows, that can be disproportionately
[normal] time-consuming. It may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers legal aid for this kind of litigation but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increases it in the courts. The expense of three judges of 
[normal]the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented. With more a
[normal]nd more self-represented litigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service in this court, I shall not refrain from expressing my conviction that justice 
[normal]will be ill served indeed by this emasculation of legal aid.
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PRISONERS[bold]20.  
[normal]The MOJ proposes removing  legal aid for a very wide variety of cases arising in prisons (even if internal complaints mechanisms/ombudsmen have not resolved them, even if the complaints are constitutionally important ones).  
[normal]The proposals for removing civi
[normal]l legal aid for prisoners 
[normal]have 
[normal]not materially altered, save that the requirement to have a criminal legal aid contract for prison work has been removed.  
[normal]21.   
[normal]Prisoners
[normal] 
[normal]in the complete control of the state.  
[normal]Without legal aid, they are probably unable to
[normal] obtain independent scrutiny of complaints against it.  
[normal]Removing 
[normal]legal aid to enable them to challenge state action, where other means of redress have failed, is 
[normal]therefore antithetical to the rule of law.  The suggestion that prisoners should use alternati
[normal]ve means of resolving grievances such as internal complaints and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman does not obviate this concern, since judicial review has always been a 
[normal]remedy of 
[normal]last resort, but 
[normal]one which 
[normal]sometimes 
[normal]proves
[normal] necessary. 
[normal]22.   Removing access to a lawyer in many cases 
[normal] means
[normal] in effect
[normal] removal of access t
[normal]o justice in the case of 
[normal]a person who is incarcerated
[normal].
[normal] However, it is doubtful that the small, specialist 
[normal]prison law 
[normal]firms 
[normal]will be able to absorb 17.5% cuts in fees and the
[normal] reduc
[normal]tion in the scope of 
[normal]prison law eligible for legal aid, especially given the ongoing proposal that much initial preparation work for judicial review remain unpaid or subject only to discretionary payment.
[normal]22.  Removal of legal aid for prison work mea
[normal]n that there will be many important issues where injustice may go unredressed.  For example:
[normal]- miscategorisation of a prisoners
[normal] in too high a security category
[normal];
[normal]- unlawful denial of access to offending behaviour courses and/or re-settlement work for releas
[normal]e on parole;
[normal]- representations on whether a mother should be separated from her baby or admitted to a mother and baby unit;
[normal]- representations on assaults in prison.
[normal]23.  Apart from individual injustices going unredressed, it is likely that withdrawal of in
[normal]dependent advice and assistance will render safe management of prisons more 
[normal]e very significant. 
[normal]difficult.  (Lord Woolf's report in 1990 into the Strangeways pris
[normal]on disturbances shows a link). 
[normal]24.  Work by Dr Nick Armstrong demonstrates that the on-costs 
[normal]of the proposed removal of prison legal aid - mainly as  result of prisoners being categorised in too high a security category and an increased number of complaints to the Prisons &amp; Probation Ombudsman.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]JUDICIAL REVIEW[bold]25.  The consultation response pro
[normal]poses of a 17.5% fee cut and 
[normal] 
[normal]no payment for claimant lawyers for work undertaken unless and until permission to proceed by way of judicial review is granted by a court
[normal].  That is so 
[normal]even if the claim was well-founded but judicial aid is no longer needed, f
[normal]or example, because the executive body backs down before the c
[normal]laim is determined by the court
[normal].
[normal]   In combination with other changes above, and the proposals in the parallel judicial review consultation (eg on standing), these proposals are likely to drive s
[normal]mall, specialist, 
[normal]efficient firms out of business
[normal].
[normal]26.  The c
[normal]umulative
[normal] practical effect - if not the intention - will be to remove a vital constitutional safeguard against misuse of executive power.
[normal]  It is of particular concern, however, that it 
[normal]does 
[normal]appear to be the intention of the Ministry of Justice to prevent even well-founded applications for judicial review from proceeding, both by limiting legal aid  for judicial review, and by other restrictions on legal aid, including - as noted above - by re
[normal]moving standing for 
[normal]public interest litigants such as charities and NGOs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BORDERLINE/TEST CASES[bold]27.  Equality of arms is important in all litigation, but especially in litigation between an individual and the state.    The proposal to remove legal aid fun
[normal]ding from 'borderline' cases affects those in which a lawyer cannot fairly estimate the prospects of success: that is, test cases which establish important points of law of general public importance.   The examples given in the paper from Richard Drabble Q
[normal]C - which I have seen - illustrate how removal of funding for such cases would enable the government to be the sole judge of when a 'test' case can be brought to challenge a judgment which it considers wrong, in circumstances where individual litigants cou
[normal]ld not obtain funding to oppose them.

[normal]CONCLUSION[bold]2
[normal]8
[normal].  The proposals in respect of
[normal] civil legal aid 
[normal]funding are of genuine 
[normal]constitutional importance and should be rejected on constitutional
[normal], human rights and democratic
[normal] grounds.
[normal]2
[normal]9
[normal].  
[normal]No executive body
[normal] likes to have its decisions overturned in court (any more than it likes them to be criticised in the press).   But no citizen wa
[normal]nts to live in a country where the government regards itself as 
[normal]ab
[normal]ove and unconstrained by 
[normal]law.  A
[normal] credible and effective  judicial mechanism for ensuring that the executive acts within its lawful authority is essential to the rule of law.  As Lord Pannick
[normal] QC 
[normal]has recently remarked
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal] those countries in which the Government win
[normal]s
[normal] all 
[normal]its
[normal] cases in court are not places in which any of us would wish to live
[normal].
