[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Declaration of Interest[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cellmark Forensic Services (Orchid Cellmark Ltd) is the second largest private Forensic Service Provider (FSP) in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal].  Cellmark employs approximately 500 staff primarily involved in forensic analysis at its laboratories in Abingdon, Oxfordshire and Chorley, 
[normal]Lancashire
[normal].  Cellmark has provided forensic 
[normal]DNA
[normal] services for 25 years and delivers a full forensic casework service to the police.  This includes crime scene attendance, laboratory evidence recovery, a comprehensive range of analytical services and the presentation of results and expert interpretation in court.  Cellmark’s laboratory services are accredited to ISO17025, with scene att
[normal]endance accredited to ISO 17020.  T
[normal]he Company is currently contracted to support over 75% of the police forces in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the [bold]UK[bold] and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that the Government’s strategy to allow a private forensic marketplace to develop and to encourage competition between regulated Forensic Service Providers (FSPs) has delivered cost effective, high quality and timely forensic services in support of the Criminal Justice System.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, the outsourced forensic market is shrinking due to a number of factors: reduced expenditure on forensic science (as in all areas of public spending); lower reported crime rates; and the strategy of investing in the development of in-house forensic capabilities within individual police forces.  The planned implementation of Streamlined Forensic Reporting may also impact on police spend on forensic science.  Increased competition can of course stimulate development activity and encourage innovation to reduce cost, but the shrinking market will also have the effect of reducing the attractiveness of the market for private investment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s current forensic procurement strategy has also added significant complexity and therefore cost to the delivery of forensic science, with the potential for an increased administrative burden diverting resources away from service delivery.  This impacts particularly in complex casework where the coding structure is also less well suited for capturing the broader forensic review and assessment activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The relatively modest size of the forensic market influences its attractiveness for R&amp;D investment and current predictions are that with the current strategy the market will continue to shrink.  In addition there is a relatively long lead time in forensic science from innovation to presentation in the courtroom and this affects the potential return on investment.  Previous government expenditure on forensic R&amp;D, channeled through the Forensic Science Service’s research activity, is no longer available and while efforts are being made by the Government to encourage greater interdisciplinary networking and involvement of the university sector, we are not aware of any specific Government funding identified for forensic R&amp;D.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the challenges, from the perspective of a FSP the management of the transitional arrangements was well organised and delivered to the agreed timescale.  The forensic community and police forces worked well together demonstrating great flexibility and coordination and, although service delivery timescales were affected, forensic work was prioritised to meet the requirements of the Criminal Justice System.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This was a very significant change in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] forensic marketplace.  When the closure of the Forensic Science Service (FSS) was announced in December 2010 it was estimated that the FSS was carrying out approximately 60% of the police’s outsourced forensic work in the 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal].  With the exception of the Wetherby laboratory the FSS stopped accepting new work in October 2011, just 10 months after the announcement, and closed in March 2012.  The transition of such a large volume of work within such a short timeframe presented significant logistical difficulties particularly given the very labour intensive nature of much of the work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Within just 10 months several procur
[normal]ement exercises were completed and 
[normal]staff and accredited laboratory capacity was developed within other FSPs as well as within the Metropolitan Police (despite being hindered by the fact that many FSS staff could not be released until after the work was moved to other suppliers in October 2011).  Working procedures were agreed and developed with each police force and the work was successfully transitioned in a phased manner.  Throughout this period forensic services were maintained to support the Criminal Justice System.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training?  In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained?  (please provide evidence/examples).[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal](i) We are not able to comment on the impact of the FSS’s closure on the Criminal Justice System. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal](ii) 
[normal]Forensic Science R&amp;D[bold]The closure of the FSS clearly curtailed the R&amp;D activity at the FSS and was discussed in detail in the previous HO Select Committee review and the s
[normal]ubsequent Forensic Science R&amp;D r
[normal]eview by Professor Silverman (published in June 2011). These studies confirmed that research and particularly development activity is carried out within other FSPs either individually or through collaborative exercises, and research with forensic applications is carried out within academia and the wider research community as well as by equipment manufacturers and technology providers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Silverman review made several key recommendations which have been implemented. These included for example, reinforcing the contractual requirements for R&amp;D in the Procurement Framework for forensic science provision, and the facilitation of increased communication within the forensic R&amp;D landscape by establishing a regular cross-disciplinary conference and a Knowledge Transfer Network.  However, 
[normal]we are not aware of any specific Government funding identified for forensic R&amp;D.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Forensic Training[bold]Although the forensic training capacity provided directly by the FSS has been lost, the industry retains a significant training resource, both for internal staff advancement and for external provision to support the police in this country and overseas.  Indeed additional capacity was and continues to be developed within FSPs and police run laboratories by delivering significant levels of training, in addition to the recruitment of new staff. Cellmark has a well developed approach to staff development and training which has expanded in recent years in line with increased workload and the broader range of forensic disciplines provided by the Company.  This means that Cellmark, along with other forensic science organisations, provides comprehensive training for the development of new and existing forensic scientists 
[normal]to
[normal] ensure the ongoing quality and expertise of forensic work delivered to the police and the Criminal Justice System.  In addition, a number of specialist forensic consultancies have emerged which provide additional resource to supplement training capacity. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Quality Standards and Accreditation[bold]When the closure of the FSS was announced there was already a well developed forensic market with suppliers working to agreed quality standards.  Cellmark for example has been accredited to submit profiles to the N
[normal]DNA
[normal]D since 1998 which has required it to operate to exactly the same quality standards as the FSS.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Quality and Accreditation standards for FSPs have continued to be well defined and maintained.  Indeed FSPs have never been more regulated - the combination of the NFFNG requirements, the Forensic Regulator and the UK Accreditation Service ensures that forensic delivery by FSPs meets ISO17025 accreditation standards and the Forensic Regulator’s Codes of Practice.  In 2012, for the first time, quality accreditation was extended to forensic delivery at the crime scene with the introduction of ISO17020.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should be the role of the Forensic Science Regulator?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We support the current role and responsibilities of the Forensic Science Regulator.  The Regulator should define the Quality and Accreditation standards for the delivery of forensic science to the UK Criminal Justice System and provide independent oversight of the quality of service delivery from the recovery of evidence at the crime scene to the delivery of expert witness testimony in the court room. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The size of the forensic market outsourced by police in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] through the National Forensic Framework (including the outsourced work of the police forces in the NE of England and the Metropolitan Police Service) has declined due to price reduction, lower reported crime rates, pressure on public expenditure and increased in-sourcing.  This market expenditure is now believed to be approximately £80m to £100m per year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The stability of the forensic market is as yet unknown.  The value of the market has reduced annually for a number of years and we believe that it is set to reduce further in 2013.  The stability of the existing market suppliers will be influenced by the relatively short contracts awarded through the procurement process and the potential for large swings in market share at each tendering exercise. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2012 the second National Forensic Framework (National Forensic Framework Next Generation) was issued and potential suppliers were invited to qualify.  The qualifying process permitted a maximum of six suppliers to become eligible to bid in future tenders for each of the 13 forensic Lots.  The forensic Lots comprise 10 single forensic disciplines (such as 
[normal]DNA
[normal] testing or drugs analysis), one multidisciplinary trace evidence Lot, a case review Lot and a general forensic casework 
[normal]Lot
[normal] which comprises all the forensic disciplines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Each Lot contains a number of analytical product specification documents that detail what is expected of the forensic service provider for each forensic ‘test’ or ‘service’ in terms of evidence processing, accreditation requirements, how the results should be delivered and how the work should be charged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Using the Framework documents Police forces, generally acting as a regional group, undertake procurement exercises with the suppliers on the framework, awarding their forensic work for a period of 2 – 4 years.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Forensic procurement has delivered a number of positive benefits:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However we believe that the procurement process could be improved.  Some product specifications have become too complex in an attempt, we believe, to provide flexibility and attribute specific costs against each activity at a very detailed level.  This has introduced additional administrative burden and cost into the delivery of forensic science, both for the submitting police forces and forensic suppliers.  Two examples:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]              
[normal]In the Casework Lot, the examination of a forensic exhibit to recover blood and other body fluids, and, where appropriate to interpret blood distribution patterning is captured with product specifications which in 2008 contained 4 pricing points.  Now there are 29 pricing points.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B
[normal]              
[normal]In the 
[normal]DNA
[normal] Lot, the recovery of 
[normal]DNA
[normal] from an exhibit and the subsequent 
[normal]DNA
[normal] profiling for submission to the National 
[normal]DNA
[normal] Database is detailed in product specifications which had 4 pricing points in 2008.  There are now 26 pricing points.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although the procurement framework could eventually result in standardised forensic delivery, because there are currently overlapping frameworks and contracts, and because changes have been made by forces at each tendering exercise, in April 2013 suppliers may have to operate with four different sets of product specifications being delivered to different police force regions.  This adds complexity, administrative burden and cost, and detracts from the scientists’ focus on delivering forensic science.  The further standardisation of police requirements would assist with efficiency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Forensic work is tendered in large quantities (the latest tender involved three of the nine police regions – a third of the country’s forensic work in a single tender). Sometimes tenders are for single suppliers.  The movement of large quantities of forensic work, particularly casework which is very labour intensive, can present significant logistical difficulties and can be very de-stabilising for the forensic companies involved.  It can also discourage the emergence of smaller suppliers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The continued focus on reducing timescales for forensic delivery, even though 
[normal]England
[normal] has the most rapid forensic services in the world, is sometimes out of step with the speed of other aspects of the Criminal Justice System and runs the risk of putting too much pressure on the forensic scientists involved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The commoditisation of forensic procurement has worked well for single discipline services but is less well suited for purchasing forensic provision in complex casework investigations.  Some of the review activities required by the Forensic Regulator’s Code of Practice are not adequately catered for within the coding structure and this could potentially lead to a loss of independent and/or broader forensic oversight.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that the forensic procurement and delivery process could be improved by FSPs having a greater level of involvement and consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the [bold]UK[bold]?  (please provide evidence/ examples).[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that the closure of the FSS has resulted in a loss of intellectual volume, but not a loss in intellectual expertise.  Although we are aware that for a few scientific disciplines the numbers of scientists do not yet match the demand, in general the number of forensic roles has reduced in line with current police expenditure on forensic science.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Within most forensic suppliers there remains a healthy spectrum of length of experience.  Forensic scientists undergo considerable scientific and forensic training before they are involved in the examination of forensic exhibits or the reporting of forensic results, and the work of forensic examiners and reporting scientists is always subject to checking and peer review, with mentoring by those with greater experience.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Not only is there a considerable wealth of talent in UK forensic science among the younger forensic scientists but across a range of disciplines there are many forensic practitioners with more than 20 and even 30 years experience of investigating crime.  At Cellmark 18% of our Forensic Reporting Scientists have more than 20 years forensic experience and 67% have more than 10 years forensic experience.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is however important that the police continue to use a range of forensic disciplines rather than, because of budgetary constraint, restricting their forensic analysis to a few selected techniques such as 
[normal]DNA
[normal] analysis.  UK forensic science and the Criminal Justice System has historically benefitted from a comprehensive analytical approach but as the market shrinks certain expertise may be difficult to maintain if we go through a period of under-use, such as we are currently seeing with forensic fibre analysis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are current arrangement for the FSS’s archives satisfactory?  How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the [bold]UK[bold] be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]32
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are not experiencing any difficulties with the current FSS archive arrangements.
