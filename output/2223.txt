[[[&#xa0;]]]Re:              Have Your Say on the Deregulation Bill - Amendments relating to Rights of Way Issues in the Draft Deregulation Bill  CM8642&#xa0;&#xa0;A coalition of various groups have suggested that the Deregulation Bill affords a real opportunity for updating the way the law is interpreted regarding the use of our green lanes by motorised vehicles, trail bikes and quad bikes.&#xa0;I fully support the suggested rights of way clauses to the bill which would have the effect of&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;OR&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I live in the Peak District National Park and the increasing recreational use of mechanically propelled vehicles (MPVs), Trail Bikes and Quad Bikes is sadly destroying the green lanes and packhorse routes.   These routes have suffered a great deal by such use and in many cases walkers, cyclists and horse riders can no longer use these lanes because of the damage caused by off-roaders.  Over the last eight to ten years, the use of MPV's has increased significantly.  I have walked on dedicated footpaths and at times been confronted by off-roaders.  Lanes are often narrow and the only option to get out of the way is to climb the bank side.  Sometimes this is not always possible.&#xa0;Off-roaders are not only a danger to walkers, cyclists and horse riders but the damage which is done to lanes is heartbreaking -  for example  - erosion of the lanes, damage to walls, the local environment and wildlife.  Not only do these MPV's cause damage to lanes, they are a significant nuisance to the local areas as access to these lanes is through small villages where residential cottages face roads often without any pavements.   The noise and nuisance these vehicles create in our villages spoils the rural tranquillity and environment of the countryside. I have witnessed many examples of vehicles driven during the day and at night through quiet residential lanes and villages to the detriment of the safety of the public and visitors causing a significant public nuisance.&#xa0;Councils have tried to repair some of these lanes.  However the lanes are destroyed very quickly. This is a waste of council finances.  For example, over £600,000 has recently been spent on one local route, only for these repairs to be damaged within a very short space of time.  In times of severe council austerity such repairs and re-repairs are a complete and appalling waste of tax payers money.&#xa0;Legal disputes and public enquires are further examples of unnecessary ongoing expenditure.  The rules made for times gone by do not apply to how recreational MPV's are used today.  Packhorse routes were never designed for motor vehicles.  Ongoing bureaucracy is expensive and wasteful.&#xa0;I would be pleased if the Joint Parliamentary Committee would seriously consider making changes to the Bill which would be deregulatory in effect and within the localism agenda.  The proposed measures will have the added benefit of protecting the environment and non vehicle users and eliminating the waste of public money spent on repairing and re-repairing lanes damaged by motor vehicles.&#xa0;Attached to this letter are some recent photographs which show damage by recreational motor vehicles to nearby bridleways.  I apologise for the poor quality of the prints.  However they clearly indicate the damage done to just a few of our local green lanes.  Many other lanes suffer from similar damage.&#xa0;Thank you for your consideration of my comments and I look forward to a positive response to this ongoing and increasingly destructive issue.   Our countryside is a valuable asset to the whole nation and needs our dedicated protection.  I am very fortunate to live within a National Park and I believe that all National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty deserve our protection against such use by MPV's.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
