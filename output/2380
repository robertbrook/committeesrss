[normal]Could you please consider some rights of way additions to the draft Deregulation Bill in order to protect the National Parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from the damage caused by off­ roading motorbikes and 4x4vehicles on ancient tracks and footpaths.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Twentyeight years ago I was fortunate enough to come to live in Eyam, a beautiful and historic village in the Peak District National Park. I was especially delighted to discover the many lovely tracks and footpaths leading out of the village onto the moors and surrounding villages. They were peaceful, tranquil paths with a feeling of history and a reminder of feet treading them through the ages. Motorised vehicles were never seen on them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over the last fifteen years or so four of these paths which previously had been used only by walkers, horses or farmers have been invaded by groups of off-roading motor bikes and 4x4 vehicles. After very expensive and time-consuming Public Inquiries these paths have been made into Byways Open to all Traffic (BOATs) because only evidence relating to historic use (ie horses and carts) could be considered at the Inquiry. No consideration was allowed to be given to danger to the public (many children visit this village), damage and erosion to the paths and noise which can be heard all round the village. The Parish Council now must apply to the authorities to request Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) be placed on these BOATs.

[normal]Surely this is a case which would benefit from a Deregulation Bill which allowed the authorities to consider all relevant evidence and protect the Peak District and other National Parks from such damage at a time when we are all in need of the peace and tranquility which our Parks can supply.
