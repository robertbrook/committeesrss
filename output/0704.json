"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Rupert C E Wyndham (CLC040)&#xa0;\n1. \nIntroductionThe Foresight programme findings, which instigated the Committee's solicitation of views from the public, are substantially out of date. \n&#xa0;\n2. \nDeclaration of interestsIn conspicuous contrast to numbers of MPs, I have no financial or reputational interests whatsoever in the subject of alleged man-made climate change. Neither have I ever had. \n&#xa0;\n3. \nPublic perception of climate changeThe public, rightly, increasingly perceives alleged anthropogenic global warming as a scam designed to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe perception of climate change as no more than a political contrivance has grown markedly during, say, the last two years. Evidence is easily found not just from numerous polls or from anecdotal indications, numerous though these are, but from the fact that sceptical news stories, once as rare as altruistic politicians, are now common currency in both tabloid as well as broadsheet national newspapers. \n&#xa0;\nWhy?\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n   \nScience - overview. AGW 'science' has been fraudulent from inception. Since it always lacked authentic\n \nscientific underpinning, it was obliged to have recourse to chicanery - contrived claims of a scientific consensus, refusal to observe protocols of scientific method (verification and replication),\n \nsubversion of  peer review, avoidance of debate, denial of contra-indications, concoction of data,\n \nmisrepresentation, misinformation, disinformation. But, once politicians had bought into the profiteering racket, it then became imperative to divert vast state funded financial resources into promoting it. For a while, this worked. But, as others have recognised in their times, 'the big lie' may be made to  gain traction, but will not long withstand exposure to dispassionate analysis. This made it imperative to censor all potential exposure thereto; hence the role now of the BBC and a complicit academia, which could be bought ('grant troughing', in the vernacular).\n&#xa0;\n  3.2   Is there any aspect in which AGW 'science' is plausible?\n \nNo, quite simply impossible. The orthodoxy posits that fundamental and potentially dangerous alterations to the Earth's climate may be wrought by minute changes in the atmospheric concentration of a single component, a trace gas amounting in total to less than 1/25\nth\n part of a single percentage point. By any standard, this constitutes an hypothesis that can only be regarded as facile and unlikely, if not positively flaky, the more so when taking into account that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAn implausible hypothesis requires exceptionally strong proof. \n&#xa0;\nHas there been any evidence to support of the AGW hypothesis? Not one example has yet been\n put forward drawn from observation in the real world.\n&#xa0;\nNevertheless, this still does not represent the flaw au fond in the AGW edifice. That, ironically, is provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) itself, of which more in due course. Pro tempore, it is sufficient to note that, writing for once truthfully and accurately, in its First Assessment Report (AR1), it made the entirely correct (though obvious!) declaration that the atmosphere/climate is a vast, chaotic, non-linear system, not susceptible to prediction. In consequence, the IPCC added that it would/could deal only with 'scenarios'. By the advent of AR2, however, it was clear that it had every intention of promoting not only prediction but catastrophism also. And the supposed scientific justification for such predictions? Why, to be sure, they were to be attributed to minute alterations in a single variable, namely CO\n2\n. For members of this Committee and others: \n&#xa0;\nN.B.  By virtue of underlying realities, the acknowledgement on the one hand that prediction is impossible and on the other an appeal to predictive determinism represents the juxtaposition of mutuallyexclusive propositions! &#xa0;\n4.   \nCredibility of cited authorities&#xa0;\n4.1 \nIPCCCataclysmic climate change propagandists frequently seek to dismiss questioning of their orthodoxy by reference to the alleged absence of specialist expertise possessed by dissenters. In spite of this, the public is not so dense that it cannot see the clash between this proposition and the appointment of a railway engineer to head up what is, supposedly, the world's primary authority on proclaimed climate change. Moreover, as propaganda from the IPCC and pseudo-environmentalists has grown increasingly shrill, so too have investigations multiplied both of their claims and of their basic integrity. It did not take long for a string of outright falsehoods to be exposed:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nto name but a few. Neither did it escape public attention that  Rajendra Pachauri had substantial conflicts of interest between his official role and his business activities, nor that these were both insolent and brazen -\n&#xa0;\n(“They're of interest to me so are not conflicting.”). \n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment agencies: Met Office, University of East Anglia, Hadley Centre, Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Grantham InstituteTo a greater or lesser degree of perceptibility, the reputation of each one of these taxpayer funded bodies fatally undermined by the 'Climategate' scandal although, as an objective reality, 'Climategate' served only to confirm what was already self-evident. Subsequent whitewashes instigated by Parliament in no way mitigated the damage caused to their reputation. Instead, they merely served to aggravate public perceptions of venality within the composition of parliamentarians, perceptions already deeply and irrevocably entrenched  from other revelations. Moreover, since this submission addresses public perceptions, this section should not be closed without noting what has been a risible performance by the Met Office. Neither should and mendacious manipulations by the Tyndall Centre, amongst others, be overlooked. There has been frequent public comment on the seemingly inexplicable morphing of the original use of the term “global warming” to “climate change”.  Any exploration of the blogosphere will readily yield sardonic comments on  this transformation, even though many seem not to have knowledge of its source. \n&#xa0;\nThat source is, in fact, within the public domain. It is vested, courtesy of the Tyndall Centre, in '\nWorking Paper No. 58'\n - The Social Simulation of the Public Perception of Weather Events and their Effect upon the Development of Belief in Anthropogenic Climate Change – Dennis Bray &amp; Simon Shackley, Sept. 2004) [My underlining]\n&#xa0;“Only the perception of positive anomalies will be registered as an indication of change, if the issue is framed as global warming.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn plain English, too hot and it's CO\n2\n. Too cold and it's CO\n2\n. No change and it’s CO\n2\n.  What is clear is that Messrs. Bray and Shackley knew well that they were selling a pup; the ethics of the second hand car dealership or, perhaps more immediately, the solar panel salesman, are normative throughout the climate change industry.\n&#xa0;Hypotheses that, at least in principle, are not capable of being disproved are not science; they are merely  manifestations of cultist dogmatism and demagoguery.&#xa0;4.3  \nThe European UnionIn spite of increasingly desperate prime ministerial and other efforts to sustain a rearguard action, the EU is now seen by a majority in this country (as well as more widely throughout Europe) as not just \nun- but, beyond redemption, pro-actively \nanti-democratic, uncontrollably profligate, centrist, malign, bureaucratic, interfering and institutionally corrupt. Enthusiastically adopted also by a British classe politique, its role in promoting grotesquely polluting, expensive and impractical palliatives to a non-problem is widely resented. Well grounded hostility towards Brussels translates readily into aversion to any cause or policy espoused via EU dictat emerging from an anonymous and unaccountable bureaucracy.\n&#xa0;\n4.4  \nBBCThe BBC is systemically biassed, by no means exclusively but most particularly, in relation to its coverage of so-called climate science. Its flagrant partiality is now the common currency of newspaper comment, as is its total absence of scruple in pursuit of a leftist agenda. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n             On the specific subject of 'climate change', the so called “28gate” revelations have now laid bare its mendacity,\n \nas has the rejection by BBC management of the findings of its own enquiry established to report into bias within climate change coverage. Neither was the damage lessened by subsequent attempts to invoke the assistance of a bought scientist. His basic recommendation that the BBC should give even less coverage \nto questioning\n voices merely made him and his paymasters appear disreputable. After all, even less of\n \nnothing remains nothing. Disrepute was only aggravated by an inept attempt to justify this on the grounds that any such open dialogue would inevitably involve only genuine scientists on the one side pitted against ignorant but vociferous laity on the other. As many were able to point out, heavy weight scientists, including formidable names specialising in the field, were easy to identify in substantial numbers. If nothing else, to the man in the street, this made it clear beyond dispute that anthropogenic global warming, far from being a settled consensus, was in reality a maelstrom of conflicting opinion within the scientific, not just the sceptical lay, communities.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC is now routinely in breach of its own Editorial Guidelines, supposedly a legal binding framework. Breaches of impartiality are a daily occurrence. Accuracy is subordinated to the party line. It becomes ever more difficult to identify journalistic reports from which the prejudicial opinion of the reporter is excluded. And, needless to say, the supposed right of reply is impudently ignored. In a nutshell, the BBC is corrupt. It is seen to be, and is not trusted. That an icon such as David Attenborough should be seen to be 'sexing up' reports adds to public disillusionment and cynicism.\n&#xa0;\n4.5  \nThe Royal SocietyUnder the stewardships of its last three Presidents, from being a national treasure, the Royal Society has become a  propagandist for the human induced climate change paradigm. It is fair to state that over the course of the past decade, the RS has exercised all its authority and prestige in advancing the orthodoxy by lending to it a spurious veneer of scientific/intellectual respectability. It has gone to inordinate lengths to encourage acceptance of the proclaimed consensus and to discourage all debate. With respect to the latter, I am able to speak from experience. More to the point, even significant numbers of its own Fellows have expressed disquiet at the public stance of the Society. This too is in the public domain, and the public at large is increasingly aware that the alleged consensus is not even remotely as monolithic as is claimed by pseudo-environmental jihadists.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 \nAcademiaMutatis mutandis, much of the foregoing relating to the RS may be transposed to academia at large, especially scientific academia.\n&#xa0;\n4.7  \nThe print mediaExcept amongst AGW cult fundamentalists, the reputations of The Guardian and The Independent have been increasingly under attack for their unshakeable left wing cultist prejudice. The Daily Telegraph has gained credibility, because it has consistently over a long period entertained both sides of the debate. A sea change, however, has occurred within the daily tabloids. Two years ago sceptical articles were rare to the point of extinction. They can now be described almost as the default position for bo\nth copy and editorial comment.\n&#xa0;\n 4.8\n  DECC, DEFRA, Government Chief ScientistWidely seen to be tainted sources of information. Distrusted to the point of  derision.\n&#xa0;\n4.9 \n Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF)The effectiveness of this foundation needs little comment. Even by AGW proselytisers its impact has been openly acknowledged. Arguably, success in its aims has been proportionate to its avoidance of theological certitude. Whether or not this is so, what is very clear is that its detractors are at a loss as to how to counter its\n \ninfluence. As a result, and in keeping with industry custom and practice, their \nfallback\n position has been ad hominem innuendo, primarily related to its source of funding. That such should be repeated by its current President demonstrates more clearly than anything else the loss of dignity suffered by The Royal Society as well as the depths of corruption it has plumbed under his stewardship and those of his two predecessors. \n&#xa0;\n4.10 \nPersonal experienceThe cognitive dissonance between what they are being told and what they experience for themselves is not lost on the public. Their senses tell them that state pronouncements on supposed climate change are no better than outright falsehoods, the consequences of which are substantially impoverishing them. Moreover, huge numbers of citizens of a certain age have clear recollection of precedents without number for allegedly unusual and anarchic weather events. The Committee may wish to bear in mind that most can also read! The public is being hit in the pocket for no good reason. It is this - not the science, not the vapourings of parliamentary committees, nor even the evidence of their own senses - that will discredit the whole climate change farrago.\n&#xa0;\n4.11 \nThe blogosphereSince officially sponsored information cannot be trusted, the internet is now the predominant source of dispassionate and reliable information on putative climate change. Numerous highly regarded blogs exist, which cover all aspects of the subject by recourse to data not unsubstantiated assertion, with many being run by, or closely associated with, scientists of immense prestige, who are dismissive of  the orthodoxy.\n&#xa0;\n5.  SummaryThis \nsubmission can be distilled as follows:\n &#xa0;&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncorruption of politics, both at national and local level;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncorruption of national institutions - the Royal Society and the BBC, most conspicuously;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsubversion of the integrity of the scientific enterprise and the education of the young; \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndespoliation of the natural environment;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nimmense pollution and habitat expropriation, albeit not necessarily on these shores;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndiversion of financial resources on a blanching scale into worthless palliatives to non-existent problems;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nimpoverishment of populations, both at home and abroad, to no good end,\n \nwhich has been the subject of\n \nrepeated critical comment, as has been, in parallel, the self-enrichment of key players\n&#xa0;\n6. \nTerms of referenceIt is clear that the key driver for the Committee's solicitation of submissions from the public lies less in any desire to seek truth, but rather in the hope that ways will be opened for the manipulation of public opinion. As to the terms of reference, comment is made as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.   \nPostscript \nAnthropogenic Global Warming, speciously morphed to 'Climate Change', is not a scientific issue at all. The science is clear. There is no demonstrable causal linkage between carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and global mean temperature. Neither is there any evidence that modest rises in global mean temperature would be anything other than beneficial. \n&#xa0;\nRather, because it represents a full frontal assault on the very notion of open and objective debate and evidence led scientific investigation, it constitutes a fundamental ethical issue of unique significance.\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
