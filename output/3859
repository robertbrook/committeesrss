defaultMind responded to the government’s consultation 
default“Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform
default.
default”
default 
defaultMind considers j
defaultudicial review 
defaultto be 
defaulta key tool for ensuring that the rights of people with experience of mental health problems are protected, promoted and upheld. 
defaultThe ability to hold the executive to account is a fundamental tenet of a democratic society
default and 
defaultMind’s view is that the 
defaultgovernme
defaultnt’s proposals will severely dilute the constitutional rights of citizens and undermine the role of the judiciary in holding public bodies accountable.
default 
defaultMind 
defaulti
defaults deeply concerned about the impact of the proposals on people who expe
defaultrience mental health proble
defaultms and we have outlined our concerns below.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.default              defaultStandingdefault:default defaultThe proposed introduction of a narrower test for “standing” to apply for judicial review, so as to limit the range of people and groups who are entitled to invoke the proceduredefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default2.
default1
default              
defaultThe courts 
defaulthave 
defaultrecognised
default the value of claims being brought by those without a direct interest in the proceedings:
default&#xa0;
default“Public law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs - that is to say misus
defaultes of public power; and the courts have always been alive to the fact that a person or 
defaultorganisation
default with no particular stake in the 
defaultissue or the outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the co
defaulturt to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for leave, the court's only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive.”
default&#xa0;
default2.
default2
default              
defaultAdditionally, the government itself 
defaultacknowledge
defaultd
default 
defaultin the consultation 
defaultthat cases brought by NGOs, charities and pressure groups tend to be valid claims:
default&#xa0;
default“From Administrative Court records for cases lodged between 2007 and 2011 around 50 judicial reviews per year have been identified that app
defaultear to have been lodged by NGOs, charities, pressure groups and faith 
defaultorganisations
default, i.e. by claimants who may not have had a direct interest in the matter at hand. The identified cases tended to be relatively successful compared to other JR cases.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOrganisations
default that bring cases as representatives of a group of individuals are best placed to provide the court with an expert view. This means that the court can focus on the underlying issue rather than on the specific facts of an individual case. The r
defaultisk posed by the proposal to change the rules on standing is that the courts will face a series of claims from various individuals when one would do. This would be neither cost effective nor efficient. 
defaultThe proposals to limit those with standing will impact
default on a minority of cases which are generally highly meritorious by virtue of their wider public interest.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Mind’s view, a test for standing that is any narrower than having to demonstrate “sufficient interest” risks interfering with the right to a remedy under Article 6 ECHR.  
default 
default&#xa0;default3.default              defaultThird Party Interventionsdefault: The proposed modification of the rules to discourdefaultage the involvement of interveners and third partiesdefault&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultThird parties make applications to intervene in a minority of cases in order to assist the court in understanding the wider implications of a case on often large numbers of people. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultMind has 
defaultintervened in a number of cases
default, 
defaultthe majority 
defaultof which have involved 
defaultbreaches of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms
default under human rights and equality legislation
default. Some examples are given below:
default&#xa0;
defaultSavage v 
defaultSouth Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
default and 
defaultRabone
default and another v 
defaultPennine
default Care NHS Foundation Trust
default 
defaultestablished 
defaulta positive duty on hospitals to ensure that they take reasonable steps to prevent mental health patients from taking their own lives. It was a challenge relating to the application o
defaultf Article 2 ECH
defaultR
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultMM and DM v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
default involves a challenge to the Employment Support Allowance (“ESA”) determination process based on the 
defaultfact that 
defaultit places people with mental health problems at 
defaulta 
defaultsubstantial 
defaultdisadvantage.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDas v Secretary of State for the Home Department
default concern
defaulted the threshold for determining whether p
defaulteople with mental health problems should be detained in immigration removal 
defaultcentres
default. 
defaultThis case was brought against the backdrop of four previ
defaultous cases in which the 
defaultc
defaultourt found breaches of Article 3.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultP v Cheshire West and Chester Council
default &amp; P and Q v Surrey County Council
default concerned the proper approach to the question of when a person is deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article
default 5 ECHR. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe above case examples concern matters of fundamental importance to 
defaultMind’s beneficiaries and it 
defaultis imperative, in Mind’s view, that 
defaultthe rules on interveners remain as they are in order for the court to decide whether it would benefit from the 
defaultex
defaultp
defaultert evidence 
defaultthat 
defaultthird parties 
defaultare in a unique position to 
defaultprovide.

defaultCostsdefault: The proposed rebalancing of financial incentives so that providers are only paid for work carried out on judicial review cases where permission is granted, or exceptionallydefault in the Legal Aid Agency’s discretiondefault default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultAside from the fact that the government a
defaultppears
default to be suggesting that public lawyers pursue cases for reasons other than that their client has a valid claim and that the Legal Aid Agency 
default(LAA) 
defaultgrants funding for unmeritorious cases, Mind has 
defaulta number of concerns relating to this proposal.  
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultT
defaulthere is a risk that the courts will become clogged with applications for costs determinations. This can be a lengthy process and will require provider
defaults to 
defaultsubsidise
default the costs of litigation which is not viable for many firms, particularly those which undertake predominantly legal aid work. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultAnother
default undesirable result of th
defaulte
default proposal is that specialist public law firms, with many years experience of 
defaultjudicial review, may cease taking on judicial review cases because it is not financially viable for them to do so. 
defaultThe risk is that 
defaultnon-specialist lawyers 
defaultwill 
defaultattempt to turn their hand to judicial review which will increase the likelihood of unmeritoriou
defaults/vexatious and poorly prepared claims being brought. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultV
defaultulnerable clients, for example those wit
defaulth mental health problems, sometimes 
defaultchange their mind about pursuing a claim part way through the 
defaultprocess – i.e. between issuing the proceedings and permission being granted. They may choose to discontinue a claim because they find the process too stressful, or because they have a lack of tr
defaultust in the process as a result 
defaultof a previous bad experience. Therefore, pr
defaultoviders may be less willing to act for vulnerable clients due to the risk of not getting paid.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultT
defaulthe introduction of 
defaultdiscretion
default for the 
defaultLAA
default to pay providers in cases where proceed
defaultings are issued, but the case concludes prior to a permission decision, 
defaultis likely to lead to a significant number of claims being brought against the LAA. Where its application of the criteria leads to non-payment, providers will have no choice but to moun
defaultt such challenges. Ironically, this would increase the number of judicial review applications made.   
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultPeople with mental health problems are more likely to access health and community care services. Where the provision of such services is refused or 
defaultreduced, the appropriate remedy is judicial review where all other avenues have been exhausted. If these proposals go ahead, such individuals will effectively have no remedy beyond pursuing a complaint, as they will struggle to find a lawyer able and/or wi
defaultlling to take their case on. 
defaultMind considers that the proposals to further curb access to legal aid risks 
defaultbreaching 
defaultindividuals
default’
default rights under Article 6 ECHR.

defaultTh

defaultector Equality Duty provides
default an important safeguard for
default our          
default           beneficiaries’ 
defaultrights,
default if public authoritie
defaults 
defaultcomply with it when providing 
default           
defaulteducation,
default health and social care, planning and 
defaultpolicing. If 
defaulta public authority 
default          
default fails to follow
default its obligations, judicial review may sometimes be the 
default           
defaultonly means by which an individual can challenge this failure
default. Raising a   
default       
default    
defaultcomplaint is usually a lengthy process and does not prompt urgent action.  
default 
default           
defaultThis remedy is important
default for people who have mental
default         
default 
default 
defaulthealth
default problems as th
defaultey are likely to be more depende
defaultnt upon public

defaultauthorities.
default A pre-action protocol letter may be enough to secure change

defaultll be small.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default             
default 
default&#xa0;default6.default              defaultThe combined effect of these proposals with the government’s proposals to reform legal aid, in particular thdefaulte introduction of a residence test  default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultUnder the 
defaultresidence test
default, a person detained in 
defaulta 
defaultpsychiatric hospital would 
defaultbe entitled 
defaultto advice as 
defaultthose subject to detention under the Mental Health Act are
default not
default e
defaultxc
defaultluded from 
defaultthe 12 month rule. However, once discharged into the 
defaultcommunity, 
defaultsuch an individual 
defaultwould 
defaultnot be entitled to legal aid to enforce their rights to social care support and housing 
defaultif the
defaulty
default could not satisfy the 
default12 month
default residence test
default. 
defaultA lack of adequate after
defaultcare services and/or accommodation 
defaultp
defaultlaces people 
defaultat serious risk of relapse and r
defaulte
defaultadmission 
defaultto hospital
default. 
defaultFrom enquiries to our Legal Advice Line, and from our work with advocates and service providers in local Minds, we know that some psychiatric patients, whether they have been detained or were admitted as voluntary inpatients, are discharged from hospital w
defaultithout any, or any adequate, aftercare services including social care support and housing. These people require legal assistance to enforce their rights. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimilarly, the 
default12 month residence test will 
defaultalso 
defaultnot apply to those in immigration detention
default. Howeve
defaultr, Home Office guidance stipulates that people with
default a 
defaultserious mental 
defaultillness which 
defaultcannot be satisfactorily managed in detention 
defaultare normally considered suitable for detention in only very exceptional circumstance
defaults
default.
default 
defaultThe 
default12 month residence test 
defaultcreate
defaults
default an 
defaultanomaly as those who are detained will be entitled to legal aid, but those who are living in the community, often with serious mental health problems
default and therefore significant support needs
default, will not.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultIn a climate of increasing cuts to public services, of which people with mental health problems are often beneficiaries, the government is attempting to severely restrict the ability of individuals to challenge the decisions, acts and omissions of public b
defaultodies. Combined with the further reforms to legal aid, in Mind’s opinion, the government’s plans 
defaultwould be catastrophic
default for people with mental health problems.
