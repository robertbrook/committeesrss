defaultCase study: Beth and Daniel 
defaultBeth’s grandfather, who was caring for her and her disabled brother Daniel during their mother’s detention, became seriously ill and was admitted to hospital three times. Beth had to stop attending school to care for her brother and grandfather and missed 
defaulther GCSE exams.   Beth found it extremely difficult to look after her seven year old brother, was has limited motor control and severe behavioural problems. Children’s Services deemed Daniel to be at risk of emotional and physical harm, and found that: ‘Da
defaultniel has found it very difficult being separated from his mother…  [A] concerned neighbour rang to report that Daniel was playing alone in the road at 8pm... he walks into people’s houses.’  
default&#xa0;
defaultTwo months into his mother’s detention Daniel was hit by a car.
default  Despite receiving reports about the welfare of these children, the Home Office detained their mother for 160 days before she was released on bail by the Tribunal. The Home Office subsequently awarded the family compensation for the mother’s detention. Un
defaultder the proposed residence test, this mother would not have been able to access Legal Aid for her civil claim challenging the legality of her detention.

defaultUnlike the State’s own nationals,

defaultCase study
defaultFaith was detained with her partner for 206 days after serving a prison sentence. Her four children were aged between one and 11 when she went to prison; the eldest child was a British Citizen. The children were extremely distressed, and some of them devel
defaultoped behavioural and health problems.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThree months into her detention, the Home Office wrote to Faith and her partner informing them that they intended to remove the parents and children together. The family had been separated for two years and five months. The Home Office noted the need for t
defaulthe children to ‘re-establish their relationship with their parents before removal,’ and envisaged that this might happen at Heathrow Airport. It is extremely concerning to see that the Home Office thought it would be appropriate to reunite these extremely 
defaultdistressed children with their parents during the course of their forced removal. This removal attempt was cancelled, and the Home Office arranged a new date for the family to be removed using the same method, but this was prevented by a Judicial Review ap
defaultplication. The parents were subsequently released from detention and granted leave to remain in the UK.
