[normal]While the reforms may result in an increase in numbers of litigants in per

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ‘
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid
[normal]’ consultation
[normal] exercise (
[normal]2013
[normal]) invited opinions on the proposal for 
[normal]a residence
[normal] test for 
[normal]civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to t
[normal]hose with a “strong connection” 
[normal]with the UK
[normal].  The 
[normal]subsequent 
[normal]consultation “Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps”
[normal], 
[normal]which 
[normal]closes on 18
[normal]th
[normal] October 2013,
[normal] introduce
[normal]s
[normal] a number of additional exceptions to the residence test.  The
[normal] consultation document states:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We have also concluded that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain matters of law would not be required to meet the residence test. The test will therefore not apply to categories of case which 
[normal]broadly rela
[normal]te to an individual’s liberty
[normal], where the individual is particularly vulnerable or where the case relates to the protection of children” (MoJ, 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“1. Detainees making applications 
[normal][release on] 
[normal]immigration 
[normal]bail
[normal]2. Detainees making applications for 
[normal][release on] tem
[normal]porary admission
[normal]Both these situations will be exempt from the residence test, where they qualify for funding under
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]paragraphs 5, 20, 25, 26 and 27
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO.

[normal]Case study: Beth and Daniel 
[normal]Beth’s grandfather, who was caring for her and her disabled brother Daniel during their mother’s detention, became seriously ill and was admitted to hospital three times. Beth had to stop attending school to care for her brother and grandfather and missed 
[normal]her GCSE exams.   Beth found it extremely difficult to look after her seven year old brother, was has limited motor control and severe behavioural problems. Children’s Services deemed Daniel to be at risk of emotional and physical harm, and found that: ‘Da
[normal]niel has found it very difficult being separated from his mother…  [A] concerned neighbour rang to report that Daniel was playing alone in the road at 8pm... he walks into people’s houses.’  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Two months into his mother’s detention Daniel was hit by a car.
[normal]  Despite receiving reports about the welfare of these children, the Home Office detained their mother for 160 days before she was released on bail by the Tribunal. The Home Office subsequently awarded the family compensation for the mother’s detention. Un
[normal]der the proposed residence test, this mother would not have been able to access Legal Aid for her civil claim challenging the legality of her detention.

[normal]Exceptional Funding[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Unlike the State’s own nationals, 
[normal]foreigners have to meet a further, exceptional, test. It is not enough that they have legal rights, legal merits and the absence of means. They must 
[normal]show that the refusal of funding in their individual case is itself a violation of the Human Rights Act 199
[normal]8 or EU law. That is unequal treatment which is unjustifiable. The prohibition does not focus on legitimacy of the resort to the Court, the nature of the issue, the viability of the argument. Being a foreigner does not indicate a lesser need, or a lesser j
[normal]ustification, for effective access to the Court
[normal]” (LIBERTY, 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“To deny legal aid altogether to such persons, so that even the minimal rights provided to them by the law cannot be
[normal] enforced, is in our view unconscionable”.

[normal]If not, t

[normal]to introduce a residence test 
[normal]should 
[normal]at the very least 
[normal]be subject 
[normal]to full Parliamentary scrutiny

[normal]“T
[normal]ackl[ing] the burden that the 
[normal]growth in unmeritorious judicial reviews has placed on stretched public services
[normal]…
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In this paper the Government sets out a series of further reforms which
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it states
[normal], seek
[normal] to address three interrelated issues: 
[normal]i. the
[normal] impact of judicial review on economic recovery and growth, ii.
[normal] The
[normal] inappropriate use of judicial review as a campaign tactic, iii. 
[normal]The
[normal] use of the delays and costs associated with judicial review to hinder actions the executive wishes to take.

[normal]Judicial [bold]reviews to challenge removal from the UK[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study
[normal]Faith was detained with her partner for 206 days after serving a prison sentence. Her four children were aged between one and 11 when she went to prison; the eldest child was a British Citizen. The children were extremely distressed, and some of them devel
[normal]oped behavioural and health problems.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Three months into her detention, the Home Office wrote to Faith and her partner informing them that they intended to remove the parents and children together. The family had been separated for two years and five months. The Home Office noted the need for t
[normal]he children to ‘re-establish their relationship with their parents before removal,’ and envisaged that this might happen at Heathrow Airport. It is extremely concerning to see that the Home Office thought it would be appropriate to reunite these extremely 
[normal]distressed children with their parents during the course of their forced removal. This removal attempt was cancelled, and the Home Office arranged a new date for the family to be removed using the same method, but this was prevented by a Judicial Review ap
[normal]plication. The parents were subsequently released from detention and granted leave to remain in the UK.
