defaultWritten evidence submitted by the UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (LCI0010)defaultBackgrounddefault: defaultWe asked the NAO to review “Public funding for innovation in low carbon technologies in the UK” and we are publishing their report and launching our own inquiry. The NAO report highlights that that since June 2010, DECC have taken steps to improve co-ordindefaultation of innovation funding. DECC re-launched the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG) in late-2011 comprising all the bodies involved in funding low carbon innovation: BIS, DECC, DEFRA, MOD, DfT, DCLG, UKTI, the Welsh Government, the Scottish defaultGovernment, the Energy Technology Institute, Crown Estate, Ofgem, Carbon Trust, Scottish Enterprise, Technology Strategy Board, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The LCICG is preparing a strategy for launch in early 2014, which shdefaultould include an assessment of the opportunities for funding for different low carbon technologies. The LCICG should also report on the different stages of the innovation process where public investment could be most effective.defaultHowever, the UK’s performancedefault on funding for low carbon innovation to date has been mixed. UK expenditure on energy research and development doubled betweendefault default2006-2011 and DECC allocated £185m for 2011-2015 for low carbon innovation: but it under-spent its budget between 2011-2013 becadefaultuse of delays in agreeing and launching its projects. Furthermore, there is no commitment beyond 2015 to a low carbon innovation budget, leaving industry uncertain on support for their investment in long-term innovation initiatives.defaultIntroductiondefaultThis paper
default provides the response from the UK Hydroge
defaultn and Fuel Cell Association to 
defaultthe 
default“Low carbon innovation” inquiry published by the Energy and Climate Change Committee in October 2013
default. 
defaultThe UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (U
defaultK HFCA) aims to accelerate the 
defaultc
defaultommercialization of fuel cell and hydrogen energy tech
defaultnologies. Through the breadth, 
defaultexpertise and diversity of our membership, we work
default to trigger the policy changes 
defaultrequired for the UK to fully realise the opportunities
default offered by these clean energy 
defaultsolut
defaultions and associated elements of the supply chain. 
defaultFuel cells and hydrogen are ‘game changing’ tec
defaulthnologies providing low-carbon 
defaultsolutions across transport, stationary power and b
defaulteyond. The growing industry is 
defaultalready bringing benefits that the UK cannot a
defaultffo
defaultrd to miss: creating new jobs, 
defaultsupporting UK economic growth and improved competi
defaulttiveness in the energy markets 
defaultglobally. 
defaultThis 
defaultsubmission
default has been produced through consultation
default with our members and presents 
defaultthe Association’s response to those aspects o
defaultf the consult
defaultation of most relevance to the 
defaultsector. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultOur key messages are:defaultUK HFCA Feedback on tdefaulterms of Reference: defaultWhilst the
default current approach towards low carbon innovation undoubtedly 
defaultoffers some benefit
defaults, 
defaultthe Government could provide further incentives to stimulate long-term public and private investment
default into the low carbon sector
default to help achieve policy objectives and avoid costly long term challenges around the rising cost of conventional fuels, securit
defaulty of supply and cost of carbon adaptation. 
defaultAdditionally,
default 
defaultlowest cost is not the only factor to consider.

default.
default 
defaultWe observe that the members of LCICG include a wide range of government departments with a wide range of scope, timescales
default, varying levels of understanding of low carbon innovation technologies
default and 
defaulta wealth of 
defaultother priorities.
default In 
defaultorder

defaultbe focused on “legally binding targets” and “lowest possible cost”
default, 
defaulta consistent approach to assess
defaulting, prioritising
default and monitor

default the progress o
defaultf the projects that are funded is 
defaultrequired
default, 
defaultand is
default not evident today
default. T
defaulthe LCI

defaultco-ordinate
default this activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever
default,
default it
default is also 
defaultimportant to 
defaulthighlight 
defaultthat:     
defaultFrom the members of UKHFCA experience
default,
default the two criteria being tested
default 
defaultare 
defaultnot 
defaultthe
defaultrefore the
default only criteria by which innovation funding 
defaultshould be 
defaultassessed
default. 
defaultFor instance
default, from a 
defaultBIS perspective, ability to contribute t
defaulto UK growth is 
defaultincluded in funds that are administered through the Technology Strategy board, as well as allowing for applied research projects that may or may not deliver innovation that 
defaultcan be deployed 
defaultwithin the timescales of the legally binding targets
default, or within the UK alone.  For instance
default,
default 
defaultt
defaulthe European
default 
defaultFuel Cells and Hydrogen
default industry has seen annual turnover increase by 10% over the past five years
default1
default, t
defaulthe global fuel cell and hydrogen energy market is projected to be worth over $15 billion by 2017
default2
default, 
defaultgrowing to $180 billion in 2050
default3
default, 
defaultand r
defaultevenues in the fuel cell sector are projected to grow at a rate of 26% annually over the next decade
default3
default. This substantial 
defaultopportunity should not be neglected by the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our view that th
defaulte government’s approach towards low carbon innovation 
defaultdoes not have the right balance as it 
defaultis not structured to facilitate the introduction of new tech
defaultnologies (such as hydrogen and fuel cells)
default that do not fit “neatly”
default into existing policy schemes
default. Furthermore,
default 
defaultthere are no planned policy schemes that could support the needs of a small scale and not fully market ready sector (such as hydrogen and fuel ce
defaultlls). For example, the next steps of the EMR (Capacity Market and Contracts for Difference) will address the needs of fully commercialised
default sectors
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultn a similar basis, 
defaultthe 
defaultexisting Government structures
default 
defaultfail to recognise the convergence of previously dive
defaultrse parts of the energy space (e.g. electricity for vehicles and heating)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultorder to maximise the options for the UK in delivering its carbon objectives, the scope of Government thinking, and support for innovation, needs to be extended beyond the ‘usual suspects’. This should include evaluations of technologies with significant p
defaultotential which is not currently recognised by either Government thinking or support, such as fuel cells and hydrogen, so that new strategies can be developed to help the UK optimise its response to the opportunity. 
defaultSpecifically for 
defaulthydrogen and fuel cells
default,
default o
defaultutcomes from the LCI
defaultC
defaultG would therefore
default need to
default include a
defaultnalyses to support the sector
default, 
defaultsuch as 
defaultRoad mapping of future pathways and options (across all 
defaultmarkets), and evaluation of the business case. These will help to define the best pan-application poli
defaultcies and support mechanisms to sit alongside those available for other low carbon technologies.
default 
defaultIn addition, it would be most useful for the sector if the Energy and Climate Change Committee launched in the short-term a specific inquiry on hydrogen and fu
defaultel cells where written and / or oral submissions would provide the evidence required to stimulate Gove
defaultrnment’s thinking and support for
default the sector.
defaultSuch is the challenge of low carbon innovation that i
defaultnvestment needs to be targeted across all stages of the innovation process. 
defaultFor innovative disruptive technology for which there is a small but growing industry opportunity
default, such as 
defaulthydrogen and fuel cells
default,
default there is a need for on-going R&amp;D in all stages
default of the
default pipeline. Over the long term
default, the G
defaultovernment can particularly play a role in defining market needs, risk mitigation, demonstration and scale. 
default&#xa0;
defaultShort term funding timelines are not helpful in any aspect of low carbon innovation. Private sector investment needs to 
defaultbe 
defaultgiven 
defaultconsistent long term strategies and risk mitigation support to h
defaultave confidence in 
defaultmatch funding investment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDECC should ensure
default that its remaining capital allocation is wisely spent by doing work to understand which technologies should be receiving funding. As mentioned above, in question 3, technologies with substantial potential
default, such as hydrogen and fuel cells,
default are currently ov
defaulterlooked. 
defaultA more practical recommendation would be for DECC to identify ways to 
defaultaccelerate
default the process of getting contracts figured out.
defaultIt also debatable why the LCICG needed to have their own projects and couldn’t use existing funding providers with est
defaultablished contracts and competition processes already such as Carbon Trust, TSB etc. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the moment, the Government is not maximi
defaultsing opportunities to learn from and partner with international players. Other countries
default 
defaulthave understood the potential of the
default fuel cell and hydrogen
default sector
default and are investing to reap the benefits
default.
default For example, Germany
default has established
default a strategic alliance ca
defaultlled the National Innovation Programme Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP). NIP is 
defaultintended to speed up the process of market preparation of products based on this technology. The total budget 
defaultfor the 10 year 
defaultperiod 
defaultto
default 2016 amounts to € 1.4 billion. 
defaultHa
defaultlf of this is provided by 
defaultThe Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi, Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie), while the balance is funded by participating 
defaultindustry.
default 
defaultNIP is divided into four programme areas to advance numerous hydrogen and fuel cell technology product and application options
default in parallel
default, and to be able to address in a targeted way the market-specific challenges of market preparation. The 
defaultspec
defaultific
default programme areas are: “Transport and Hydrogen Infrastructure”, “Hydrogen Provision”, “Stationary Energy Supply”, and “Special Markets”. With 
defaulta view to
default series production of c
defaultomponents, the explicit focus of
default all programme areas is on the strengthening of
default the supply industry.
