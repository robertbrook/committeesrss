"Written evidence from John Dwyer, Police and Crime Commissioner, Cheshire [CST0041]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?&#xa0;\nThe only target set by my Police and Crime Plan is that of reducing crime, there are no targets set for individual crime types nor for detection. \nHowever\n contained within my plan there are measures to allow \nme to perform my statutory functions and hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the Constabulary. T\nhese have been developed and agreed with the Constabulary, in order to ensure that they result in effective and meaningful data and to \nmake certain\n that they do not \nresult in \nperverse incentiv\nes, thus driving bad\n practice. \n&#xa0;\nHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? &#xa0;\nThe Constabulary rigorously audits its crime recording, analysing anomalies to understand the reasons for them and this is \nscrutinised by \nme \nas part of my scrutiny processes. This process includes quarterly Public Scrutiny Boards and monthly meetings with the Chief\n Constable and his Chief Officer team. \nI believe the Constabulary’s crime recording to \nbe good\n, it was judged as such by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2010 and \nI\n look forward to a further inspection of crime recording in the New Year.\n I have also commissioned a piece of work to be undertaken by the \nAudit Committee \nwhich will \nreview\n the integrity of crime recording practices in Cheshire and provide me with additional reassurance that standards are being properly applied. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
