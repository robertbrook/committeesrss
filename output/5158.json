"- \n4\n -\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nBritish American Tobacco UK Limited\n [TOB\n25\n]\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following submissions are made on behalf of \nBritish American Tobacco UK Limited\n (\n\"BATUK\") in relation to the inquiry into tobacco smuggling announced by the Home Affairs Committee (\n\"HAC\") on 23 July 2013 (the \n\"Inquiry\").  \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to the public statements made by the HAC, the Inquiry will consider what could and should be done to reduce tobacco smuggling and to disrupt the illegal trade in tobacco within the UK, with a particular focus on UK sanctions and enforcement, the incidence of illicit trade in Northern Ireland, the effects of tobacco-related legislation in the Republic of Ireland and the relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAddressing illicit trade is a real focus of \nthe BAT group of companies (\n\"BAT\")\n both in its end markets and at the highest levels of management.\n BAT attempts to combat the illicit tobacco trade in all of its manifestations, not least because BAT's commercial objectives are undermined by the proliferation of illicit product. \n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIllicit trade causes BAT to suffer direct revenue losses due to the proportion of the market taken by illegal product (described in section 2 below). Further, illicit trade affects BAT's business in more indirect ways:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompetition in the market is distorted since legal brands will be competing with much cheaper illegal product. \n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditional employees are required to monitor and counter the trade.\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCosts are increased, first to secure distribution networks and secondly to ensure that networks are free from involvement in illicit trade.\n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCounterfeit products result in a dilution of brand equity.\n(e)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legitimate tobacco industry as a whole is undermined by the erosion in consumer confidence.\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBAT is also concerned about the effects of illicit trade on society more generally. In particular, it notes that the market for illicit product is outside the control of governments, regulators and legitimate, responsible manufacturers and distributors. Both the public purse and public confidence are undermined, as the funds of the criminals who orchestrate the illicit market are swelled. \n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese submissions are structured as follows. BATUK will first describe the steps BAT takes, both globally and in the UK to tackle illicit trade. It will then describe the work of \nBAT's Anti Illicit Trade Intelligence Unit (\n\"AITIU\"). Finally it will address each of the specific questions raised by the HAC. \n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe illicit trade in tobacco products manifests itself in three main ways: smuggled (including \"illicit whites\"), counterfeit and local tax-evaded products. It is a global problem. Given that, in the UK, on average, 83\n%\n of the cost of a single pack of cigarettes is accounted for by tax, there are significant incentives for the consumer to seek out cheaper products and this encourages criminals to seek to fulfil this demand by evading tax. The incentives are so great that the illicit trade in tobacco products is presently a mainstay of organised crime.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEuromonitor\n International has recently estimated that, in 2011, 570 billion illicit cigarettes were consumed; equivalent to 11.5% of world cigarette consumption.\n On this basis, national governments are losing an accumulated estimated total of US $34 billion a year in tobacco taxes.\n HMRC\n has estimated that, in 2010-2011, illicit cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco (\n\"HRT\") accounted for approximately £1.86 billion in lost revenue for the UK alone.\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo put this in context, if Illicit Trade were a multinational tobacco company, its global market share \n(excluding China) would be 14%\n.\n \nBy way of comparison \nthis \nwould be just below \nBAT's \nmarket share \n(at 18%) and comparable to JTI\n’s\n (at 14.3%) and greater than  Imperial Tobacco\n’s\n (at 7.6%).\n \n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ITIC\n have found that the primary drivers for illicit trade are twofold:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nconsumers seeking to save money; and\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncriminals seeking to make money.\nThey have also identified the following as contributing factors to the problem of illicit trade:\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan unbalanced fiscal policy;\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndisparities in tax driven prices between jurisdictions;\n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nprotectionist policy measures;\n(iv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncorruption;\n(v)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nweak enforcement;\n(vi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nlack of robust controls in free trade zones and on goods in transit;\n(vii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ninadequate legislation and sanctions;\n(viii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ngrowth in illegal distribution networks; and\n(ix)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npublic tolerance of the illicit trade in tobacco products.\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe prevalence of illicit trade is closely linked to economic conditions. In tougher economic times increasing numbers of people are likely to seek cheaper tobacco products. Further, where legitimate tobacco products are becoming more expensive, the combination makes it even more likely that people will seek cheaper product. High taxation on tobacco products thus exacerbates illicit trade. \n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe prevalence of illicit trade is also linked to the robustness of law enforcement agencies to challenge organised crime. Without organised crime networks, large-scale smuggling and counterfeiting operations cannot function. Both OLAF\n and HMRC have recently emphasised the rapidly changing nature of the illicit market and the speed with which organised crime groups involved in illicit trade adapt to new developments in the demand for tobacco products and respond to evolving investigative techniques and procedures.\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe tobacco industry cannot, by its actions, positively affect global or national economies (except insofar as it continues to flourish as an employer and taxpayer).  Nor can BAT, in isolation, combat organised crime. However, it is ready and willing to offer appropriate support to national and supranational law enforcement bodies to aid their efforts in combatting illicit trade.\n \n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBAT has a dedicated group, fully integrated within the business, to combat illicit trade. Its head sits on BAT's Global Legal Board.\n A multi-functional anti-illicit trade (\n\"AIT\") Steering Group has been established. AIT Regional Managers are supported by employees in all end markets, with dedicated AIT Managers in the most important markets for AIT.\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBAT's AITIU operates at and above market level and has a global scope for its range of specialist operations. The Unit conducts investigations into all forms of illicit trade and provides intelligence on illicit production, supply and movement of illicit product and the criminals involved to law enforcement agencies around the world. Operating to agreed business priorities and upon legal advice,\n the AITIU cooperates with police and customs officials to bring enforcement action against illicit traders.  The AITIU is based at BAT's London head office, and its activities are controlled through four geographical regions (Turkey, Africa and Middle East, Americas, \nAsia/Pacific\n and Europe). The AITIU also has a dedicated laboratory for forensic analysis located \nin Southampton. \n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe AITIU has developed particularly strong relationships with prominent law enforcement authorities and delivers presentations and other training to customs officials in numerous countries across the globe. \n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the realm of intelligence-sharing, the tobacco industry's relationship with HMRC is particularly constructive; a matter reflected in the National Audit Office's report dated 6 June 2013\n and in HMRC's evidence to the House of Lords EU Select Committee.\n In February 2013, the major tobacco multinationals agreed an \nIntelligence Sharing Protocol\n with HMRC, which has been incorporated within a newly agreed Memorandum of Understanding, to be signed in September.\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBAT's AITIU has a firmly established working relationship with HMRC's Risk and Intelligence Service, especially regarding intelligence leading to the interception overseas of illicit product destined for the UK. In this regard BAT's end market AIT Managers fully cooperate with HMRC's FCLOs (Fiscal and Criminal Liaison Officers).\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBAT recently engaged Sir Ronald \nFlana\ngan, former Chief Constable of the RUC\n and PSNI\n and former HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, as an external consultant and advisor on tackling illicit trade.\n Following his distinguished career in the police force, which included 32 years of service in Northern Ireland, Sir Ronnie is now a recognised global expert in policing, organised crime and counter terrorism strategy. Given the terms of reference for the Inquiry, it may assist the Inquiry to understand Sir Ronnie's \nviews. BATUK therefore appends to these submissions a letter from Sir Ronnie.\n \n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK is not in a position to address this question directly as this is a matter for the legislating, prosecuting and judicial authorities and those involved in the allocation of resources and budgets in this sphere. BAT cooperates and intends to continue to cooperate with HMRC and other enforcement authorities to ensure that the trade in illicit tobacco is effectively tackled. BAT's AITIU regularly liaises with HMRC, sharing its intelligence whenever possible. \n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK takes the view that the falling trend in the numbers of arrests, prosecutions and convictions should be reversed as soon as possible. The illicit trade in tobacco remains a significant issue. Even in present economic conditions, where resources are limited, the illegal tobacco trade should be a focus of law enforcement bodies. Tobacco smuggling is not a victimless crime. The trade in illicit tobacco is predominantly controlled by organised criminals and the considerable profits are often used to fund other illegal operations. Further, with tobacco in the hands of criminals, rather than responsible manufacturers, distributors and retailers, there is no control of the sale of such products to children, nor are there controls on the constituent materials used in the counterfeit products, illicit whites and unbranded, loose tobacco/cut rag that are prevalent in the illicit market. \n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, BAT's intelligence suggests that, worryingly, because of the economic conditions, more previously law-abiding people are becoming tempted to transport, sell and/or purchase illicit tobacco. In some communities the practice is becoming endemic such that such criminality has been normalised and is no longer a taboo. This is a matter that requires the active focus of the enforcement authorities.\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgain, BATUK is unable to make substantive submissions in respect of this question. To the extent that this is a question of resource, it refers to its submissions made in section 4 above.\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK notes that in the EU, t\nhe\nre is an inherent\n conflict between \nthe overarching principles of the free movement of goods and people that bind the Union and the notion of\n differential tax\n rates between Member States, which are exploited by smugglers. It is only when a smuggler brings legitimately purchased product across a border, typically from a lower tax country to a higher tax country, without paying the necessary duties and with the intention of selling them on, that the product can be classed as illicit. The difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate cross-border movement and smuggling thus presents a considerable\n \nenforcement \nchallenge\n. \n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK also notes that tobacco smugglers are sophisticated criminals, whose intent is to avoid detection from the authorities. Their \nmodi\n operandi are constantly evolving and it is doubtless difficult for Border Force to anticipate their moves. Nevertheless, BATUK suspects that a disjointed approach to intelligence sharing is assisting the smugglers. In the UK, the police, HMRC, Border Force, SOCA/NCA, Trading Standards and the postal service may all have intelligence that, if shared in an appropriate forum, would assist the operations of Border Force and more effective enforcement generally.  \n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBAT also recommends greater mutuality in the sharing of intelligence between the public and private sectors. This would enhance the effectiveness of AIT operations. \n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK notes that the 2011 HMRC and UK Border Agency joint strategy paper on tobacco smuggling set out a range of \"\nhard-hitting sanctions\n\" to deter smugglers.\n BATUK fully supports the implementation of these measures.\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK supports stringent penalties and sanctions for tobacco smugglers. It notes the maximum penalty that can be levied against a tobacco manufacturer for breaches of s7A Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979\n is a penalty of up to £5 million and would recommend that sanctions for individuals and organisations that are found guilty of smuggling offences to be similarly severe. \n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSaying this should not detract from BATUK's view that the Inquiry should primarily be focussing on the minimum sanction levels. By increasing the minimum level sanctions, the deterrent for low level smuggling increases. It will similarly deter those businesses (including retailers and distributors) tempted to become involved, in the current difficult economic climate, in illicit activity. Further, legitimate retailers and other businesses engaged in the legitimate supply chain (on whose profits illicit trade is having a real effect) will be assured that the Government and enforcement authorities are tackling the illicit tobacco trade.      \n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency operations in Northern Ireland7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe AITIU's understanding of illicit trade in Ireland is that illicit tobacco enters the country both direct from outside the British Isles and from the UK, where it has either been locally \nmanufactured or travelled in transit. Illicit product, of which the majority is understood to be illicit whites, enters Dublin by ship, by plane, across the\n border with Northern Ireland \nand by post. \n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe AITIU \nis\n aware of large quantities of illicit product entering Ire\nland from a range of 'source'\n countries (e.g. China, the Philippines, Eastern Europe and the Canary Islands)\n via a host of other \n'transit' \ncountries (e.g. Vietnam, Malaysia, UAE, Panama, Greece). The U\nnit\n also believes that illicit product is being manufactured locally. There is\n a\n proliferation of illegal enterprises involved in the trade, from criminal cells with terrorist links to dual (part legitimate/part illegitimate) businesses. Such enterprises tend to be well organised and sophisticated. \n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the same time, the available statistics appear to demonstrate that the Irish authorities are experiencing difficulties in controlling and combatting illicit trade. By way of illustration only, 11,157\n kg of \nHRT\n \nwas seized in 2011, falling to 5,277 kg HRT in 2012. This year, between January and June 2013, the Irish Revenue has seized approximately only 950 kg HRT.\n \nYet this fall cannot be attributed to falling incidence\n.\n BAT is unaware of a single conviction for tobacco smuggling in Ireland in recent years.\n7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough BATUK understands the Irish revenue authorities estimate illicit cigarettes to comprise approximately 13% of total cigarette consumption in Ireland,\n BAT's estimates are much higher (28-30%).\n For HRT, BAT estimates that figure to be as high as 40%. Comparable estimates for the UK would be in the region of \n9-15% (cigarettes) and 38% (HRT).\n \n7.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs with the UK, anecdotal evidence suggests there is a troubling increase in the proportion of the Irish population that accepts the sale, purchase and consumption of illicit tobacco as legitimate, or at least commonplace, conduct.\n7.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther, BAT believes that a significant proportion of illicit product entering Ireland is destined for the UK market. Brands of illicit whites that have been seized by Irish authorities do not tally with the favoured Irish brands for consumption identified by empty pack surveys in Ireland. Certain seized brands such as \"Golden Eagle\", \"Master\", \"Jim\" and \"Capital\" tend not to be smoked in Ireland but are popular in the UK. The presence of such brands in seizures suggests that such cargoes were intended for the UK market. \n7.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is noted that a recent national newspaper article stated that, even now, Senior \nGardai\n and Customs officers estimate that between 150 and 200 million cigarettes of illicit cigarettes are smuggled by organised criminal networks from Ireland into the UK each year.\n7.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIllicit trade in tobacco is a real problem in Ireland and we would urge the UK and Irish authorities to cooperate to deal most effectively with it.\n8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is difficult to hypothesise at this premature stage about the possible effects of standardised packaging in Ireland on the UK. BATUK therefore can merely identify potential risks. In this regard BATUK notes that HMRC also appreciates that there are significant potential risks that the introduction of Plain Packaging, at least in the UK, will negatively impact levels of illicit trade (albeit they consider that those risks are not insurmountable).\n8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIreland, like the UK, is a high tax jurisdiction compared with the rest of Europe. Also, the geographical position of Ireland as an island off mainland Europe is similar to that of the UK.  It is reasonable, therefore, to expect the introduction of Plain Packaging in Ireland to have similar effects to that expected to be occasioned by its possible introduction in the UK.\n8.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn BATUK's responsive submissions to the UK Standardised Packaging Consultation, BATUK explained that Plain Packaging (as defined in those submissions) would drive growth in all segments of the illicit market,\n more easily facilitate counterfeiting and smuggling and thereby the distribution of products through unregulated, untaxed criminal networks,\n and stimulate both legal and illegal cross border trade.\n It also noted the particular stimulus Plain Packaging would give to the trade in illicit whites.\n \n8.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK understands that the demand for illicit whites in Ireland is already growing rapidly and anticipates that the introduction of Plain Packaging would only encourage such demand further. Increased demand will lead to increased supply. An increased amount of product coming from overseas direct into Ireland is likely to spill over across the Northern \nIrish border and elsewhere into the UK. There may also be increased levels of illicit product in transit through the UK to Ireland, which may result in some of the illicit cargo leaking into the UK market. \n8.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther, t\nhe increased demand may also lead to an increase \nin\n illicit product manufactured in the UK.  \n8.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSystemic links between the illicit tobacco trade in Ireland and organised crime further raise the prospect of higher rates of illicit product entering the UK market. Where there is considerable profit to be made in a market so close to home and penetrable, it is very likely that criminals will seek to exploit that further market.\n9.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK understands \nthat some significant individuals involved with tobacco smuggling\n i\nn Ireland are members of terrorist groups\n. BAT's intelligence is supported by recent articles in the national and Irish press concerning the links between former members of the IRA and the illicit trade in tobacco.\n The matter has also been addressed in the international press\n and in a recent \nTranscrime\n report.\n  \n9.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBATUK would urge the Inquiry to ensure that whatever can be done to reduce the illegal tobacco trade in Ireland and Northern Ireland is done and BAT commits to continue to assist the authorities in this regard.\n \nAs ex-\nP\nS\nN\nI deputy chief constable Alan \nMcQuillan\n is quoted as saying: \"\nOn every level this is a crime that damages the public purse, funds terrorism and crime and damages health\n\".\n \n10.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary, BAT takes a proactive stance to combatting the illicit tobacco trade in all its forms and allocates a significant amount of resource in this regard. BATUK supports the objectives of the Inquiry (to consider what can be done to reduce tobacco smuggling and to disrupt the illegal trade in tobacco in the UK) and urges the Inquiry to make positive recommendations to improve detection and prosecutions in this sphere, to ensure \nsanctions (particularly at the lower levels) are sufficient and appropriately applied by the courts, and to address intelligence sharing amongst key public bodies. \n10.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt also is pleased that the Inquiry seeks to investigate further the impact of illicit trade in Ireland on the UK, given Ireland's suspected role as a gateway for illicit product to enter the UK market and urges the UK Government to work with its Irish counterparts in this regard. Finally, BATUK reaffirms BAT's commitment to working with the UK authorities in its AIT endeavours.  \n&#xa0;\nBritish American Tobacco UK LimitedAugust 2013AnnexLetter to the Committee from Sir Ronald Flanagan, 28 August 2013TOB\nACCO \nSMUGGLING\n&#xa0;\nI am \nawa\nr\ne of \nthe decision \nof the \nHome \nAffairs Select Committee \nto conduct \nan invest\nig\nation \ninto \nthe effects of illicit \nt\nr\nade in t\nh\ne \ntobacco \nindustry. \nI \nhave read the online \nr\nemi\nt \npublished by the Committee and \nI \nwri\nt\ne \nto \noffer my views in this \narea \nto the extent they \nmay be of \ni\nnt\neres\nt \nor cons\nid\nered \nof value to the \nCommittee's work.\n&#xa0;\nI \nam \ncurrently resident in the \nUnited \nArab \nEmirates; my present \nrole \nbei\nn\ng the \npolicing and secu\nr\nity \nadviser \nt\no \nthe offices \nof \nthe Deputy Prime Minister \nand Minister of Interior.

My role in assisting BAT in \nthis \nre\ngard \nis confined strictly \nto the \nanti-illic\ni\nt \ntrade \nand \nI \ndo no\nt \nconsider myself, \ni\nn \nany sense, \nto \nbe \nan advocate for the \ntobacco \nindustry. \nI \nsim\nply \nseek \nto assist, to \nt\nhe \nextent \nthat I \ncan, in reducing \nthe \nability of organised \ncrime groups \nand indeed \nterrorist \norganisations to profit from such illegal business and \ntheir \nuse \nof such prof\ni\nts \nin \nother areas of criminality, \ninc\nlu\nding \nterrorism, \ndrug-dealing, \nhuman traff\nick\ning and \nmoney-laundering\n. \nI have \nseen the submiss\ni\non \nto \nyou \nfrom \nBA\nT \nUK Ltd and \nI \nagree \nwith \nand endorse \nits \ncontent.\n&#xa0;\nBroadly, \nI \nbelieve that the key to \ngreater success in \ncombatting\n the evils \nfostered by profits \nof \nthe \nillicit \ntobacco \ntrade \nlie \nin \nmuch \ngreater collaboration (including \nintelligence-sharing) \nbetween private industry and public investigative \nand \nenforcement \nbodies\n. \nWh\ni\nlst I appreciate \nthat the \nCommittee's \nfocus \nin this instance is \non \nillicit tobacco \ntrade\n, \nin \nmy experience \nth\ne \nsame criminal/terrorist \ngroups \ndo not \nconfine \nthemselves \nto \nsingl\ne fie\nl\nds \nof \nracketeering\n, \nso I believe that \ngreater \ncollabora\nt\nion across a \nwide \nrange \nof affected \nindustries is also requ\nir\ned. There also needs \nto be \nappropriate \ncommunication strategies to reduce what \nI \nsee as a \ngrowing \nrisk of public tolerance of such activity.\n&#xa0;\nI \nbelieve \nthat \nthe public \nneeds to \nrealis\ne \nthat \nillicit \ntrade is \nnot \ns\nimply \na \nmatter of profit-loss to commercial \ncompanies. Rat\nh\ner, \nit \ncontributes to a massive \nloss \nto \nt\nhe nation's \nrevenue, \nwhich \nwould otherwise be spent on the 'public good'. The public also needs to be made more aware of\n \nthe other dreadful \ncriminal activity \n(referred \nto \nbriefly above), which is funded by profits in \nthis \ni\nllicit trade. Currently I believe that criminals see \nth\nis \narea (\ni\nllic\nit \ndealing \nin to\nbacco\n}, \nas \nbeing of \n'high profit' and relatively \n'low\n-r\nis\nk'. I feel \nthis attitude too must be changed \nthrough \nappropriate enforcement and punishment.\n&#xa0;\nSir Ronnie Flanagan\n28 \nAugust \n2013.\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n \n              \n\"\nIllicit Trade in Tobacco Products 2012: Will the new protocol prove effective?\n\" \nEuromonitor\n International \"Passport\" presentation dated March 2011, p5.\n \n              \n\"\nIllicit Trade in Tobacco Products 2012: Will the new protocol prove effective?\n\" \nEuromonitor\n International \"Passport\" presentation dated March 2011, p5.\n \n              \nIn this note, \"HMRC\" refers to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and its forebears.  \n \n              \n\"\nProgress in tackling tobacco smuggling\n\", National Audit Office, dated 6 June 2013, paragraph 1.8\n \n              \n\"\nIllicit Trade in Tobacco Products 2012: Will the new protocol prove effective?\n\" \nEuromonitor\n International \"Passport\" presentation dated March 2011, p5.\n \n              \nThe International Tax and Investment Center, in their report \"\nThe Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products and How to Tackle It\n\", p4.\n \n              \nThe European Anti-Fraud Office\n \n              \nAPPG Report, p36.
