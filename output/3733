[normal]contact within DH and is th
[normal]e link at executive level between PHE and the senior officials o
[normal]f DH, and also with ministers.

[normal]ctor General for Public Health;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]t
[normal]he SDS supports the Permanent Secretary in holding PHE to account and providing assurance on its performance. A critical mechanism is the quarterly accountability meetings, chai

[normal]Operational Autonomy[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]My noble friend is anxious for Public Health England to be and to be seen to be a trusted and impartial champion for the protection of the health of the people and free to provide advice based firmly on the science and the evidence. So are we.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“It will be essential for it and the Government to work together seamlessly and to share the same objectives. Anything less could severely limit the Secretary of State's capacity to undertake his statutory duty.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Public Health England will of course be its own master as regards the research that it undertakes, and it will be operationally independent, as I emphasised earlier.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“My noble friend Lady Cumberlege asked me whether PHE will be able to give professional advice freely to the public. We expect it to do precisely that, in much the same way that the Chief Medical Officer already does. It will be good practice for PHE and the department to consult each other about communications on public health matters, but with a view to agreeing the content, not censoring it. PHE data will be subject to the code of practice on official statistics, which severely restricts access to certain material by Ministers or officials before it is published. Within three years of PHE becoming operational we will undertake a review of its governance to ensure that it is entirely appropriate and effective
[normal].”
