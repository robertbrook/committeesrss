[[[1.0 ]]]

[[[Introduction ]]]&#xa0;

[[[1.1]]] CCPS is the Coalition of Care and support Providers in Scotland. Its membership    comprises more than 70 of the most substantial providers of care and support in Scotland’s voluntary sector, supporting approximately 350,000 people and their families, employing around 43,000 staff and managing a combined total income of over £1.3bn, of which an average of 78% per member organisation relates to service provision that is commissioned, purchased or otherwise funded by the public purse. &#xa0;

[[[1.2]]] CCPS members provide services right across the spectrum of care and support, including services for older people; children, young people and families; adults with physical and learning disabilities, sensory impairment, dementia, acquired brain or spinal injury; and people facing a range of challenges in their lives, including mental health problems, addictions and involvement in the criminal justice system.&#xa0;

[[[1.3]]] The Housing Support Enabling Unit (HSEU) works with providers of housing support across Scotland across the voluntary and private sectors and has done so since 2004. &#xa0;

[[[1.4]]] The Criminal Justice Voluntary Sector Forum (CJVSF) promotes the role of the voluntary sector within criminal justice and supports voluntary sector providers working in the field of criminal justice in Scotland to increase the impact of their activities.  &#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.1]]] Vulnerable people across Scotland face growing difficulties accessing and sustaining the housing and support they need due to the cumulative impact of welfare reform.  Providers of housing and housing support have concerns about the following aspects of welfare reform:

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The impact of ]]]

[[[changes to the way housing costs are dealt with under welfare reform]]]

[[[              ]]]                                                                                    

[[[3.1]]] One of the changes which has not yet been fully implemented but which is causing some concern is the plan to pay housing costs through a monthly payment directly to the tenant rather than to the landlord.  There have been various direct payments demonstration projects across the UK and they have highlighted an increase in rent arrears. Arrears across the demonstration projects ranged from 3% to 12%. In Scotland, Dunedin Canmore has been a demonstrator project and has found that ‘engagement, advice on budgeting and financial inclusion will involve markedly more intense housing management resource commitment and staff liaison than has traditionally been the case’. This could have significant cost implications in terms of housing management at a time when rental income is under increasing pressure.   In addition, we are aware that during this demonstration project a dedicated Citizens Advice Bureau adviser was made available to assist tenants and we are concerned that this level of resource will not be available to other registered social landlords on full roll out. &#xa0;

[[[3.4]]] Direct payment is just one aspect of welfare reform; there are other aspects, such as the expectation that claimants will submit benefit applications online which will have an impact on the way in which claimants obtain assistance to meet housing costs and will impact on the way local services provide support to do so . Under the Local Support Service Framework (LSSF) various groups of people, including those with support needs, may not be expected to manage direct payments and digital access at least initially.  This approach is to be welcomed.

[[[confusion which will serve]]]

[[[ only to ]]]

[[[disempower vulnerable claimants further.]]]

[[[  ]]]This is particularly important for those people using short term supported accommodation and the providers of those services including homeless hostels and womens refuges.&#xa0;

[[[3]]]

[[[.5]]] We are aware that under the LSSF, local partnerships are to be formed to assess and plan services to help claimants who require support to deal with the changes to the welfare system and that these partnerships may involve the voluntary sector. We have already provided some input into the DWP’s plans to use ‘keyworkers’ as a means of providing the assistance that vulnerable claimants will require.  

[[[We urge that a distinction between advice work and support work be maintained.]]]

[[[  ]]]Already we are aware that many housing support services are working with people who face increasingly complex issues around managing money and budgeting and there is a risk that support services are being diverted away from essential work on other important daily living skills and social skills. &#xa0;

[[[3.6]]] We note that the statutory issues relating to the claimant commitment will be dealt with separately from the local partnerships set out in the LSSF. 

[[[ ]]]We are already aware, however, that the support the voluntary sector has been offering to claimants can be negatively impacted upon by the requirements of the DWP’s ‘claimant commitment’.  One of the ways voluntary agencies have tried to help claimants has been to provide access to computers and the internet. The numbers of people that have been able to use this facility has been restricted by a requirement in some areas that claimants show they have been using the internet to job search on a full time basis.  

[[[We would suggest that statutory agencies (DWP and Work Programme) become i]]]

[[[nvolved with local partnerships at an appropriate level to ensure the support services, planned and delivered locally, are available and effective for all those who need them.]]]   &#xa0;

[[[3.7]]] In Scotland the ‘bedroom tax’ has affected 82,500 people.  This figure is somewhat lower than initially predicted due in part to the efforts made by social landlords to assist their tenants to move if at all possible. The scope for more people to move to smaller properties is, however, greatly limited by the lack of smaller properties.  It is estimated that 20,000 one bedroom properties will become available in the social rented sector in Scotland over the next year but 60,000 of the people affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ would need to move to a one bedroom property to avoid the penalty plus around 23,000 homeless households require a one bedroom property in a year.  It is evident that the ‘bedroom tax’ has created additional demand for a property type in short supply.  It is of particular concern that disabled people are being disproportionately affected by this penalty; 80% (63,500) of households in Scotland affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ include an adult with a disability under the Disability Discrimination Act. &#xa0;

[[[3.8]]] There are 3,200 single-bed households in City of Edinburgh Council area currently seeking housing &amp; only approximately 900 tenures available from local authority and registered social landlord allocations. In one week in May, 32 one bedroom social rented properties were advertised in Edinburgh, with an average of 121 bids per property through its choice based lettings system.  Of these 32 properties:•              4 were sheltered housing•              4 were amenity properties or had some sort of age restriction (usually 55 and over)•              8 were on the ground floorOf the 16 remaining properties there was an average of 149 bids per property.  This highlights the particular challenge that working age single people or couples may face in obtaining one bedroom accommodation.  This could be a particular issue for ex-offenders seeking to find settled accommodation; this is known to be an important factor in reducing the risk of re-offending. &#xa0;

[[[3.8]]] Disabled people living in properties which have housing adaptations are not exempt from the penalty and are being forced to make very difficult decisions about whether to look for another home or not.  To gain assistance with the penalty a disabled person can apply to their local authority for a discretionary housing payment but there is not entitlement to an award and even if one is made it will be time limited award with no future award guaranteed.  

[[[We urge that disabled people whose homes have housing adaptations be exempt from the ‘bedroom tax’.]]]

[[[3.9]]] We note that children are not expected to share bedrooms with disabled siblings.

[[[Supported Housing]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[4.1]]] Supported housing will be dealt with separately from the Universal Credit system initially but a new system will be developed in the future (2014 onwards) and it is likely that the Westminster Government will devolve funding to Scotland for supported housing.  The future funding of supported housing for those who require assistance to meet housing costs is uncertain.  There is particular concern about the future financial stability of supported housing in respect of:     unringfenced funding at a local level;     current cost of supported housing. &#xa0;

[[[4.2]]] In the meantime some supported housing in Scotland appears to be subject to aspects of welfare reform such as the ‘bedroom tax’, despite the Westminster Government’s stated intention to exempt supported housing from them.  The reason for this lies with the decision to restrict the definition of supported housing to that of Supported Exempt Accommodation (SEA).  Unfortunately SEA: &#xa0;

[[[4.3]]] A joint survey undertaken by the HSEU, the Scottish Federation and Housing Associations and Homeless Action Scotland in March 2013 found that many supported housing providers anticipated difficulty in gaining exemptions from aspects of welfare reform, such as the bedroom tax, because of the criteria associated with Supported Exempt Accommodation.  The survey found that:     housing services would not fall within the definitionof SEA. This could mean that some vulnerable people in Scotland will not be able to meet housing related costs associated with supported housing. some extent. Supported housing aimed at people with mental health problems;       people with learning disabilities; people with physical disabilities and homeless resettlement projects appear most likely not to meet the criteria for SEA.&#xa0;

[[[4.4]]] The DWP has acknowledged the need to update the existing definition of Supported Exempt Accommodation and while we welcome this decision we are concerned that indications so far suggest that local authority owned accommodation will not be included in any revision.  &#xa0;

[[[4.5]]] Almost a third of refuge accommodation is owned by local authorities in Scotland and does not qualify as exempt. The majority of local authorities have continued to exempt this accommodation from the under occupation charge for this financial year while they await the outcome of the DWP’s review of housing benefit and supported accommodation. In  some areas, however, there has already been an impact on refuge services, for instance in one area where a refuge has been assessed as not qualifying as exempt (although this is being challenged) it is now unable to offer a service to women and children unless they would qualify for a 3 bedroom flat under the ‘bedroom tax’ rules.  In other areas Women’s Aid services are being advised that the local authority grant they have come to rely on will be reduced in the next year to offset the costs of covering the current benefit shortfall caused by the ‘bedroom tax’.&#xa0;

[[[4.6]]] Refuge services in Scotland are already unable to meet demand; a recent annual census day survey found that 2 out of 3 women were unable to get a refuge space for themselves and their children because of the lack of safe or suitable space.  Where women are not able to access refuge for themselves and their children when they need to they may be at risk of returning to abusive partners or forced to accept unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation through a local authority which will no longer have access to appropriate temporary self-contained accommodation.&#xa0;

[[[4.7]]] The ‘bedroom tax’ is already limiting the options for people facing homelessness and could impact on the availability of supported accommodation provided through the ‘Housing First’ model which is being piloted in Glasgow by Turning Point.  Under this model, people facing homelessness avoid using temporary accommodation whilst accessing the support they need.  The ‘bedroom tax’ restricts available accommodation for single people and couples facing homelessness, and result in greater demand being placed on temporary accommodation.&#xa0;

[[[4.8]]] Whilst local authorities may decide to prioritise some assistance for supported housing services that do not meet the SEA criteria through the Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) this can only be regarded as a short term solution given the intense pressure on DHP. This increase in pressure was evidenced by the number of applications for Discretionary Housing Payments in Glasgow City Council, for instance, with 5,501 applications for DHP in April 2013 compared with just 1,437 in April 2012.  Although the Scottish Government has set out plans to increase the amount available for discretionary housing payments in 2013/14 this is not a long term solution.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[5.0 ]]]

[[[Severe poverty]]]&#xa0;

[[[5.1]]] There is growing evidence that people are being forced into greater poverty due to welfare reform.  The Trussell Trust has been highlighting an increasing use of foodbanks and Citizens Advice services have reported that increasing numbers of people are coming to them in ‘extreme poverty’.  Whilst the voluntary sector is responding to this growing demand it is of great concern that people have to turn to them for help to survive.  Indeed the Stirling Citizen Advice Bureau has recently developed a ‘Survival Guide’ to help people deal with ‘no money, no food and no power’.  &#xa0;

[[[5.2]]] Support workers are working with an increasing number of people who face benefit sanctions.  This is a particular issue for people required to demonstrate to Job Centre staff that they are looking for work.  There appears to be a lack of consistency between job centres about what constitutes suitable evidence. Young care leavers and young people in transition are facing major problems with sanctions and conditionality because of the particular challenges they face and we would urge that their needs are given further consideration in line with those set out by the National Care Advisory Service (NCAS).  Other people have faced sanctions relating to attendance at medical assessments and have had to wait 8 weeks without benefit payments until the outcome of their appeal.  In this case a crisis grant was obtained through the Scottish Welfare Fund but was not sufficient to last 8 weeks. There is concern that once a sanction has been applied (even if it has clearly been applied wrongly), there is nothing any organisation or authority can do to prompt the DWP or Job Centre to lift the sanction.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[5.3]]] People who do not qualify for an advance benefit payment nor for a payment through the Scottish Welfare Fund are being advised to go to a food bank.  This is particularly difficult in rural areas where people may not have the means to travel the distances involved.&#xa0;

[[[Criminal Justice ]]]

[[[practitioners]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[6.1]]] Criminal justice practitioners have highlighted a number of ways these reforms are impacting on their service users.  Practitioners report particular concerns that service users are struggling to meet their day-to-day living costs and many are unable to afford any increase in housing costs arising from the ‘Bedroom Tax’.  At the same time, a lack of alternative housing available locally means that the individuals concerned do not have the option to move to a smaller property and are therefore facing rent arrears. &#xa0;

[[[6.2]]] Practitioners also anticipate that the ‘Bedroom Tax’ could impact on families that have a family member going to prison.   An individual is eligible for housing benefit when they are in prison:If an individual is in prison for longer than these periods, then they will not be eligible to claim housing benefit and the ‘Bedroom Tax’ could apply to the family. &#xa0;&#xa0;26 September 2013&#xa0;7&#xa0; Welfare Reform (Further Provisions) (Scotland) Act 2013, Initial Report 2013.
