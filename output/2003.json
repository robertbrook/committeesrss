The first would benefit from a consistent approach to content filtering for all Internet access networks that provide service in public places. The second requires education for parents and children, as well as a policy that all devices (and internet access software on those devices) should be supplied with adult content filtering turned on by default.\nProtecting Consumers through education&#xa0;&#xa0;The need for research&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nSuch as the wireless cameras operated by the BBC and Sky News, and the radio microphones used in virtually all television production and many West End shows.\n \nOfcom’s Communications Market Report 2013\n \nThis is split across; 38% of 5-7 year olds, 62% of 8-11 year olds, 87% of 12-15 year olds - Ofcom’s Children and Parents: Media use and attitudes report (Oct’12)\n \nUK Safety Internet Centre – Safer Internet Day – Have Your Say Report February 2013: 86% of 7-11s use some form of online communication tool, such as social networks and virtual worlds (56%), chat functions in online gaming (38%) or using webcams (28%).
