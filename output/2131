defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default(a)

default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(...) a recommendation that within a specified period the respondent takes specified steps for the purpose of obviating or reducing the adverse effect of any matter to which the proceedings relate (a) on the complainant; (b) on any other person.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAnalysisdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSanctions for breach of the right to equality must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Sanctions must provide for appropriate remedies for those whose right to equality has been breached including reparations for material and non-material damages; 
defaultsanctions may also require the elimination of discriminatory practices and the implementation of structural, institutional, organisational, or policy change that is necessary for the realisation of the right to equality
default. [Emphasis added]
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default16. Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that States Parties make reparation to individuals whose Covenant rights have been violated. (...) The Committee notes that, where appropriate, reparation can involve restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction, such as public apologies, public memorials, 
defaultguarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices
default, as well as bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations.
default&#xa0;
default17. In general, the purposes of the Covenant would be defeated without an obligation integral to article 2 to take measures to prevent a recurrence of a violation of the Covenant. 
defaultAccordingly, it has been a frequent practice of the Committee in cases under the Optional Protocol to include in its Views the need for measures, beyond a victim-specific remedy, to be taken to avoid recurrence of the type of violation in question. 
defaultSuch measures may require changes in the State Party’s laws or practices.
default 
default[Emphasis added]
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThese institutions should also be empowered to provide effective remedies, such as (...) 
defaultguarantees of non-repetition
default (...) and State parties should ensure that these measures are effectively implemented
default.
default [Emphasis added]
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(...) requires that States parties provide reparation to women whose rights under the Convention have been violated. Such remedies should include different forms of reparation, such as (...) 
defaultguarantees of non-repetition; changes in relevant laws and practice
default (...)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the problems about the existing order of things is that individual proceedings deal only with individual problems and yet often they relate to systemic problems which require systemic solutions. It is very important that the tribunal which has heard all the evidence is able to make recommendations on a wider basis.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultClause 44: Repeal of Duty to Prepare Sustainable Community Strategydefault&#xa0;
defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(...) when making decisions of a strategic nature about how to exercise its functions, [to] have due regard to the desirability of exercising them in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socio-economic disadvantage.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAnalysisdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEquality has become a dirty word because it has come to be associated with the worst aspects of pointless political correctness and social engineering. Just look at the socio-economic duty. In reality, it would have been just another bureaucratic box to be ticked. It would have meant more time filling in forms and less time focusing on policies that will make a real difference to people’s life chances.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(...) as poverty may be both a cause and a consequence of discrimination, measures to alleviate poverty should be coordinated with measures to combat discrimination, in the pursuit of full and effective equality.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPatterns of discrimination keep people in poverty which in turn serves to perpetuate discriminatory attitudes and practices against them. In other words, discrimination causes poverty but poverty also causes discrimination. As a result, promoting equality and non-discrimination is central to tackling extreme poverty and promoting inclusion. Measures to eliminate poverty and efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination must be understood as mutually reinforcing and complementary.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIndividuals and groups of individuals must not be arbitrarily treated on account of belonging to a certain economic or social group or strata within society. A person’s social and economic situation when living in poverty or being homeless may result in pervasive discrimination, stigmatization and negative stereotyping which can lead to the refusal of, or unequal access to, the same quality of education and health care as others, as well as the denial of or unequal access to public places.

defaultBy moving to an administrative system, applicants for an exemption would know the result far sooner than now – perhaps in 3 months rather than 6 – 12. This would reduce uncertainty for operators and allow them to introduce vehicles sooner than they might currently feel able to due to the inherent risks and doubts which surround the current system.
default&#xa0;
default(viii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfficial, legal, Ministerial and Parliamentary time would also be saved – indeed, it is improved efficiency in public administration that would form the main tangible benefit to be gained by the proposed change.
