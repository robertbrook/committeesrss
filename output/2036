[normal]Rocking the BOAT – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Amendments to 
[normal]The
[normal] Draft Deregulation Bill
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rocking the BOAT is a small local campaigning group formed following a public enquiry in February 2010 in which a little local lane known as 
[normal]Chertpit
[normal] Lane, from the village of Great 
[normal]Longstone
[normal], Derbyshire was classified as a Byway Open 
[normal]To
[normal] All Traffic or BOAT. The inspector at the time gave very little weight, if any to local public opinion, which was large over 90 residents attended the enquiry and the decision was based on historical evidence from ancient maps dating back 1650 and implied use of horse and carriage. Appeals to Derbyshire county council highways authority were made to implement a traffic regulation order without success, rocking the BOAT submitted a request in February 2012 for a traffic regulation order to the Peak District National Park Authority, the PDNPA are currently going through the public consultation process  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Little or no credence was given to the current use of the lane by other soft user groups, walkers, runners, cyclists, horse riders, local education establishments, Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme and families and the dangers of making a small rural green track into a BOAT
[normal],  allowing
[normal] legal use of the lane for recreational mechanical propelled vehicles and the loss of amenity and safety issues which come with it .
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Chertpit
[normal] Lane is a 1 mile long narrow (2m at narrowest) unsealed limestone lane with limestone dry stone walls either side the rout of the lane from Dale Farm a livery  rises to give extensive views of the peak district,  with access to 
[normal]Longstone
[normal] Edge. The effect of the implementation of a BOAT on this local lane is a tragic loss of amenity to the local community, with the increased use of the lane by trail bikes, 4x4’s and quad bikes. This has had a dramatic affect on use by other soft user groups with usage being greatly reduced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since the opening of 
[normal]Chertpit
[normal] Lane as a BOAT Derbyshire Highways Authority have seen it necessary to carry out repairs to the surface, initially in March 2011 which levelled a section of the lane for greater access for 4x4s but removed the character of the lane. In November 2012 further repairs were carried out to approximately 500m section which involved the resurfacing of the lane with road 
[normal]planings
[normal], the charm and character of the 
[normal]lane  has
[normal] now been completely altered, and now some 9 months since those repairs were completed the lane is once again in need of repair, due to the over use of the lane by recreational vehicles causing enhanced erosion. This is an unnecessary cost to the local tax payers and is unsustainable, with repairs being required on a regular basis
[normal]. 
[normal]To summarise in  3 ½ years since the re classification of 
[normal]Chertpit
[normal] lane to BOAT status it has gone from a tranquil grass covered lane, safe for all soft user groups to a dangerous, damaged, noisy tarmac  covered Lane, with a loss of amenity to the community and visitors to the Peak District.

[normal] – 8, of damage caused by recreational vehicles and 
[normal]Chertpit
[normal] Lane in use by various user groups. 
[normal]Chertpit
[normal] Lane is not an 
[normal]exception  within
[normal] the Peak District National Park with recreational vehicles  causing similar problems to communities thought the National Park.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To address these problems outlined above there is an opportunity for amendments to be made to the deregulation bill for green lanes to be given back to the communities for their quiet enjoyment.
