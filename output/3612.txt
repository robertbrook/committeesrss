[[[ Ruiz [FBB0013]]]]&#xa0;I disagree with the idea of some actresses acting and dressing like men and some actors dressing and acting like women ON CHILDREN PROGRAMES such us CBeebies. This swapping gender confuses children. I strongly believe that children should be encouraged to have a very clear knowledge on the difference between men and woman.I am talking about Aunt Polly on the programme Something Special and Gail Force and Sue Keeper on Gigglebiz In the same way, Sid who keeps dressing and acting like a women and Rebecca who keep dressing and acting like men on the programme Lets Play.I donâ€™t understand the necessity on this. Therefore, I share this view with other mums who agree with me. Please, stop such performances.November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
