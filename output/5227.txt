[[[RICS Wales]]]

[[[ (DWB 07)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales is the principal body representing professionals employed in the land, property and construction sector and represents some 4000 members divided into 17 professional groups across Wales. As part of our Royal Charter we have a commitment to provide advice to policy makers and in doing so we have an obligation to bear in mind the public interest as well as the interest of our members.

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales position. We will decide on taking a position when a Referendum is called by Welsh Government and following Consultation and engagement with our Members and based on circumstances at that time.

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales position. We would comment that it could potentially allow Welsh Government to invest in Infrastructure, and that the effect would depend on what Welsh Government did with it. So if for example it was used to reform the tiered element, or to make Wales relatively more attractive this would likely be positive. Conversely however we would be very concerned if it was used to raise revenue over and above that levied in England because of the geographical proximity of Wales to England versus Scotland and the resulting cross border nature of many developers. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales position. We welcome this provided it is used to support investment in Infrastructure in Wales.

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales position. While we would not rule out supporting higher limits in future, we think this is fine for now. However the caveat that it should be regularly reviewed to reflect changing conditions and needs. However we warmly welcome the greater flexibility in regards to the circumstances in which Welsh Government Ministers can borrow in the short term

[[[The Bill will increase the Assembly Term to 5 years and drop the ban on dual list and constituency candidacies for the Welsh Assembly at the same election.]]]RICS Wales position. We have decided to remain neutral on these electoral points. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales position. In our view this is a sensible measure granting flexibility as devolution in Wales and the constitutional position across the UK continues to evolve going forward.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]RICS Wales position. We would strongly support this and ask Welsh Government and the UK Government to agree such a protocol as swiftly as they can to help ensure devolved legislation operates smoothly alongside UK wide legislation.&#xa0;
