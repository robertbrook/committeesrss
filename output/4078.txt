[[[n evidence submitted by Peter Morris ]]]

[[[ElecInfo]]]

[[[ Limited (BRC 64)]]]&#xa0;May I start by stating I have an interest in NAPIT, as a duly elected representative of the NAPIT Trade Association nationally and the Electrical Safety Round table.  I am not permitted by NAPIT Group to express the views of the NAPIT members I represent in Public.  The  information below is my personal opinion based on speaking to Electrical contractors, Electricians (The Trade) and their customers the Public.&#xa0;

[[[Summary,]]]Part P of the Building regulations, why has it become so notorious? &#xa0;The information contained in the letters from The Trade to the Committee have been in the Public domain, for eight years. They are more than frustrated that their voice and that of their customers the Public has been ignored. They welcome this opportunity to set the record straight, after watching the Select Committee being sold to, by organisations that are all connected commercially or at director level, restricting the evidence given to the Committee.&#xa0;You can become an Installer in three weeks, if it is so easy and safe, why do we need Schemes?&#xa0;The Charities, Schemes and registers don’t have any money, other than that provided by the Public and “The Trade”. These two groups are principal stakeholders and are totally ignored, in particular the Public. The Trade have tried to help the Public in their communities, but they meet the same wall of complexity and indifference the Committee has seen.  The complaints procedures in particular provides little redress, there are  multiple examples of Schemes asking for money to inspect non-compliant work, conflicts of interest in this area are not acceptable.  Members of the Public walk away from the complaints procedure in disgust, paying again to have their electrical work carried out again to a compliant standard.  &#xa0;Parliament approved Part P of the Building Regulations which was introduced in 2005. In 2006 DCLG changed by Statutory Instrument Part P of the Building regulations, removing the requirement to test and inspect electrical installations, was this for safety reasons?  DCLG then proceeded to allow people to join their Competent Person Schemes, before they were qualified. More below… &#xa0;The way forward,  needs to be based around performing safe electrical installations in the homes of the Public by Competent Qualified Electricians, the Trade knows that DCLG is a long way from providing that to the Public.  We hope that parliament can get agreement, as the Public and The Trade have no powers to get it themselves, that belongs to DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[“The Committee wants to establish whether these are isolated problems or point to wider, systemic inadequacies with the competent persons scheme.” ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Schemes hide behind a wall of jargon and complexity, which the Select Committee have been struggling to unravel for almost two years.  When the Public require electrical work to carried out in their homes,  and use a member of a Competent Person Register they believe will it  be carried out by a Competent Qualified Electrician, this is not the case. &#xa0;The Electrical Schemes all work to the same EAS Committee minimum standard, which they were almost exclusively involved with making. The Trade have been complaining about low standards for over eight years, the Select Committee have been speaking to the Schemes for almost two years, is it not strange that this has not been raised by DCLG or the Scheme in all that time, what else was omitted?  The Electrical Schemes have all been accredited by UKAS in various forms for years, the statements that they will fully accredited by UKAS from the 14th June, 2014, does not mean that the Public will get a, Competent Qualified Electrician on the Doorstep, the whole Competence story being sold is false. &#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.The Public are not aware of the Competent Person Schemes why should they be? The Public should be aware of their responsibilities for electrical work like Gas Safe, say Electric Safe.  &#xa0;1.2.The Public are not aware of which electrical work should be notified, neither are many in the electrical trade.  The Public should not be involved with notifications, that is just an imposition by DCLG and LABC because that is the way the way have always done it.  If you are having building work carried out which will be inspected by LABC, then notification is good. But to apply that system to every piece of work carried out by all Trades such as plumbers, heating engineers, electricians etc. is a bureaucratic box ticking farce, it should be scrapped. &#xa0;1.3.The one area that does make the Public think about their responsibilities, is when a Solicitor asks what electrical work has been carried out, when they are selling a house and the have to sign the document. The Public should be made aware that they need an Electrical Installation certificate, supplied by the person that carries out the work.  It is the responsibility of the person carrying out the work to ensure that it is inspected and tested and a certificate provided to the customer.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2.The entry requirements onto the register of an Electrical Scheme are cause for concern, the five day wonders through to the three week wonders were agreed by the EAS Committee, which include the Electrical Schemes, Electrical Safety Council, DCLG etc.&#xa0;2.3.They all agreed with the short course Cheque Book Competence route for entry to their Schemes, some Schemes like NAPIT set a higher standard though. The derisory minimum qualifications were also not required on joining a Scheme, you are given  twelve months to obtain them, during which time you could would work on safety critical equipment in the homes of the Public.&#xa0;2.4.Being an Electrician is a good trade, we welcome new entrants, but the amounts of money charged, the sales claims made by training providers and accepted by Schemes, have misled many people. It is claimed that UKAS accreditation will suddenly change the competence levels of those in Schemes on the 14th June, 2014, how?&#xa0;2.5.The EAS committee which DCLG, the Schemes and their owners sit on, set the standards for Competence. They then changed the meaning of Competent Person Schemes, to Competent Enterprise, which requires only one person per enterprise to be Assessed Qualified or Competent, this misleads the Public and parliament who naturally believe a Competent Person Scheme has Competent persons on its register.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2.The change from Competent Person Scheme to Competent Enterprise, is also dangerously flawed in the area of supervision. The EAS Committee standard allows  the Qualified Supervisor to certify the work of others work unseen, I believe this to be both dangerous and illegal. In the Domestic Electrical sector (Part P), individual Competence on the doorstep is the only safe solution, but the Electrical Safety Council seem unwilling to agree to this simple step for their own Scheme.  This should be a case of Public protection, in the commercial and industrial electrical sectors, contracts and suing each other are common, the Public should not be in that situation.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.2.The lack of assessment has always been a topic on the electrical forums for years, the trade has always been in favor of having assessments a separate item, not included in membership fees, paying for an assessment upon receiving one.  Apparently annual assessments, were not a requirement until UKAS accreditation.&#xa0;4.3.Risk based assessments were in the EAS standard from 2009, this was introduced to reduce the cost of Competent people being assessed each year. Why did DCLG and the Schemes not implement this, was it a commercial reason or safety, if it was safety why did it appear in the standard written by them.&#xa0;4.4.The premise from the Schemes is that you are Competent if you are a member, if not, you are a rogue trader, although they have a right to sell this opinion, this manifestly is not true.  The Electrical Schemes base everything around assessment, why because it is very profitable, with the Gas Safe system you are assessed as Competent and then reassessed every 5 years. The premise from DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes, is that let anyone join, because membership is everything including profitable.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.2.The effect of competition between the accreditation bodies NAPIT and Certsure provides healthy competition to ensure that charges for Scheme services are not exorbitant, which would be the case in a single register Monopoly.  The Electrical Schemes charges are still very high through compared with Gas Safe £186, which were set contractually under competitive tender, the two accreditation bodies charge, Certsure £444, NAPIT £408.&#xa0;5.3.The two separate registers; ElectricSafe has to my knowledge been in development since 2011, the principal being one register of Electricians available to the Public. Certsure was announced towards the end of 2012, The Trade are puzzled about the formation of the Electrical Safety Councils subsidiary Certsure between the ECA and the Electrical Safety Council subsidiaries, as they were always competitors.&#xa0;5.4.The reluctance to agree with a single register is because whichever company takes control, takes the profit and both sides know that with DCLG Schemes they are anything but transparent.&#xa0;Regulation by DCLG of the Electrical Schemes is nonexistent, not light touch, as is the supervision within DCLG.&#xa0;Examples,6.2.Parliament approved Part P of the Building Regulations in 2004, which was introduced in 2005.  In 2006 DCLG changed, by Statutory instrument Part P of the Building regulations, removing the requirement to test and inspect installations, was this for safety reasons?DCLG will argue that the Electrical Regulations BS7671 require test and inspection, the electrical industry is highly competitive, if it is not a statutory requirement it does not happen, DCLG know this, so what was the real reason, I do not believe they will tell you.&#xa0;6.3.DCLG then proceed to allow people to join their Competent Person Schemes, before they were qualified.&#xa0;6.4.DCLG chose to allow, the EAS Committee to change the basis of a Competent Person Scheme from  Competent Persons, to “Competent Enterprises” this change resulted in only one person per company being required to be Qualified, or assessed as Competent.  Surprisingly the Electrical Safety Council is the largest supporter of this practice, the Public and the Select Committee may think that a Competent Person Scheme was just that, but it is not true. The Public believe that they are going to get a Competent Qualified Electrician, they pay for one, but that is not the case as DCLG’s Competent Person Schemes are not required to provide them. When you add in the fact that the Public are then responsible for that persons work, what would you describe that as?&#xa0;

[[[ (2008)]]]&#xa0;The issue of inexperienced people with negligible training still exists, those courses still exist, are the Electrical Schemes still accepting people from the courses, or are there thousands of people being misled by training companies.&#xa0;

There are concerns within The Trade about what happens when the Select Committees scrutiny is removed, we are aware that the Part P industry just sees this as a short delay. &#xa0;6.7.The goal posts have been moved so many times in the last eight years,  the latest move being UKAS accreditation from the 14th June, 2014 seems to be a nirvana moment when the Schemes will miraculously change and everyone will become Competent.  UKAS is unlikely to be able to provide the control required As a group the Schemes have tested this committee, I do not believe that UKAS could control the excesses the Schemes are capable of, with just policies, procedures and ticking boxes.&#xa0;6.8.So who funds the Schemes, Registers, DCLG and the rest of the growing profitable Part P industry? the principal stakeholders are the Public and the Trade, Do the present policies and procedures provide what the Public or Trade would recognise as Competent Persons no, DCLG and the Schemes probably believe they do.  DCLG and there authorised Schemes should be service providers for what the Public want, not vested commercial interest.&#xa0;6.9.The way forward,  needs to be based around performing safe electrical installations in the homes of the Public by Competent Qualified Electricians, the Trade knows that DCLG is a long way from providing that to the Public.  We hope that parliament can get agreement, as the Public and The Trade have no powers to get it themselves, that belongs to DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes&#xa0;&#xa0;This is becoming a Public protection issue,&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
