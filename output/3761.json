"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nRoad Safety Analysis (CYS0028)\n \n&#xa0;\nTransport Select Committee session on Cycling Safety\n, 2 December 2013\nThe ongoing public \ndialogue\n \naround cyclist safety has generated more heat than light. Much discussion of the topic seems to reflect a \n“\nTwo Tribes\n”\n mentality: many drivers and cyclists alike perceive themselves as blamed and bullied, and in response have a\ndopted an entrenched approach to the \ndebate. At the heart of this dichotomy lies both sides’ convictions that cyclist injuries are mainly ‘the \nother guy’s fault’: many cyclists feel that drivers treat them with reckless contempt; many drivers have countles\ns tales of cyclists who ignore the rules of the road; both sides are quick to accuse the other of aggressive and irresponsible behaviour. This febrile atmosphere has only increased with the recent tragic spate of cyclist deaths.\nThe present climate of the \ncycling safety debate present\ns\n government with significant political challenges. \nM\nany \nproposed \nintervention\ns\n \nintended \nto improve cycling safety \ncould \nbe perceived by one or both sides of the debate as \nan accusation of \nblame \nagainst them\n. The consequent \nvit\nriolic \nattack\ns\n will \nonly \nserve to \nmake \nconsensus and acceptance \neven \nhard\ner\n to achieve\n. \nGiven that any \ngovernment action \nis likely to include \na range of measures which need to win \nbroad \nacceptance \nin order \nto be effective, \na stormy reception of this kind \ni\ns likely to \nweaken their long term effect on \ncasualty reduction\n.\n \nA\nn intelligence led approach based on objective information\n is \nprerequisite for \nquenching \nthese flames. \nThis submission provides fact based information \nwhich intends to elucidate the extent to which the actions of \nvarious \nroad users influence \ninjury crashes. It is indicative of a direction of travel \nwhich this \ndebate \nmay take \nin \nthe \nfuture. If all concerned parties are informed by home truths about what i\ns actually occurring on Britain’s roads, it may become easier for government, road safety stakeholders and mainstream public opinion to coalesce around an agenda for effective future action.\nRoad Safety Analysis (RSA) is a not-for-profit company which prov\nides quality analytical and educational products and services, notably the award-winning web-based analysis tool MAST Online, to the British road safety profession.  \nIn order to elucidate the impact of both driver and cyclist behaviour on \nroad \nrisk, \nRSA \nha\ns sought to examine the factors which contribute to \nincidents which resulted in injury and involved\n \nboth \nmotor vehicles and pedal cycles\n. \nIt is hoped that this \nevidence \nwill shed some light on the heated ‘blame game’ which sometimes breaks out between grou\nps representing road users, leading to an increased sense of joint responsibility for use of shared space and mutual respect for the dangers and difficulties faced by others.\nThis information is derived from \nSTATS19 data supplied by the Departm\nent for Transport to \nRSA \nfor dissemination to the road safety community via inclusion in MAST Online. This data includes \ncontributory factors recorded under STATS19\n,\n which are not available to the \ngeneral \npublic for data protection reasons but are \nincluded\n in an anonymised summary configuration \nin MAST\n,\n \nwith access restricted to \npublic sector road safety professionals\n only\n.\nThis evidence deliberately includes all qualifying police attended incidents, even where the actual degree of injury inflicted was not \nparticularly severe. About five-sixths of the casualties in these incidents were recorded as ‘Slight’; this classification includes injuries such as whiplash, shallow cuts, sprains, bruising and shock requiring roadside attention. This choice was made for \nseveral reasons:\nUp to six contributory factors (CFs) can be recorded by a police officer who attended the scene of an injury crash\n, each related to a participant (vehicle, driver, rider, passenger or uninjured pedestrian). \nIt is important to a\nppreciate that \nCFs reflect the officer's opinion at time of reporting \nand \nmay not be the result of extensive investigation\n. Therefore, they \nshould be regarded \nonly \nas a general guide\n to the factors most likely to feature in incidents, rather than a definit\nive explanation for them. However, in the last seven years attending officers have recorded CFs for \nover nine hundred thousand\n injury crashes, making them by far the most extensive and inclusive basis for examining \nthe issues which \ntypically \nprecipitate\n sy\nstem failure \nand \nresult in injury.\nThis preliminary examination included \nCF\ns\n recorded by \nall \npolice officers who attended injury crashes on Britain’s roads \nover \nthe last seven years (2006 to 2012) which involved \ntwo vehicles, one of which was \na pedal cycle\n and \nthe other \neither \na \ncar or \na \ngoods vehicle\n. \nThis sample included 67\n,\n88\n2\n police attended crashes, \nencompassing \na total of 135,764 individual\nly attributed \nCFs\n.\nTh\ne\n analysis divides \nCFs \ninto two broad categories:\nCFs which were attributed directly to a driver or rider were then grouped by vehicle type:\n61,792 \ntwo vehicle injury crashes involving a pedal cycle and a car\n were analysed. \nThe overall proportion of cyclist injuries to other road users \nin these incidents is a stark warning of the vulnerability of cyclists in the event of conflict with a motor vehicle. \nThese crashes resulted in 63,305 casualties\n,\n of whom 97% were cyclists. 17% of \nthese \ncasualties were either killed or seriously injured\n, o\nf whom \n98% were cyclists.\n 369 people were killed in these crashes: all \nbar \none \nwere \ncyclist\ns\n.\nFigure 1 (see appendix) \nincludes all these \ncrashes\n, grouped \ndepending on \nthe category of \nCFs reported by the attending officer: those attributed to the driver\n (or\nange circle)\n; those attributed to the cyclist\n (blue circle)\n; and those classified as environmental factors which may fall beyond the control of either\n (green circle)\n.\n An incident could fall into more than one category, with over two thousand crashes falling into all three.\nThe following conclusions can be drawn:\nSimilar analyses were conducted on 4,393 crashes \ninvolving a \ncyclist \nand a \nvan, and 1,697 crashes involving a cyclist \nand a \nlorry. The res\nulting casualties \nare indicative of even greater risk\n of severe cyclist injury\n: \nin crashes with vans killed and seriously injured cyclists accounted for 19% of all casualties, while in crashes with lorries 38% of casualties were killed and seriously injure\nd cyclists. \n151 cyclists were killed in crashes involving lorries, almost 9% of all casualties from these incidents; while 52 cyclists were k\nilled in collision with vans.\nFigure 2 (see appendix) \nshow\ns\n \ncrashes involving cyclists and lorries, grouped dependi\nng on the category of CFs reported by the attending officer: those attributed to the lorry driver (\nyellow \ncircle); those attributed to the cyclist (blue circle); and those classified as environmental factors which may fall beyond the control of either (gre\nen circle).\n Figure 3\n \nshows crashes involving cyclists and vans, grouped on \nreported \nCF categories: those attributed to the van driver (grey circle); those attributed to the cyclist (blue circle); and those classified as environmental factors (green circle)\n.\nThe following conclusions can be drawn:\nWhile there is a great deal more to explore, these brief findings make is abundantly clear that \nany strategy \nmust take account of the role played by human behaviour \nif it seeks to address the principal factors \ninvolved in cyclist safety\n. While there is no single simple explanation for why crashes involving pedal cycles occur, the evidence \nprovides clear signposts which poi\nnt the way \nfor \nboth \nfuture debate and ultimate action.\nThe most important points are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Edmund King, President of The AA, Autumn 2012 \nhttp://autumn2012.theaamagazine.com/edmund-king.php\n"
