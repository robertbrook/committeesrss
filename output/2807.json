"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nChartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) (WRT 014)\n&#xa0;\nCIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,000 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT members plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems \nand infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.\n&#xa0;\nCIHT welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Transport\n Select Committees\n consultation on \nWinter Re\nsilience in Transport\n. \nThis response primarily concerns the highway network, however there are inclusive comments on rail and aviation.\n&#xa0;Overview&#xa0;The extreme \nweather \nexperienced by the UK between \n2009-\n1\n2 \nseverely challen\nged the transport sector\ns\n ability t\no keep \nthe network\n open, \nsafe and serviceable.  \nU\nntil the winter of 200\n8\n-\n9\n the \nUK\n had experienced 20 years of relatively mild winters which\n combined with\n the \npublic sector\ns\n \nbudget pressures, resulted in many \nlocal \nhighway authorities \n(LHAs) \nreducing their overall \npre-season \nsalt stocks \nlevels\n.  \n&#xa0;\nAs a consequence\n of the difficulties\n, several \nreviews and inquiries \nhave \nfollowed\n, \nthe outcome of which has seen improvement\ns\n in the way the UK plans and reacts \nto future severe winter weather events\n and a recognition of the importance of the service\n.\n&#xa0;\nIntegrat\nion of transport networks and \nthe provision of relevant, up-to-date \ninformation \nto passengers, covering all modes is vital to the continued operation of the network during severe weather events.\n  It was clear from the 2009-10 winter that passengers were often not provided with sufficient information to allow them to make sensible choices\n, this was identified in the\n reviews.    It is essential that the flow of information is integrated across tran\nsport modes\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe treatment of footways and cycleways is \nalso \nan important component of \nthe \nlocal \nnetwork\n and needs to be recognised in winter maintenance strategies\n.  \nAs many LHAs already do, authorities should collaborate\n \nwith and support lower-tier auth\norities to help ensure\n \nthat maximum practical winter support can be given in\n \nareas and communities beyond the treated networks,\n \nincluding\n \nthe treatment of key footways and\n \npedestriani\ns\ned\n areas.\n&#xa0;\nAll transport networks need to ensure that they have disruption plans in place and good communication available to all stakeholders during adverse winter weather (and at all times).  Safety of users of the transport network must be paramount.  \n&#xa0;\nFinally, a\nnd crucially, budgets for the transport sector need to be set at a sufficient level\n and certainty\n to ensure a robust response to adverse winter weather  This should include the ability to allow providers to ‘invest to save’ through the purchase of better p\nlant and materials if needed.\n&#xa0;\nQ1.How resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather? &#xa0;\n1.1&#xa0; \nThe UK’s transport networks would ap\npear to be \nbetter prepared to respond \nt\no adverse \nwinter weather\n, following the s\nevere winter of 2009\n. \n \nT\nhere have been a number of significant reviews and new guidance to the transport sector.  \n&#xa0;1.2&#xa0; \nRoads –\n \nthe RAC Foundation Report (2013) \n‘Ploughing On’\n published in May \n2013 \nhighlighted that Local Highway Authorities had made good prog\nress in improving th\neir winter resilience.  The report\n note\nd\n that, so far, budgets had been preserved for winter service operations.  CIHT has concerns that a continued \npressure\n on revenue funding for highway authorities could impact \non \nlonger term winter \nresilience\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3&#xa0; \nMost bus routes are on local highway authorities’ winter salting/gritting or snow clearance rout\ne\ns, and therefore are kept clear for bus services to continue to operate in all but the most extreme conditions.  However some services on more min\nor roads may be affected by adverse weather conditions, where the local authority has not cleared the route, with bus operators unable to provide services on those routes\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4&#xa0; \nRail –\n Heavy snowfalls can have serious impacts on the rail network.  Snow clearance systems generally seem to work well in the UK, but there are some disruptions to services, especially in the more remote areas between centres of population.\n&#xa0;\n1.5&#xa0; \nAviation – \nAs with\n rail\n,\n heavy snowfall can have a serious impact on aviation, however the sector appears to work well.  There are the unavoidable runway closures in extreme conditions, but the main priority of the airport operator and the airlines on these occasions must b\ne passenger safety.\n&#xa0;Q2. What lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10? What practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather? &#xa0;2.1&#xa0; \nOn 12 March 2009 the then \nSecretary of State (S\no\nS) for Transport, \nGeoff Hoon\n, made a statement to Parliament on the severe weather\n. The statement highlighted problems caused by the heavy snowfall and announced that the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG) would review lessons that can b\ne learnt from the events of early February.  The UKRLG recommended what steps could be adopted by LHAs, trunk road authorities, producers of salt and other stakeholders to ensure the effective treatment of England’s road networks in order to ensure the nat\nion is better prepared should similar events occur in future years. \n&#xa0;\n2.2&#xa0; \nUKRLG \nreview \n‘Lessons from the severe weather February 2009’\n \nwas \npublished \non \n4\n \nAugust 2009\n and included \na package of 19 recommendations to develop and improve the highway maintenance f\nor future winters.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.3&#xa0; \nThe Government responded to the review in a written Ministerial statement\n and the Code of Practice for the highways sector,\n Well-maintained Highways\n,\n was updated \nin tandem with the announcement.\n&#xa0;\n2.4&#xa0; \nThe winter of 2009/10 \nwas the coldest in the UK for 30 years and the duration of freezing temperatures and the extent of coverage of both snow and ice were highly unusual. \n&#xa0;\n2.5&#xa0; \nWith the experience of the second severe winter and with some concern as to whether all the lessons lear\nned from the previous winter had been acted upon, the then S\no\nS for Transport commissioned a further but independent review in March 2010.  A three-man Panel led by David Quarmby, Chair of the \nRAC\n Foundation was formed, \nits purpose to \nconsider and recommend\n practical measures to improve the response of England’s transport systems to severe winter weather. \n&#xa0;\n2.6&#xa0; \nThe Quarmby review\n ‘The Resilience of England’s Transport System in Winter’\n published in October 2010, \nendorsed all the recommendations of the UKRLG rev\niew and noted that progress had been made by the roads sector.  \nA significant concern\n was that the supply\n of salt for highways was \na major issue.  The recommendation in the Interim Report was for a strategic reserve of a quarter of a million tonnes for 201\n0/11 (this was accepted by Government). \n&#xa0;\n2.7&#xa0; \nThe Review recommended a combination of higher stockholding levels for the beginning of the winter season (with a new resilience bench-mark of 12 days/14 runs pre-season), permanent adoption of lower salt spread ra\ntes and a willingness by the two main suppliers to commit to higher\n throughput rates when the market\n demands.  \nIf successful these measures would secure sufficient resilience to meet the needs of a severe winter.  \n&#xa0;\n2.8&#xa0; \nThe\n RAC Foundation report, ‘Ploughing On\n – A review of hig\nhway resilience in Winter 2013’, covering both England and Wales \nconcluded that good progress has been made by local highway authorities in winter service operations. \n&#xa0;\n2.9&#xa0; \nThe report found that, without exception, local authorities are maint\naining their level of spending on winter resilience despite general budget cuts. The review found evidence of cooperation between adjacent and intertwined county, district and parish councils; and that this activity was underpinned by improved consultation\n with local communities and better communications with the media and the public.\n&#xa0;\n2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe report highlights where progress has been made and stated that ‘the valuable initiative and work of the National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) should be brought under the wing of the UKRLG’.  Many local highway authorities \nhave reviewed salt sp\nread rates. F\nollowing the issue of the revised guidance from the UKRLG, \nthere have been \nsavi\nngs in the volumes of salt used. LHA’s are now\n applying salt at rates that are appropriate to varying circumstances. In practice, some of the salt saved has been re\ndirected into salt bins or salt bags, to support community efforts.\n&#xa0;\n2.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn 18 September 2013\n an updated Appendix H\n \nto Well-maintained Highways \nwas published.  This latest revision of Appendix H has been carried out under the direction of the NWSRG on behalf \nof the UKRLG and UK\n \nR\noads \nB\noard\n using information from the NWSRG Practical Guide for Winter Service (Practical Guide) and NWSRG member organisations, as well as other recent winter service research and information.  The spread rate tables in this guidance should help assist Local Highwa\ny Authorities to adopt the most suitable, and efficient in usage terms, salt spreading levels.  \n&#xa0;\n2.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs noted at the start of Appendix H:  “The guidance and recommendations contained within Appendix H relate to national Best Practice and it is recognised that\n local circumstances, including financial and other resource constraints, as well as political influences etc. can vary widely across the country. Authorities and operators will need to take all of these factors fully into account, when devising and revisi\nng their Winter Service policies and plans. Some of the recommendations and practices will, if adopted, also take a number of years to implement. For example, it is recognised that, in certain cases it could potentially take up to around 10 years or so for\n a major programme of change to be fully implemented.”\n&#xa0;\n2.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCase study – improved resilience by the Highways Agency through capital       investment&#xa0;\n2.13.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHighways Agency invested in a new vehicle fleet which could spread pre-wet. This came on stream between 2008 a\nnd 2011\n.  This was supported by r\nevised treatment guidance implemented \nwhich included\n the use \nof \npre-wet systems which have significantly reduced salt use and therefore made stocks more resilient\n.\n&#xa0;\nOther changes included:  \n2.13.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nService Provider salt stocks wer\ne increased to maximum capacity during summer re\n-\nstocking\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.13.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDfT through HA procured a strategic salt stock of 425000 tonnes of salt located strategically around England. This will be made available in the event of a severe salt shortage to LHA and HA.\n&#xa0;\n2.13.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSup\npliers increased their production capacity and increased above ground salt stocks to ensure supply\n&#xa0;\n2.13.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupply chain arrangements were put in place to increase the UK supplier base\n&#xa0;\n2.13.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall the English \nstrategic road network (SRN)\n \nis\n more re\nsilient than in \n2009/10 however the UK\n must be careful not to become complacent particularly following more mild winters\n&#xa0;\n2.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe H\nighways \nA\ngency\n and its Service providers are considering \nimplementing \noutcome lead specifications for winter service. This may lead to cost reduc\ntion\n through efficiencies in resource allocation\n but \ncould also\n lead to \ndifferent levels of \n delivery of winter service across England\n, unless the development of specifications is carefully considered\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRail – Resilience plans should continue to include contingencies for disruption to services, including the provision of rail replacement bus services where appropriate.  Network rail and train operating companies generally have these plans in place, but they wil\nl need to continue to work with local highway/transport authorities to ensure that plans remain robust.\n&#xa0;\n2.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAviation \n- The UK’s aviation industry has made improvements to its ability to deal with severe winter weather. \nSince 2009-10 Heathrow has invested £50 \nmillion in snow and ice clearance equipment and increased staff numbers available for snow clearance and Gatwick has invested a further £8million.  The Civil Aviation Act 2012 gave the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) powers for a new licensing regime, inclu\nding measures to ensure an airports operational resilience as a license condition (to come into force in 2014). The CAA has formalised its compliance monitoring team which is deployed at airport when there is major disruption to operations, monitoring and \nensuring compliance with legislation on assisting passengers when flights are delayed or cancelled, with the powers to employ enforcement orders and penalties.\n&#xa0;\nQ3. How well prepared are the Government, local authorities and transport providers for adverse winter weather? What more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?&#xa0;\n3.1&#xa0; \nThe \noverall \nmessage is that generally all sectors are better prepared than they were in the past but \nthat all those involved in the delivery of a winter service\n shoul\nd not be comp\nlacent\n.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nRAC Foundation Report\n,\n \nPloughing\n On\n,\n identifies some areas of concern and ma\nkes an important point that \nthe travelling public should take more responsibility in terms their preparations particularly in making journeys in bad weather.\n  There \nmay be a need \nto place more responsibility on road users to ensure they are prepared for severe winter conditions. Many of our European neighbours have legisla\nted to ensure this is the case.  Public expectations can be un\nrealistic and the role of the media\n and now social media needs careful consideration. \n&#xa0;\n3.3&#xa0; \nFurther research and improvements to guidance in the use of alternative treatment methods\n is required\n.\n Both Europe and North America \nmake use of a suite of treatment methods and do not rely predominantly\n on the application of salt. While the UK climate tends to be mild in nature there is still much to be learnt from abroad.\n  The National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) might benefit from this.\n&#xa0;\n3.4&#xa0; \nAs mentioned in\n point \n1\n.2 above, CIHT has \nconcerns about \nreduced revenue funding\n to the sector (particularly Local Highway Authorities). This \nmay \nha\nve\n two effects:  firstly on day-to-day operations during a period of severe winter weather (and having sufficient  \nresources\n to address the situation)\n; secondly, a lack of funding \nimpedes\n the ability to take on board some of the more significant changes required through capital investment.\n&#xa0;\n3.5&#xa0; \nCIHT would recommend that sufficient funding \ncertainty \nis provided to the transport sector to be able to ‘invest t\no save’ to better manage winter resilience.  For instance new spreaders can optimise sal\nt usage (and thereby save cost), this would help authorities deliver on more significant change and improvements in the delivery of their winter service operations.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.6&#xa0; \nThe recognition that Highways incorporate footways and cycle\n \nways is particularly relevant during periods of adverse weather and the recommendations of the Quarmby review are important in this regard. The needs of non-vehicular users and the clarity of adv\nice to householders to support the actions of local highway authorities in keeping footways clear is a continuing area for consideration. The role of funding from across government to reduce the amount of injury from slips and falls is a key area for furth\ner \ndevelopment\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.7&#xa0; \nIt is essential that local highway authorities and bus operators work together to agree those    routes that will routinely be treated, and to clearly identify the routes or parts of routes where bus services may not operate in adverse con\nditions, with appropriate information being provided to customers.  This is particularly important in those areas, mainly the English metropolitan areas, where local highways and public transport are the responsibility of different authorities.\n&#xa0;\n3.8&#xa0; \nBus statio\nns are usually located away from \nmajor \npublic highways, and therefore not necessarily on local authorities’ winter salting/gritting or snow clearance routes.  Most bus stations are owned and operated by the relevant local transport authority, and where thi\ns is the same as the local highway authority it would be expected that winter treatment of bus stations would be part of the overall treatment strategy.  However, this may not always be the case in areas where local highways and public transport are the re\nsponsibility of different authorities, and in these areas it is crucial that the authorities work together on a strategy to ensure that bus stations and the relevant bus routes are properly treated in adverse winter conditions.  Some metropolitan transport\n authorities keep their own supply of road salt and salting vehicles for use in bus stations, but this \nseems an unnecessary duplication of effort when the relevant highway authorities have their own equipment and materials, and could add bus stations to th\neir winter treatment routes.\n&#xa0;\n3.9&#xa0; \nIn adverse winter conditions, it is often the case that local highway authorities will prioritise the treatment of roads, but give less attention, if any, to footways.  For car drivers and passengers this may cover all or almo\nst all of their journey, but for bus passengers clearly it will not.  All bus passengers will need to walk a certain distance at the start and finish of their bus journey, and they will be vulnerable to falls and injury if the footways aren’t appropriately\n treated.  Indeed, many passengers may not make the journey at all, if they have doubts about being able to negotiate footways at either or both ends of their bus journey.  In this respect, older and less able-bodied people are particularly vulnerable.  Th\nis should be picked up by local highway/transport authorities and bus operators in developing and implementing their winter resilience strategies.\n&#xa0;\n3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt times of major disruption to transport operations associated with adverse winter conditions, the dissemin\nation of information to passengers is crucial, to allow them to decide on the options available to them for their journey, or in some cases not to travel at all.  Within their winter resilience strategy, local transport authorities must have systems and pr\nocedures in place to provide information to passengers, and they must of course be flexible enough to allow for ever-changing conditions. \n&#xa0;\n3.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nRail – Perhaps the main concerns are around electrified railways, where power supply issues can become critical in \nheavy snow.  There are generally few problems with 25kV AC overhead power supply systems, but 750V DC third-rail systems, such as exist in SE England and Merseyside, can be seriously affected in heavy snow falls, causing substantial disruption to services.\n  The longer-term solution is for third-rail systems to be converted to overhead power supply, but this would be expensive, and probably difficult to justify whilst the frequency of serious winter events remains low.  However, the rail industry will need t\no continue to work on ensuring that third-rail systems are as resilient as possible.\n&#xa0;\n3.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNetwork Rail and train operating companies are usually very good at providing information for their customers when services are disrupted, but as previously identified, t\nhis flow of information must be part of an integrated information strategy, covering all transport modes.  In most situations where rail services are disrupted, e.g. for rail engineering works, train operators will provide rail replacement bus services.  T\nhis would probably not be possible where the disruption is caused by heavy snow, potentially leaving passengers stranded with no alternative transport.\n&#xa0;\n3.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs for bus services, it is important that rail stations and their environs, and at least the main pedes\ntrian routes to/from stations, are kept clear of snow and ice.  The 2009/10 winter weather showed that many passengers were reluctant to travel on snow-cleared rail routes where their walking routes at either end of the rail journey were hazardous.  It is \ncrucial that all relevant agencies work together in developing and implementing robust resilience plans that consider the whole-journey implications for the population.\n&#xa0;\nConcluding remarksThe recognition of winter maintenance as a fundamental part of \ncustomer services across transport networks has improved since the difficulties after 2009. We believe our comments will lead to the highways and transportation sector continuing to deliver improvements in dealing with an uncertain future scenarios\n.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/ploughing_on_winter_resilience_review_smith_may_2013.pdf\nhttp://www.publications\n.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090312/wmstext/90312m0002.htm#09031266000022\n \nhttp://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/archives/uk-roads-severe-weather-lessons-2009.pdf\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/wmstext/91215m0006.htm#09121583000135\n \nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111014014059/http://transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk/docs/final-report/wrr-final-report-2010\n-10-22.PDF\n \nhttp://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org/en/guidance/winter-service-guidance.cfm\n"
