defaultI am writing this submission as 
defaulta parent of school aged children and a member of a group of like-minded people. Parents are 
defaultbecomi
defaultng increasingly concerned over

default&#xa0;
defaultExecutive defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been a great deal of debate lately over the electorate’s lack of engagement in politics and democracy in this country and this is a typical example of why people feel disenfranchised. As parents, wishing to help our children in their education, we are effectively sidelined for all the significant decisions involved in whether
default,
default or how
default,
default a school becomes an academy and on having any real influence over the governance and ethos of these establishments.

defaultThe effectiveness of defaultacademisationdefault in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes.default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default              
defaultThe current academies programme has only been operating for a little over three years now and I believe that it is too early to draw any concrete conclusions over the effectiveness of this policy when it comes to the quality of education for our 
defaultchildren and young people, including those considered disadvantaged.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWe are told that it is too soon
default for the academy programme to have had an
defaulty
default effect on
default the 2012 PISA tests, the 
defaultresults
default and rankings of which have recently been released. 
defaultYet, we are also told that 
defaultthe academy 
defaultprogramme is having an immediate transformative effect o
defaultn education, resulting in apparently
default overnight boosts to examination results in those new academies. Clearly, there is a discrepancy here and test and exam
defaultination
default results are only part of the picture in any case. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultWhere is the evidence of real, substantive
default improveme
defaultnt in the quality of our children’s education in academies? Or are the improvements on paper only, e.g. better exam results due to successful academy headteachers being more “clued up” on the easier exam syllabi, how to teach to test, how to target “failing” pupils for intervention work shortly before exams (after years of poor progress) or how to exclude “difficult” students? How often are 
defaultapparent improvement
defaults due 
defaultto other variables, such as manipulating the intake
default,
default through changing admission arrangements? 
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultSince “outstanding” schools that convert to academy status are not subject to Ofsted inspections, it is nigh on impossible for them to lose their “outstanding” ratings. But, of course, standards can fall as well as rise. So, data that shows increasing numbers of “outstanding” and “good” academies, does not take into effect the fact that falling standards might not be routinely picked up. Only if test or exam passes dramatically fall or a whistleblower alerts the authorities to problems, would Ofsted step in.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultHow does
default hiring non-qualified teachers raise standards?
default The most successful education systems in the world value their teaching professionals, hold them in high regard and, insisting on high qualifications.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 
default              
defaultHow can it be deemed important for maintained schools to follow the National Curriculum, yet not for academies and free schools, where controversial curricula, can be taught?
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default 
default              
defaultAcademies are allowed to give priority in their admission arrangements to children eligible for Free School Meals. How many actually do this? Surely, if all schools, including successful maintained schools and faith schools were 
defaultcompelled to give priority to FSM children, we would see a marked improveme
defaultnt in outcomes for these groups as they would have better access to good schools.
default&#xa0;
default1.8 
default              
defaultSome sponsored academies that change their admission arrangements, actually reduce the numbers of Free School Meal and Special Education Needs pupils, e.g. by bringing in “Fair Banding” whereby children with higher academic achievements from further afield can displace local disadvantaged children.
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default              
defaultIt is an accepted view in most circles that children’s educational outcomes are affected by the levels of parental involvement and support and that the best schools work in collaboration with parents to help their pupils reach their potential. Unfortunately, converting a school to an academy does nothing to address this issue. In fact, my own experienc
defaulte with one academy is that
default the level of communication with parents went rapidly downhill within months of its conversion. Gone were the regular newsletters, parent post and the yearly traditional written parent reports. A more expensive uniform was introduced for the academy’s sixth form, without consultation with parents, which is clearly not in the best interests of poorer, disadvantaged families.

defaultThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors.default&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultParents are sidelined from all the important decisions, both over whether schools convert in the first place, and over how they are run once they become academies.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
default              
defaultThe Academies Act 2010 states “Consultation on conversion
default:
defaultBefore a maintained school in England is converted into an Academy, the school’s governing body must consult such persons as they think appropriate. The consultation must be on the question of whether the school should be converted into an Academy. The consultation may take place before or after an Academy order, or an application for an Academy order, has been made in respect of the school.”
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThere are cases where parents have not been consulted until after the Secretary of State has signed the academy order and chosen the sponsor, e.g
default. 
defaultRoke Primary School
default, Croydon.
default How can such a consultation be meaningful?
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultParents have little or no say over the trustees or the sponsor, which can have a huge effect on a school, with many ramifications. The ethos of a school can be significantly altered on becoming an academy, depending on the trustees and governors. It is even possible for academies to introduce a faith ethos into a formerly non-faith designated school, without consulting parents.
default 
default&#xa0;default2.5
default              
defaultParents generally do not have a free choice over which school or academy their children attend in the first place, but when the governance and ethos of a school dramatically changes part way through a child’s time at that school, as is possible on academisation, it is not easy and certainly not ideal for the parents to have to look for alternative educational provision.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 
default              
defaultThere have been many cases in the news lately where previously good schools have received “requires improvement” or “inadequate” Ofsted judgments and these have often led to “compelled” 
defaultor “forced” 
defaultacademisat
defaultion, despite overwhelming 
defaultopposition from the schools, parents and other local people. Whereas, clearly, poor standards cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, 
defaultin 
defaultsome of these cases, e.g. 
defaultBournville School and Sixth Form in Birmingham
default, 
defaulta good school which has
default decided not to 
defaultconvert to academy status, has been subjected to an Ofsted inspection shortly thereafter, subsequently downgraded and forced into becoming a sponsored academy. It makes many local people
default question the role of Ofsted in the academy programme and whether it is an impartial body.

default&#xa0;default3.0 default              defaultTdefaulthe role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default3.1 
default              
defaultSince this inquiry was announced, 
defaultthe Secretary of State has announced 
defaultRegional School Commissioners and panels of head
defaultteachers to oversee academies and free schools in the future. Will this new arrangement lead to conflicts of interest? Will heads on the regional boards press for "
defaultfailing" academies 
defaultto join their own academy chains?
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default

default 
default4.0 default              defaultTdefaulthe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of locdefaultal authorities and other organisdefaultations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default4.1
default              
defaultThere should be a local level of oversight and accountability. I do not thin
defaultk the newly announced Regional School Commissioners and 
defaultpanels of head
defaultteacher
defaults will be sufficient.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThe Local Authority or another loca
defaultl
default 
defaultbody 
default(
defaultelected by and accountable to 
defaultthe p
defaultublic),
default should be responsible for coordinating important fun
defaultctions, e.g. school admission arrangements; school places;
default coordinating partnerships betwee
defaultn schools to narrow the gap, raise standards and share best practices; 
defaulthelping parents and families where
default they have issues with schools and a
defaultcademies
default, e.g. expensive school
default uniforms or poor communication; and 
defaultproviding advice and guidance to h
defaulteads and governors at all schools and academies, when needed. Not all academy heads and governors have the expertise they need, e.g. over legal duties, whereas Local Authorities have decades of experience in such areas.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultObviously, parents can
default take
default up issues over policies and practices directly with academies, through the academies’ own complaints procedures.
default But these can take months to reach conclusion an
defaultd there is no recourse
default 
defaultif the parents ar
defaulte dissatisfied with the outcome
default, other than raising the issue wi
defaultth the Department for Education.
default In any case, I expect the DfE will only be interested in significant issues such as financial mismanagement or serious failings i
defaultn key measures. M
defaulta
defaultny parents may be wary of making
default official complaint
defaults 
defaultin the first place, fearing negative ramifications for their children. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
default              
defaultAcademies have to include parent governors on their boards, but it can be as few a two parent governors for academies over 1200+ pupils and often their existence is not promoted and parents not encouraged to contact these people who are supposed to be a voice for all parents within an academy or school.
default&#xa0;
default4.5  
default              
defaultTherefore,
default it is imperative that parents have a local, accessible
default service for raising issues over the running of all schools, including academies and free schools
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default6
default              
defaultTo give one example of where I believe local coordination is vital within the education system: L
defaultocal police have recently informed schools 
defaultin my area 
defaultof 
defaultsome 
defaultpotentially serious incidents 
defaultinvolving one or more adults targeting young girls. The police
default asked the schools 
defaultand academies 
defaultto relay the inform
defaultation to students and parents. It seems not all academies have done so. The Local A
defaultuthori
defaultty should be able to compel all 
defaultschools to do this.
default&#xa0;
default5.0 default              defaultWdefaulthat role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements.default&#xa0;
default5.1 
default              
defaultI am not clear how academy chains are accountable to anyone other than shareholders, if linked to businesses or private sponsors. They are not subject to Ofsted inspections.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
default              
defaultHow much oversight and accountability is there in the system? How do we know that contracts for services for academies in a chain are put out to competitive tender? Or are companies owned by or run by friends, family and associates of the directors given favourable treatment
default in the 
defaulthanding out se
defaultrvice contracts, as alleged at the Kings Science Academy. Individuals and c
defaultompanies providing servi
defaultces to academies can do so for profits. But, t
defaulthere seem to be many cases where the academy sponsors and chains a
defaultre directly linked to businesses that are run for profit, or the lines are blurred.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultAmongst my other concerns is that one academy chain can have a near monopoly over schools in a particular loc
defaultation. For instance, I understand that 
defaultin Pimlico, London, 3 out of 4 primaries are part of the same academy chain (Lord Nash's Future Academies Chain). This cannot be good for parental choice or healthy competition.
default&#xa0;
default5.4 
default              
defaultOnce a school joins an academy chain, the governing body for the chain can apparently reorganize classes, merging schools or moving classes or year groups between different academies in the chain, without any requirement to hold a consultation with parents, e.g. Chumleigh Academy Trust, Devon.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultAs academy chains grow and reap the cost benefits of the economy of scale, the reverse may occur within Local Authorities, to the point where maintained primary schools may be effectively forced to join academy cha
defaultins as services provided by the LA become too expensive.
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultCan academ
defaulty chains become too big to fail, e.g. E-Act?
default&#xa0;

default6.0 default              defaultThe defaultappropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply; and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default6.1 
default              
defaultIs it really in the best interest of a primary school to be part of an academy chain led by a secondary academy? Will the leadership at the secondary be best placed to advise on primary matters? Will there be conflicts of interest when league tables start giving more weight to progress measu
defaultres rather than just raw test or 
defaultexam results, e.g. could a lead secondary academy be tempted to suppress high achievements in primary academies in its chain
default,
default 
defaultto take the credit itself by 
defaultshowing apparently impressive progress with its own intake? Is the power skewed in academy chai
defaultns towards the secondary academy(i
defaultes
default)
default in the chain?
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default6.2
default 
default              
defaultHowever, a single primary school may be too small to go
default it alone as a converter academy, 
defaultwith al
defaultl the demands of autonomy, but 
defaultwithout the 
defaultbenefits of Local Authority
default 
defaultsupport. 
defaultIt 
defaultwould have little
default "buyi
defaultng power" for services and would not be able to
default do 
defaultall the functions
default itself.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.0 default              defaultWdefaulthat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools?default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultPartnerships, federations or better support from the local authority are measures that have worked in the past. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2 
default              
defaultThere was much talk of successful academies sponsoring failing schools, but so many of these academies do not seem interested in helping other schools with large numbers of pupils
default eligible for Free School Meals or with Special Educational Needs 
defaultor 
defaultschools 
defaultlocated in poorer areas.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultOne 
defaultlocal secondary academy 
defaulttrust 
defaulthas recently taken over a “failing” primary school. It has turned it around from an undersubscribed junior school, with nearly one third of its students qualifying for Free School Meals, into an oversubscribed primary academy with its latest intake of 30 pupils including just ONE pupil eligible for FSM.  
defaultThe academy trust 
defaultcould have given prefer
defaultence to FSM children in its local secondary academy’s 
defaultand its sponsored primary academy’s admission arrangements. It did not. Instead it chose to give feeder status 
defaultfor admissions to the “outstanding” secondary academy 
defaultto that primary academy. Almost overnight the sponsored 
defaultprimary 
defaultacademy “improved” by becoming oversubscribed in its admissions. Pupils there are now guaranteed a place at the successful secondary academy.
default Has there been 
defaultan improvement in teaching or educational outcomes at
default the primary academy? It is too early to know.
default But certainly, it does not appear that many FSM children will benefit if there has been.
