[[[ (ILC) (LAI 0072)]]]MiCLU and ILC welcome the Joint Committee on Human Rights’ (JCHR) inquiry into the effect on access to justice of the changes to the legal aid regime proposed by the coalition government in ‘Transforming Legal Aid: Delivering a More Credible and Efficient System’ and now revised in ‘Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps’. We have grave concerns regarding the effect of these proposals on access to justice for the most vulnerable in our society, including children, young people, vulnerable adults, and those who do not have the means to fund legal advice to ensure that their fundamental human rights are protected.

[[[Background to the proposals and the coming into ]]]

[[[force of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, 2012 (LASPO)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;VC is an elderly lady who originates from Jamaica and has lived in the UK since around 1965. She was brought to the UK to join her parents who arrived in the first decade after the Second World War. As VC entered the UK before the Immigration Act 1971 she has a statutory right to settle permanently in the UK. She has worked in the UK as a nurse in the NHS for many years. Her passport was destroyed in a house fire some years ago. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Matthew is 8 years old and has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He is having difficulties at school and his mother Jean is unable to access support from his school to help the family cope and ensure that he reaches his potential. The Local Authority have also threatened to take Matthew into care. Jean has no documents confirming her nationality and that of Matthew. Jean’s parents were Jamaican nationals but she remembers that they had British passports. However, Jean has never applied for a passport because she never needed one and the family never had the money to go on holiday.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Maria is 22 year old Spanish national. She has returned to the UK to work and has been in the UK for 7 months. Before returning to Spain she had studied and worked in the UK for a year. She has recently given birth to her small baby and has been told that she is being evicted. Maria has lived in the UK for 12 months but has no documentary evidence to prove how long she has been here. As a Spanish national she also has no visa or immigration document to prove her status.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Revised provisions - ‘Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps’&#xa0;&#xa0;Sima is a Pakistani national who arrived into the UK when she was 2 years old. She is now 18 and has given birth to a baby outside of wedlock. The baby’s father is also a Pakistani national. Neighbours have raised concerns about the baby and Sima with the Local Authority. The Local Authority have visited the family home and are satisfied that Sima and the baby are looked after by the family and there are no child protection issues. This is largely as a result of language barriers and misleading information that Sima’s family have provided. The Local Authority decide not to intervene. Sima wants to remain in the family home and does not wish for the child to remain with her. She is also concerned about the child’s welfare and would like someone to help the baby but she will not shame the family by disclosing any information about the family circumstances and nor will she initiate any proceedings against them.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Abdi is an unaccompanied asylum seeking child from Somalia. He witnessed the massacre of his immediate family whilst in Somalia. He was separated from his uncle and subjected to abuse and ill-treatment on his journey to a safe country. He arrived alone in the UK. He was 17 years old on arrival and placed in Local Authority care. His claim for asylum was accepted a few months after his arrival and he was granted refugee status (he was ‘lawfully present’ in the UK as an asylum-seeker for 2 months and ‘lawfully resident’ in the UK as a refugee for a further 2 months). On turning 18, the Local Authority advise him that they will no longer responsible for his care. His support and accommodation was terminated and he was given no assistance with accessing alternative support and housing. He became street homeless. There was a significant deterioration in his mental health, requiring urgent medical intervention. &#xa0;&#xa0;Melissa is 14 years old from Albania. She was trafficked into the UK at the age of 12 for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The police raid the brothel that she is imprisoned in and she is taken into the protection of the Local Authority.  The Local Authority think that she is 16 and not 15 but place in her foster care for her protection. Her claim for asylum is successful and she is granted refugee status within 2 months of her claim being submitted. A few weeks after securing refugee status the Local Authority decide to terminate her foster placement and place her in semi-independent accommodation. Melissa is doing well in foster care and her foster mother is helping her to recover from her experiences and does not think it would be in Melissa’s best interests to be alone and in semi-supervised accommodation. She also believes that Melissa is 14 not 16. &#xa0;John is a 17 year old from Uganda. He was forcibly recruited as a child soldier to fight with rebel groups where he suffered and witnessed severe incidents of violence and human rights abuses. He has significant mental health problems and suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. He is granted international protection after being interviewed by the Home Office, approximately 7 months after his arrival to the UK. His health is deteriorating and the Local Authority failed to access relevant support to help him with his mental health needs (he was ‘lawfully present’ in the UK as an asylum-seeker for 7 months and ‘lawfully resident’ in the UK as a refugee for a further month).&#xa0;&#xa0;Ali is a 16 year old unaccompanied asylum seeking child from Afghanistan who claimed asylum and was granted refugee status within 8 months of his arrival to the UK.  He is unable to access the relevant support to go to college and his social worker has failed to assist him with making relevant applications for bursaries and to assist him with accessing relevant college courses. He has been able to secure a place for himself at a college that is 5 miles away but the Local Authority have advised him that they are unable to assist him with travel expenses. He feels very isolated and is depressed. &#xa0;&#xa0;A refugee shall enjoy in the Contracting State in which he has his habitual residence the same treatment as a national in matters pertaining to access to the Courts, including legal assistance&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Vera is a 12 year old Angolan child who was brought into the UK when she was a baby by her Portuguese national sister. Her sister no longer want to care for her and takes her to the Local Authority. The Local Authority provide Vera with care and support under s20 of the Children Act 1989. There is evidence of abuse but as Vera is already in the care of children’s services the Local Authority do not pursue a care order under s31. Vera is out into a foster placement. The school have raised concerns about Vera’s wellbeing, general appearance and concentration levels at school. Vera tells her teacher she is not getting along with the children in the foster family and social services have not listened to her. It transpires that the foster carer is also no longer willing to support Vera but has not been able to get any help from social services to address the care placement. &#xa0;Stuart arrived into the UK with his mother when he was 5 years old. He is a Nigerian national. Social services have been involved with the family because of concerns raised about his welfare. He is placed on the child protection register. Stuart is later abandoned by his mother and her whereabouts are unknown. She has left him with strangers where he is subject to abuse and neglect. He is placed in the care of the Local Authority under s20 of the Children Act 1989. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Daphne is 19 year old from Malawi and arrives as a dependent of her mother. Her mother secures a visa to join her new partner in the UK. She has learning difficulties and is particularly dependent on her mother as a result. Whilst in the UK she is subjected to violence at the hands of her mother and her new partner. She tells someone at the church what is happening to her and they try to get her some help from the Local Authority. The Local Authority inform members of the faith group that they are unable to help Daphne because she is not a child and over 18.  Deborah is a 15 year old Jamaican national. She arrived into the UK when she was 6 years old and joined her British family. The details of her arrival and status are unknown. She has tried to commit suicide and is self-harming. She discovers she is pregnant and runs away from home. Her teacher contacts the Local Authority because she is worried about her housing situation and also notices the deterioration in Deborah’s health. Deborah discloses a history of sexual abuse within the family home since childhood. The case is referred to the police and investigations are on-going. She has been told by the police and the Local Authority that she has no immigration status in the UK and therefore must return to Jamaica if she can. The only home that Deborah has known is the UK. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Legality of the residence test

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disproportionately affect migrants and children, and will therefore indirectly discriminate against those with a particular race, age, ethnicity or nationality. This has implications pursuant to the Equality Act 2010 and Article 14 ECHR (when considered alongside Article 6 ECHR).&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Directly discriminate against all children who do not meet the proposed test, including (i) British children under the age of 12 months who are unable to prove their citizenship entitlement, (ii) migrant children who have been lawfully resident in the UK for less than 12 months and (iii) migrant children unlawfully resident in the UK who as minors without legal capacity or financial resources, cannot be held culpable for failing to seek to regularise their status or seek privately- paid legal advice. It is no answer that local authorities can foot the financial bill, as in many cases such vulnerable and undocumented children will not be known to social services and even if they are, social workers are not immigration law experts and often do not recognise the advice needs of migrant children and young people. Local authority in- house teams are prohibited from providing immigration law advice, as advisors are not OISC registered. There would also be serious questions regarding conflicts of interest and competing instructions if in-house local authority teams were to take on such work. &#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Directly and/ or indirectly discriminate against EEA nationals and their family members, many of whom derive lawful rights of residence through the interpretation of EU law by domestic and international courts, in circumstances where not all rights have been comprehensively incorporated into domestic law.&#xa0;iii)              The residence test- not fit for purpose&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Lisa is 17 year old South African national. She arrived with her mother on a visit visa when she was a small child. Her mother overstays her visa and whilst in the UK she gives birth to Lisa’s younger sister Noeleen. Lisa’s mother is an alcoholic and a drug addict. The Local Authority have concerns over the mother’s ability to care for Noeleen, who is 5 years old at the time, and she is taken into Local Authority care. Lisa remains with her mother. Lisa’s mother dies due to her drug and alcohol problems. Following her mother’s death Lisa goes to the Local Authority to tell them what happens and ask for help. They fail to provide her with support and accommodation and Lisa is homeless although a school friend has allowed her to sleep on her sofa for a few nights.&#xa0;&#xa0;Shalia was a 17 year old Zimbabwean national who arrived into the UK with her family. The family were granted leave to remain in the UK. Due to abuse within the family home Shaila ran away. She was housed by the Local Authority. Shaila was later subjected to abuse by her support worker. She had in fact taken by her support worker to live with at her flat. The Local Authority failed to support and accommodate her. It was later discovered that Shaila had no immigration status because her family had failed to apply for indefinite leave to remain on her behalf. Her refugee status had expired. Through specialist support her support worker was suspended and is under police investigation. She was housed by the Local Authority and her immigration matters were resolved.               &#xa0;Abdul is a 17 year old Bangladeshi national whose mother has a history of mental health issues. He was in care from the age of 10 to 13 and then went to live with his father until a year and half ago when he returned to his mother. Abdul’s mother assaulted and threatened Abdul with a knife and the police said it was not safe for him to return home. Abdul approached the Local Authority for assistance and was advised that he should sofa-surf until he went to university. With specialist support we challenged the local authority’s refusal to carry out a child in need assessment and provide Abdul with accommodation by way of a pre-action protocol letter. Abdul was then provided with support and accommodation from Social Services. This sort of action against a public body whom is meant to have the best interests of a young person in mind, would not be possible without the help of free and independent specialist lawyers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;iv)              The impact of the Residence test on the Law&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[e paid for if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Existing measures and mechanisms that exist in the current legal aid and judicial system to limit unmeritorious claims&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;ii. Failure of the Government to accurately evidence and/or quantify their justification for bringing in such a proposal&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Sarah is a 17 year old who was referred for psychiatric services when she was rescued by a passer-by from attempting to throw herself off a bridge. Sarah is the sole carer for her mother and younger siblings and has been finding it difficult to cope with her studies and responsibilities. Sarah’s mother refuses to engage with support services and Sarah’s psychiatrist has been trying to refer Sarah to the local authority for a child in need assessment under the Children Act 1989 but was not having any success in doing so. Sarah’s mother told her that she could not return to the house and Sarah was facing street homelessness. Streetlegal wrote a pre-action protocol letter challenging the local authority’s failure to carried out the assessment and provide Section 20 accommodation. Following this the local authority accommodated Sarah whilst an assessment was being carried out by social services. The local authority then accepted a full Section 20 duty under the Children Act 1989 to accommodate and look after Sarah. Sarah would have been unable to ventilate her case without the expert help of legal aid lawyers.&#xa0;Amber is a 20 year old who has two children aged 1 and 2. Amber’s mother was diagnosed with cancer in January 2010 when she was pregnant with her second child. Amber’s mother asked her to leave as there was not enough space in the house for her to stay. Amber approached the local authority to make a housing application and was told that she could only apply for private rented accommodation and was not entitled to temporary accommodation. The Local Authority however did not offer any private accommodation and each time Amber called up she was told someone would call back but they never did. Amber’s mother passed away in November 2010 and has still not been provided with any accommodation. Amber’s mother left her housing association to Amber’s older brother with whom Amber has always had a difficult relationship. Amber’s brother was pressurising her to leave and additionally there was an insect infestation in the house that he was refusing to address. Amber’s doctor wrote a letter concerning Amber’s skin condition and the local authority had still not provided her with any accommodation. Streetlegal wrote a letter to the local authority proposing to commence judicial review proceedings if they did not provide Amber with emergency temporary accommodation. Amber and her children were then provided with suitable accommodation. Amber was a particularly vulnerable young person who would have had little prospect of rectifying her situation without the assistance of a legal aid lawyer.&#xa0;Mark was accommodated by the Local Authority under a Part VII homeless application under the Housing Act 1996 at 17 years old. When M turned 18 a Section 184 decision was made that he was not in priority need for accommodation. Mark was receiving psychiatric treatment and had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and had attempted suicide on two occasions while in temporary accommodation. When Mark received the letter saying he had been found not to be in priority need for accommodation and cancelling his housing he attempted suicide and was hospitalised. Streetlegal obtained a psychiatric report confirming that he would be vulnerable if he were street homeless as a result of his mental health issues and relied on caselaw that it was unlawful for the Local Authority to have delayed the decision on his housing case until he turned 18. Streetlegal then requested a Section 202 review and made representations for interim accommodation with a threat of Judicial review if the Local Authority did not provide it. The local authority provided interim accommodation and withdrew their Section 184 decision following full representation.&#xa0;&#xa0;Tom was in his late 30’s when he approached ILC in a highly distressed state. He explained he was homeless having fled his secure accommodation due to homophobic violence. Tom was a former care leaver and had been subjected to severe sexual and emotional abuse during his time in care. Tom had been sectioned in the past and had a history of trying to take his own life. He applied to the local authority as a homeless person and was told verbally he was not vulnerable and temporary accommodation was denied. In desperation he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalised. Upon his release from hospital Tom again approached the local authority homelessness department and he was told that he was not vulnerable and therefore not in priority need. By the time he reached ILC it was mid-afternoon and he was very distressed and informed us that he felt like killing himself. Urgent contact was made with the local authority and a request for urgent interim accommodation was made. Psychiatric evidence was provided to the authority together with a request for the authority to review its decision under section 202 of the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII). The authority declined to provide interim accommodation pending the outcome of the review request. ILC had no option but to issue judicial review proceedings and seek urgent injunctive relief. That evening the High Court ordered the authority to provide interim accommodation. Whilst proceedings were issued the matter did not go to permission or a full trial as the local authority conceded their position, and Tom was spared the stress and trauma of lengthy litigation in the High Court. Tom was clearly very vulnerable and had the local authority fulfilled its statutory duty and made enquiries into his circumstances whilst placing him in temporary accommodation, a judicial review would have been avoided.&#xa0;&#xa0;Shareen is a 19 year old victim of sexual violence and was trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. She was supported by a trafficking charity who helped her make a claim for asylum. She is extremely traumatized and an urgent referral to a qualified psychiatrist has been made. There is a wealth of evidence confirming her highly distressed state and concerns over her fitness for interview. Written submissions are made to the Home Office to request that her asylum interview be delayed pending the assessment of the psychiatrist. The Home Office refuse to postpone the interview. Professionals are extremely concerned that compelling Shareen to attend an interview may damage her mental health and there is a risk that such an interview may retrigger trauma. We write to the Home Office to advise that we will have no choice but to lodge a claim for judicial review if they fail to reschedule the interview. If Shareen does not attend her interview, and the Home Office do not agree to rescheduling, her claim for asylum can be refused on non-compliance grounds. The Home Office refuse to engage with numerous pre-action correspondence and we have no choice but to lodge a claim including an urgent application for interim relief from the court. The judge considering the application orders that the interview be postponed pending the outcome of the psychiatric assessment. Subsequently, we are contacted by Treasury Solicitors. We receive an apology for the lack of correspondence and advised that the decision to refuse our requests were made by a ‘new member of staff’ and the pre-action correspondence had not reached a senior official in time. The case is conceded and there is no need for the case to go up to a judge to consider whether permission be granted.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;iii. The impact that this proposal will have on day to day practice and the long term effect on the public &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Mohammed is a 16 year old who was in the care of a Local Authority. He was abused and exploited as a street child in Libya and later in Greece, having arrived into the UK to seek safety. Due to his past traumatic experiences he became depressed, addicted to solvents and later heroin. As a result, he was convicted for petty offences. During his time in Young Offenders Institute (YOI) he was not provided adequate support services or access to behaviour management courses. He was placed in segregation for lengthy periods of time all of which had a direct impact on his rehabilitation. He was also denied access to contact with his mother. &#xa0;Adam is a 17 year old national from Senegal with severe mental health problems. He has indefinite leave to remain in the UK and his family are British Citizens. He was charged and sentenced for offences relating to his gang affiliation in a local housing estate in North London.  Unfortunately, there has been a breakdown in the family relationship and the Home Office have decided to take deport action to remove him from the UK. Upon release he was denied support from the Local Authority. He was later assessed as having significant cognitive impairments with an assessed mental capacity of a 5 year old. Specialist legal advice was needed to ensure that the Local Authority fulfilled their statutory duties to provide adequate accommodation, support services and protection from gang reprisals.  &#xa0;Belinda is 16 year old from the DRC. Her family were killed during the civil conflict whereby significant human rights abuses were committed against women and children. Belinda is orphaned at the age of 12 and has been raped on numerous occasions. She is later trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation through several African countries. During this time she falls pregnant and is subjected to a forced abortion. Her traffickers later facilitate her entry to the UK through a false visa placing her age beyond her actual minority. She is internally trafficked through England and is imprisoned in a brothel for several years. Belinda was finally able to escape her trafficking situation and was street homeless in a major UK city before she was helped by a female stranger. When she arrived at the police station she was placed into the care of the Local Authority and housed in a foster placement because of her vulnerabilities. She is taken to the Home Office by her social worker. At no stage have the police or the Local Authority disputed Belinda’s minority, she was 16 at the time. Having arrived at the Home Office the immigration official note that she is trafficked victim having listened to Belinda’s account and that of her social worker. Whilst at the Home Office Belinda is abandoned by her social worker. She has no idea where she has gone and is forced to wait at the Home Office alone before she is told to travel with a man and boy in a car. Belinda does not know where she is being taken and is extremely scared. Upon leaving the car she is met by a housing officer who informs her that she will be staying at the accommodation before she is taken back to the Home Office. A week later Belinda is taken to the Home Office and told that her age is being disputed. The Home Office rely on the visa application that was used to facilitate her entry to the UK. She is taken to adult accommodation for asylum seekers. She is alone and isolated for several weeks before the accommodation she lives in is raided by immigration officers. She is arrested and taken to HMP Holloway having been charged with immigration offences for making a false claim for asylum and entering the UK unlawfully. Whilst in prison concerns about her mental health and minority are raised by prison staff and immigration officers but no steps are taken to assess her needs and provide her with appropriate support. Once the case was referred to use we secured he release from prison, she was age assessed by a Local Authority who later found her to be a child and she was placed in a foster placement once again. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
