[normal]Written evidence submitted by David Fogarty (CLC0062)[bold]The following is a submission to the UK Parliament
[normal]’s Select Committee on “
[normal]Climate: public understanding and its policy implications
[normal]”. I am writing this in my personal capacity as 
[normal]a 
[normal]specialist science and e
[normal]nvironment writer. I was the 
[normal]climate change correspondent for Thomson Reuters 
[normal]in Asia 
[normal](2008-13) and 
[normal]I’m 
[normal]now a media consultant and writer fo
[normal]cusing on environmental issues. I started writing about climate change in the late 1980s.
[normal] The following 
[normal]comments are for the public record.
[normal]Summary
[normal]Q: 
[normal]Are there particular difficulties when reporting
[normal] complex science areas such as 
[normal]climate science? 
[normal]A specialist climate science/climate change reporter 
[normal]should have no more difficulty 
[normal]covering their beat than other specialist correspondents. 
[normal]Clima
[normal]te science is complex but no more so than, f
[normal]or instance, mergers and acquisitions, specialist criminal or business law 
[normal]or international trade. Reporters 
[normal]should have a background that allows them to understand the technical details of the main issues
[normal] of the
[normal]ir beat; 
[normal]be able to quickly distinguish what is new and therefore news and what isn’t
[normal]; 
[normal]have credible contacts 
[normal]who can 
[normal]offer insight on developments
[normal] and offer contrasting opinions to help readers better understand any key developments.
[normal] 
[normal]What makes climate stories interesting and publishable?
[normal]Q: Has there been a loss of scientific and environmental expertise in newspapers and news agencies? What has been the impact of this for the coverage of c
[normal]limate science?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q: Has there be
[normal]en a change in climate science 
[normal]and policy news coverage in the UK recent years? If so why do you thi
[normal]nk this is?
[normal] 
[normal] How effective is the press in the UK at distinguishing legitimate concerns about climate and energy policies and less accurate criticisms of the science?
[normal]Q: Do you have
[normal] a vi
[normal]ew on the reasons James Painter
[normal] found in his research that the UK and US press represent 80% of sceptical voices in the countries he included in his study?
