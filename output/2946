defaultQuestions 1-54
defaultWitnesses:
defaultRt Hon John Gummer,default defaultLord Debendefault, Chair
defaultman
default, Committee on Climate Change and 
defaultDr David Kennedydefault, Chief Executive, Committee on Climate Change, gave evidence.
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Welcome to the 
defaultCommittee
default. I suppose it is a measure of the importance of the subject that this is the second Select 
defaultCommittee
default you have appeared before in this morning’s business.
defaultBefore we start
default,
default I should remind everyone of my entries in the Register of Members’ Interests to do with the oil and gas industry and
default,
default in particular
default,
default a shareholding in Shell.
default              
defaultYou are 
defaultobviously
default going to follow up on the IPCC’s report. Do you have any initial thoughts on the headlines that can come out of that?
defaultLord Debendefault: It is obvious, Mr Chairman, that the programme we are embarked upon is to give our response to the position of the 
defaultfourth carbon budget
default in November and December of this year
default,
default therefore we will have to present that agains
defaultt the background of the science. T
defaulthat is bound to be so. 
defaultT
defaulthat is the timing 
defaultas we see it
default. The initial response is that there is no change in the basic assertions of the science. The degree of certainty has increased
default,
default but in general there is nothing in this that would suggest that there is a fundamental change in the science.
defaultDr Kennedy:default In particular
default,
default there is nothing in there that leads you to believe there should be a different climate objective to the one that we have used before when advising on carbon targets and budgets. There is nothing in there that leads you to believe the emissions reductions to achieve that objective are any different
default from 
defaultto the ones that we have previously 
defaultas
defaultsu
defaultm
defaulted.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you think they have addressed adequately the warming pause observed in sea temperatures?
defaultLord Debendefault: The answer is yes
default, 
defaultbut
default I do not want that 
defaultto be seen 
defaultas being a dismissive one
default.
default 
defaultI think we have to look at every piece of science and every piece of information with a critical and sceptical eye. My own view is that they have
default,
default but I approached it in that form. We are bound to have uncertainties in science. We are bound to have circumstances where we do not have a full explanation. What I think they have done is to give us the best explanation that the science provides us with
default,
default therefore that is the right way to approach it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default What empirical evidence would it take to convince you that the world’s temperature sensitivity to increases in carbon dioxide is at the bottom of the level in the IPCC report and
default,
default therefore
default,
default not as serious a problem as we previously supposed?
defaultLord Debendefault: First of all
default,
default I would be delighted if I could have it. I do not want to believe—
defaultMr Lilley:default No. What evidence would do?
defaultLord Debendefault: With respect, I want to put it in the context of where one stands. 
defaultT
defaulthe first thing is that I am not not seeking the empirical evidence. I would be delighted if I thought that there was evidence to show that climate change was not as damaging as the evidence shows it. 
defaultI
defaultf you can produce the empirical evidence that we can assume that the lowest level of sensitivity is the highest level that we need to worry about, then you would have my support. That evidence is not there
default,
default but I would certainly accept it were it to be there. You and I have known that we have taken a different view on this since we both sat in John Major’s Cabinet. We have had that difference. 
defaultT
defaulthe fact is
default,
default I have always wanted not to believe in climate change
default,
default b
defaultut
default I think it is so considerable a weight that we have to face and deal with
default it
default. Therefore
default,
default if you produce the empirical evidence I will be the first to accept it. I am the first person to say that if we have been wrong, if the world has been wrong and the scientists have been wrong, then we should admit it. Unfortunately
default,
default I am afraid they are right.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default That was a very nice answer, but not to my question. My question is
default,
default what evidence would it take to convince you; what empirical evidence? Would it be a long period of no increase in temperature? A period of declining temperatures? The failure to find the fingerprint in the troposphere? What would it be?
defaultWhen Einstein came up with the theory of relativity he also proposed the test that would say whether it was right or not: was light bent by the sun
default?
default What is your test as to whether the theory is wrong?
defaultLord Debendefault: I am not Einstein
default,
default and I am not in the position to make the test. If the evidence showed that what we have been saying
default is wrong
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default What evidence? That is my question.
defaultLord Debendefault: I realise it is your question
default,
default and I know that you asked that question
default, b
defaultut the evidence is actually for you. In other words, if the scientists produced evidence that showed that the lower level of sensitivity is the highe
defaultst
default level——
defaultlet us
default take that as the simplest concept—then I would be the first to accept it. I am not in a position, nor are you in a position, if I may say so, Mr Lilley, to lay down what that evidence would be
default,
default because that evidence is not there. Evidence could be any of those things that you have said, or a collection of them, or something that we do not know about now. I am a true sceptic. I do not know what that evidence would be
default,
default but were it to come 
defaultI 
defaultwill take it seriously
default 
defaultand I will listen to the scientists. 
defaultI give you my undertaking on that. 
defaultThe fact of the matter is that the scientists who have looked at the evidence as it is have said that there is no evidence for that. Whe
defaultn they say something different—
defaultor i
defaultf they say something different—
defaultit will be our duty to accept that. I cannot prejudge hypothetically what evidence might arise that might have that effect. That is one of my problems with those I disagree
default,
default with because they tend to do precisely that.
defaultDr Kennedy:default Just to add to that, the scientists have been very clear
default. O
defaultn th
defaulte
default specific issue of climate sensitivity
default,
default there is a range. They have not said, “
defaultLet
default’s
default focus on the lower end of the range”. They have not said, “
defaultLet’
defaults
default focus on the high end of the range”. Our approach as a c
defaultommittee
default is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe look across the range in its entirety. That is the first thing. In order to believe that the lower end of the range is what we should focus on, that we should rule out the rest of that range, you would have to believe that the positive feedbacks that come from water vapour, for example, and through the melting of ice and reduced reflection of the sun back out of the atmosphere, were offset with very strong negative feedbacks due to cloud. That is not evidenced at all at the moment. So that is one thing that we look at.
default              
defaultEven if you believe the low end of the range, that does not take you to saying, “
defaultLet
default’s do 
defaultnothing. We can relax. We can sit back”. It takes you to saying, “Great
default, i
defaultt gives us a better chance of achieving the climate objective
default”
default, which is a better balance of probabilities of achieving a temperatur
defaulte rise in 2100 that is around 2° C 
defaultand not higher.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default If th
defaulte low end of the range is a 1.5° C 
defaultrise for doubling and
default we have already had 1° C
default,
default that would be another half degree. Is that frightening?
defaultDr Kennedy:default That is rather simplistic maths, with respect. If you can wait until our report in November we will show you what is the appropriate response across the whole range of climate sensitivity.
defaultAgain, the modelling says that even if you believe
default,
default for example
default,
default that climate sensitivity is 2, it does not mean you sit back and relax and do nothing. We do not believe it is 2. But if you did, that would not be the implication.
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Lilley:default I still have not received an answer to what evidence would be necessary to convince you that alarm is excessive; that the sensitivity is less. I am not asking 
defaultwhether it is
default, but what evidence
default would be needed
default? 
defaultBefore you give us the same answer again, John—it was very long and it helps talk it out—I have asked this same question of sceptics. I say to them, “What would convince you that the 
defaultGovernment
default is right? That the IPCC is right?” 
defaulta
defaultnd they d
defaulto
default give me an answer. Why can you 
defaultnot 
defaultgive me an answer?
defaultLord Debendefault: Simply because you are asking a question the answer to which could be any of the things that you say. What you need, if I may say so—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default So a long period of no rise could be evidence
default that it is—
defaultLord Debendefault: It could be. But you would have to look at what other evidence came at the same time. That is the whole issue. You have all the time to be looking at the evidence. 
defaultIf I may say so, t
defaulthat is the problem of my many years of arguing with you on these issues. I think that you have to take the science at the present point, wherever that point is, and make a proper assessment of what that science is telling you. You do not say, “Well if it told you something different, or if this came along, I
default would
default have a different view
default,
default” because that is not a sensible way to proceed.
default You have to—
defaultMr Lilley:default It is the normal scientific method, I have to tell you. I am a 
defaultscientist, y
defaultou are not.
defaultLord Debendefault: With great respect, you are not a scientist in this particular area. You are a statistician, if I understand it.
defaultMr Lilley:default 
defaultA p
defaulthysicist.
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultA p
defaulthysicist.
defaultMr Lilley:default Is physics not involved?
defaultLord Debendefault: Of course it is a science. But the fact of the matter is you are not asking me a scientific question, if I may say so.
defaultMr Lilley:default I am asking you a scientific question.
defaultLord Debendefault: With great respect, you are not. You are asking me to propose to you the situation that might arise in which I might have to answer a question. I think that is a series of hypotheses that do not get you anywhere. I am saying to you
default,
default if there were evidence in any of the range that you are talking about and beyond, not contradicted by any other evidence, then I am happy to accept it. When that comes
default—
defaultif that comes
default—
defaultI will
default accept it 
defaultand show that I w
defaultill
default do
default 
defaultwhat I say I will do. I only wish I believed that 
defaultthat 
defaultwere true of some of those who disagree with me.
defaultDr Kennedy:default The Chairman ask
defaulted,
default 
default“W
defaulthat does the latest evidence say
default?
default”
default and that is what we consider
default,
default the latest evidence.
defaultMr Lilley:default That was not my question.
defaultDr Kennedy:default But th
defaultis
default was the question from the Chairman
default.
defaultMr Lilley:default 
defaultI am sorry, you are answering my questions
default now
default.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: 
defaultRight. 
defaultWe have a statutory duty to consider the science.
default&#xa0;defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default 
defaultWe have established that you cannot envisage any evidence, or will not tell us in advance what evidence would falsify—
defaultDr Kennedy:default I gave you a specific example
default.
defaultMr Lilley:default I want to move on to another—
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultIf I may say so, w
defaulte did not establish that I could not envisage
default that
default. We established that I could envisage the evidence. What I could not do was to tell you in advance what that evidence might be. I could
default say that there are
default a range of things that could turn out to be true that would change my view
default. B
defaultut it is incorrect to say that I suggested that I could not envisage such a circumstance
default,
default because of course I can and anybody who said that they could not is not treating science seriously
defaultDr Kennedy:default defaultIt is important to say, as well, that
default we continuously monitor the science. That is a statutory duty. We will continue to do that. We will come up with an assessment of the latest science in November. That will not be the last word. We will continue to look at it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default 
defaultLet us move on. 
defaultIn round numbers, between the industrial revolution and about 1997—these are very round numbers—if I have my units right, 
defaultmankind emitted approximately 800 
defaultgigatonnes 
defaultof 
defaultCO
default2
default. This coinci
defaultded with an increase of about 
default1° 
defaultC
default in temperature. The IPCC
default,
default having looked at that and lots of other stuff
default,
default said they are fairly confident that 
defaultCO
default2
default was the main determinant of that rise in temperature. Since 1998 we have added half as much again—another 400 
defaultgigatonnes 
defaultof 
defaultCO
default2
default—but the temperature has not risen. Most people would say that perhaps indicates that there are other factors
default,
default in addition to 
defaultCO
default2
default,
default that can be of the same order of magnitude of importance in affecting the world’s temperature. Would you agree?
defaultLord Debendefault: The first thing I would say is that all that has been looked at by the IPCC and they have come to very clear views. 
defaultSo
default 
defaultI would 
defaultat least 
defaulttreat carefully the judgment of the world’s key scientists in this area. That is the first thing I would say.
default 
defaultSecondly
default,
default I would say that this is a very short period of time in looking at the world
default,
default therefore I would be very careful not to produce my views on that short period of time.
default 
defaultThirdly
default,
default I would say that we are dealing with a very complex world
default,
default and of course it is true that there may well be countervailing issues, not least when you talk about
default,
default for example
default,
default the influence of ozone-depleting chemicals and the rest. There is a whole range of things that can be dealt with.
default 
defaultThat is why the IPCC looked at it so carefully and came to that conclusion. 
defaultMy problem with your question, Mr Lilley, is very simple. This is not a new question. It is a question that has been considered in great detail by scientists. You are careful to point out that I am not a scientist. May I point out that you are not a climatologist? Those who have looked at it have come to the conclusion that this does not alter their view of where we are. That is why I take that view.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default 
defaultRight, so y
defaultou are taking
default the
default IPCC as doctrine
default, s
defaulto 
defaultin
default looking into the IPCC 
defaultyou 
defaultwill not be capable of reaching a different view from the IPCC.
defaultLord Debendefault: I’
defaultm sorry?
defaultMr Lilley:default Yo
defaultu are saying you cannot answer—the IPCC has given your answer, they are very authoritative,
default therefore you take their view as 
defaulta 
defaultgiven. So when you have promised to somebody or other that you will be looking into the IPCC report and reaching a judgment on it, you have already reached that judgment
default, “I
defaultt is authoritative
default. W
defaulte will accept it
default”
default.
defaultLord Debendefault: Certainly not. I am reaching 
defaultthe
default judgment at this moment. I have not done the review. We are doing the review. I
defaultf I may say so, I really
default 
defaultdo find it difficult when you are trying to impute to me things
default—that is the second time—
defaultthat I have not said
default.
default I have said 
default“
defaultat this moment
default”. W
defaulte started off by saying we are looking at this very carefully
default. At this moment 
defaultI am taking the view of the IPCC
default,
default b
defaultecause we have not done the work. If in doing that work I come to the conclusion that the opinions that you have held for all these years turn out to be true, then I at least will admit it and say it. But I am not saying it in advance
default,
default because we have not done the work.
defaultDr Kennedy:default 
defaultIt
default is not the only source of evidence that we 
defaultuse,
default either. 
defaultFor example,
default on the climate science we had a call for evidence; we have had workshops; we have had a whole range of people involved in climate science coming to talk
default to us
default. So we will consider all the different views, including, for example
default,
default 
defaultviews published 
defaultby the Global Warming Policy Foundation on climate science.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default I am not a climate scientist
default,
default nor an ex-member of the Major Cabinet
default,
default although it was fascinating to have an insight 
defaultin
defaultto what was going on. I will wait for the diar
defaulties
default from both of you and read them differently.
default              
defaultA serious point
default,
default though. I am more of your views than I am of Peter Lilley’s. I always have been. 
defaultA
defaults the Chairman reported, the pause was one of the headlines 
defaultthat 
defaultcame out of the science
default,
default and there had been a pause. So I am confused, 
defaultlet us
default just say. Yes, you are going to reflect o
defaultn
default the report and the evidence that you receive
default, b
defaultut will you be able to look at some predictions for the future
default? I
defaultf there was another 15-year pause on top of the 15 years that we have had, would people 
defaultthen 
defaultbe arriving at different conclusions
default,
default o
defaultr would they be moving 
defaultto 
defaultother judgments and evidence?
defaultLord Debendefault: It is not surprising that you highlighted the headline. A large number of organisations spent a great deal of time making sure that that was the headline.
defaultAlbert Owen:default 
defaultWith respect, I am coming from the view that m
defaulty constituents are raising this issue
default,
default and so are the people of 
defaultBritain
default—
defaultLord Debendefault: Yes
default exactly
default, of course.
defaultAlbert Owen:default —and w
defaulte are asking you to answer some questions.
defaultLord Debendefault: My job is to look at the evidence. 
defaultO
defaultbviously
default 
defaultit would 
defaultbe foolish to ignore the IPCC’s evidence. They have produced a particular answer. We will go through all the things that we have talked about and come to an answer. You are 
defaultabsolutely
default right
default,
default if we were to find some evidence that suggested that we should take a different view
default,
default we w
defaultould
default say that. In our report in November and December—there are two parts 
defaultof
default it
default,
default and it will be in the November part—we will seek to say whether we think that the prognostication is different. I do
default not
default know, because we have not done the work yet, but it 
defaultw
defaultould be possible to say that we would look carefully for evidence of this kind and that kind, which would move a little bit towards where Mr Lilley was. In other words
default,
default it 
defaultw
defaultould be possible to say
default, “W
defaulte are looking at the evidence
default. W
defaulte w
defaultill
default be looking carefully for this or that, which might give an indication of a different sort
default”
default. 
defaultThat
default seems to me to be the right way to approach it
default,
default and that is what we will do.
defaultAlbert Owen:default 
defaultI
default look forward to that report.
defaultDr Kennedy:default The pause is there i
defaultn the report. The long-
defaultterm outlook does not change in the report
default, either, s
defaulto those two things fit together in the views of the climate scientists in the IPCC.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default I would just like to talk a little bit about the tension between the 
defaultUK
default’s competitiveness and our emission reduction targets.
default 
defaultIt has been said that the 
defaultUK
default’s approach is world-leading. I think I am right in saying
default—Dr Kennedy will correct me if I am wrong—
defaultthat there is no other country on the planet that has a tougher 2050 strategy target than the 
defaultUK
default. Is that still the case?
default 
defaultNone spring to mind, certainly.
defaultLord Debendefault: W
defaultell, no, w
defaultithout comparing ourselves with 
defaultSouth Korea
default, which has a carbon-neutral target, but you do
default not quite
default know how that is going to be measured. There are a number of countries that hav
defaulte very similar determinations, b
defaultut targets are one thing and what you will do to get to them is another matter.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default 
defaultAbsolutely. 
defaultThe point is we have a world-leading approach 
defaultthrough
default the Climate Change Act, the 2050 target and the use of interim budgets
default, b
defaultut is there a risk that we are world-leading without necessarily having followers? I say that because the Committee on Climate Change themselves have said that the competitive
defaultness
default risks are manageable
default,
default provid
defaulted
default other countries commit to deliver the emission
defaults
default cuts required as well and that
default,
default if other countries were to deviate from theirs, there is a risk that UK competitiveness could fail. I want to explore that tension
default a little bit
default. 
defaultFor example, w
defaulte know that there are some EU energy companies that are pushing the EU to water down their renewables targets. Do you see a potential danger to 
defaultUK
default competitiveness if that were to happen?
defaultLord Debendefault: As you know, we wrote a letter that we hoped would be helpful to the 
defaultSecretary of State
default for Energy
default and Climate Change
default 
defaultin
default assess
defaulting
default the present situation as far as 
defaultEurope
default was concerned, because that is the first step. Our assessment was that
default,
default in the 
defaultEuropean
default context
default,
default 
defaultat this moment 
defaultthere is nothing to suggest that 
defaultBritain
default should alter its targets because of other people not acting or the 
defaultEuropean
default Union not acting.
default              
defaultThat does not mean to say that that will necessarily be true. It was an attempt to say
default,
default 
default“T
defaulthis is not the moment in which you can tell that
default,
default because the 
defaultEuropean
default Union is at the moment discussing exactly what its longer-term plans will be
default”
default. The first part of the answer is
default,
default no, it is not at the moment, as far as 
defaultEurope
default is concerned.
default              
defaultAs far as the rest of the world is concerned
default,
default we think you have to look at competitiveness in different ways. For example
default,
default you have to look carefully at energy-intensive industr
defaulty and
default particularly those using a lot of electricity, particularly in the context of the electricity market reform. We produced a very detailed report that shows that
default,
default given the 
defaultGovernment
default’s decisions and what it has put aside to help the electricity-intensive industries
default particularly
default, we see no evidence that o
defaultur plans and our programme make us
default uncompetitive. That is where we are and where we
default will be
default in 
defaultthe 
defaultforeseeable future. Just as I tried to say
default—
defaultprobably unsuccessfully
default—
defaultto Mr Lilley
default, 
defaultI have an 
defaultabsolutely
default open mind about these things. Particularly coming from my political and business background
default,
default I am very keen on making sure we do not lose competitiveness. We are looking at it all the time and it could change all the time.
default              
defaultBut you must look at it against a background in which other people are moving, many of them, it appears, faster than we are. If you look at the changes that 
defaultChina
default has been doing and the sp
defaulteeding up that is happening—
defaultI hope that Mr Lilley has read the details of this—what they are doing
default is
default 
defaultvery significant
default. If you look at countries as different as 
defaultKorea
default and 
defaultMexico
default, the fact is the world is moving very clearly in this direction and making the changes
default,
default and we are seeing that 
defaultv
defaulte
defaultry
default widely. So
default,
default although I am not prognosticating
default,
default I 
defaultdo not
default think you 
defaultcan 
defaultput this against a background in which we have gone out in front and no one else is doing things. A lot of people are doing things. You then have to assert what they are doing and assess whether what they are doing is actual or merely window dressing. That is the nature of it. So we d
defaulto that and we will keep that up-to-
defaultdate all the time. All I can assure you at the moment is that the evidence shows that we are not in a non-competitive position
default, i
defaultt is not making people offshore and
default,
default in the 
defaultEuropean
default context
default,
default we are not out there in front. If the 
defaultEuropean
default Union were to make certain changes then we might be
default,
default and in that situation then we would have to reconsider that and the 
defaultCommittee
default would consider it necessary to do so.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: 
defaultJust
default to come back on that quote, our conclusion is 
defaultthat 
defaultcompetitiveness is 
defaultobviously
default very important. We take it very seriously. We have to. It is a statutory duty for us. We concluded that the competitiveness risks are particularly pronounced for electricity-intensive industries
default. U
defaultnder current policies those risks are manageable and/or being managed, out to 2020. The 
defaultfourth
default budget is what people will be discussing over the next month. The incremental competitiveness risks associated with a small budget are very small in magnitude. So again, they are manageable. We were very clear in our letter that there is no reason to change the
default fourth
default budget on account of competitiveness risks. The EU was the context for that letter. We will go beyond the EU and look at the broader international context in our November report.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default Moving on from business competitiveness to consumers
default,
default the cost to consumers and the impact on public opinion, why do you think there is such a wide range of estimates? The CCC has estimated the cost in energy bills from low-carbon policies to 2020 to be £5. The 
defaultTaxPayers
default Alliance
default has calculated it to be £240.
defaultDr Kennedy:default £100 was our estimate.
default&#xa0;defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default £100? I apologise
default, m
defaulty note is incorrect. But the 
defaultTaxPayers
default Alliance
default 
defaulthas 
defaultsa
defaultid
default £240. 
defaultObviously
default there are lots of ways of estimating this
default,
default but such a wide range makes the public look at this and think, “Hang on. We
default a
defaultre being taken for a ride. Nobody knows 
defaultwhat is
default going on. Who knows what they are talking about?” Do you think there is a
default danger, particularly in public 
defaultopinion terms, when it looks like this is a wet finger in the air rather than a properly calculated figure?
default              defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultS
defaultome of the figures that are put forward
default—and wild horses would not drag them out—
defaultare clearly like that
default,
default and that is an issue. 
defaultL
defaultook
default, w
defaulte have no interest 
defaultin
default that sense in doing other than trying to get the figures right. We are there to do that job
default, s
defaulto if the figures were £240
default,
default or whatever it is, we would have said so. We have done the work and our calculations are clear and public
default,
default so you know what they are. Other people have done different calculations and some people
default appear to have done no calculations but suggested that a particular figure might be. We have had thousands
default. We
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default Do you look at other people’s figures and make an analysis as to how they got to them?
defaultLord Debendefault: Very, very carefully
default. I
defaultndeed, we have had to say to some political people, “Look, your figure is not right
default,
default because you have done this, that and the other and it does not add up”
default.
default 
defaultS
defaultometimes 
defaultyou 
defaulthave to say to people, “Your figure is right
default,
default but it refers to something quite different
default,
default”
default because one of the other things 
defaultto ask 
defaultis
default,
default 
default“
defaultW
defaulthat is this that you are talking about
default?”
default We do it all the time. I am very conscious
default of that
default, but I know that there are some people who do not believe 
defaultu
defaults. I know they do not because they believe that we are in a kind of campaigning group
default. I
defaultf I wanted to be that I would, but that is not what I am. I am here to provide the facts
default. T
defaultherefore
default,
default we have done this work very carefully. If anyone has other figures, we hope they show them to us. If it is in public, we find it and we look at it extremely carefully.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default Do you publish your views on it?
defaultDr Kennedydefault: 
defaultYes, we do.
defaultLord Debendefault: Yes, we do.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: I will just come back
default on that
default. On the 
defaultTaxPayers
default Alliance
default, for example, you would not say that is a fact-based exposition of energy bill impacts. What you do if you go to that website, you put your consumption in, you press 
defaultthe
default button and a big number comes out. It is not clear where that comes from. There is more serious analysis out there. For example, RWE did their energy bill impacts recently. DECC does a very detailed analysis. If you look on our website you will see a comparison of our analysis with all of the different estimates out there that we have done over the last few months. We take it very seriously.
defaultIn terms of what is the right number, it is pretty easy to calculate. We know that the levy control framework is agreed at a number, which is 
default£
default7.6 billion in 2020. We know how much the residential sector consumes relative to the other sectors. You can just allocate that amount across the households. That is where the £100 comes from. It is pretty uncontroversial, although there are people who for whatever reason put a much bigger number out there.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default Do you think the Government is effective at communicating this in a clear way? I sometimes worry that Government is not always honest enough between when they are making a comparison with the counterfactual versus a comparison with the actual.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: Yes. We have discussed this before. The DECC methodology says
default,
default 
default“I
defaultmagine a world if we did not ever do anything
default,
default and we had not ever done anything about 
defaultlow-carbon
default policies, what would that world look like?
default”
defaultThen let us look at the full set of our policies, both those 
defaultthat push b
defaultills up, so support for 
defaultlow-carbon
default, and those that reduce bills, the energy efficiency. We think there is analytical merit in that approach but it is confusing for people.
default 
defaultOur approach is
default:
default we know where we are now. What is the change from now to 2020 and then to 2030 through investment in 
defaultlow-carbon
default technologies? How much does that push the bill up? We are very clear we think that is £100. We do not then roll in and say, “That £100 will automatically be offset through energy efficiency improvement”
default.
default We say, “It is £100
default,
default so debate and discuss that. Is that something we can afford?” Energy efficiency improvement is part of the story. We put a number on that and then we raise questions around the major challenges that there are in delivering energy efficiency improvement in practice.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultDan Byles:default Can I quote you saying the way DECC do it is confusing?
defaultLord Debendefault: Mr Byles, the important thing is that that is the way we do it
default. I
defaultt does not mean to say that we do not look at the ways other people do it
default,
default because there are other issues you might want to raise. 
defaultO
defaultn our website
default 
defaultwe have tried very hard
default—and 
defaulttell us 
defaultif you feel that we have not succeeded—
defaultto show the differences and show why they come to different points of view. I rather wish that other people with websites would do the same thing
default,
default so that they would in fact show
default what
default their position 
defaultis 
defaultbase
defaultd on
default. 
defaultO
defaultf course, 
defaultsome people do not 
defaultproduce any explanation of how they get to that figure. They merely present it to you. That is much more difficult.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: I should say this is a communication thing as regards us and DECC. If you dig into the DECC numbers, the £100 from now to 2020 is totally consistent with the DECC analysis. They have different headline numbers but, again, the £100 in our analysis is in their analysis as well
default. T
defaulthat is on a website for anybody who wants to follow up and see why that is the case.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Lee:default I guess there is a broader point about not just competitiveness between countries but also carbon budgets and global negotiations. Are you persuaded that consumption-based measures of 
defaultCO
default2
default are the right way forward
default,
default or territorial-based measures of 
defaultCO
default2
default emissions? For example, I look at current Government plans on transportation. They are building a train that is going to be electrified between 
defaultLondon
default and 
defaultBirmingham
default. Arguably, you could say that we should be building 
defaultfibre-
defaultoptic
default cabling so that you are discouraging people from travelling
default, which 
defaultwould be a better way of reducing our carbon footprint as a country, instead of putting in a massive railway line
default with a
defaultll the expense of that. Yet
default,
default because we do not tend to negotiate in territorial-based 
defaultCO
default2
default emissions, it is not such a—do you understand what I am trying to say?
defaultLord Debendefault: Yes.
defaultDr Lee:default Do you have an opinion on this? In terms of competitiveness, when we were in 
defaultChina
default it was quite interesting that the Chinese were worried a
defaultbout going down the territorial-
defaultbased
default route
default. They were also worried about
default the consumption-
defaultbase
defaultd route,
default because it would discourage us 
defaultfrom 
defaultbuying their manufactured products. They did not know which way to jump. I personally think it should be territorial
default,
default because that is the honest assessment of the impact 
defaultof this country’s
default 
defaultCO
default2
default emissions.
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultAs you know, w
defaulte did do a report looking at precisely this issue. It is important to be aware
default—
defaultand I do not mean that in a vague way but seriously aware
default—
defaultof our impact in an extraterritorial way. In other words, I think that the idea of the consumption measurement is a valuable idea because if you do not have it, then you do not get the context right. 
defaultAs you well know, t
defaulthe problem with it is that it measures things over which you have very much less control, whereas the mechanisms that we use today are at least dealing with things that to some real extent we have control over. I am always worried about having things 
defaultover which
default you do not have a huge amount of control. I want to do both. I want to have that as part of the contextual situation, but we have come to your conclusion that that is the right way to do it.
defaultI think the question you talk about, HS2 and 
defaultfibre-
defaultoptic
defaults
default—
defaultagain
default,
default I very much do not believe in emission creep
default,
default so I am not going to 
defaultgive 
defaultany view about HS2
default—
defaultis 
defaultpartially affected by that
default,
default but it is also a much more complex issue. It is a very important issue about how Government make decisions
default,
default which goes beyond that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Lee:default I guess my point is that one of the supposed selling points of HS2 is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is green. I remember the video with wind farms next to the railway line. I am thinking, “Well, hang on a minute, it would be greener to discourage people from travelling
default,
default full stop
default,
default by giving them the facility to be able to do commerce via a fast broadband”
default.
default I think this is the problem I have generally with the way in which protecting the environment is used as a reason for doing something. It depends how you measure the impact of that.
defaultLord Debendefault: Absolutely, and one should be cynical about it, certainly sceptical about it. I agree with that. 
defaultThe other 
defaultthing I want to do
default—
defaultI 
defaulthave 
defaultstill 
defaultnot managed 
defaultto 
defaultdo it
default,
default 
defaultbut
default 
defaultI promised to
default, 
defaultand 
defaultwhen I find the right person
default I
default 
defaultwill do—
defaultis 
defaultadd to our team of behavioural scientists
default. O
defaultne of the difficulties of putting those two
default issues
default beside each other is that, despite all the efforts of BT and 
defaultothers
default, 
defaultso far people have 
defaultbeen peculiarly resistant to not going to see people 
defaultand
default dealing with
default things
default on the internet and suchlike. I would add into that a third issue, and that is
default that
default it is only green if people do it. If it means that you give all the 
defaultfibre-
defaultoptic
defaults but instead of using them they get on a less green train or they drive to do it
default,
default irrespective of what you have done, then you have another problem. 
defaultSo 
defaultI just want to put that into it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Lee:default I guess my point is that Peter’s scepticism is, I think, driven by what this is going to cost the British economy, essentially. Therefore, if we were to change our economy that we were less dependent on energy full stop, then how it was generated would become less important.
defaultLord Debendefault: I agree with that
default,
default and I think that is one of my problems with those who do have this view about the British economy. My own view is that there are timing problems and the rest, but in economic terms we are doing something that we are going to have to do in a world of 9 billion people anyway
default,
default and that to become less dependent upon finite resources becomes absolutely crucial. In a sense, the bigger issue has to be taken into account in that sense. We are also involved in the immediate issue
default,
default a
defaultnd in that sense you are right. T
defaulthe more that we can lessen our dependence on energy without making our lives less exciting and full of choice and the rest—because I am not a puritan, I want people to live in an exciting, choice-full way—the better we can do that. One of the sadnesses of the world is that we waste a tremendous amount of energy unnecessarily.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default I am going on to electricity market reform. I am conscious of the time
default,
default so I will try to be as concise in the questioning as I can. You have given evidence to the Government that focusing investment on shale gas in particular
default,
default but gas in general
default,
default in the 2020s and then moving back to 
defaultlow-carbon
default in the 2030s could drive up costs
default. T
defaulthe figure I have here is £100 billion in some scenarios. Why might prioritising investment in gas in the 2020s be so expensive?
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultI
defaultt is a question of the timing, Mr Owen, and I will ask David to go through the details that we have put forward in that sense. The background thing is that it is not because we are opposed to gas. There are two issues with the gas. One is
default that
default we have to be careful about birds in the bush
default,
default in terms of how much and what the cost is and the rest. The second is that you have to be careful about building an infrastructure that is for a temporary period of time and inhibiting another infrastructure, which is the one that you want in the long term. It is 
defaulttrying
default to bring those two together 
defaultthat
default we are most concerned
default about
default. You also have to be careful about the assumption that that which you know about
default,
default in the sense that you experience fossil fuel production,
default for instance,
default is inevitably 
defaulta
default better way forward 
defaultthan 
defaultthe one that you are beginning t
defaulto learn about, which is low-
defaultcarbon.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default But in the context of decarbonising, at the moment we have predominantly coal. We do not have carbon capture as yet. Surely gas is less of an evil when it comes to carbon in some people’s minds
default,
default so that would be an improvement. Exploiting shale locally rather than importing foreign gas may be an advantage.
defaultLord Debendefault: First of all, as long as that is interim, yes. If you continue—
defaultAlbert Owen:default I did give some dates. I am talking decades
default here
default.
defaultLord Debendefault: Yes, but it has still to be interim in the sense that you are reaching over time—
default              
defaultAlbert Owen:default We are nearly in the 2020s now.
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultE
defaultxactly, but it still has to be interim. The second thing is that you have to be reasonably certain about it being provided for
default,
default and thirdly, you have to make sure that in providing for it in the interim you do not exclude what you need to do for the longer term. That is all that one needs to do. It is a perfectly reasonable thing to say that you will have some use of shale gas, but our own belief is that it should not interfere with the decarbonisation of electricity. That does have to be on a cost-effective—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default 
defaultY
defaultou do accept that there is less carbon in gas than there is in coal
default,
default so there would be a net gain?
defaultLord Debendefault: As long as it is produced in particular ways, as long as it is measured properly, yes, but very often no
default,
default because people have not taken the carbon impact of producing it into account.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: 
defaultI will just
default give you a sense of 
defaultwhere 
defaultthat £100 billion
default comes from, and
default that is an upper band
default. I
defaultt is a range of £50 billion to £100 billion. The Government is committed to spending a lot of money
default on
default investing in a portfolio of 
defaultlow-carbon
default technologies out to 2020. That is the levy control framework. Beyond that, you have a choice. You can either stop investing in that portfolio and instead focus on gas-fired generation
default, 
defaultuse that as the bedrock of the system
default, then 
defaultget into the 2030s and very quickly have
default to scrap that gas-based system and 
defaultbuild a 
defaultlow-carbon
default system over a short period of time with technologies that you have not developed properly
default. T
defaulthat is a very expensive thing to do. The alternative is to carry on with the portfolio investment
default and
default carry on with the technology commercialisation, drive those costs down, and then roll out the technologies that at the moment are less mature,
default and
default roll those out in the 2030s and 2040s at a much lower cost. That is how you get the £50 billion to £100 billion number. The £50 billion
default figure
default is an assumption about gas prices at current levels.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default Does it have to be either/or? Why do we have to stop the development of renewables and carry on with gas? We are still going to need gas. Most people, domestic and businesses, have gas heating. If we are going to have to electrify that, that is a big challenge in the future.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: Of course we will carry on. There is a debate about what you do with the power system. The carbon budgets and all of our analysis say we will continue to use gas for heating our homes, our offices and our industries, not
default just in the 2020s but
default in the 2030s and 2040s. The demand from those sectors is likely to be much more than any shale gas that will come to the market in this country. There is a use for the shale gas. As long as we bring it from the ground in a responsible way
default,
default there is a use
default for it within a carbon-
defaultconstrained world. It does not change the power sector story, which is about portfolio investment, investing in order to save money in the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default Can I move forward slightly on that
default,
default then? You have also said that you think it will create uncertainties for investment in the future.
default Is that the—
defaultLord Debendefault: No, I do not think that we have done that. First of all, you are right to say it is not either/or, but it is both/and. There are those, of course, who are presenting it as if it is either/or
default,
default so that we do the gas and we do not do the other thing at all. That is one of the ways in which some have been speaking. The issue that we have about investment is that
default,
default from all the work that we have done with industry
default,
default 
defaultit is clear 
defaultthat if you have a sy
defaultstem where you spend the money—
defaultthe Government has been very good at producing the money that we asked for in order to do the work on the portfolio between now and 2020—
defaultbut 
defaultyou do not have certainty thereafter, or at least a degree of certainty, so that you have a figure at 2020 and then you go to a figure at 2050, industry finds it very hard to plan for that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default What should Government and Parliament be doing now to address that uncertainty?
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultO
defaultur view is that there should be a carbon intensity target for 2030
default. T
defaulthat could be modulated in such a way as to take into account changes between now and then, which would leave you between 50 and 100. You can do it in that way. We believe that that is necessary. It is partly for a climate change reason but, frankly, it is also partly for a UK plc reason. If you want people to bring their supply chains here rather than elsewhere, or build them here rather than elsewhere, you have to give them the sort of parameters that enable them to do it. Otherwise, they will go to other countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default You do not think the current Energy Bill does that?
defaultLord Debendefault: We think that there needs to be some certainty for the 2020s. The carbon intensity target is the right way to do it for this reason
default: i
defaultt is not prescriptive. It merely says
default,
default 
default“T
defaulthat is where we are going to reach. You, whatever your technology and the rest of it, can bring towards that your best efforts
default”
default. That is the right way. Industry has to compete. Industry has to accept that there will be ups and downs. Industry cannot be protected by Government, but it must at least have some view of what the Government certainty is, which is why we think that is reasonable.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: It is not just us. 
defaultAgain, y
defaultou will have seen a very high-profile letter in the last couple of weeks—
defaultAlbert Owen:default 
defaultBut y
defaultou are before us today and I am asking you.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: Absolutely. Just a couple of other things. 
defaultFirst
default, it should not be a blank cheque to the industry. We have been very clear about that. It should be a challenge to the industry and a commitment that
default i
defaultf you can drive costs down, then there will be a market for your technologies, but if you cannot drive costs down there will not
default be
default.
defaultOne last thing. There is a figure that is being quoted around what the cost of a decarbonisation target 
defaultis 
defaultover and above the Government’s current policies. We have been very clear on this. Again, we have a transparent analysis of this in our electricity market reform report. The incremental cost of that target
default,
default over and above current policies
default,
default we estimate to be £20 for the typical household in 2030. It is £20 on top of that £100 we have said is associated with policies to 2020.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default 
defaultA f
defaultinal point on EMR, you recently wrote to the Secretary of State recommending they include, “A slower degression in strike prices for offshore wind” in line with evidence. What would be the anticipated impact of reducing Government support more slowly? What advantages would there be?
defaultLord Debendefault: The overall one is to encourage investment at the next stage and to move forward. That is the overall one.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default But 
defaultdoes 
defaultthat 
defaultnot 
defaultdiscourage investment in tidal and other renewables that we need to build up a bigger renewable portfolio?
defaultDr Kennedydefault: The point is at the prices proposed we think those are below the level of cost, so you have to ask
default,
default 
default“I
defaultf the prices proposed are below the level of cost who would want to invest
default?”
default The risk is that we get very limited offshore wind investment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default Is that what industry is telling you? Is that what the offshore developers are telling you?
defaultDr Kennedydefault: 
defaultI
defaultt is not just the offshore wind developers. We had a very detailed study on all of the 
defaultlow-carbon
default technology costs. It was state-of-the-
defaultart
default. It
default look
defaulted
default at all of the evidence that has been published, and concluded, “This is what we think the costs are at each point in time
default”.
default It certainly is what industry have said in response to our letter. We did not go and say to industry, “What do you think
default? W
defaulte will do your bidding for you
default”.
default We said, “This is our evidence. The prices are low
default,
default relative to cost
default”.
default We have since had a lot of feedback. I think everybody in the industry
default,
default or almost everybody
default,
default is in agreement with our letter.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultAlbert Owen:default You have not answered my final part. If we put all our renewable eggs in the offshore wind basket, then we are not going to encourage other big projects to come forward, like tidal.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: They are not all in that basket. If you look at the way the National Grid modelling says that £7.6 billion will be spent, some of it is on onshore wind; some of it is offshore; some of it is on biomass conversion; some of it is on marine technologies. There is a portfolio approach there that is both possible and planned within the £7.6 billion
default. I think
default doing less offshore wind would
default 
defaultraise questions about whether we can commercialise that technology properly.
defaultLord Debendefault: Mr Owen’s point is very important. I think what we are saying is that if you want one of the eggs in your basket to hatch, you do not have the figures quite right. We have produced those figures ourselves with the help of research, not with the industry. It is not our job to listen to what industry says. Our job is to look at the facts and try to produce the best figures we have, so that is true. I think that we have to be ever mindful of the fact that you do not want to get into too close a position so that you exclude others. As you well know, although 
defaultI 
defaultno longer have any interest in it, 
defaulthistorically I had 
defaulta real interest in the belief that tidal power in various places is a very valuable thing. We and the Government have to keep an eye on that 
defaultand
default all sorts of other things at the same time.
defaultAlbert Owen:default I would imagine you still have an interest, you just do not have a financial interest.
defaultLord Debendefault: I do not have an interest in the technical sense. I am interested in it.
defaultAlbert Owen:default Not everything is financial. I have interest but I do not have 
defaulta 
defaultfinancial
default interest
default.
defaultLord Debendefault: Yes. I have a belief that we have all the time to say both/and rather than either/or, which is the point you made.
default              
defaultAlbert Owen:default Yes, absolutely. Thank you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default When you produced your 2013 progress report, you 
defaultessentially 
defaultsuggested that had it not been for the recession
default,
default we would not have met our first or second carbon budget. What are the elements of the savings that would have enabled us to have met our first and second carbon budget
default,
default and why were they not achieved?
defaultLord Debendefault: First of all, the overall reason for putting it in that way is that we were concerned lest people should think
default, “Oh, well,
default we have done rather better than we thought we were going to do
default. T
defaultherefore, we have that so we can splurge it on something
default”
default. It was very important to point out that
default,
default if you looked at it very carefully
default,
default it was clear that a major element in it was the recession. There are ups and downs. We produced a document explaining some things in our annual report
default,
default showing how we had done rather better in certain areas and we had done rather less well in other areas. There is also the question as to whether what we have done has been the right thing. I think we have all the time to look at what we are doing and say, “Is that the right thing? 
defaultF
defaultor example, 
defaultis 
defaultseeking to insulate more and more solid walls the right way to spend our money?” That is the sort of question we ought to be asking all the time. I do not think it is a static answer to your question, but the static answer David will give you.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: The first carbon budget built in a relatively low level of ambition, recognising there is a limit to what you can do in terms of new policies and implementation. We are broadly on track with that low level of ambition. The point is we have outperformed the budget because of the recession, not because we have done a lot more than we thought in terms of policies.
defaultIf you look forward I think it is pretty clear that there is more needed to achieve the budgets further out in time and, in particular, the fourth carbon budget. The Government has been clear on that in giving evidence to the 
defaultEnvironmental Audit Committee
default recently. As John says, there is an open question around what is the set of policies that will deliver the emissions reductions to which we have committed in the fourth carbon budge
defaultt.
default We will be coming back on that in our report to Parliament in July, but there are big questions around all of the key policies, whether it is electricity market reform, 
defaultthe 
defaultenergy company obligation, the renewable heat incentive, the electric vehicle su
defaultpport schemes or
default the commercial sector energy efficiency improvement policies. All of those need further consideration and we will come back on that and I am sure others will as well.
defaultLord Debendefault: Mr Whitehead, can I make a point that I think is very important for the Committee perhaps to consider, and it is this. You set out a series of policies, the Government acts, and it continues. There is a tendency among campaigners to feel that if you change those policies
default,
default or you spend money on something else in order to achieve that end
default,
default you are going back on your commitment. One of the things that we
default 
defaulthave to get better at is being prepared to say, “We have tried that. It does not turn out to have quite the effect that we thought it 
defaultwould
default”.
default I remember myself being very critical of the formation of the climate change levy when that was first introduced. I remember being attacked by supporters of it sa
defaultying
default, “You cannot believe in climate change
default,
default then
default,
default if you are against the climate change levy
default”.
default I had to say, “I do believe in climate change
default,
default but I do not think this levy is going to do what you say it is going to do
default”.
defaultOne of the things we have to do all the time is to look at the policies that have evolved and say, “That is not doing as well as it was thought”—it may not be a policy we would suggest—“and perhaps it would be better to look at it in this way
default”.
default What I hope we will b
defaulte is mature enough not to have
default a whole lot of campaigners
default then
default saying, “This shows you do not
default 
defaultbelieve in it” because these things are developing all the time. The mechanisms of measurement are developing all the time, particularly in the area of how you save energy in homes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default I think that is absolutely right
default. I
defaultndeed, one of the purposes of the budget mechanism and the review mechanism is precisely that it is not necessarily exactly what you do, it is how you do it in a framework
default that, first,
default learns from what you were doing before
default;
default and secondly, may move about depending on how the budget might best be achieved in certain trajectories. But the point about the recession can be seen either as a silver lining for the achievement of targets, 
default“L
defaultuckily we achieved the targets because there 
defaulti
defaults a recession
default”—
defaultDr Kennedydefault: We would 
defaultnot
default see it as a silver lining.
defaultDr Whitehead:default 
default—o
defaultr as a bankable challenge in order to say, “Let us loosen up targets for the future
default,
default because we did rather better than
default we thought we were going to do
default not because of our own efforts but because of something else that happened. Therefore, we can loosen arrangements for the future
default”.
default Which way do you see that?
defaultLord Debendefault: We would say very clearly that it is a warning rather than a bankable thing. It is a warning that even in these terms, not in any other, even in the favourable circumstances
default,
default we found it pretty hard to do this. Therefore, do not think we are in splurge time
default,
default because we are not.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: We have to advise the Government can that be banked through to the next budget, and we will do that I think early next year. In banking through, all you do is store up costs and risks for the future. You say, “Okay, I can delay doing things that I should be doing to be on track to meeting the 2050 target
default”.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default Yes, which indeed takes me to the third carbon budget
default and the
default advice that you have given that we are not on track to meet the third carbon budget. Indeed, banking and borrowing aside, what effect might not meeting the third carbon budget have on those 2050 targets in the long term in your view?
defaultLord Debendefault: 
defaultT
defaulthe purpose of budgets is to try to keep us on course in the most cost-effective way to reach the end. If we do not keep to the course
default,
default it costs us more money
default.
default I am rather mean about these things. I would like it to cost us less money. The point that David has rightly pointed to is that you have to be careful about banking for another reason, which is that if it stops you doing it in time then you do not get it done. I think the fundamental thing is that any failure to meet budgets costs money. That is why we have done the budget. The budgets are done on the basis of ability to do
default them
default—of course, you do not do a budget that you cannot achieve—in order to make sure you do it in the most cost-effective way.
default              defaultDr Kennedydefault: We have not said we cannot meet these budgets
default,
default either. We have said we are not on track at the moment
default. T
defaulthe challenge is to put policies in place so that we
default 
defaultare on track to deliver the cost-effective path to our longer-term objectives.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default I guess the central point that is being made is that keeping on track in the first place costs you rather less than scrambling to catch up in the second place.
defaultLord Debendefault: Absolutely.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: That is why we recommended the budgets in the way that we did. They were the cost-effective path and a departure from it—
defaultLord Debendefault: Any businessman would say that, and anyone in front of 
defaulta
default business—
defaultthat is exactly how we run businesses.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default In your process of reviewing the fourth carbon budget, indeed you have recently written to the Secretary of State
default, Lord Deben,
default indicating that the assumptions relating to the review of the fourth carbon budget should not be based on what may or may not happen as far as EU policy is concerned. That is rather a brief caricature of what is being said, but how do you see that in terms of your review 
defaultthat is 
defaultunder
default 
defaultway at the moment?
defaultLord Debendefault: The Act provides for
default,
default and we specifically said that we would do
default,
default a review of the fourth carbon budget
default,
default and that is what is under
default 
defaultway. The Government wanted it done in this time
default 
defaultscale
default,
default and there was no reason not to accept that, so we are producing the evidence and the science and the rest of it in November and our conclusions in December. That is how it will be done. 
defaultF
defaultirst of all
default,
default the review has to be done in a particular way because that is what the statute says. The statute says that we should review the basis upon which the budget was established and assess whether there were changes, whether scientific or political changes, which would lead to our recommending that the budget be tightened or loosened or whether the budget should stand.
defaultOne of
default the changes that have
default been widely mooted abroad is that the situation in the European Union is now different from the basis upon which we produce the budget
default. B
defaultecause that was a widespread comment, what we did was to look at the circumstances and see whether that was true and whether that was established. What we have said is 
defaultthat 
defaultat the present time it is not true. There is nothing in the present circumstance that would lead one to say that the budget should be changed.
default 
defaultWe also say that at the moment 
defaultthere is 
defaultno likelihood of certainty that there might be a change, because there could be a change, of course, depending on what the European Union says. We considered what the Government’s own view about what the level of ambition should be
default. W
defaulte looked at all that and said
default that
default what we need to do is to recognise that there is no reason to change the budget in the present circumstances, but we will monitor that
default,
default because there might be a situation in the future in which the basis upon which the budget had been made is changed
default. T
defaulthat is not something that we are likely to know—indeed, it is probably impossible for us to know—between now and December. Indeed, it may not be next year or the year afterwards, but that will be a future thing when we know where the European Union is.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default 
defaultI
defaultn its response to the Commission’s 2030 framework for climate and energy policy, 
defaultthe UK Government 
defaultsuggested that the EU should adopt a unilateral greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 40% for 2030, which is an increase in ambition o
defaultn
default where things apparently presently stand, certainly as far as the Green Paper suggestions are concerned. 
defaultP
defaultresumably 
defaultthat would 
defaultcause a change in circumstances in terms of the fourth carbon budget in a revision downwards, would it not?
defaultDr Kennedydefault: No. What we show in the letter is that the fourth carbon budget is broadly consistent with that 40% target at the European level and the implication of that target for the 
defaultUK
default. The UK Government is also arguing that
default,
default in the context of a global deal
default,
default we should have a 50% target, in which case you would tighten the budget. It is only if the 
defaultUK
default is completely unsuccessful and we end up with business as usual, the current default policies, th
defaultat
default you would look again at the budget. That certainly is not what we are hoping for, it is not what the Government is aiming for, but let us watch closely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default If I can be clear
default, 
defaultthe position on matters as they appear to be moving is that the budget stays as it is.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: Broadly, yes. If you look at the—
defaultDr Whitehead:default The higher rate of ambition might cause the budget to be reviewed downwards.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: Yes, annex 2
default says, “The budget is 1,950 
defaultmegatonne
defaults”. It might be 1,960 if the 
defaultUK
default is successful with its unilateral target for the EU, and if we move to a 50% target, you would tie it to something
default like
default 1,850 
defaultmegatonne
defaults. So it is developed very much in the way that we had assumed when we designed the fourth carbon budget
default. T
defaulthat is why we say there has not been a change in circumstances that leads you to think we should now lower the ambition in the budget.
defaultLord Debendefault: The importanc
defaulte, Dr Whitehead, is simply this:
default that with all the issues that are discussed, it is important to ensure that you know which ones you can have a definitive answer to and which ones you cannot. 
defaultTherefore, w
defaulthat we have done is to provide 
defaultas early as possible 
defaultan interim answer, which says
default,
default 
default“I
defaultn most of the likely scenarios, as far as this bit of the basis of the budget, it looks as if the budget is more or less in the right place
default”
default. There are circumstances in which that would change, both at the bottom and the top, but those circumstances would not be shown until you 
defaultreached
default that point. Looking at the speed with which the European Union moves and the rest of it, that is not going to happen between now and the end of the year, and it may not even happen next year. We thought it was right to at least clear that one out of the way while we were doing the work.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Whitehead:default Yes. 
defaultF
defaultinally, how do you see your position as a committee based in the legislation
default,
default relative to such changes that might be made to the fourth carbon budget?
defaultLord Debendefault: The 
defaultc
defaultommittee has a particular legal position
default, which is that 
defaultwe can review the budget
default,
default and we wanted to do
default that
default. If we propose that it should be tightened or loosened, then the Government can either agree or not agree it. If we propose that there is no need for this, then the budget continues. That is the Climate Change Act situation.
default              
defaultTherefore, i
defaultt is very important that we do this work extremely carefully so that every detail is dealt with. That is what we are doing
default. T
defaulthat is why it is taking rather 
defaulta 
defaultlong time, because we have to look at everything. But happily, the Climate Change Act makes it clear
default 
defaulthow you do it. In other words, you do not bring in exterior things
default. Y
defaultou look at exactly the basis
default. Y
defaultou establish the basis again on which you based the fourth carbon budget in this case, or any budget, and then you look in detail at each of those elements and see whether
default,
default first of all
default,
default individually and then cumulatively
default,
default they demand a change in the budget either upwards or downwards
default. T
defaulthat is what we are going to do.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: The Act is very clear. If there has not been a change in circumstances, then the budget cannot be changed. That is our focus. Has there been a change in circumstances? The Government cannot reinvent the basis upon which the budget was set. It was set on a particular basis. Have those circumstances changed? That is our focus.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default I have brief questions about the 2013 report to Parliament on progress. What do you think the impact is of a low level of public knowledge about 
defaultlow-carbon
default technologies, allied to a jaundiced scepticism because of the perceived increased cost on their pockets that those technologies have, combined with the failure thus far of the Government at the much higher level to agree a strike price with EDF for Hinkley C? What sort of impact do you think that has on the investor community and their confidence about investing in those technologies? Is it a significant impact or a negligible one?
defaultLord Debendefault: I am a businessman, so I start off with the understanding that the most important thing for business is certainty, so uncertainty always has a real effect, and the length of time to establish the nuclear part of this is certainly very serious, but we hope we will come to a conclusion. The Climate Change Committee’s job is to say that it thinks that nuclear should play a part in this portfolio
default,
default and that is what we have said
default,
default therefore we have an interest in that sense to see that it is achieved.
defaultOn the first part of the question, w
defaulthen energy prices are rising
default,
default 
defaultit is extremely difficult 
defaultfor one to make the point that the overwhelming majority of the increase has come from the fact that energy prices have risen and that the green increase is a very much smaller proportion of it. There are two reasons for that. One is that those who do not approve of the policy will emphasise and exaggerate that
default, the
default green bit
default. T
defaulthe other is
default,
default of course
default,
default that those who have an interest in blaming somebody else for their prices will also do that. So you will always get that
default,
default and it is difficult. If you ask the degree, I think it is serious
default.
default I think it is very important for people to
default be 
defaultclear about it
default. That
default is why we have tried
default—
defaultas we said earlier 
defaulton 
defaultabout our website and suchlike
default—
defaultto describe
default it
default so that people know. The Government has to be better and better at explaining it to people, but I am not kidding myself.
defaultYou cannot
default constantly tell people in popular newspapers that the reason for all this is the cost of the portfolio
default,
default without saying to them
default,
default 
default“A
defaultlthough there is a cost and the cost is limited, and this is the limited cost, the reason for that portfolio change is a very fundamental one, which is not just climate change, it is about energy sovereignty and it is about having some security against rising prices of a particular energy source, particularly gas
default”
default. So there is a real sense of investment and insurance that is involved in this.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default In terms of the investor community’s confidence in Hinkley C
default,
default the strike price still to be agreed between EDF and the Government, th
defaulte
default failure thus 
defaultfar and the lead times that may
default result in
default 
defaultto build and 
defaultto 
defaultput online Hinkley C, what impact do you think
default those things
default will have
default on our carbons targets?
defaultLord Debendefault: I do not think I would want to try to do too much 
defaultof an estimate
default,
default because I am always sceptical about the nuclear industry’s ability to meet the targets of timing, even when you know what they are. You are asking me to make a judgment when we do not even have the strike price and we do not know what the timing is going to be. I used to have two nuclear power stations in my constituency. I watched one of them grow
default and
default be built, and I watched them miss every target that they promised as far as 
defaultthe 
defaulttim
defaulting
default 
defaultwa
defaults concerned, so I would prefer not to say that. There is a real issue about investment. 
defaultW
defaulte have only
default just
default begun to explore that
default. We are told t
defaulthere are many opportunities in the wings
default,
default and companies are less willing to come out of the wings until this is over. So I would have to say
default that
default I would wait until it is over
default,
default when we know what the timing is, then I would add a bit to it, if I may say so
default. Then 
defaultour job would be to have 
defaulta
default look 
defaultto
default see whether that 
defaultmeans
default that we have to do more elsewhere. That is the issue.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: We have identified a
defaultn
default 
defaultimportant role for nuclear potentially in meeting low-carbon targets. There is a very healthy nuclear project pipeline
default,
default with at least three investors looking to put significant amounts of money into this country. They will be watching closely what happens with EDF
default. A
defaults John says, 
defaultlet us
default wait and see.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default But if I ask the question 
defaultin
default a slightly different way
default, 
defaultSam Laidlaw from Centrica says he believes that the time
default 
defaultscale for the project has double
defaultd from five years to 10 years. D
defaulto you believe that then has an impact on carbon budgets and targets
default,
default and do you think it has a significant impact on other investors’ confidence and appetite for fulfilling that pipeline that you mentioned?
defaultDr Kennedydefault: We should wait and see what is agreed. We have assumed something that is quicker than 10 years in designing our different scenarios for investment in the power sector. If it was 10
default years
default, I think it
default would probably raise
default questions about what is the contribution of nuclear to power sector decarbonisation over that time
default 
defaultframe relative to the other technologies, but again
default,
default it 
defaultis 
defaultsomething we would not spend too much 
defaulttime 
defaultspeculating on now. 
defaultLet us
default get some facts about that
default,
default and then let us understand the implications of it.
defaultLord Debendefault: I am always careful about particular people, so I am going to avoid the Sam Laidlaw question, because one of the issues is
default that 
defaultyou also have to work out why people say certain things
default,
default and sometimes we have a range of reasons for saying things. The real issue is
default,
default once you have a stake in the ground
default,
default we can make those prognostications. I know the Minister says we are just a few weeks away, but I have heard that before and I just want to wait.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default Can you make a prognostication about the Green Deal, which has
default had a great amount of interest
default but a 
defaultdispiritingly
default low level of take-up? What do you think the level of take-up has to be to make it a significant contributor to achieving our carbon targets?
defaultLord Debendefault: Without being rude and saying
default,
default 
default“M
defaultore than it is at the moment
default”
default, I
default 
defaultdo think we have to be sensible about these things and say
default, “I
defaultf it does not appear to have hit the spot as we hoped it would, are there are other things that we should be doing to try to make it 
defaultdo it
default?
default”
default In other words, at the moment, it quite clearly is not achieving what the Government had hoped that it would achieve. I would like it to achieve that. I think 
defaultthere is
default a lot going for it and much in it
default. B
defaultut clearly it is either a much slower-burning fuse than anybody thought it was going to be or there are some things that have to be changed. I do not think we should be ashamed of changing
default it
default. It is not for us to do, but I think nobody should be ashamed of changing things
default. I
defaultt is funny, it is like a product
default—
defaultI have been involved in launching a product. You think you are going to do it absolutely right and it turns out something needs to be changed, and if you are a sensible business you change it as quickly as you can.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: 
defaultThe 
defaultorder of magnitude
default. I
defaultf you look at the previous policy
default,
default that was delivering millions of measures each year. If you look at 2012, it was in the millions for loft 
defaultand 
defaultcavity wall insulation. You would have to look at achieving those levels in future to say it is a successful policy. It is not doing that at the moment
default. From the start w
defaulte raised fundamental questions about the Green Deal. I think there are also fundamental questions about the energy company obligation, focusing on what looks to be very expensive solid wall insulation. I say those are questions
default;
default we do not have the answer
defaults
default for you now
default,
default but again
default,
default we will come back on this in our Parliament report
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Climate Change Act requires us to do a deep dive on all of the key policies. We will do that in July next year.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default I wonder if Lord Deben can give us a sneak preview of what he thinks should be in there
default.
default H
defaulte says he would not be ashamed to make changes
default, so
default I wonder what levers he would pull or knobs he would twist to make changes to the Green Deal
default.
defaultLord Debendefault: Mr Pincher, you are so tempting, but I
default 
defaultam not going to go down that path. I do not think I ought to
default,
default because everything I say needs to be based on the evidence that we have
default,
default and we 
defaultare looking in great detail a
defaultt the reasons and the issues involved. We did make a number of criticisms of the way that this worked in the past, so we have not been uncritical about it
default. B
defaultut 
defaultI do 
defaultsay again what I said to Alan Whitehead
default. T
defaulthe fact is that if your policies need to be changed, improved, altered, that is what you have to do. If we think that is the case
default,
default that is exactly what we will say, but I do not want to pre-empt
default it
default. We
default 
defaultdo spend a lot of time getting this right
default,
default and if I started pre-empting it, I know my team—which is a jolly good team—would soon say to me, “What the hell are you doing?”
defaultDr Kennedydefault: We do know the options t
defaulthat we will consider—c
defaultan you do stuff with council tax? Can you do stuff with stamp duty? Can you increase flexibility in the energy company obligation, opening that up to different measures? Can you put a safety valve into the energy company obligation, a bit like the renewables b
defaultuy-out 
defaultmechanism? Is there a bigger role for local authorities? 
defaultSo t
defaulthere are a set of things that we will be looking at very closely.
defaultLord Debendefault: There is one other thing that I am prepared to be led down the garden path on, which is simply this. I think people should not underestimate the need to put things simply so that people understand things
default,
default and I am not sure that that is always true about our policies.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default On that note, I will ask one last question, if I may
default.
default I
defaultt is very quick. The Government’s policy is dual. It is essentially to reduce energy output and money outlaid by more efficiency, but also by being better insulated. When you model the amount of energy saved and also the cost to the consumer that is saved, do you build into your model the spending that might result a
defaults a result of that money saved—
defaultwhat the customer, the consumer
default,
default will spend their cash on
default—
defaultand does that have an impact on our carbon targets? If they then spend their cash on goods from 
defaultChina
default,
default 
defaultBrazil
default,
default 
defaultMalaysia
default and 
defaultIndonesia
default, so they are walking around in Primark t-shirts with big carbon footprints on their backs, should we 
defaultnot 
defaultbe counting that too?
defaultLord Debendefault: You have to be very careful
default, first,
default to ensure that what you are trying to model is precisely
default 
defaultable to be modelled;
default and secondly
default,
default that you say very clearly what you are modelling. The answer is
default no
default,
default we do not to the sort of extent you are talking about
default, but we do in other ways.
defaultDr Kennedydefault: We do in the sense that we model the rebound effect. We do not say, “The energy saved through insulating your loft is this and there is no consequence of saving money and spending that elsewhere in the economy”. We model the rebound effect using the best evidence available. It erodes some of the energy saving, but not all of it.
defaultLord Debendefault: What I mean by making that first comment is that
default,
default no, I do
default not think that when we model
default the rebound effect in a general sense
default—
defaultwhich we hope takes that into account
default—
defaultit is very easy to move down to the next stage, which is to count the number of Primark shirts. There is something between those two, which is what we use.
default              
defaultThe other thing we are very careful about is that it does depend
default on
default where you do the energy saving. If you do the energy saving among the poorest, who have been spending every penny that they can afford on their energy, the actual energy saving you have is much less, because what happens is that they the
defaultn make their house warm enough. They 
defaultuse the same amount of money
default,
default and indeed may well spend the same amount of energy, because they were living in a cold house and 
defaultnow 
defaultthey live in a warm house. Part of that warmth is because of the insulation, but part of it is because they are using the same amount of energy, but it is more effective. So you have to aim off that in quite a big way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultChristopher Pincher:default I accept that you have to have some form of gearing when you model, but I just make the point—and I think Philip Lee made the point—that if we are not measuring emissions by consumption and nobody else is measuring those emissions, then there is an emission measurement gap and that we might be paying for that.
defaultLord Debendefault: Indeed. We are trying hard to make sure that we do it in this circumstance by consumption, so at least your figures for saving are as good 
defaultas they can be
default taking into account those two elements, the one that I mentioned a
defaultnd the one that you mentioned. S
defaulto there is certain
defaultt
defaulty, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default I have a note here urging me to be brief, so could I ask for brief answers as well? It is about the Climate Change Act and post-legislative scrutiny. I am going to take the huge risk of asking a question to which I do not know the answer, which one should never do on these occasions. One of the main features of the Act was that it was said to be the only legally binding framework in the world. What would be the implications for Government and Ministers if they choose to ignore 
defaultsurreptitiously
default the targets and budgets you set them? Would they go to jail; would they be fined; would they be judicially reviewed? What does “legally binding” mean?
defaultLord Debendefault: 
default“
defaultLegally binding
default”
default means that there are processes laid down in the Act that Ministers and the Government are bound to follow. Were they not to follow them and not to repeal the Act, then they would obviously be open to judicial review. 
defaultI
defaultt would not be
default for
default us to do that, but that is the situation. If they suddenly said, “We are going to ignore the Act and do X” then somebody would take them to judicial review
default,
default because the Act says they have to do Y. That is the situation. We cannot impose budgets on people, but we propose a budget, Parliament accepts that budget or not, then that budget becomes the budget and the Government is required by law to achieve that budget
default,
default and we are required to say each year whether they do achieve that budget. What w
defaultould happen if they refused to r
defaulteceive that budget, it having
default been parliamentarily laid down?
default I suppose—but it would not be for me to say this—they would be subject to some kind of judicial review
default,
default because that is what they have said.
default 
defaultThe sanction is judicial review.
default              defaultDr Kennedydefault: Say 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Government—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default 
defaultNo, that is fine. Y
defaultou have answered the question
default. Th
defaultere is no need to answer it several times. Now we know. So the judges could come in and impose a policy in response to a judicial review that the Government had rejected. That is fair enough.
defaultLord Debendefault: May I say, it was worth making just those two distinctions. There are some things that arise from the nature of the Act, the other things that arise from Parliament having passed a budget. That is all.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default The other aspect of the thing is that it is unilateral
default.
default 
defaultBritain
default is bound by this Act. No other country is. To what extent can you take into account the growth of emissions elsewhere? When asked by Mr Byles for other countries that were as stringent as us, you puzzled me by quoting 
defaultChina
default, because this Committee produced a report that said—I had 
defaultit 
defaultin front of me just now, but it has wiped itself out—
defaultthat 
defaulthalf the growth in the world’s carbon emissions between now and 2030 would come from 
defaultChina
default. How is that compatible with them having a more stringent policy than us?
defaultLord Debendefault: I do not think I used the word “stringent
default,
default” but I will—
defaultMr Lilley:default Mr Byles did.
defaultLord Debendefault: Yes. I will just say this:
default the Chinese Government has now produced its five-year plan. It has now tightened that five-year plan. Its policy is to reduce its emissions very significantly.
defaultMr Lilley:default Not its emissions, no.
defaultLord Debendefault: Sorry, just a moment. It originally had a view that it would not be concerned to reduce its emissions. It is now talking about peaking its emissions very much earlier than it previously did. It is now talking about objectively reducing emissions after that peaking
default. Y
defaultou are perfectly right that 
defaultpreviously 
defaultit did not do that
default. It 
defaulttalked about measuring its emissions in a wholly different way. But it has changed
default. I
defaultt now has some pretty—I will use the word now—stringent determination. The issue that you and I would have, and we would be on the same side of this, is
default whether
default it 
defaultis 
defaultgoing to do what it says it is going to do
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default My recollection is that their targets—what you are saying means that this Committee was wrong in its report—were to reduce the emission
defaults
default intensity of economic growth
default. E
defaultmissions would continue to rise but not quite as rapidly as they would have done if they had not reduced the emissions intensity for economic growth. So they would not peak, they would continue growing.
defaultLord Debendefault: That was the position. It has changed its position, so your Committee is not wrong
default. I
defaultt has said that it is now looking to peak. There is an argument about when it is going to peak
default,
default but it is certainly doing that
default,
default and the implications of its present policy are that it would reduce its emissions
default. T
defaulth
defaultat
default is very recent
default. I
defaultt has happened over the last three months
default and
default is subsequent to any of the evidence the Committee should have
default.
default 
defaultSo 
defaultI am certainly not suggesting 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Committee was wrong
default. I
defaultndeed, I think it is much better to stick to that until we have seen the evidence. I am merely saying 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is what its policies are 
defaultnow
default, a
defaultnd I find that very encouraging. It shows that 
defaultChina
default is moving.
default&#xa0;defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Lilley:default Perhaps you could look at it a little further and give us a written note on what has happened since April when we debated this report in Parliament

defaultChair:default Finally, we would like to welcome the decision to remove yourself from Veolia’s energy-related activities
default. O
defaultbviously it caused quite a lot of media interest. Do you think there are any lessons that could be learnt for DECC to try to improve their processes?
defaultLord Debendefault: I will not argue about how much 
defaultmedia
default interest
default there was. I
defaultf I may say so, 
defaultit was largely 
defaultin one place
default. B
defaulteside
defaults
default that, the fact of the matter is that if I had known that this subsidiary company had a very small interest in linking up electricity of all kinds
default,
default with no 
defaultparticular 
defaultinterest in renewable energy, I would have told the Committee. I am pretty sure that the Committee would have seen that that was so distant I never had anything to do with it
default, that
default I was not going to have anything to do with it
default and
default that it was not a conflict of interest. I have always said it was a pity that I had not been informed of that, but the situation had 
defaultnot 
defaultarisen. It is very clear to me that this can happen t
defaulto anybody in the circumstances.
defaultOne thing I think I have to say is 
defaultthat surely 
defaultthe Committee would have recognised
default that,
default with my past
default,
default if ever there had been any question of anything that might have been seen as a conflict of interest, I would have withdrawn myself. All I have done is to 
defaultput
default that on the face of the

defaultill, so to speak, rather than not. Of course I would have 
defaultmuch 
defaultpreferred the order of these things to have been the right one, which is that I would have known in the first place and told you in the first place
default,
default and you would have seen what the context is.
default              defaultChair:default Thank you very much.
default I would like to thank you for your evidence. We will be writing and following up some of the issues further, and if there is anything you wanted to have said that has not come across, please write to me.
default Thank you.
