[normal]Q.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It will also be important to understand what resistance reservoir exists in normal human and animal commensal microbiota (even prior to any antibiotic exposure). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We need to know:

[normal]Q. Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q. What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Strengths
[normal]:  realisation that there is a problem and that measure should be undertaken to combat this problem.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Department of Health 5 year strategy states at Point 2.1, page 8; ‘Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than antibiotics in animals’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Weaknesses
[normal]: lack of willingness to introduce comprehensive legislation to combat resistance development in both the human and veterinary sectors.
