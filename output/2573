WWC12[bold]Written evidence submitted by Dr Ruth [bold]McLellan[bold], Senior Lecturer at Southampton [bold]Solent University.[bold]1.[bold]0[bold] EXEC[bold]UTIVE[bold] SUMMARY [bold]2.[bold]0[bold] CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND[bold]2.1 
[normal]This submission is based on my experience in the following roles and contexts
[normal] in relation to the underachievement in education of white working class children.
[normal]2.2 
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]doctorate
[normal] study
[normal] 
[normal]was designed to 
[normal]answer the research aim ‘who influences white working
[normal] 
[normal]class boy’s higher education decision-making process?: the role of social networks’. As such, the evide
[normal]nce I provide is focused on white working-class boys, aged 15-16. Providing additional context
[normal] to my empirical 
[normal]study, 
[normal]research was undertaken through
[normal] qualitative 
[normal]primary 
[normal]data
[normal] collection
[normal] 
[normal]which 
[normal]comprised of 55 individual interviews and 7 group interviews wit
[normal]h a 
[normal]selection
[normal] of 10
[normal] working class
[normal] boys
[normal] across two secondary schools
[normal], their parent(s), a nominated teacher, a friend from school, head teacher
[normal] of both schools
[normal], deputy head teacher
[normal] from both schools
[normal] and widening participation officers based at a local univer
[normal]sity. 
[normal]Data was collected between 2008-2010.
[normal]2.3 
[normal]I have always had a very strong interest in the ed
[normal]ucational attainment of working 
[normal]class young people, coming from that social background myself, hence undertaking a doctorate in that area. 
[normal]I therefore feel ab
[normal]le to comment on the underachievemen
[normal]t in education by white working 
[normal]class 
[normal]pupils
[normal] from a local and regional perspective.
[normal]3.[bold]0[bold] FACTUAL INFORMATION[bold]3.1 
[normal]This section presents 
[normal]the key empirical findings from my study
[normal] and addresses a number of points set out in the briefing document
[normal]. Firstly, I would like to clarify that whilst my study focused on the role of social network
[normal]s
[normal] on HE decision-making
[normal];
[normal] underpinning HE decision-making 
[normal]is
[normal] the 
[normal]role
[normal] of
[normal] prior educational attainment
[normal], aspirations
[normal] and widening participation activities; these will be discussed throughout this submission. 
[normal]3.2 [bold]Extent of white working[bold] [bold]class pupil’s educational underachievement[bold]3.2.1 
[normal]Notions of what it means to be working class
[normal] is synonymous with disadvantage. Disadvantage in schools is generally measured by Free School Meals (
[normal]FSM
[normal]). 
[normal]The most recent 
[normal]Department for Education
[normal] (
[normal]DfE
[normal], 2012)
[normal] 
[normal]results show only 34.6% of students entitled to FSM achieved 5+ A*-C including English and math
[normal]’s, compared to 62% of those not entitled to FSM.
[normal] In addition, there is a wealth of statistical data published by a range of government departments proving the educational underachievement of white working class pupils. 
[normal]3.3 [bold]The factors responsible for whi[bold]te working class pupils’ educational underachievement, including the impact of home and family. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.1 
[normal]The factors responsible for educational underachievement are v
[normal]ery complex
[normal] and
[normal] situated in a
[normal] wide
[normal] range of social, economic and local factors. 
[normal] These inc
[normal]lude, lack of prior attainment in school, which starts at a very young age
[normal];
[normal] gaps are already large and visible 
[normal]at 22 months of age 
[normal](Department for Children, School and Families
[normal], 2009) and these gaps continue to grow through school. In 
[normal]addition, literature 
[normal]highlights socio-economic disadvantage, race and gender, disengagement in education, impact of masculinity on boys’ attitudes to education, parents
[normal]’
[normal] levels of education, parents
[normal]’
[normal] occupations, parent
[normal]’
[normal]s income, neighbourhood, social identi
[normal]t
[normal]y
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]low aspirations
[normal] 
[normal]and finally
[normal] lack of access to social capital
[normal].  There is a wealth of information available on each of these 
[normal]factors;
[normal] however, little has been written in the individual context of both white working class boys and girls, instead much of the research has tre
[normal]ated the group as homogenous. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 [bold]Whether the problem is significantly worse for white working class boys than girls. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.1 
[normal]Again, there is a wealth of statistical evidence available proving that the problem is significantly worse for white working cla
[normal]ss boys than girls. For example, t
[normal]he most recent 
[normal]DfE
[normal] (Department for Education, 2012)
[normal] report
[normal] highlights the differences in gendered attainment; results show that 54.6% of boys achieved 5+A*-C including English and Math’s, compared to 61.9% of girls.  Unpac
[normal]king this further
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Chowdry
[normal] et al (2008) identify that only 4% of white British boys move up from the middle of the educational attainment distribution at K
[normal]ey 
[normal]S
[normal]tage 
[normal]2  to the top of the attainment distribution at Key Stage 4, whilst for white British girls,
[normal] this figure is 10%. These statistics highlight the importance of gender and show that there is an attainment issue for white British boys between Key Stage 2 and 
[normal]Key Stage 4
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.2 
[normal]Poor attainment at 
[normal]Key Stage 4
[normal] also impacts upon HE participation. 
[normal]HEFCE (2010, p.2) quantifies that “the participation rate of young men now trails that of young women by a decade and over the past 15 years around 270,000 fewer young men than young women have entered HE”. 
[normal] 
[normal]3.4.3 
[normal]From my experience teaching students on a
[normal]n ‘access
[normal] to HE
[normal]’ course in HE, I have found this to be predominately made up of 
[normal]males
[normal] from a range of ethnic groups. For example, this academic year 2013-14, the course has recruited 
[normal]230 students, approximately 80% are male
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.5 [bold]What steps schools can tak[bold]e to improve the educational outcomes and attainment of white working class [bold]pupils?[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.5.1 
[normal]My study found that disadvantaged families had high aspirations however; their immediate social networks had little educational experience. This directly impacted o
[normal]n the amount of educational social capital resource available within the network to help mobilise aspirations, which in turn raised motivation for attainment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.2 
[normal]My study researched into a ‘network approach’ whereby the boy, his family, friends and the school all identified their role in supporting with attainment and educational progression. 
[normal]Ultimately, e
[normal]veryone has a role to play in improving educational outcomes
[normal] and attainment of white working class pupils. 
[normal]There needs to be joined up thinking between the school, the pupil and the home in order to develop a ‘collaborative influence’. Therefore allowing aspirations to be shared and aligning 
[normal]positive 
[normal]messages to th
[normal]e pupil in the network. This 
[normal]approach
[normal] allow
[normal]s
[normal] network members to compensate those disadvantaged families with limited access to social capital. For example, one boy in my study wanted to be a doctor, however this aspiration was not shared between the school
[normal] or home.  The school was invited to send widening participation pupils to participate in a medical aspiration raising event at a local university, but the boy was not invited to attend. This left the boy feeling angry that he had not been chosen.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.3
[normal] 
[normal]My research concluded that schools are 
[normal]best 
[normal]placed to support with 
[normal]aspiration raising which 
[normal]further 
[normal]impacts upon attainment; schools are a conduit between pupils and aspiration raising activities. In addition, schools are full of staff 
[normal]that
[normal] have access to
[normal] social capital and networks and know how to develop this capital. However
[normal] there is a role for other members of the boy’s network
[normal], who may not be aware of the term ‘social capital’ and the benefits that it can bring to young people
[normal]. I recommend that school
[normal]s work more closely with network members in order to 
[normal]train
[normal] and educat
[normal]e
[normal] them on the role 
[normal]and value 
[normal]of social networks and 
[normal]how to 
[normal]utilis
[normal]e
[normal] social capital that is available within the
[normal] immediate and wider
[normal] network. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]Teachers generally have access to social networks 
[normal]which possess
[normal] social capital. Schools should encourage teachers to utilise their social networks in order to support pupils with aspiration raising. For example, the entire music department in one of the sc
[normal]hools in my study developed strong relationships with the local colleges
[normal]’
[normal] music departments and invited them to attend performances/recitals in order to support college aspiration and transition.  
[normal]In turn, the pupils worked with focus and determination in 
[normal]their music lessons and attained well, allowing them to study music at college. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]A number of teachers had developed a ‘holistic approach’ to developing the pupils which focused on more than learning and teaching, specifically on 
[normal]raising 
[normal]aspirations 
[normal]and attainment for future life roles. 
[normal]These teachers understood the value of the social network to support working class pupils aspirations and attainment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]6
[normal] 
[normal]My research found that the value of ‘talk’ was highly beneficial to raising aspirations and f
[normal]urther
[normal]more
[normal], talk was a catalyst for positive emotions and actions. Talking helped pupils to extract value from exposure to widening participation activities. However, whilst pupils attended widening participation events, there was very little follow up fro
[normal]m their teachers, as their focus was on attainment within their subject, rather than on aspiration for attainment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6 [bold]The potential for a wider range of educational approaches, for example vocational pathways, to improve outcomes for white working class[bold] pupils.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.1 
[normal]Citizenship education 
[normal]needs to include training on forms of capital
[normal],
[normal] for example, what it is, how it is developed, benefits, barriers to development, etc. This way young people will be able to identify networks and social capital that is
[normal] available and how best to develop/utilise it. 
[normal]3.6.2 
[normal]Dist
[normal]ribution of widening 
[normal]participation
[normal] resources should be assessed. Currently 
[normal]HEFCEs widening participation fund is directly given to
[normal] Higher Education Institutions
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]HEI
[normal]s
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]who
[normal] then decide on the best way to spend the money. Whilst I acknowledge that HEIs outreach staff do spend a considerable amount of time in schools, they generally attend an event and then depart, unable to spend more time in the school and unable to fully un
[normal]derstand the barriers to widening participation, aspiration and attainment that the pupils at the school face. HEI outreach staff provide a very importance service, they are a conduit between the school and the university and have an invaluable role to pla
[normal]y.  
[normal]3.7 [bold]What role Government can play in delivering improved educational outcomes for white[bold]-[bold]working class pupils.[bold]3.7.1 
[normal]Further work needs to be undertaken on targeting the correct group for outreach activities. My study found that those pupils who attend
[normal]ed aspiration activities included advantaged pupils, who were chosen because they were well behaved and were up to date on coursework. However, these students had strong aspirations and were motivated to attain at schoo
[normal]l. 
[normal]The disadvantaged students who wou
[normal]ld have benefitted the most were not 
[normal]always 
[normal]invited. 
[normal]3.7.2 Mothers play a nurturing role and genuinely valued education and understood how it could increase social mobility. The mothers in my study demonstrated a strong work ethic and a number had returne
[normal]d to education
[normal]/training
[normal] as mature adults. The mothers discussed how they talked to their children about their return to education/training and study experiences and their sons discussed how they were able to watch their mothers enjoy learning. The outcome 
[normal]of access to education/training allows mothers (and fathers) to access wider networks and resources, which can be drawn upon to 
[normal]support their children and raise
[normal] their aspirations. The government should make available budgets to allow disadvantaged parents 
[normal]access to 
[normal]education/training including support for part-time provision. 
[normal]3.7.3 University outreach is highly valued 
[normal]by
[normal] pupils especially on campus visits, however teachers rarely attended due to their value in the classroom. This is a missed opportunity as
[normal] teachers attending would allow them to further develop their social network 
[normal]with university staff 
[normal]and moreover be able to talk to their 
[normal]pupils
[normal] about the aspiration raising activities in order to increase attainment. Schools need to be encouraged to 
[normal]let te
[normal]achers attend outreach activities. 
[normal]3.8 [bold]Recommendations for action by Government for committee to consider:[bold]3.8.1 
[normal]What I outline below are a number of 
[normal]recommendations
[normal] that will go some way to making inroads on this complex social problem. The 
[normal]recommendations 
[normal]have been proposed to include the input of every social network member, however, more responsibility has been given to schools with support from the government. This is because schools are 
[normal]a constant in the white working class pupil’s lives
[normal] and can represent a source of stability. In addition, schools have an understanding of the benefits of educational attainment and therefore have value to add in the process of raising aspirations for white working class pupil’s attainment. Finally, school
[normal]s are 
[normal]conduits to local HEI
[normal]s and other organisations
[normal] that 
[normal]provide
[normal] aspiration-raising activities. 
[normal]3.8.2 C
[normal]orrect
[normal] identification and
[normal] targeting to ensure that white working
[normal] 
[normal]class 
[normal]pupils
[normal] are included in widening participation activities is vital for their 
[normal]aspi
[normal]ration raising
[normal]. 
[normal]Schools are constrained in their decisions regarding who should attend events by the importance of academic attainment. This submission has already shown 
[normal]that white boys have the lowest academic attainment at Key Stage 4. However, the decis
[normal]ion not to allow a poor academically performing pupil to attend events needs to be weighed up against the benefit and impact on aspiration and motivation that this could have. 
[normal]3.8.3 
[normal]Catalysts, such as specific widening participation activities for talking
[normal] about 
[normal]aspirations
[normal] have a fundamental impact on 
[normal]educational outcomes
[normal]. Ultimately, no 
[normal]exposure to 
[normal]catalyst
[normal]s
[normal] results in
[normal] pupils
[normal] no
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]developing and 
[normal]talking about 
[normal]aspirations 
[normal]with
[normal] network members, which in turn results in no reflection
[normal] on the part of the pupils
[normal] and what they
[normal] fundamentally
[normal] want to achieve in life
[normal] and how important educational attainment is
[normal]. It is not just the case of having catalysts, but also planning for how to make the most of the activity after the event, to encourage the 
[normal]pupils
[normal] to talk and r
[normal]eflect on their experiences. This is where the real value of the widening participation experience 
[normal]is 
[normal]held
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]s such, planning for catalysts needs to be viewed holistically, so that maximum benefit can be gained. As catalysts for 
[normal]aspiration
[normal] talk generally t
[normal]ake place within the school environment, then the school along with the HE outreach teams must work together on these. Planning should include how 
[normal]all
[normal] network members could also contribute to the process of talking 
[normal]t
[normal]o the pupil.
[normal]3.8.4 Teachers 
[normal]obviously
[normal] va
[normal]lue the benefits of 
[normal]education
[normal] and therefore this value could be included and extended into the classroom in a planned approach, through the role of continuing professional development
[normal] (CPD)
[normal].  The outcome 
[normal]of CPD 
[normal]will 
[normal]be to 
[normal]emphasise 
[normal]through teachers 
[normal]that 
[normal]education
[normal] is a normal course of action and that 
[normal]pupils
[normal] could benefit from 
[normal]attaining well in it
[normal]. However, resources and training need to be provided to teachers working in schools 
[normal]with disadvantaged students 
[normal]who 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]present
[normal] a highly complex and chal
[normal]lenging environment. 
[normal]3.8.5 Schools working with white working
[normal] 
[normal]class 
[normal]pupils
[normal] would benefit from the employment of a dedicated graduate, preferably a young white working
[normal] 
[normal]class 
[normal]person
[normal] from the local area who ‘made it’ to university. This graduate would act as
[normal] a role model, whilst also undertaking a student mentor role. The student mentor would be in a position to understand and appreciate the complexities and constraints of the pervading social characteristics which impact upon 
[normal]educational attainment
[normal]. This ini
[normal]tiative of employing a young graduate as a student mentor has been successfully used with a number of schools and 
[normal]one of the schools in my study 
[normal]self-funded this role for two years, during 2009-2010, prior to cuts in the education budget, which 
[normal]unfortunate
[normal]ly 
[normal]resulted in this post being removed. 
[normal]3.8.6 The study itself added value to the boy
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]attainment
[normal] process and it had a powerful influence as the boys had their voices heard. The boys said that they had benefitted from participating in the study as it boo
[normal]sted their self-beliefs and made them feel that they were clever enough to 
[normal]continue with their education, therefore giving them a reason to attain at school
[normal]. Adding to the role of the student mentor, could be the formation within school, and supported by H
[normal]EIs, of inclusive white working
[normal] 
[normal]class groups which allow the 
[normal]pupils
[normal] to have their voices heard whilst discussing questions about their future decisions and career choices. This approach has the potential to unintentionally stigmatise the 
[normal]pupils
[normal], however th
[normal]is has to be weighed up against the benefits of forming this group, to 
[normal]increase educational attainment from this group
[normal]. Ultimately, this group would support the 
[normal]pupils’
[normal] aspirations, growth and emotional development whilst boosting their self confidence, th
[normal]at they could ‘make it’ 
[normal]within their chosen field
[normal].
[normal]3.9 [bold]Conclusions[bold]3.9.1 
[normal]In conclusion, 
[normal]I would like to highlight that there is still much to be done in order to increase the educational attainment of white working class pupils. One such way is to develop 
[normal]a partnership approach, whereby members of the pupils network work together in order to support their aspirations and to draw upon the social capital held within the network to 
[normal]enhance
[normal] the
[normal]ir educational attainment prospects
[normal]. 
[normal] The government’s role is pivot
[normal]al in supporting networks to make a difference to the educational outcomes of white working class young people.
