defaultExecutive Summary
default&#xa0;
default1.  This submission outlines the work of ICEVI (the International Council for Education of People with Visual 
defaultImpairment) in promoting the education of visually impaired children and working to achieve a higher profile for disability in the post-2015 development framework.  It summarises my activity in relation to the UK Government on international development and
default concludes with a number of recommendations which 
defaultDfID
default should take on board going forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroduction:
default&#xa0;
default2.  I am blind and President of ICEVI (The International Council for Education of People with Visual Impairment), a worldwide body dedicated to promo
defaultting quality education for visually impaired children.
default&#xa0;
default3.  It is estimated that there are 6 million children worldwide with a visual impairment, 80 % of them in developing countries.  Of these, over 90 % or 4
default,4
default million receive no education at all.  In 199
default0 the Education 
defaultFor
default All (EFA) programme was launched by the UN with the goal of universal access to primary education by 2015.  EFA has made significant progress in reaching non-disabled children, but it has to a large extent failed to include children wit
defaulth disabilities, particularly those that require alternative modes of communication.
default&#xa0;
default4.  For these reasons, in 2006, in conjunction with the World Blind Union (WBU), we launched the EFA-VI (Education for All Visually Impaired Children) initiative.  Since t
defaulthen, we have been instrumental in getting nearly 75,000 children into school, and have involved some 35,000 participants in capacity building programmes.  But we are conscious that to achieve our aim, we need to work with many partners and to persuade nati
defaultonal governments to accept their responsibility to see to it that visually impaired children go to school.
default&#xa0;
default5.  This background has led me to take an interest in the UK Government's stance on international development issues.
default&#xa0;
default6.  Earlier this year, with N
defaultGO support, I coordinated a group of Parliamentarians to make representations to the Prime Minister in his capacity of co-Chair of the Secretary-General's High 
defaultLevel Panel about the importance of disability featuring more prominently in the post-2015 devel
defaultopment framework.
default  It wasn't possible to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister.  Our letter was referred to 
defaultDfID
default and I ended up meeting the PUSS, Lynne Featherstone, on behalf of the group at the end of October.
default&#xa0;
default7.  In the result we were very happy wi
defaultth the high profile given to disability throughout the High Level Panel's report, from the reference to "leave no-one behind", to the call for a "data revolution" or the disaggregation of data by disability and other factors, and the recommendation that "t
defaultargets will only be considered 'achieved' if they are met for all relevant income and social groups.  We understand that the Prime Minister's leadership was instrumental in securing this outcome.
default&#xa0;
default8.  ICEVI will continue to engage with the post-2015 proces
defaults, which has now moved to the Open Working Group.  The rest of this submission consists of the recommendations which we put to the PUSS.
default&#xa0;
defaultSubmission
default&#xa0;
default9.  Although disability has been a priority for the Coalition Government's international development work 
defaultfrom the first, my experience has been that, compared with gender equality, it has remained very much an after-thought.  When I began to address 
defaultDfID's
default international work, I found that 
defaultDfID's
default Guidelines on Disability were criticised.  Accordingly, after a 
defaultmeeting with PUSS Stephen O'Brien in June 2011, I arranged for a short note of key messages to be prepared which the Department circulated to country offices.
default This is appended as Annex 1 (below).
default&#xa0;
default10.  When I met 
defaultLynne
default Featherstone, I strongly welcomed the
default priority she was now giving to disability.
default&#xa0;
default11.  I said it was important to build on her "accessible schools" announcements in New York and Uganda with a broad interpretation of "accessible" to include educational materials, induction loops, etc.
default&#xa0;
default12.  Th
defaulte initiative should be expanded to embrace health - 
defaultDfID
default should not fund healthcare projects, e.g. secondary clinic and hospital construction projects which do not meet inclusion criteria.  Development projects should be looking at the development of the w
defaulthole child.
default&#xa0;
default13.  Disability needs to be embedded in all that 
defaultDfID
default does - the Department should adopt a systemic approach.  As a test case, the Department could ensure that a big upcoming funding decision, e.g. some bilateral reviews or a big multi-lateral
default review, is fully inclusive of disabled people.
default&#xa0;
default14.  The Department's Partnership Principles dating from 2005 make no reference to disability.  This should be remedied in the revision which is currently taking place.
default&#xa0;
default15.  Accountability mechanisms need t
defaulto be in place to monitor the effectiveness of work on disability.  The Department's particular interest in seeing that the right data are collected has been noted.  The UK could provide leadership globally on this issue, e.g. through a multi-stakeholder pa
defaultrtnership on the collection of disaggregated data in line of the High Level Panel's recommendation.
default&#xa0;
default16.  We cannot properly tackle poverty without tackling disability.  Optimal economic growth will not be achieved without the inclusion of disabled people.
default  The PUSS recognises that economic growth has to be inclusive growth.
default&#xa0;
default17.  It will be important to "lock in" the progress which is being made on disability and to see that accountability mechanisms and staff capacity remain in place.

defaultHow can DFID teams act on UK commitments to disability &amp; inclusive education?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK government is committed to education for people with disabilities, who form 15% of the population, and 30% of children out of 
defaultschool .
default This note offers actions which 
defaultDFID country teams can include in planning and day to day work.  More advice is available in DFID’s Guidance Note on Education for Children with Disabilities.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome general principles
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID’s influence goes well beyond the money it spends. Questions asked 
defaultby DFID will stimulate action from other donors, government and civil society. DFID staff can make a big difference by asking 1) which barriers affect disabled adults and children; 2) what is being done to improve their participation in education; 3) what 
defaultmore can be done. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDFID experts and programmes may already be making good progress. It is important to share this so that the UK government can show results against its commitments.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn low income countries there are often opportunities to help school sys
defaulttems build in inclusive approaches as they develop. 
defaultPrioritising these offers better value for money than waiting until systems are too fixed to change without greater effort and cost.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultA lack of data, or low visibility of disabled people, should not prev
defaultent progress. It is better to encourage parallel efforts which can grow together – work to get more people with disabilities into education, and efforts to develop evidence of results. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultKey actions that can be included in the work of a DFID country team
default&#xa0;
defaultInclude in plans a narrative section on activities expected to improve participation of people with disabilities in education. 
defaultReport against these, including challenges.
default&#xa0;
defaultMake it clear that DFID expects disability to be reflected in Performance Framework
default Agreements for multilateral or bilateral funding. Ask other donors and government how the PFA can include results on people with disabilities, and how these can be captured. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMake a colleague DFID’s disability contact, and ask them to consult disabled pe
defaultople’s organisations a few times a year. Use information from this in ministerial discussions. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultKey actions that can be included in the work of a DFID education advisor
default&#xa0;
defaultRequest that all logical frameworks for DFID-funded work managed by private sector, 
defaultcivil 
defaultsociety or multilateral agencies contain a gender-disaggregated indicator on how people with disabilities will be reached or benefited. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAsk for the design of teacher training curricula to prioritise helping teachers to welcome and work with a diverse range of learners. Advise that design teams include people with experience of working on disability in mainstream education. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAsk for disagg
defaultregated data on education access and outcomes for disabled children. If official sources are weak, NGOs, DPOs or universities often have data and advice. Advising on selection of EMIS
default or household survey contractors can ensure that organisations which wil
defaultl prioritise disability-disaggregated information are chosen.
