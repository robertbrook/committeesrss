[normal]Executive Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.  This submission outlines the work of ICEVI (the International Council for Education of People with Visual 
[normal]Impairment) in promoting the education of visually impaired children and working to achieve a higher profile for disability in the post-2015 development framework.  It summarises my activity in relation to the UK Government on international development and
[normal] concludes with a number of recommendations which 
[normal]DfID
[normal] should take on board going forward.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  I am blind and President of ICEVI (The International Council for Education of People with Visual Impairment), a worldwide body dedicated to promo
[normal]ting quality education for visually impaired children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  It is estimated that there are 6 million children worldwide with a visual impairment, 80 % of them in developing countries.  Of these, over 90 % or 4
[normal],4
[normal] million receive no education at all.  In 199
[normal]0 the Education 
[normal]For
[normal] All (EFA) programme was launched by the UN with the goal of universal access to primary education by 2015.  EFA has made significant progress in reaching non-disabled children, but it has to a large extent failed to include children wit
[normal]h disabilities, particularly those that require alternative modes of communication.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.  For these reasons, in 2006, in conjunction with the World Blind Union (WBU), we launched the EFA-VI (Education for All Visually Impaired Children) initiative.  Since t
[normal]hen, we have been instrumental in getting nearly 75,000 children into school, and have involved some 35,000 participants in capacity building programmes.  But we are conscious that to achieve our aim, we need to work with many partners and to persuade nati
[normal]onal governments to accept their responsibility to see to it that visually impaired children go to school.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.  This background has led me to take an interest in the UK Government's stance on international development issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.  Earlier this year, with N
[normal]GO support, I coordinated a group of Parliamentarians to make representations to the Prime Minister in his capacity of co-Chair of the Secretary-General's High 
[normal]Level Panel about the importance of disability featuring more prominently in the post-2015 devel
[normal]opment framework.
[normal]  It wasn't possible to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister.  Our letter was referred to 
[normal]DfID
[normal] and I ended up meeting the PUSS, Lynne Featherstone, on behalf of the group at the end of October.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.  In the result we were very happy wi
[normal]th the high profile given to disability throughout the High Level Panel's report, from the reference to "leave no-one behind", to the call for a "data revolution" or the disaggregation of data by disability and other factors, and the recommendation that "t
[normal]argets will only be considered 'achieved' if they are met for all relevant income and social groups.  We understand that the Prime Minister's leadership was instrumental in securing this outcome.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.  ICEVI will continue to engage with the post-2015 proces
[normal]s, which has now moved to the Open Working Group.  The rest of this submission consists of the recommendations which we put to the PUSS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Submission
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.  Although disability has been a priority for the Coalition Government's international development work 
[normal]from the first, my experience has been that, compared with gender equality, it has remained very much an after-thought.  When I began to address 
[normal]DfID's
[normal] international work, I found that 
[normal]DfID's
[normal] Guidelines on Disability were criticised.  Accordingly, after a 
[normal]meeting with PUSS Stephen O'Brien in June 2011, I arranged for a short note of key messages to be prepared which the Department circulated to country offices.
[normal] This is appended as Annex 1 (below).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.  When I met 
[normal]Lynne
[normal] Featherstone, I strongly welcomed the
[normal] priority she was now giving to disability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.  I said it was important to build on her "accessible schools" announcements in New York and Uganda with a broad interpretation of "accessible" to include educational materials, induction loops, etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.  Th
[normal]e initiative should be expanded to embrace health - 
[normal]DfID
[normal] should not fund healthcare projects, e.g. secondary clinic and hospital construction projects which do not meet inclusion criteria.  Development projects should be looking at the development of the w
[normal]hole child.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.  Disability needs to be embedded in all that 
[normal]DfID
[normal] does - the Department should adopt a systemic approach.  As a test case, the Department could ensure that a big upcoming funding decision, e.g. some bilateral reviews or a big multi-lateral
[normal] review, is fully inclusive of disabled people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.  The Department's Partnership Principles dating from 2005 make no reference to disability.  This should be remedied in the revision which is currently taking place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.  Accountability mechanisms need t
[normal]o be in place to monitor the effectiveness of work on disability.  The Department's particular interest in seeing that the right data are collected has been noted.  The UK could provide leadership globally on this issue, e.g. through a multi-stakeholder pa
[normal]rtnership on the collection of disaggregated data in line of the High Level Panel's recommendation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.  We cannot properly tackle poverty without tackling disability.  Optimal economic growth will not be achieved without the inclusion of disabled people.
[normal]  The PUSS recognises that economic growth has to be inclusive growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.  It will be important to "lock in" the progress which is being made on disability and to see that accountability mechanisms and staff capacity remain in place.

[normal]How can DFID teams act on UK commitments to disability &amp; inclusive education?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK government is committed to education for people with disabilities, who form 15% of the population, and 30% of children out of 
[normal]school .
[normal] This note offers actions which 
[normal]DFID country teams can include in planning and day to day work.  More advice is available in DFID’s Guidance Note on Education for Children with Disabilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some general principles
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DFID’s influence goes well beyond the money it spends. Questions asked 
[normal]by DFID will stimulate action from other donors, government and civil society. DFID staff can make a big difference by asking 1) which barriers affect disabled adults and children; 2) what is being done to improve their participation in education; 3) what 
[normal]more can be done. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DFID experts and programmes may already be making good progress. It is important to share this so that the UK government can show results against its commitments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In low income countries there are often opportunities to help school sys
[normal]tems build in inclusive approaches as they develop. 
[normal]Prioritising these offers better value for money than waiting until systems are too fixed to change without greater effort and cost.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A lack of data, or low visibility of disabled people, should not prev
[normal]ent progress. It is better to encourage parallel efforts which can grow together – work to get more people with disabilities into education, and efforts to develop evidence of results. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key actions that can be included in the work of a DFID country team
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Include in plans a narrative section on activities expected to improve participation of people with disabilities in education. 
[normal]Report against these, including challenges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Make it clear that DFID expects disability to be reflected in Performance Framework
[normal] Agreements for multilateral or bilateral funding. Ask other donors and government how the PFA can include results on people with disabilities, and how these can be captured. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Make a colleague DFID’s disability contact, and ask them to consult disabled pe
[normal]ople’s organisations a few times a year. Use information from this in ministerial discussions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key actions that can be included in the work of a DFID education advisor
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Request that all logical frameworks for DFID-funded work managed by private sector, 
[normal]civil 
[normal]society or multilateral agencies contain a gender-disaggregated indicator on how people with disabilities will be reached or benefited. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ask for the design of teacher training curricula to prioritise helping teachers to welcome and work with a diverse range of learners. Advise that design teams include people with experience of working on disability in mainstream education. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ask for disagg
[normal]regated data on education access and outcomes for disabled children. If official sources are weak, NGOs, DPOs or universities often have data and advice. Advising on selection of EMIS
[normal] or household survey contractors can ensure that organisations which wil
[normal]l prioritise disability-disaggregated information are chosen.
