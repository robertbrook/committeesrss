"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubmission to the Select Committee on the European UnionCall for Evidence on EU action to tackle youth unemployment &#xa0;\nThe \nSocial Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at Middlesex University is the UK partner in a new research project, funded by the EU Framework 7 programme, to investigate early school leaving across nine partner countries.  \nRESL.eu (Reducing Early School Leaving in Europe) runs from 2013-2018 and has the following objectives:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFurther information of the project are available on the SPRC website\nhttp://sprc.info/reducing-early-school-leaving-in-europe/\nand on the official RESL.eu website:  \nhttps://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/resl-eu/\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPreliminary work and emerging findings&#xa0;To date the SPRC has collected evidence from stake holders at local, national and at EU level on a range of initiatives to tackle \nyouth unemployment across England.  In addition, we are investigating how EU initiatives may be shaping national and local policies in the English context. \n&#xa0;\nIn the next phase of the study we will be working closely with schools to collect both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interviews and focus groups) on young people’s aspirations and expectations around schooling, training and employment as well as their involvement in specific programmes and initiatives. \n&#xa0;\nThus, although we have limited evidence to share with the select committee at this time, over the next few years, for example a first project paper with preliminary findings on 31 January 2014.  In subsequent years we will have rich data addressing these important issues.\n&#xa0;\n21 October 2013 \n&#xa0;\n"
