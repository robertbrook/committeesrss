[normal]Kay [bold]Allinson[bold] – Written evidence[bold]I would like to see classifying as restricted byways all unsealed unclassified roads (UUCRs) (ie green lanes)
[normal]•         downgrading all existing unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) to restricted byway status
[normal]•         OR, or if this is seen as too draconian a measure, downgrading to restricted byway all unsealed UUCRs and BOATs in National Parks, Areas of Natural Beauty (AONBs) and where part of National Trails 
[normal]•         provide rights of appeal against refusals by highway authorities to make Traffic Regulation Orders excluding motor vehicles from green lanes.
[normal]Reclassifying green lanes to become restricted byways will eliminate altogether the costs and bureaucracy involved in the processing of rights of way claims on them. The downgrading of BOATs to restricted byways would have a net nil effect in terms of red tape/bureaucracy. The creation of a right to appeal against a highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order would not be deregulatory but it does, however, fit squarely within the government’s localism agenda. Thus not only of protecting the environment, residents and non vehicle users but of eliminating the waste of the public money which is being spent on repairing and re-repairing unsealed lanes damaged by motor vehicles
[normal]I live in an area where many beautiful lanes are being vandalised by inappropriate use by motor vehicles, despite being in a National Park (Peak District
[normal])This
[normal] is also very threatening for pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders
