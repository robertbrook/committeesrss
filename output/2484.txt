[[[The West London Housing Partnership]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[The West London Housing Partnership]]] is an umbrella organisation for the 7 West London Local Housing Authorities of Brent; Ealing; Hammersmith &amp; Fulham; Harrow; Hillingdon; Hounslow, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.&#xa0;WLHP is committed to managing the effects of Welfare Reform but also recognises the burdens and pressures that have been placed on local authorities, social landlords and residents. . &#xa0;We draw your attention to the London-specific issues raised in this report in the hope that they will add some weight to the case for reconsideration of London’s unique situation under this legislation.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]London Councils’ ‘Tracking Welfare Reform’ paper (June 2013) calls for:&#xa0;&#xa0;We fully support these calls, noting that the Office for National Statistics reports that private rents in London rose 2.2 per cent in the year to May 2013, compared to a 0.8 per cent rise in the rest of England.&#xa0;The ONS index of rent increases is lower than that suggested by other sources as it takes into account rent increases in existing tenancies, not just new ones. Housing Benefit (HB) increases will no longer be in line with inflation and are to be capped at one per cent.   For anyone trying to access private rented accommodation, rents are increasing at a considerably higher rate. The ONS also reports that private sector rents in London are around twice the national average. Yorks &amp; Humber

[[[1343]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Restrictions to Local Housing Allowance and benefit caps have led to an increase in homeless approaches from people evicted from private rented accommodation. Loss of private rented accommodation is now the biggest single cause of homelessness and has created a huge increase in pressure on local authorities. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]At the same time as homelessness due to loss of private rented accommodation is increasing, local authorities are finding it more and more difficult to procure reasonable quality temporary accommodation in and around London. The number of households being placed in temporary accommodation has continued to increase since 2011 but the availability of temporary private rented accommodation has dropped as private landlords leave the ‘temporary accommodation’ sector for the buoyant rental market in the non-benefit sector. &#xa0;As the proportion of private sector temporary accommodation decreases, local authorities are working hard to maintain the existing supply in a difficult market but are increasingly being forced to look out of London. The concerns in respect of child safety and welfare in out of borough placements are well documented and of paramount importance. Local authorities are likely to have to meet the shortfalls in rent for families in unaffordable temporary accommodation, with more households being moved out of London as the situation is not sustainable. &#xa0;Options for local authorities are therefore extremely limited, and near non-existent for accommodating larger families. Bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) accommodation is already expensive and nightly rate prices are increasing as councils have little choice but to use them. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Local authorities worked hard to meet the Government’s temporary accommodation reduction target December 2010 deadline, however its use has risen steadily over the past year.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The increase in B&amp;B use is particularly steep as local authorities struggle to find additional affordable private sector temporary accommodation.

[[[TA Management Costs]]]The temporary accommodation subsidy arrangement for local authorities includes a £40 per week management fee for placements in accommodation leased from the private rented sector. The government has agreed that when universal credit comes in this management fee will be paid  direct to boroughs rather than through Housing Benefit as it is at present. In the meantime, the overall benefit cap means that in many cases the fee is lost, leaving the local authority to cover the costs from their own increasingly limited funds.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Larger Families and the overall Benefit Cap]]]Under the Benefit Cap, unless they are exempt, families with six or more children receive only 50p Housing Benefit. Whilst boroughs are working with households to help them get into employment, for single parents with young children, child care costs in London make this very difficult. If the children are at school, part-time employment with hours that fit in with schools or self-employment may be the only options. If the parent is unable to get work, then they may be moved to a cheaper area. However, there are often reasons why this cannot happen. For example, it is difficult to move families with a child doing GSCEs or A-levels because of the disruption to a key stage of their education.  &#xa0;Even if a family is moved to a cheaper location, they won't be able to afford the rent, whether private, affordable or social. 

[[[This means that boroughs have to provide acco]]]

[[[mmodation and subsidise the rent until they are able to obtain employment]]]. DHP is currently being used to top rents up, but boroughs will have to subsidise rents even if DHP is not available. Whilst the number of families subject to the 50p housing benefit entitlement is comparatively small, the financial burden ultimately falls to the tax payer. These households are likely to be worse off on Universal Credit. At the very least, some form of transitional protection would be welcome. The freedom provided by the Localism Act to discharge homeless duty into the private sector is not an option for these families as there is no attraction to landlords in accepting those whose rent cannot be covered. Receiving authorities would have neither the inclination, nor sufficient DHP funding to top up rents for households exported from more expensive areas.  &#xa0;As capping has not finished and our analysis continues, the number of families awarded 50p Housing Benefit is likely to rise. Based on 315 capped cases, Harrow has 13 lone parents who have children in key stages of education and 8 families identified to date with only 50p Housing Benefit. With another 80 cases just come through, the authority now has 395 capped cases, some of which may be subject to the 50p HB rate. &#xa0;Brent has to fund the shortfall for 27 households subject to 50p HB and for 50 families in TA losing more than £250 in HB.&#xa0;Ealing has 11 families reduced to 50p with 10 children in the key stage exam age range.&#xa0;Hammersmith and Fulham has 17 households subject to 50p HB, with 10 more anticipated. Of these, 3 households have children in the key stage exam age range thus far. Some claimants are visibly ‘capable and employable’ but are adamant they do not want to work whilst expressing resistance to moving to cheaper areas.&#xa0;These issues also apply to families whose benefits have been capped by smaller amounts to a lesser degree and the overall impact on local authorities needs to be considered&#xa0;&#xa0;Over 4000 households are experiencing shortfalls in Housing Benefit payments due to the bedroom tax in west London which will inevitably lead to increased rent arrears. The national press is already reporting the increase in rent arrears for Registered Providers.  &#xa0;There is a lack of suitably sized accommodation for under occupiers facing a shortfall in their Housing Benefit payments to downsize into. This will adversely affect social landlords’ rental income. The only real option available to many of these households is to try and downsize through a mutual exchange. &#xa0;Whilst allocation policies give under occupiers priority, the reality is that the number of tenants affected by the Bedroom Tax exceeds the total number of lettings for all categories in need, across the whole west London sub-region last year. Although maximum priority is given to social tenants who are down-sizing, the fact that only 234 under occupiers moved last year indicates that the majority of the 4000+ households will be stuck for many years being penalised for something they cannot swiftly change. We would welcome some transitional relief for tenants who have applied to down size.&#xa0;&#xa0;Local authorities are in a difficult position in estimating the effects of direct payments, based on the roll out progress of Universal Credit. The majority are expecting losses and making bad debt provision, particularly in the light of the pilot authorities who suffered significant decreases in rental income. &#xa0;&#xa0;There are potential difficulties in ensuring payment of UC for TA cases in bed and breakfast placements for a few nights due to UC being assessed monthly, based on the claimant’s circumstances at the end of the month. If B&amp;B claimants do not make a UC claim when they enter B&amp;B they (or more likely the local authority) will not receive any payment towards the rent. Direct payments for temporary accommodation placements would be welcome. Direct payments for preventions in the PRS and PRSOs would give landlords piece of mind and assist boroughs to control the growth of TA, especially B&amp;B.&#xa0;Concern has also been raised in respect of the DWP being able to cope with bulk rent increases; a situation that will be exacerbated by landlords not being able to distinguish benefit claimants (which they can currently). &#xa0;There is a real concern that UC will affect social landlord’s income streams thus affecting the ability to invest in/ build new stock. In order to mitigate this, local authorities are developing various initiatives including: &#xa0;&#xa0;The majority of these will of course only be effective if tenants engage in processes which for some of them will be completely new and daunting.  &#xa0;&#xa0;Whilst the West London boroughs have been pro-active in responding to the changes, particularly in mitigating the impact of the reforms now and in the future, they are doing so under funding that falls far short of the requirements for this resource intensive work.&#xa0;Boroughs are taking individual approaches, but the sub region’s innovations may be grouped under the following subject areas: &#xa0;&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;
