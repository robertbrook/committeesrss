[normal]S[bold]ubmission from [bold]IPPR North (FDC20)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) is the UK’s leading progressive thinktank. 
[normal]IPPR North is IPPR’s dedicated thinktank for the North of England. With bases in Newcastle and Manchester, IPPR North’s research produces innovative policy ideas for fair, democratic and sustainable communities across the North of England. IPPR North speci
[normal]alises in regional economics, localism and community policy. Our approach is collaborative and we benefit from extensive sub-national networks, regional associates, and a strong track record of engaging with policymakers at regional, sub-regional and local
[normal] levels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IPPR North welcomes the CLG Committee’s call for evidence on this critical issue in public life. Fiscal devolution rarely garners the interest of the general public or the mainstream media and as a consequence is not considered to be a high polit
[normal]ical priority and yet we would contend that if approached with verve and rigour it could be transformational to the lives and prospects of the 16 million citizens of England’s major cities outside London and many others beyond.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To this end, IPPR has champ
[normal]ioned a wide range of measures to support devolution in the UK – and in England in particular – and has a long track record of research and publications in this field. 
[normal]Three
[normal] of the most relevant examples of this include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Five Foundations of Real Localism
[normal] (2010) – a short paper setting out five key principles which should support any programme of devolution. These are a) efficiency and effectiveness; b) democratically
[normal] accountable; c) financially autonomous; d) socially just; e) constitutionally protected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northern 
[normal]Prosperity is National Prosperity: a strategy for revitalising the UK economy
[normal] (2012) – the report of the 18-month Northern Economic Futures Commission which sets out a comprehensive economic plan for the North of England, founded upon devolving greater 
[normal]economic powers to its main city-regions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rebalancing the Books
[normal]: how to make the 2015 Spending Review work for all of 
[normal]Britain
[normal] (2014) – a very recent report setting out a range of fiscal changes that would stimulate economic growth and 
[normal]bring down
[normal] welfare spending and central grants
[normal] to regions outside London and the South East.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IPPR and IPPR North are also working together on a new programme of work under the banner 
[normal]Decentralisation Decade[bold] which aims to a) 
[normal]explore the conditions in which English devolution could take hold; 
[normal]b) 
[normal]weigh the evidence for and against key aspects of dece
[normal]ntralisation; 
[normal]c)
[normal] consider the institutional architecture necessary for better sub-national governance, setting out the respective roles for national and local bodies; and 
[normal]d)
[normal] outline a 
[normal]ten-year 
[normal]programme for change.
[normal] This will report in the summer ahead of t
[normal]he major political party conferences.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In recent decades considerable energy has been given to devolution to 
[normal]Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and to the formation of an elected mayor and assembly in London
[normal]. B
[normal]ut in the rest of England plans for a redistribution of economic powers to nine regions came unstuck with the public rejection of a North East Regional A
[normal]ssembly in 2004. More recently, city deals and the formation of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) have been heralded by many as a positive move
[normal], recognising the 
[normal]importance of functional economic areas and the role of city-regions and giving new impetus 
[normal]to public-private sector collaboration around local growth objectives
[normal]. However,
[normal] it is important to note that many of the powers and finances 
[normal]previously
[normal] vested in regional development agencies have now been repatriated to the Department for Business Innovat
[normal]ion and Skills and initiatives such as the Regional Growth Fund and other LEP programmes require local bodies to bid to central government for grant support.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the 2015 general election approaches two trends suggest that the drive for 
[normal]devolution to the 
[normal]cities 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]about to get stronger and force it up the political debate
[normal] once again
[normal]. The first concerns developments in other
[normal] parts of the UK: even i
[normal]n the event of a 
[normal]‘
[normal]No
[normal]’ 
[normal]vote in the referendum, Scotland is likely to see its parliament
[normal] 
[normal]acquire significant addi
[normal]tional powers (in particular in respect of tax powers), while the National
[normal] 
[normal]Assembly in Wales has recently seen its powers beefed-up through the Silk Commission process.
[normal] The London Mayor
[normal]alty
[normal] is also proving to be particularly effective in garnering both har
[normal]d and soft powers 
[normal]to the clear benefit of the capital city and London is now looking to enhance its autonomy with a series of fiscal powers outlined by the London Finance Commission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The second factor concerns the fiscal and economic context. Whoever wins
[normal] the 2015 election will
[normal] 
[normal]face 
[normal]continuing
[normal] pressures on public spending, which will have important implications for the role of
[normal] 
[normal]government. 
[normal]Future 
[normal]spending
[normal] 
[normal]decisions will need to be 
[normal]more 
[normal]explicitly linked to a reform programme
[normal]. In order to avoid further 
[normal]‘
[normal]austerity localism
[normal]’ 
[normal]all parties recognise that
[normal] a joined-up approach to growth and public service reform could provide the
[normal] 
[normal]basis for a more radical decentralisation agenda than has been countenanced to date.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Aside from the more political debates, there is 
[normal]growing volume of evidence to show that fiscal devolution to cities would be of significant national 
[normal]economic 
[normal]benefit.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Core Cities Group point very simply to their size, power and potential: they are home to 16 million people, almost a third of the p
[normal]opulation of England (and set to grow by at least 1 million by 2030); they generate 27% of England’s wealth (more than London); they are home to half of the country’s leading research universities; contain 28% of highly skilled workers (graduate level or a
[normal]bove); and b
[normal]y 2030 
[normal]they claim that they
[normal] could put 1.16 million more jobs and £222 billion into the economy
[normal] - the
[normal] equivalent to the entire economy of Denmark and equal to almost £14,000 for every person living in a Core City urban area – £52,500 for an aver
[normal]age family.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However i
[normal]n England seven of the eight core cities have consistently performed below the national average in terms of GDP per capita. Contrast this with Germany, for example, between 2000 and 2007 all eight of the largest cities outside Berlin 
[normal]outperformed the national average and all 14 second tier cities had product
[normal]ivity growth rates above Berlin (Parkinson 2012). This is in large part down to national economic policies which have been too centralised and privileged the role of London, all und
[normal]erpinned by 
[normal]rather crude and over-simplistic interpretations of concepts such as ‘agglomeration’ and ‘new economic geography’
[normal] which is increasingly being challenged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Commentators like Sassen, Overmans and Glaeser who 
[normal]have 
[normal]promote
[normal]d
[normal] this orthodoxy rely heav
[normal]ily on North American and East Asian data and much of their thinking is derived from evidence in the 1990s when megacities were indeed booming – this was largely as a result of being the first to adopt key infrastructures and technologies.
[normal] 
[normal]But more recent 
[normal]European data calls this into question
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] during the 2000s ‘second-wave’ mid-sized cities have largely caught and overtaken the big city hubs and proved that it is not size/scale but connectivity that drives productivity and growth (see for example McCan
[normal]n 2013, Parkinson 2012). Agglomeration effects in big hubs have tended to slow down and 
[normal]marginal returns to productivity diminished as congestion effects and other problems have kicked in and it is the mid-sized cities that are driving recovery in many par
[normal]ts of the OECD (see 
[normal]Dijkstra
[normal] 
[normal]et
[normal] 
[normal]al
[normal] 
[normal]2012
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The anomaly in the European data though is the UK where London it has continued to grow faster than its mid-sized cities. The apparent reason for this is partly the 
[normal]dominance of the 
[normal]financial services 
[normal]sector 
[normal]but also that 
[normal]such a huge proportion of
[normal] investment in connectivity, infrastructure a
[normal]nd technology in the UK has 
[normal]been pumped into mitigating congestion and fostering consumption in London largely at the expense of the UK’s mid-sized cities. Unlike other Eur
[normal]opean nations 
[normal]with their devolved governance and more distributed expenditure on infrastructure and economic affairs, central government in the UK
[normal] has
[normal] invested in London
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]not afforded its 
[normal]other 
[normal]cities the same opportunities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]E
[normal]ven d
[normal]espite the strongest
[normal] growth being 
[normal]in London
[normal], 57 per cent of net aggregate growth in the UK was generated by its lagging regions in the decade to 2008 (Garcilazo 2010).
[normal] R
[normal]egional cities were achieving impressive growth prior to the financial crisis. Indeed, employment growth in
[normal] each of England’s core cities outstripped that of London between 2000 and 2007, and there is some evidence that the growth in cities such as Edinburgh, Cardiff and Glasgow was a result of devolution (
[normal]Parkinson 2012
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Aside from economic growth, from the
[normal] perspective of public service provision, greater devolution to cities could also reap significant rewards. Space prevents a detailed analysis here but there is abundant evidence that the top-down performance measures and ‘new 
[normal]public
[normal] management’ approaches
[normal] of the 2000s led to perverse incentives, a swelling bureaucracy involved in inspection, and deep unpopularity (see Muir 2012). They stifled local innovation and caused precisely the local inequalities that centralised standards are meant to drive out. Alt
[normal]hough many of these have now been abandoned, there remains a high level of top-down service design and the ring-fencing of finances for particular purposes which prevent local service providers from shaping the services to meet local needs (see NESTA 2010)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore, centralisation is not necessarily the pre-condition for a more equal society that many would believe it to be. Lessmann’s comparative study of 56 countries between 1980 and 2009 shows that in the most developed nations like the UK, higher l
[normal]evels of devolution lead to lower levels of regional inequality (2011). Huhne’s study of OECD nations shows that those with the highest levels of local revenue-raising also had the lowest levels of inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient (Huhne 2007
[normal]). Jeffery presents evidence to suggest that devolution can boost welfare standards and even promote a ‘race to the top’ (Jeffery 2011).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In short, UK cities outside Lon
[normal]don have huge potential to grow
[normal], to transform public service provision
[normal], 
[normal]and to drive a 
[normal]fairer Britain, 
[normal]but over-centralised economic policy-making is holding them back. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the key principles which must underpin any devolutionary measures is that they much be suitably transparent, democratic and accountable. 
[normal]IPPR North has consistently argued that if economic growth is going to be properly married with public service r
[normal]eform in an efficient and effective manner there needs to be a clear basis upon which to devolve different powers to different levels or spatial scales. In order to manifest the principle of subsidiarity at an operational level, England needs a much cleare
[normal]r articulation of the geographical level at which different types of decision-making should reside across the full range of government departments and public policy interventions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As regards economic development in cities, the multiple local authorities t
[normal]hat make up city-regions will continue to provide a clear basis for local democracy and ‘place-shaping’ albeit with some important issues to be addressed in two-tier areas and with the co-ordination of services such as health, police and schools which larg
[normal]ely fall outside of their direct control. Having said that, there is a growing and very important role for local authority collaboration across wider functional economic areas, broadly aligned to local labour markets. To this end the replacement of nine re
[normal]gional structures with 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) areas should not be reversed and in city-regions moves to develop Combined Authorities should be supported. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moving forward, the relationship between the LEP and the Combined Authority will be
[normal] key to the extent to which a city should receive fiscal devolution. We believe that such relationships and the formation of city-regional arrangements 
[normal]should not
[normal] be dictated by central government but that every city wanting to receive additional fiscal po
[normal]wers must have a 
[normal]clear account of its boundaries;
[normal] 
[normal]its approach to transparency and information sharing; its approach to strategic planning and decision making; delivery arrangements on a range of different matters; and its democratic accountability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This 
[normal]will involve significant new thinking and institutional development. Simple partnership arrangements between local authorities 
[normal]would be
[normal] insufficient to 
[normal]grant
[normal] the kinds of tax-raising and spending powers necessary for proper fiscal devolution. LEPs alone do
[normal] not have the democratic legitimacy to fulfil this role, even where LEP Boards involve locally elected leaders. And even statutory combined authorities should not rely exclusively on local authority elections as a mandate for their decisions.  As in London
[normal], they need to establish a proper public mandate – bottom-up – which may involve the election of a city-regional assembly or metro mayor or both.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In April 2014, Greater Manchester 
[normal]will
[normal] be joined by four other combined authorities (Liverpool City Region, N
[normal]orth East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire).
[normal] Should these five continue to work on enhancing their democratic mandate
[normal] and relationships with business through the LEPs
[normal], IPPR North has argued that these should be the basis upon which a significant fiscal 
[normal]devolution ‘deal’ should be negotiated as part of the next 2015 spending review. Further devolution to other 
[normal]city-regions could follow, subject to them developing statutory combined authorities themselves. Devolution to other areas could then be rolled out
[normal] in waves, subject to the learning and success of initial combined authorities and a clear rationale around particular economic geographies outside city-regional functional economic areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]History tells us that without a clear implementation plan, what is
[normal] promised before the general election is unlikely to be fulfilled afterwards. To this end it is worth considering the kind of ‘routemap’ that might need to be followed if fiscal devolution is likely to come to fruition. There is much to be said for a ‘big-
[normal]bang’ approach, not least in overcoming political intransigence and public apathy. Devolution 
[normal]to the three nations came on the back of a clear manifesto commitment swiftly followed through with parliamentary legislation and law within 18 months of New Labo
[normal]ur taking office. This model could be applied again although it is likely it will take two parliaments to achieve the level of ambition necessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For example, it is highly unlikely that any political party will enter the next election with a pledge to ma
[normal]ke significant changes to council tax, let alone attempt revaluation, but as with Scotland, Wales and London, the devolution of these wider fiscal power might well come after city-regional institutions have had time to bed down and garner public support. T
[normal]his may also be true for a wider constitutional settlement: while parliamentary legislation may be required for ‘big bang city deals’ this can only pave the way for a more substantive settlement about sub-national autonomy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Questions also need to be aske
[normal]d about the ‘traditional’ use of referenda in relation to devolution. As we have seen in the past, the public are very wary of any sub-national institutional change and the social identification around England’s core cities – however strong – is quite unli
[normal]ke that of the devolved nations. To this extent it may be preferable not to hold a referendum on such measures and instead to rely on the parliamentary system as we do for the vast majority of matters. Alternatively there could be provision made for a post
[normal]-hoc referendum after say – 3 or 5 years – once a city region has had the chance to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the new system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its very recent report, 
[normal]Rebalancing the Books
[normal], IPPR North has set out detailed evidence for a series of fiscal measure to support city growth and autonomy. These can be summarised as follo
[normal]ws:
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further details of all of these can be found in our report.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The call for evidence also asks 
[normal]how public services, including employment, skills and welfare, should be organised to complement devolution. Once again, IPPR has set out a range of measures that should be decentralised in order to enhance economic growth in England’s cities and support p
[normal]ublic service transformation. These can be summarised as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On economic development:
