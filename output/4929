defaultSdefaultubmission from defaultIPPR North (FDC20)default&#xa0;
defaultThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) is the UK’s leading progressive thinktank. 
defaultIPPR North is IPPR’s dedicated thinktank for the North of England. With bases in Newcastle and Manchester, IPPR North’s research produces innovative policy ideas for fair, democratic and sustainable communities across the North of England. IPPR North speci
defaultalises in regional economics, localism and community policy. Our approach is collaborative and we benefit from extensive sub-national networks, regional associates, and a strong track record of engaging with policymakers at regional, sub-regional and local
default levels.
default&#xa0;
defaultIPPR North welcomes the CLG Committee’s call for evidence on this critical issue in public life. Fiscal devolution rarely garners the interest of the general public or the mainstream media and as a consequence is not considered to be a high polit
defaultical priority and yet we would contend that if approached with verve and rigour it could be transformational to the lives and prospects of the 16 million citizens of England’s major cities outside London and many others beyond.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo this end, IPPR has champ
defaultioned a wide range of measures to support devolution in the UK – and in England in particular – and has a long track record of research and publications in this field. 
defaultThree
default of the most relevant examples of this include:
default&#xa0;
defaultFive Foundations of Real Localism
default (2010) – a short paper setting out five key principles which should support any programme of devolution. These are a) efficiency and effectiveness; b) democratically
default accountable; c) financially autonomous; d) socially just; e) constitutionally protected.
default&#xa0;
defaultNorthern 
defaultProsperity is National Prosperity: a strategy for revitalising the UK economy
default (2012) – the report of the 18-month Northern Economic Futures Commission which sets out a comprehensive economic plan for the North of England, founded upon devolving greater 
defaulteconomic powers to its main city-regions.
default&#xa0;
defaultRebalancing the Books
default: how to make the 2015 Spending Review work for all of 
defaultBritain
default (2014) – a very recent report setting out a range of fiscal changes that would stimulate economic growth and 
defaultbring down
default welfare spending and central grants
default to regions outside London and the South East.
default&#xa0;
defaultIPPR and IPPR North are also working together on a new programme of work under the banner 
defaultDecentralisation Decadedefault which aims to a) 
defaultexplore the conditions in which English devolution could take hold; 
defaultb) 
defaultweigh the evidence for and against key aspects of dece
defaultntralisation; 
defaultc)
default consider the institutional architecture necessary for better sub-national governance, setting out the respective roles for national and local bodies; and 
defaultd)
default outline a 
defaultten-year 
defaultprogramme for change.
default This will report in the summer ahead of t
defaulthe major political party conferences.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn recent decades considerable energy has been given to devolution to 
defaultScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and to the formation of an elected mayor and assembly in London
default. B
defaultut in the rest of England plans for a redistribution of economic powers to nine regions came unstuck with the public rejection of a North East Regional A
defaultssembly in 2004. More recently, city deals and the formation of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) have been heralded by many as a positive move
default, recognising the 
defaultimportance of functional economic areas and the role of city-regions and giving new impetus 
defaultto public-private sector collaboration around local growth objectives
default. However,
default it is important to note that many of the powers and finances 
defaultpreviously
default vested in regional development agencies have now been repatriated to the Department for Business Innovat
defaultion and Skills and initiatives such as the Regional Growth Fund and other LEP programmes require local bodies to bid to central government for grant support.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the 2015 general election approaches two trends suggest that the drive for 
defaultdevolution to the 
defaultcities 
defaultis
default 
defaultabout to get stronger and force it up the political debate
default once again
default. The first concerns developments in other
default parts of the UK: even i
defaultn the event of a 
default‘
defaultNo
default’ 
defaultvote in the referendum, Scotland is likely to see its parliament
default 
defaultacquire significant addi
defaulttional powers (in particular in respect of tax powers), while the National
default 
defaultAssembly in Wales has recently seen its powers beefed-up through the Silk Commission process.
default The London Mayor
defaultalty
default is also proving to be particularly effective in garnering both har
defaultd and soft powers 
defaultto the clear benefit of the capital city and London is now looking to enhance its autonomy with a series of fiscal powers outlined by the London Finance Commission.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe second factor concerns the fiscal and economic context. Whoever wins
default the 2015 election will
default 
defaultface 
defaultcontinuing
default pressures on public spending, which will have important implications for the role of
default 
defaultgovernment. 
defaultFuture 
defaultspending
default 
defaultdecisions will need to be 
defaultmore 
defaultexplicitly linked to a reform programme
default. In order to avoid further 
default‘
defaultausterity localism
default’ 
defaultall parties recognise that
default a joined-up approach to growth and public service reform could provide the
default 
defaultbasis for a more radical decentralisation agenda than has been countenanced to date.
default&#xa0;
defaultAside from the more political debates, there is 
defaultgrowing volume of evidence to show that fiscal devolution to cities would be of significant national 
defaulteconomic 
defaultbenefit.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Core Cities Group point very simply to their size, power and potential: they are home to 16 million people, almost a third of the p
defaultopulation of England (and set to grow by at least 1 million by 2030); they generate 27% of England’s wealth (more than London); they are home to half of the country’s leading research universities; contain 28% of highly skilled workers (graduate level or a
defaultbove); and b
defaulty 2030 
defaultthey claim that they
default could put 1.16 million more jobs and £222 billion into the economy
default - the
default equivalent to the entire economy of Denmark and equal to almost £14,000 for every person living in a Core City urban area – £52,500 for an aver
defaultage family.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever i
defaultn England seven of the eight core cities have consistently performed below the national average in terms of GDP per capita. Contrast this with Germany, for example, between 2000 and 2007 all eight of the largest cities outside Berlin 
defaultoutperformed the national average and all 14 second tier cities had product
defaultivity growth rates above Berlin (Parkinson 2012). This is in large part down to national economic policies which have been too centralised and privileged the role of London, all und
defaulterpinned by 
defaultrather crude and over-simplistic interpretations of concepts such as ‘agglomeration’ and ‘new economic geography’
default which is increasingly being challenged.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentators like Sassen, Overmans and Glaeser who 
defaulthave 
defaultpromote
defaultd
default this orthodoxy rely heav
defaultily on North American and East Asian data and much of their thinking is derived from evidence in the 1990s when megacities were indeed booming – this was largely as a result of being the first to adopt key infrastructures and technologies.
default 
defaultBut more recent 
defaultEuropean data calls this into question
default,
default 
defaultfor
default during the 2000s ‘second-wave’ mid-sized cities have largely caught and overtaken the big city hubs and proved that it is not size/scale but connectivity that drives productivity and growth (see for example McCan
defaultn 2013, Parkinson 2012). Agglomeration effects in big hubs have tended to slow down and 
defaultmarginal returns to productivity diminished as congestion effects and other problems have kicked in and it is the mid-sized cities that are driving recovery in many par
defaultts of the OECD (see 
defaultDijkstra
default 
defaultet
default 
defaultal
default 
default2012
default). 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe anomaly in the European data though is the UK where London it has continued to grow faster than its mid-sized cities. The apparent reason for this is partly the 
defaultdominance of the 
defaultfinancial services 
defaultsector 
defaultbut also that 
defaultsuch a huge proportion of
default investment in connectivity, infrastructure a
defaultnd technology in the UK has 
defaultbeen pumped into mitigating congestion and fostering consumption in London largely at the expense of the UK’s mid-sized cities. Unlike other Eur
defaultopean nations 
defaultwith their devolved governance and more distributed expenditure on infrastructure and economic affairs, central government in the UK
default has
default invested in London
default 
defaultand 
defaultnot afforded its 
defaultother 
defaultcities the same opportunities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultE
defaultven d
defaultespite the strongest
default growth being 
defaultin London
default, 57 per cent of net aggregate growth in the UK was generated by its lagging regions in the decade to 2008 (Garcilazo 2010).
default R
defaultegional cities were achieving impressive growth prior to the financial crisis. Indeed, employment growth in
default each of England’s core cities outstripped that of London between 2000 and 2007, and there is some evidence that the growth in cities such as Edinburgh, Cardiff and Glasgow was a result of devolution (
defaultParkinson 2012
default). 
default&#xa0;
defaultAside from economic growth, from the
default perspective of public service provision, greater devolution to cities could also reap significant rewards. Space prevents a detailed analysis here but there is abundant evidence that the top-down performance measures and ‘new 
defaultpublic
default management’ approaches
default of the 2000s led to perverse incentives, a swelling bureaucracy involved in inspection, and deep unpopularity (see Muir 2012). They stifled local innovation and caused precisely the local inequalities that centralised standards are meant to drive out. Alt
defaulthough many of these have now been abandoned, there remains a high level of top-down service design and the ring-fencing of finances for particular purposes which prevent local service providers from shaping the services to meet local needs (see NESTA 2010)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, centralisation is not necessarily the pre-condition for a more equal society that many would believe it to be. Lessmann’s comparative study of 56 countries between 1980 and 2009 shows that in the most developed nations like the UK, higher l
defaultevels of devolution lead to lower levels of regional inequality (2011). Huhne’s study of OECD nations shows that those with the highest levels of local revenue-raising also had the lowest levels of inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient (Huhne 2007
default). Jeffery presents evidence to suggest that devolution can boost welfare standards and even promote a ‘race to the top’ (Jeffery 2011).
default&#xa0;
defaultIn short, UK cities outside Lon
defaultdon have huge potential to grow
default, to transform public service provision
default, 
defaultand to drive a 
defaultfairer Britain, 
defaultbut over-centralised economic policy-making is holding them back. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the key principles which must underpin any devolutionary measures is that they much be suitably transparent, democratic and accountable. 
defaultIPPR North has consistently argued that if economic growth is going to be properly married with public service r
defaulteform in an efficient and effective manner there needs to be a clear basis upon which to devolve different powers to different levels or spatial scales. In order to manifest the principle of subsidiarity at an operational level, England needs a much cleare
defaultr articulation of the geographical level at which different types of decision-making should reside across the full range of government departments and public policy interventions.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs regards economic development in cities, the multiple local authorities t
defaulthat make up city-regions will continue to provide a clear basis for local democracy and ‘place-shaping’ albeit with some important issues to be addressed in two-tier areas and with the co-ordination of services such as health, police and schools which larg
defaultely fall outside of their direct control. Having said that, there is a growing and very important role for local authority collaboration across wider functional economic areas, broadly aligned to local labour markets. To this end the replacement of nine re
defaultgional structures with 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) areas should not be reversed and in city-regions moves to develop Combined Authorities should be supported. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMoving forward, the relationship between the LEP and the Combined Authority will be
default key to the extent to which a city should receive fiscal devolution. We believe that such relationships and the formation of city-regional arrangements 
defaultshould not
default be dictated by central government but that every city wanting to receive additional fiscal po
defaultwers must have a 
defaultclear account of its boundaries;
default 
defaultits approach to transparency and information sharing; its approach to strategic planning and decision making; delivery arrangements on a range of different matters; and its democratic accountability.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis 
defaultwill involve significant new thinking and institutional development. Simple partnership arrangements between local authorities 
defaultwould be
default insufficient to 
defaultgrant
default the kinds of tax-raising and spending powers necessary for proper fiscal devolution. LEPs alone do
default not have the democratic legitimacy to fulfil this role, even where LEP Boards involve locally elected leaders. And even statutory combined authorities should not rely exclusively on local authority elections as a mandate for their decisions.  As in London
default, they need to establish a proper public mandate – bottom-up – which may involve the election of a city-regional assembly or metro mayor or both.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn April 2014, Greater Manchester 
defaultwill
default be joined by four other combined authorities (Liverpool City Region, N
defaultorth East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire).
default Should these five continue to work on enhancing their democratic mandate
default and relationships with business through the LEPs
default, IPPR North has argued that these should be the basis upon which a significant fiscal 
defaultdevolution ‘deal’ should be negotiated as part of the next 2015 spending review. Further devolution to other 
defaultcity-regions could follow, subject to them developing statutory combined authorities themselves. Devolution to other areas could then be rolled out
default in waves, subject to the learning and success of initial combined authorities and a clear rationale around particular economic geographies outside city-regional functional economic areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultHistory tells us that without a clear implementation plan, what is
default promised before the general election is unlikely to be fulfilled afterwards. To this end it is worth considering the kind of ‘routemap’ that might need to be followed if fiscal devolution is likely to come to fruition. There is much to be said for a ‘big-
defaultbang’ approach, not least in overcoming political intransigence and public apathy. Devolution 
defaultto the three nations came on the back of a clear manifesto commitment swiftly followed through with parliamentary legislation and law within 18 months of New Labo
defaultur taking office. This model could be applied again although it is likely it will take two parliaments to achieve the level of ambition necessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, it is highly unlikely that any political party will enter the next election with a pledge to ma
defaultke significant changes to council tax, let alone attempt revaluation, but as with Scotland, Wales and London, the devolution of these wider fiscal power might well come after city-regional institutions have had time to bed down and garner public support. T
defaulthis may also be true for a wider constitutional settlement: while parliamentary legislation may be required for ‘big bang city deals’ this can only pave the way for a more substantive settlement about sub-national autonomy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestions also need to be aske
defaultd about the ‘traditional’ use of referenda in relation to devolution. As we have seen in the past, the public are very wary of any sub-national institutional change and the social identification around England’s core cities – however strong – is quite unli
defaultke that of the devolved nations. To this extent it may be preferable not to hold a referendum on such measures and instead to rely on the parliamentary system as we do for the vast majority of matters. Alternatively there could be provision made for a post
default-hoc referendum after say – 3 or 5 years – once a city region has had the chance to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the new system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn its very recent report, 
defaultRebalancing the Books
default, IPPR North has set out detailed evidence for a series of fiscal measure to support city growth and autonomy. These can be summarised as follo
defaultws:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe call for evidence also asks 
defaulthow public services, including employment, skills and welfare, should be organised to complement devolution. Once again, IPPR has set out a range of measures that should be decentralised in order to enhance economic growth in England’s cities and support p
defaultublic service transformation. These can be summarised as follows:
