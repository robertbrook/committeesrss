[normal]I am writing to ask you to do all you can to stop 4x4 and motorbikes using our green lanes.  They make it so walkers, horse-riders etc cannot use these lanes, leaving very deep ruts.  I fully support the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group, The Green Lanes Protection Group, the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance, and my own Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.
