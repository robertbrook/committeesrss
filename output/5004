[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A. Education[bold]. We 
[normal]believe strongly in the importance of improving educational opportunities to improve the future for Palestinian residents of Jerusalem. Thus, the Foundation supports numerous ini
[normal]tiatives such as learning centres, professional development for teachers and educators, and more.
[normal] 
[normal]The Evaluation report
[normal]3
[normal] noted that it is key to expand the target population of those involved in peace-building activities to include the mainstream in order 
[normal]to broaden its support.
[normal] 
[normal]For this reason the Foundation is also involved in projects such as 
[normal]Language as a Cultural Bridge
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]Living in Jerusalem Advanced Civics Course
[normal], the 
[normal]Erna D. Leir Peace Kindergarten
[normal] and the 
[normal]Max Rayne Hand in Hand School for Bilingu
[normal]al Education
[normal]. 
[normal]P
[normal]rojects such as 
[normal]MICHA
[normal] and the 
[normal]Hattie Friedland School for the Deaf
[normal] 
[normal]provide vital services for both Jews and Arabs, and are able to bridge cultural gaps through this service provision
[normal]. 
[normal]B. Community Development in Palestinian Community[bold]. We 
[normal]recognise the importance of services for the Palestinian community in everyday life, especially given its dire socio-economic situation. The Foundation has been instrumental in establishing and supporting community centres and facilities throughout the cit
[normal]y, most significantly in 
[normal]Wadi Joz, Beit Safafa 
[normal]and the
[normal] Muslim Quarter of the Old City
[normal]. We have 
[normal]also aided 
[normal]health and welfare service providers 
[normal]in
[normal] deliver
[normal]ing
[normal] necessary care
[normal], such as in the construction and expansion of the 
[normal]Sheikh Jarrach Medical Centre, 
[normal]and
[normal] in ongoing support for the
[normal] Elderly Services Centre in the Old City.
[normal]C. [bold]Developing[bold] A[bold]gents of [bold]C[bold]hange[bold]. 
[normal]In order to systematically advance peace on the ground it is critical to develop agents of change. Two of the Jerusalem Foundation’s 
[normal]major
[normal] projects in this area are the 
[normal]Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC)
[normal] and the 
[normal]Adam Institute for Democracy and Pe
[normal]ace.
[normal]D. [bold]Rights Advocacy[bold]. 
[normal]Enabling Palestinian residents to access their legal and social rights is of utmost importance in paving the way for a 
[normal]peaceful future in the region. Two examples of important projects, initiated by the Jerusalem Foundation together with its partners, are the  
[normal]Atta’a Assistance Centre for the Rights of East Jerusalem Residents
[normal] and 
[normal]Grey Action (Council for the Rights of the
[normal] Elderly).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The appendix attached describes examples of our work, together with a large number of partners, over the past [bold]48[bold] years. [bold]We have seen that little by little, we have the ability to effect lasting change. With additional long-term support from [bold]veteran and new partners from around the world, we can do much, much more to advance peace in Jerusalem.[bold]&#xa0;
