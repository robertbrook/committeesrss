[[[Written evidence by the Natural Environment Research Council (PHE 0003)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Public Health England]]]&#xa0;The following information was submitted by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and includes information provided by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) and the NERC Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH).&#xa0;The following questions were presented to NERC’s Research Centres and partners for comment. The questions are based on each of the Key Responsibilities for Public Health England (PHE).&#xa0;

[[[Inquiry questions:]]]

[[[Question 1: ]]]How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ‘]]]making the public healthier by encouraging discussions, advising government and supporting action by local government, the NHS and other people and organisations’1. Research undertaken by NERC CEH includes the modeling of spatially and temporally resolved data to assess observed air pollutant concentrations for the assessment of personal and population exposure, supporting the identification of air pollution hotspots and episodes when air quality is impaired to a degree that it could/will have adverse effects on human health. These models and monitoring activities enable assessment of changes in air quality due to local authority or national policy implementation, providing a robust evidence base for the ex-ante and ex-post assessment of interventions (e.g. the quantitative effect of urban transport measures on local air pollution, or the long-term effect of climate change and air pollution interactions on the burden of disease from air pollution on a UK scale).  2. Further research undertaken by CEH can estimate drug use and compliance using wastewater epidemiology models to help public health messages become more timely, targeted, and demographically sensitive, while potentially leading to less mis- and un-used drugs, less wastage and ultimately a more robust and efficacious health system. CEH already supports the work of Defra, Environment Agency, SEPA and other stakeholders, including providing ad hoc model assessments of air pollution and health effects to the Defra Air Quality Expert Group (AQEG). &#xa0;3. Research undertaken by PML includes sharing the outcomes of research into the public’s perceptions of health and well-being benefits of using the coast. PhD research is investigating the types of activity (e.g. water sports through to passive pursuits such as relaxation), which people pursue at the coast and their motivations for doing so. Further investigations include assessing the impact of the motivating factors which encourage more people to use the coast for the health and well-being benefits.&#xa0;4. All research undertaken by, or on behalf of, NERC, can be disseminated to the PHE and includes access to PhD theses/summaries of findings, and access to any published articles or presentations of findings etc. On-going collaboration between PML and the University of Exeter’s Medical School’s European Centre for Environment and Human Health, involves research into the public’s perceptions of health and well-being benefits, and the risks of consuming seafood.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 2: ]]] How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ]]]‘supporting the public so they can protect and improve their own health’?5. NERC CEH can, and does, supply information to the general public: e.g. the Pollutant Deposition (http://pollutantdeposition.defra.gov.uk/) platform, and the Air Pollution Information System (APIS, http://www.apis.ac.uk/) platform. With the availability of high resolution observation and modeling systems, CEH can further support the PHE in generating information on current and forecasted air pollutant concentrations – working with partners e.g. at the Met Office, at CERC and elsewhere - to provide air quality information and advice to the general public, as well as particularly vulnerable groups (children, older adults, people suffering from respiratory diseases etc.). &#xa0;6. CEH is leading on the development of a Prepared Science Notice (PSN) within the Natural Hazards Partnership, which will contribute to this objective. In addition, CEH contributes to research modeling the quantitative impacts from natural hazards, (such as volcanic eruptions in Iceland) on UK public health and ecosystems. &#xa0;7. Most recently, work towards personal exposure assessment, (using low-cost portable air pollution monitors) has been developed at CEH, including work with SEPA on developing air pollution monitoring in a citizen science context. Through engagement with citizens, the awareness of air pollution levels and the potential for individual or collective actions to improve the situation could be substantially improved. The work of CEH includes research into the role of the environment in generating, maintaining and spreading antibiotic resistance - which can be used to inform and empower the public on how their actions impact their health, and define mechanisms for how to alleviate these health risks.&#xa0;8. Research undertaken by PML includes addressing the key issues in the debate and discussions around the safety and health benefits of seafood consumption.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 3: ]]] How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ]]]‘protecting the nation’s health through the national health protection service, and preparing for public health emergencies’9. The work by CEH described in response to Question 2, in particular regarding Natural Hazards (incl. air quality/air pollution episodes), would also contribute to preparing for public health emergencies.  &#xa0;10. CEH has also measured and modeled pharmaceutical use during public health emergencies, such as an influenza pandemic. These activities have served to identify vulnerabilities within infrastructure (e.g. wastewater treatment plants), the environment, antiviral resistance development and drinking water treatment. CEH has served on the UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee to help inform the Government of emerging environmental issues relevant to an influenza pandemic.&#xa0;11. PML and the University of Exeter’s Medical School’s European Centre for Environment and Human Health; will be holding a workshop concerning seafood risks and benefits to which stakeholders in the public health sector are being invited. They will produce a workshop report aimed specifically at these stakeholders.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 4: ]]] How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ]]]‘sharing…information and expertise with local authorities, industry and the NHS, to help them make improvements in the public’s health’?12. NERC CEH is closely cooperating with local authorities and regulatory agencies (e.g. Environment Agency, SEPA, SNH, Natural England and others) in providing tools and expertise to assess the impacts of agricultural and other installations on ecosystem effects. Currently work is being undertaken to expand this to include direct effects on human health. By supporting the regulatory impact assessment process, agencies have quantified substantial savings in staff time and other expenditures, which would be further explored by embedding existing information on air pollution and health effects in these expert systems, e.g. APIS (http://www.apis.ac.uk/). Output from air pollution dispersion models could forecast episodes of high air pollutant concentrations - enabling the NHS, local hospitals and GPs to prepare for elevated incidences of respiratory-related hospitalization, or GP visits to improve preparedness levels with sufficient warning time. &#xa0;13. In addition, data from models and observations run by CEH can document the effect of changes due to public health driven interventions, and identify locations for, and timings of, policy actions for more efficient and effective interventions. With active collaborations with PHE and the NHS, CEH can help to better inform on the use and compliance of pharmaceuticals. Through the use of wastewater epidemiology, CEH can also examine the relationship between pathogens in wastewater and the prevalence of infections in a wastewater catchment - thereby providing an unbiased screening tool for community surveillance.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 5: ]]] How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ]]]‘researching, collecting and analysing data to improve…understanding of health and come up with answers to public health problems’?14. NERC CEH collects and maintains large environmental datasets from local to UK scale and beyond (http://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/), which, even though not collected primarily with a public health background, are of vital relevance for the improvement of understanding how health and the environment are connected. These data-sets can be a powerful resource when they are combined with health effects analysis or epidemiological data to identify the links between environmental exposure and potential pathologies (e.g. Ellis et al. 2012). CEH scientists have led recent work to better integrate the conceptual approaches to address human and environmental health impact assessment and are contributing to the operationalisation of ecological public health - connecting public health impacts and ecosystem services concepts, and bridging existing discipline gaps (see Reis et al., 2013). CEH has examined the potential for human exposure to pharmaceuticals and in particular anti-cancer drugs through tap water. This potential exists in areas of the country where rivers are used both to receive treated sewage effluent and as a source of drinking water. Starting with assessing human consumption and excretion, geographic based water quality modelling can tell us what exposures in raw drinking water might occur from this route for humans.&#xa0;15. With the emerging challenges posed by ‘big data’ and exposomics, utilising these data resources with a public health focused approach would have a high potential to yield added value. As many drivers of public health are either environmental, or driven by environmental media, environmental dataset can be seen as key for improving our understanding as well as developing robust and viable solutions.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 6: ]]] How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ]]]‘reporting on improvements in the public’s health so everyone can understand the challenge and the next steps’?16. It is a goal of NERC to manage our environment responsibly as we pursue new ways of living, doing business, escaping poverty and growing economies. To do this NERC uses, open data policies, requires impact plans of its research and encourages public and stakeholder engagement. As a result, NERC science is being used nationally, and globally by legislators to establish safe limits for emissions, and set quality standards for our air water and soil.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Question 7:]]]  How can/will your centre help the PHE in:

[[[ ]]]‘helping local authorities and the NHS to develop the public health system and its specialist workforce’?17. NERC has a strong training agenda, for example supporting over 1000 PhD students. This provides a highly educated and trained research base that can move out of the direct science base into wider roles such as for PHE.
