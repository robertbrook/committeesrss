[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Academy of Social Sciences (RaD014)[bold]1.1  [bold]The
[normal] Academy of Social Sciences welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s Inquiry into R&amp;D funding and request for suggestions for future topics of inquiry in this area. The Academy represents a membership composed of over 900 individual peer-elec
[normal]ted social scientists, and 46 Learned Societies in social science disciplines.  
[normal]1.2  [bold]With reference to the National Audit Office’s (2013)
[normal] Review of Research and Development funding of science and technology in the UK
[normal] (henceforth NAO (2013)), the Academy e
[normal]ndorses the view of R&amp;D as a crucial metric of innovation.  Without a strong research base covering all academic disciplines (social sciences and humanities as well as the STEM subjects) innovative products cannot be generated and brought to market.  Techn
[normal]ological inventions are successful when they are considered useful, appealing and affordable – these qualities require expertise in human-computer interaction, economics and marketing – all social science inputs. And innovative solutions to social issues a
[normal]nd challenges may not be found, or successfully applied in society, without social science research.  
[normal]1.3  [bold]In NAO (2013) the overall rise in annual R&amp;D spending (37%) recorded between 1995 and 2011 has different implications for different academic discipl
[normal]ines.  According to the report most of this increase came from growth in UK businesses’ spend on R&amp;D - although this spend has been affected in recent years by the economic crisis (NAO, 2013:6).  Government support for UK business R&amp;D has increased, making
[normal] up part of the reduction in funding from non-government sources.  The commercial R&amp;D spend in the UK is dominated by the pharmaceutical industries and hence chiefly uses STEM R&amp;D. 
[normal]1.4 [bold]The Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are a particularly important 
[normal]in the R&amp;D landscape of the UK, contributing 27% of R&amp;D untaken, compared to an OECD average of 19%.  However, the UK has not been increasing investment in this sector at the same rate as competitor countries, which may have implications for future perform
[normal]ance.  Subject Overview Reports undertaken for the 2008 RAE consistently found excellence in social science disciplines across UK HEIs, and benchmarking undertaken by the ESRC and learned societies since 2005, demonstrates that the UK is world-leading in m
[normal]any social science subjects. 
[normal]The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills document 
[normal]International Comparative Performance of the UK Research Base
[normal] – 2011
[normal] confirms that the UK’s strength in the social sciences is second only to that of the USA
[normal],
[normal] and that this strength is growing over time.
[normal]  Social sciences are therefore a vital part of the knowledge economy in UK HEIs. 
[normal]1.5 [bold]NAO (2013) notes the significant level of European funding for research received by the UK, an area where social science res
[normal]earch has been a key beneficiary.  The report acknowledges that it is hard to determine to what extent the research funded under the 7
[normal]th
[normal] Framework meets the ONS definition of R&amp;D used in the publication.  This definition, which comes from the OECD, may exc
[normal]lude some social science research activity related to policy, and hence underplay the importance of funding in these areas and outcomes derived from such research. 
[normal]1.6 [bold]European funding has been an important component in the strength of UK social science R
[normal]&amp;D in recent decades.  The Academy of Social Sciences recently put out a call to Academicians to cite examples of the role of EU funding in their work, and received a strong and positive response.  UK social scientists are involved in EU-funded projects br
[normal]inging in millions of euros and maintaining engagement in EU-wide intellectual and enterprise networks.  ERC figures on the number of grantholders by country of host institution per call year for the last 5-6 years show the UK as having 
[normal]around twice the nu
[normal]mber of grantholders as the country ranked second on number of grantees.  UK social sciences have also benefited greatly from funding under FP7 and its predecessors.  Cross-national research across European partnerships has contributed to greater internati
[normal]onalisation of European social sciences and more effective dissemination of ideas and approaches to problems. Our level of international collaboration is a distinctive advantage for the UK in comparison with the USA and other English-speaking countries.
[normal]1.[bold]7 [bold]European funding has also enabled interdisciplinary projects to gain support which may have fallen between natural science and social science funding sources in the UK.  Examples include the Surveille advisory project which involves UK researchers in giv
[normal]ing advice to technology developers, manufacturers  and end users who want to discuss the ethics and fundamental rights implications of their work; research in language-learning and linguistics and studies bringing together social and environmental aspects
[normal] of sustainable development.  As EU funding concentrates on issues that are high priority across the Europe and addressed by Community policies, the links between research and policy are often strong.  
[normal]1.8 [bold]Interdisciplinary research has been strengthened 
[normal]by the implementation of cross-cutting themes in Research Council funding in recent years.  The ESRC is the only Research Council funded under all of the themes, underlining the utility and versatility of social science approaches. However, there remains m
[normal]ore to be done in terms of linking natural and social sciences activities. Social science contributions could further aid the effectiveness of public engagement with natural science and medical research in fields such as ageing and well-being.  
[normal]1.9 [bold]NAO (20
[normal]13) 
[normal]refers to the ‘Thomson Reuters 2012 list of Top 100 Global Innovators’ which lists the most innovative companies worldwide.  The metrics used look at patents obtained; as well as ‘
[normal]favouring fast-paced high-tech industries with short product life lifecy
[normal]cles rather than the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that dominate R&amp;D in the UK’
[normal] (NAO, 2013:9), such assessment is unlikely to capture innovation in creative industries or in management, services and the financial sector – all areas relevant to
[normal] social science and humanities R&amp;D, and where the UK is strong internationally.
[normal]The Academy’s view of the 2013 Spending Review[bold]2.1 [bold]The Academy of Social Sciences welcomed the Chancellor’s continued ring-fencing of the science budget, which includes social
[normal] science.  As estimates suggest that there has been a real terms cut of money available to science and research of around 14% during the current Public Expenditure period to 2015, 
[normal] challenges remain
[normal] in terms of 
[normal]maintaining
[normal] excellence and international stan
[normal]ding. The Academy also welcomed the increase in capital spending the Chancellor set out – without adequate capital investment there is a risk of introducing damaging ‘stop-start’ inefficiencies into the system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 [bold]Capital
[normal] [bold]investment in the science 
[normal]infrastructure – the kit underpinning discovery in the natural sciences – has been identified as key to economic growth.  We would contend that the social science infrastructure of large-scale data sources is also essential to innovation.  The British coho
[normal]rt studies provide excellent evidence which feeds into government policies.  Such resources are all the more important in times of rapid health and welfare reform in a climate of austerity.  The Government also has its own resources of large-scale national
[normal] surveys – the future of several of which is currently under review.  We hope that the underpinning support of social science datasets will not be forgotten in the allocation of capital investment for growth.
[normal]2.[bold]4[bold] [bold]The Academy expressed concern about the inc
[normal]reased burden upon students created by not increasing grants by the rate of inflation. 
[normal]Universities are having increasing difficulty recruiting the best domestic 
[normal]postgraduate 
[normal]students because of the pressures of student debt.  It is vital that our own 
[normal]stud
[normal]ents have the opportunity to study in our world-class Universities – otherwise we risk our excellence being exported, without sustaining domestic research power.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 [bold]The Academy has stated its case to the Government vigorously, pointing out that an impor
[normal]tant part of introducing scientific innovation is knowing how this will affect the economy and society. 
[normal]Social sciences are a vital part of the research-innovation-impact cycle, bringing scientific discovery into widespread use. Without understanding of so
[normal]cial, economic, political and cultural processes underlying innovation - both in its development and adoption phases - future economic growth will be jeopardised.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Suggestions [bold]for [bold]future inquiries on UK R&amp;D funding[bold]3.1 [bold]The Academy suggests that the Committee examine the role of social science R&amp;D in innovation. In assessing the impact and value of R&amp;D and in improving the interface between HEIs and business, there has been an emphasis on commercialisation of research thr
[normal]ough patents and spin-outs.  These vital activities are predominantly based in STEM disciplines, but they are not the only form of knowledge transfer or innovative work going on in HEIs.  
[normal]3.2 [bold]The UK IRC (2009) survey of 
[normal]Knowledge Exchange between Academic
[normal]s and the Business, Public and Third Sectors
[normal] makes the case for a wider perspective on the role of universities in innovation, saying that:
[normal]‘knowledge exchange mechanisms are wide and varied – it is not simply about the codified transfer of science (patent
[normal]s, licences, etc.) but includes many people-based, problem-solving and community-driven activities’ 
[normal](page 7)
[normal]These latter activities are very much the province of social sciences and ensure not only that technological innovations get to market and are take
[normal]n up in society, but also work in their own right to build relationships and activities which contribute to economic growth.
[normal]3.3 [bold]Whilst natural sciences may produce the ‘direct hits’ of new drugs, new agricultural methods or new aids to independent living, it is social sciences which analyse and explain how (and if) such innovations are successfully used and diffused through societi
[normal]es; the cultural and other barriers to their acceptability; unintended consequences of their application.  Without a thriving social science research community (and investment in foresight and horizon scanning) both innovation and policymaking are at risk 
[normal]of problems resulting from the neglect of the human and social elements in establishing what works, both in terms of innovation and democratic communications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 [bold]Such insights touch on social science research into the links between universities and local
[normal] economic growth.  Academician Prof. John Goddard, a leading authority in this field, has described how universities active in developing effective partnerships in their localities, have moved beyond purely ‘entrepreneurial’ models of innovation to become 
[normal]‘civic’ institutions with a wider model of engagement in local economies and societies.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.5 [bold]These broader models of successful knowledge transfer have implications for how impact of research is measured, and indicate scope for how R&amp;D funding may meet the
[normal] challenge of regional growth in the future.
[normal]3.6 [bold]An ongoing issue is to establish if, how, why research evidence has been used effectively in innovation policy, and this could be another area of future inquiry.  This will be especially relevant as the new 
[normal]‘What Works?’ initiatives get established and the extent to which they feed into Departmental policies becomes observable.  
[normal]3.7 [bold]There has been increasing attention on evaluation of interventions and social policy impacts themselves, both within academic a
[normal]nd practitioner communities and in Government departments.  Evaluation methods, including the wider use of RCTs, could be another area of inquiry.  Research into innovation in service delivery by public bodies, and issues in learning across sectors and cou
[normal]ntries, would also be worthy of investigation
