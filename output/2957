[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK National Ecosystem Assessment provides a comprehensive 
[normal]account of how the natural environment and its biodiversity provide us with services that are critical to our wellbeing and economic prosperity
[normal]. 
[normal]Despite this, biodiversity 
[normal]is being continually eroded and fragmented by inappropriate development
[normal]. T
[normal]he 
[normal]planning system does not adequately guard against biodiversity loss; the mitigation hierarchy is inconsistently applied
[normal],
[normal] and where compensation does take place it is often inadequate and short-lived. 
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the same time, there is an acute s
[normal]ocial need for mor
[normal]e housing, alongside
[normal] better infrastructure for business
[normal]. Despite this,
[normal] the planning system is
[normal] often
[normal] slow and cumbersome. It is, therefore, only right that Government explores ways in which to make the planning system more fit for purpose, so that it can de
[normal]liver truly sustainable development. 
[normal]The
[normal]re is undoubtedly potential
[normal] for 
[normal]a new
[normal] system 
[normal]that could take
[normal] a
[normal] systematic account of the value 
[normal]of
[normal] nature, 
[normal]save money for business, and
[normal] increase speed in
[normal] a simpler
[normal] planning system
[normal]. 
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, the Government’s preferred
[normal] options raise a series of 
[normal]significant concerns that
[normal] will need to be addressed before a
[normal]ny new
[normal] system is established.  
[normal]In particular, o
[normal]ffsetting must only be established as part of a coherent strengthening of the mitigation hierarchy; it must be supported b
[normal]y real, independent ecological expertise at a local level; it must be applied uniformly across developments; and it must be underpinned by a long-term financial and legal framework for monitoring, reporting and implementation. If this can be achieved, biod
[normal]iv
[normal]ersity offsetting can deliver
[normal] potential benefits for econo
[normal]my, society and environment. Conversely,
[normal] if 
[normal]t
[normal]hese issues cannot be addressed, biodiversity offsetting 
[normal]risks serious damage to our natural environment.
[normal]The m[bold]itigation hierarchy [bold]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recreating complex 
[normal]natural processes is inherently difficult and full of risk. Essentially, you are guaranteeing ecological loss in return for uncertain gains.
[normal] Even if the offset is successful, in many cases there will be a temporal loss of biodiversity that can never be ret
[normal]rieved.
[normal] As such, in-situ conservation is always preferable. 
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]That offsetting biodiversity loss is incredibly difficult is evidenced 
[normal]by the fact that there are no systems in the world that have been able to demonstrate no net loss of biodiversity, and t
[normal]he w
[normal]ealth of studies showing (often considerable) net-
[normal] losses
[normal]. 
[normal]Indeed, we would seriously 
[normal]question the repeated statements in the Impact Assessment
[normal],
[normal] that offsetting wil
[normal]l ‘improve biodiversity’, given the 
[normal]absence of any evidence to support this statement.  
[normal] 
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is because of the uncertainty and risk associated with offsetting that the mitigation hierarchy must be adhered to
[normal], as required by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)
[normal]. O
[normal]ffse
[normal]tting should
[normal] only ever
[normal] be
[normal] undertaken when a development is absolutely 
[normal]necessary, and all attempts to avoid harm or mitigate it have been exhausted. 
[normal]We welcome the statements in the Green Paper that the mitigation hierarchy is adhered to, but this assertion is undermined and contradicted by the explicit desire for offsetting 
[normal]to free up more land on site for development (because mitigation will no longer be necessary). This is a blatant
[normal] disregard of
[normal] the mitigation hierarchy
[normal],
[normal] to which we strongly object.
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We would consider 
[normal]the failure of LPAs to avoid and mitigate harm from devel
[normal]opment to be a far more serious problem for biodiversity than the poor implementation of any necessary compensation. This is largely due to a culture of not va
[normal]luing biodiversity and not giving
[normal] due weight to policies concerned with biodiversity – a point su
[normal]pported by Defra commissioned research into the implementation of PPS9
[normal]. 
[normal]Government must
[normal] ensure that LPAs and the Planning Inspectorate give appropriate weight to biodiversity policies, just as they do to, for example, housing policies. 
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LPAs need better g
[normal]uidance on how to avoid and mitigate harm, and it is crucial that a single guidance document is published on every aspect of the mitigation hierarchy. This must contain very clear guidance on how to assess harm, avoid harm, mitigate harm, and finally – off
[normal]se
[normal]t 
[normal]harm
[normal]. 
[normal]E[bold]cological expertise[bold] within planning authorities [bold] [bold]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The metric applied to offsetting is merely a simple articulation of what will often be a complex decision. 
[normal]It takes significant ecological expertise to be able to assess the ‘value’ of a site an
[normal]d to understand how, or if, its loss can be compensated.
[normal] Such an exercise will necessarily requi
[normal]re a degree of judgement, and while it is the responsibility of the developer to provide the initial assessment, 
[normal]the LPA cannot fulfil its role as a competent d
[normal]ecision-maker if it is unable to verify the information. 
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The world of land use planning is highly contested by a myriad of different interests, and the integrity of the planning system depends on independent arbitration. Moreover, the public’s faith in th
[normal]e 
[normal]system
[normal] depends on independent arbitration. The decision to approve an 
[normal]application may hinge on matters relating to biodiversity and it would be unacceptable for a LPA to have to sim
[normal]ply accept the developer’s recommendation on offsetting – even if the rep
[normal]ort is written by an ‘accredited’ expert. 
[normal]Accredited or otherwise, a consultant is ultimately being paid
[normal] by a developer
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]who will have
[normal] a clear vested interest in obtaining planning permission.
[normal] 
[normal]We would strongly recommend a system of accreditation but this cannot be a substitute for LPA ecological expertise. Many planning consultants are ‘accredited’ by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), but no-one would seriously suggest 
[normal]that this negates
[normal] the need for local authority planning officers. It is equally unacceptable for LPAs not to have any ecological expertise, simply because consultants are accredited. 
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the potential benefits of an
[normal] offsetting system would be
[normal] the strategic choice of of
[normal]fs
[normal]et type and location, involving
[normal] the replacement of lower value habitat with higher value habitats
[normal] (higher value habitats should generally be replaced like for like)
[normal]. While certain habitats are of national importance (and this needs to be reflected in any
[normal] metric
[normal]s), ‘value’ will vary according to local
[normal] ecological
[normal] context. 
[normal]Ecological expertise
[normal] is therefore needed 
[normal]to ensure that local metric
[normal]s reflect local value, and strategic plans maximise opportunities for enhancing the local ecological network with offset
[normal]s. 
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the critical importance of local authority ecological expertise in both reducing risk and maximising potential benefits associated with offsets, it is highly alarming that less t
[normal]h
[normal]an 30% 
[normal]of local authorities have any ecological expertise. 
[normal]All loca
[normal]l authorities must have ready access to independent ecological expertise before a biodiversity offsetting system can be reliably implemented.
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]The importance of a[bold] mandatory [bold]system[bold]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Largely because it is 
[normal]required as part of an environmental impact assessme
[normal]nt (EIA), there will generally be an explicit process of assessing the potential impacts of a major planning application on bi
[normal]odiversity. However, for applications
[normal] that
[normal] are 
[normal]either 
[normal]outside of protected areas
[normal] or
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]fail to meet the required threshold for a
[normal]n EIA, 
[normal]biodiversity is infrequently considered and assessments of potential harm are often poor
[normal]. 
[normal]This is a major factor in
[normal] the alarming losses of wildlife 
[normal]outside of protected areas. Losses of biodiversity and the fragmentation of habitats outside of 
[normal]protected areas
[normal],
[normal] also have a significant negative impact on our protected area network
[normal]. 
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We share the Government’s desire for a faster and simpler planning system that brings forward the sustainable development that society needs. A faster system depends 
[normal]on increased simplicity, and the system will only become simpler for all users
[normal],
[normal] if all users are using the same system. It is very difficult to reconcile the Government’s contradictory desire for a 
[normal]simple system, and 
[normal]for developers to be able to opt out an
[normal]d use a different system. A new method will only make the planning system simpler if everyone in the planning
[normal] system uses it.
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nor will a scheme deliver effective protection for biodiversity if a threshold is applied below which developers will not be requi
[normal]red to participate. 
[normal]A
[normal] standard and explicit system for assessing potential harm to biodiversity would
[normal] 
[normal] only bring margin
[normal]al conservation benefits if solely
[normal] applied to major developments; whereas there would be significant benefits if
[normal] it was
[normal] applied to all n
[normal]ew housing development, new commercial buildings and to large commercial extensions. 
[normal]We recognise that direct participation in an offsetting scheme may be prohibitively expensive for some of the smallest developers—in such cases, it may be possible to impl
[normal]ement a form of the Community Infrastructure Levy, where businesses 
[normal]would pay a levy to the local planning authority which would then strategically offset any unavoidable damage associated with the development.
[normal]Metrics[bold]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There must be a consistent framework 
[normal]for local authorities to produce their own metrics within an offsetting supplementary planning document. This is because the value of a habitat may vary depending on context. For example, woodland may be
[normal] extremely
[normal] rare in an urban authority and this would 
[normal]need to be reflected in 
[normal]the ‘score’
[normal] used
[normal] to express its value.
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There must also be national guidelines that set minimum scores for
[normal] nationally important
[normal] priority habitats and species
[normal], so that, for example, a local authority in Dorset could not set a low sco
[normal]re for 
[normal]nationally rare 
[normal]he
[normal]athland
[normal],
[normal] on the basis that it is
[normal] not considered rare in that district. 
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]pecies should 
[normal]also 
[normal]be included in
[normal] any future
[normal] metric
[normal]s, and this needs to be accompanied by much better data on general populations, so that the value of a loca
[normal]l population can be determined. Storing all data collected as part of a new standardised system, both for existing/ lost sites and for offsetting sites, could be hugely beneficial in this regard. This data should be stored nationally by Natural England, vi
[normal]a LPAs. 
[normal]Protection[bold] and management of offset sites [bold]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For offsetting to stand any chance of
[normal] avoiding net losses,
[normal] 
[normal]sites must be protected and managed 
[normal]over ecologically relevant timeframes. 
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Natural processes require
[normal] very l
[normal]arge areas of natural land that are 
[normal]seldom found in England
[normal]. Unfortunately, this renders most habitats in need of continual management and this would be the case for most offset sites, thus making ongoing management an additional cost
[normal] 
[normal]on top of the upfront costs 
[normal]associated with creating the 
[normal]habitat
[normal]. 
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Management costs must be secured 
[normal]i
[normal]f the offset site is to stand any chance of avoiding a net-loss of biodiversity.
[normal] A recent example from Scotland
[normal], involving a European protected site and Scottish Coal, highlights the dangers: Scottish Coal were g
[normal]ranted permission to mine,
[normal] on the condition that 
[normal]they restore the site after use, only for Scottish coal to then declare
[normal] bankrupt
[normal]cy.
[normal] 
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to overcome the danger of either the developer or the offset provider ceasing to operate (there is a danger this 
[normal]could be premeditated) it is critically important that monies are collected prior to the commencement of development and this money is paid into a trust fund. 
[normal]We recommend
[normal] that this trust fund is operated by one of 
[normal]Defra’s
[normal] agencies – preferably Natural 
[normal]Eng
[normal]land. This would enable additional oversight and the ability to withhold funds if the offset provider was not meeting the conditions of their agreement. 
[normal]Clear responsibility and the ability to enforce[bold]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Without clear legal and financial arrangements in place at the outset, there is no guarantee that an offsetting provision would be reliable. 
[normal]There must be a robust legal agreement that sets out clear responsibility for the implementation and management of 
[normal]an offset. 
[normal]Critically, this has to enable enforcement to be taken against a specified party at any time
[normal],
[normal] for the duration of the agreement. 
[normal]In particular, i
[normal]t must also be possible to take punitive action against a third-party that 
[normal]fails to fulfil its obligations. 
[normal]As such, it is
[normal] inconceivable that a third-party would not be bound by a legal agreement at the planning stage, as the delivery of the offset is integral to the decision to grant planning permission. It is, therefore, alarmi
[normal]ng that the Green Paper suggests
[normal] that provision of an offset by a third-party could avoid the need for detailed requirements
[normal] regarding compensatory measures in s106 or similar agreements. You cannot grant planning permission, subject to a legal agreement,
[normal] if the legal agreement does not secure all
[normal] of
[normal] the measures necessary to make the development acceptable. 
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If the granting of planning permission is dependent on satisfactory offsetting,
[normal] there must
[normal] also
[normal] be a clear legal responsibility on the competent auth
[normal]ority to enforce the offset for the duration of the agreement, with this being the LPA in most cases. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]it may be advantageous from a conservation perspective for the offsetting to
[normal] take
[normal] place outside of the local authority where the development take
[normal]s place
[normal] and permission is
[normal] granted
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Clarification would be
[normal] needed 
[normal]as to how enforcement action could
[normal] be taken 
[normal]in such circumstances, if, for example, a management agreement was not being adhered to. 
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, if 
[normal]commuted sums are 
[normal]taken
[normal] by LPAs
[normal] for small
[normal]er developments (to enable cumulative funding for strategic offsetting)
[normal] in lieu of any offset 
[normal]prov
[normal]ision, the monies must be 
[normal]ring-fenced
[normal] and used for conservation
[normal], and there must be a robust legal agreement in place with the subsequent offset provider
[normal] -
[normal] tha
[normal]t 
[normal]can
[normal] be enforced through a civil mechanism. 
[normal]Ensuring [bold]additionality[bold] [bold]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Any offsetting provision must be additional to any existing statutory or policy obligations. For example, this means that it would not be acceptable for aftercare from a minerals site (t
[normal]hat was a conditi
[normal]on of the permission) to be used to offset harm fr
[normal]om another development, as the aftercare
[normal] was necessary to offset the harm from the mineral extraction. However, the aftercare agreement would typically be time limited, and 
[normal]in some circumst
[normal]ances 
[normal]we would be comfortable for the site to be sold as an offset once the planning obligation had expired, 
[normal]if
[normal] this would secure additional funding 
[normal]necessary 
[normal]to manage the site. 
[normal]Likewise, it would be unacceptable for Government to 
[normal]generate funds needed to 
[normal]fulfil its existing obligations for managing protected sites
[normal] through offsetting
[normal]. Neither would it be acceptable to use 
[normal]agri
[normal]-environment funded work to offset harm elsewhere, during the timeframe of the agreement. The integrity of t
[normal]he system depends on 
[normal]additionality
[normal] and without 
[normal]additionality
[normal] we will end up with severe net-losses of biodiversity. 
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is also important to avoid offset provision being ‘double-sold’. This will require a central register, preferabl
[normal]y
[normal] maintained by Natural 
[normal]England,
[normal] 
[normal]that holds details of all offset provision. 
[normal]Monitoring[bold]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the main benefits of introducing a standard system is that it enables effective monitoring
[normal] and analysis
[normal] of net changes. This means that Natural England should be requi
[normal]red to collect th
[normal]e data
[normal] of the
[normal] initial assessment of the s
[normal]ite, in order to understand what has been lost
[normal]. There must also be a legal agreement as part of the planning consent that requires the submission of monitoring reports of the offset to the LPA
[normal]. These should also be 
[normal]standardised so that the assessments of the site follows the same criteria as those used when deciding whether or not to offset. This data should in turn be submitted to Natural England. Understanding changes in the extent of different habitats will also b
[normal]e necessary to inform the revisi
[normal]on of criteria for valuing habitats, as value may change according to changes in extent
[normal].
[normal]Offset type and location[bold] [bold]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]High value habitats must be protected accordingly. T
[normal]his means that permission 
[normal]should only be granted on sites
[normal] that have a high ‘score’ in exceptional circumstances. The bar for what constitutes necessary development should rise commensurate with the score - and the likelihood of granting permission should decrease. 
[normal]Furthermore, i
[normal]f a high value habitat is lost, we
[normal] would expect that habitat to be replaced like-for-like, wherever possible. 
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]or sites with lower scores 
[normal](
[normal]especially smaller sites
[normal]), offsetting with a higher value habitat in a strategic location could lead to significant ecological gains. 
[normal]In order to maxi
[normal]mise this potential, neighbouring LPAs should work with each other and with their Local Nature Partnerships
[normal], to identify strategic locations where cumulative offsetting could do most to improve ecological connectivity and deliver landscape-scale conservat
[normal]ion. This strategy should then be embedded in the LPAs SPD for offsetting.
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]However, while strategically locating offsets has the potential to deliver ecological gains, distancing communities 
[normal]from biodiversity can also incur
[normal] a social cost.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]For instance, t
[normal]aking a small wildlife reserve from an ecologically deprived location could have a significantly negative impact on that community’s quality of life.  LPAs will need to carefully balance the needs of people and wildlife, and these trade-offs should be expl
[normal]icitly addressed when 
[normal]planning for the strategic implementation of offsets.
