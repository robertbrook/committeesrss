"&#xa0;\nRMP 01&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by John Thwaites&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Royal Mail privatisation and sale of shares&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe share issue and impact on USO&#xa0;The role of Royal Mail in Rural areas is unique to the UK, and is a cherished, vital and historic service that has provided communications to isolated communities for over 500 years.&#xa0; The Royal Mail cost of oper\nations for the Universal\nService was £5.65bn in 2005-6. People costs represented\n68.6% of this figure\n. (\nSource\n Royal Mail Group Regulatory Financial\nStatements 2005-6)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne\n of the founding principles in the introduction of all staff\n when first joining Royal Mail\n is that the company \nremains a social ne\ntwork for isolated communities. B\ny the inevitable introduction of economic value placed on these communities they would become even more isolated and due to the fact nationwide broadband is falling behind schedule we will see the elderly\n in particular cut off from family and friends.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n This has been highlighted in reports from Charities representing the elderly in the UK. Many of the postal staff that \nis\n on rural deliveries have been on that delivery for a number of years, and become frie\nnds of their customers\n?\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf there is no impact on the USO by the privatisation, how is it possible for the competitors (TNT) to deliver within central London only every other day per household?  With their staff employed on zero \nhour contracts and minimum\n wage?\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf the \nRoyal Mail\n \nwere\n privatised would the VAT exception on items such as PPI \nbe removed?\n&#xa0;\n7.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs Postcomm \nand now Ofcom are\n unable to make a decision whether or not the Business Collection, be part of the USO, \nwould privatisation impact greater on \nrural business\n?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEnd to end competition in the postal sector Ofcom (as referred to by the Secretary of State).&#xa0;The Ofcom’s statutory duty reproduced below has limited protection for the USO.Ofcom’s statutory duty, under section 29 of the Act, is to secure the provision of a universal service (see section 29(2)). In carrying out this duty, Ofcom must have regard to:  The need for the provision of a universal service to be financially sustainable. This expressly includes the need for the universal service provider to make a reasonable commercial rate of return on expenditure incurred for the purpose of, or in connection with, the provision of the universal service (see s29 (4)); and The need for the provision of a universal service to be efficient before the end of a reasonable period and for its provision to continue to be efficient at all subsequent times. 3.5 Any regulatory conditions imposed by Ofcom must take account of these duties. Therefore if the need for financially sustainable would the impact be greater on rural areas, where even Royal Mail have admitted are loss making and subsidized by urban areas so the withdrawal of services on a daily basis is not in fact guaranteed.The condition does not give Ofcom the power to accept or reject an operator’s proposals. It is not akin to an authorisation process but simply a system of advanced notification. Ofcom has the power5 to impose general universal service conditions (“GUSCs”) on operators providing a service within the scope of the universal service. Services within the scope of the universal service are defined in section 40 of the Act. General universal service conditions are generally applicable and are not specifically attached to an individual operator. 7.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the USO is already at a minimum, and allows Royal Mail competitors to give a minimum service, w\nith the \nlimits\n place on Ofcom would not the ideal method for the future Royal Mail be to follow TNT’s method and limiting the del\nivery to every other day over a \n6-day\n period.\n \n7.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIs \nthe protection of \nthe USO,\n stated by the Secretary of Stat\ne,\n limited and open to abuse?\n7.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith the removal of licensees and the sale of Royal Mail I feel the privatisation will impact on an increasing unmanag\neable postal market with a increased drive to the bottom, in both profits and services, as refle\ncted in the Dutch postal system?\n7.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI believe the Secretary of State has misunderstood the relationship between customers, delivery staff and the history behind ce\nnturies of the service given by generations of postal employees.\n&#xa0;\nShare issue and impact on staff&#xa0;\nI also have concerns that if the staff accepts the offered shares would they issued under the Growth and infrastructure Act 2013 Para 31, Employee shareholder where there is removal of basic rights such as redundancy payments, the right to claim unfair dismissal and impact on maternity rules.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCommercial relationship between Royal Mail and Post Office Limited &#xa0;16\n.\n              \nU\nnder the agreement are POL allowed to ta\nke Royal Mail competitors mail \nacross their counters.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n              \nIs the crown office closure plans against the principles as laid out in the Hooper report?\n Is the threat of crown office closure just another way of privatizing the POL network by individually selling off crown office to sub postmasters or companies su\nch as W H Smiths?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive summary:&#xa0;The Secretary of State statement fails to recognize the progress that Royal Mail, CWU and members of staff have made since the Hooper Report. This progress has been seen in both the modernization of the business and increases in profits since the pension bailout.&#xa0;My greatest concern is as indicated the USO is set as a minimum and fails to protect the bulk of the mail that staff deliver on a daily basis 6 days a week. If Royal Mail’s competitors are not faced the same restrictions, they will increase in the number of deliveries in urban areas, which will increase the economic pressure on Royal Mail to cut back on uneconomic deliveries and collections.&#xa0;The Secretary of State fails to take on the concerns of the staff, of all grades within Royal Mail, with the consultative ballots results showing the bulk of staff against privatisation. &#xa0;If privatised my concerns is that we will follow the Dutch Post route of zero hour contracts, having the mail dropped off and delivering from their homes.&#xa0;28 July 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
