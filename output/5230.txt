[[[Written evidence submitted by the Electoral Commission (DWB 09)]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[ ]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Electoral Commission is an independent body which reports directly to the UK Parliament. We regulate political party and election finance and set standards for well-run elections. We put voters first by working to support a healthy democracy, where elections and referendums are based on our principles of trust, participation, and no undue influence. We are responsible for publishing reports on the administration of elections and referendums. 1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our comments on the draft Bill relate to matters concerning referendums and electoral arrangements. 

[[[Referendum about commencement of income tax provisions]]]1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have specific responsibilities in relation to the conduct of referendums held under the framework of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA). The proposed referendum included within the Draft Wales Bill will be conducted under that framework.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In any such referendum, our role includes: &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Chair of the Commission, or someone she appoints, is Chief Counting Officer, responsible for the conduct of the referendum and ensuring the accuracy of the overall result. 1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A well-run referendum which has the confidence of voters and campaigners is underpinned by a clear and certain legal framework. Good legislation provides absolute clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those administering the referendum and sets out fair rules governing campaign spending and fundraising.1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Commission’s comments on the draft Bill draw on lessons learnt from the Wales and the UK-wide referendums held in 2011. We published reports on the two referendums in 2011. 1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The legislation for the forthcoming Scottish independence referendum addresses a number of our recommendations from 2011 and also contains provisions specific to that referendum. After the independence referendum, we will reflect on how those provisions have worked in practice and consider whether and how such provisions should apply to all referendums held under PPERA. 

[[[Rules for the conduct of the referendum]]]1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft Bill provides for the referendum rules to be contained in an Order in Council. The provision in the draft Bill is the same as that in the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GOWA). 1.10&#xa0;&#xa0; Following the referendums in 2011, we recommended that the UK Government should use the powers provided in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) to make a generic order providing for the conduct of any future referendum. We said that introducing generic rules would:&#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK Government responded to our recommendation in December 2012, recognising the benefits that a generic conduct order for referendums would bring, and undertaking to consider this further, including through discussion with the Law Commission in the context of their review of electoral law as a whole.1.12&#xa0;&#xa0; We continue to urge the Government to make such an Order, which in relation to the draft Wales Bill would obviate the need for rules to be made in the Order in Council after the referendum has been triggered. 1.13&#xa0;&#xa0; Having a generic conduct Order in place would also ensure that the rules for the referendum are in place at least six months before the referendum takes place, as should be the case for all polls. We have already seen the benefit of this for the Scottish independence referendum, where the relevant legislation is in place nine months in advance of the poll.1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Scope of the Order-making power]]]1.15&#xa0;&#xa0; Notwithstanding our recommendation for a generic conduct order, we are concerned that the Order-making power in the draft Bill may not be sufficient in scope to allow for lessons learnt from other referendums to be applied. Our concern is based on experience in the previous referendum in Wales in 2011.1.16&#xa0;&#xa0; The detailed rules for the referendum held under the Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Act 2011 (PVSC) were very similar to the rules used for the Wales referendum in March 2011, but with some notable differences. The two sets of referendum rules could not be fully aligned at the time, because of limitations to the scope of the Order-making power in in GOWA. 1.17&#xa0;&#xa0; We have recommended that changes should be made to the generic controls on campaigning at any referendum held under the provisions of PPERA, to provide a robust and proportionate regulatory regime. 

[[[We recommend]]], therefore, that these should apply to any referendum held under the provisions of the draft Bill.  Again based on experience from the Wales referendum in 2011, it may not be possible for these changes to be introduced under the Order-making power in its current form.1.18&#xa0;&#xa0; To illustrate the scope of the Order-making power that will be needed, specific examples that the rules for the referendum should include and the changes that need to be made to the regulatory controls of the referendum are set out in

[[[Designation and putti]]]

[[[ng campaign arguments to voters]]]1.21&#xa0;&#xa0; The issue of whether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and able applicants for designation as lead campaigners on both sides of the argument is one that needs early consideration. 1.22&#xa0;&#xa0; The generic statutory designation process in PPERA relies on the assumption that there will be campaign groups on either side of the referendum question which are willing and able to use the benefits of designation to mount a lead campaign. If that is not the case – either because most prospective campaigners are on one side of the debate, or because a campaigner sees tactical advantage in not seeking designation – then the referendum campaign, and the process of putting the campaign arguments to voters, is likely to suffer.1.23&#xa0;&#xa0; At the 2011 referendum in Wales, we were unable to designate lead campaigners because there was no willing and able applicant for the ‘no’ outcome.  1.24&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[We recommended]]] in 2011 that when considering the case for future referendums, legislators should take into account whether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and able applicants for designation. We would of course be happy to work with the Government to consider how to take this recommendation into account.1.25&#xa0;&#xa0; We also recommended in 2011 that the Government should take steps to reduce the potential advantages to a prospective lead campaigner of deciding not to apply for designation. In 2012, the Government responded to this recommendation by saying:‘Designated organisations are important to the referendum process as they are a source of public awareness about the issues at hand. It is important that support be provided for them through the legislative framework. Clearly, it runs counter to the interests of voters if there is any incentive for campaigners to refrain from applying to become designated organisations, as this may impede the proper development of public understanding during a referendum campaign…… The Government is therefore considering carefully how the designation process might be improved’1.26&#xa0;&#xa0; The Scottish Government has addressed this recommendation in the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013 by providing for the Commission to designate for only one outcome if there are not willing and able applicants for both outcomes.180-day timetable for the Order in Council1.27&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft Bill provides for a 180-day period from receipt by the Secretary of State of a notice from the First Minister to the draft Order being laid in Parliament. This compares with a 120-day period in GOWA, which was in practice suspended after the UK Parliamentary general election was held in May 2010. 1.28&#xa0;&#xa0; As described earlier, generic referendum rules would obviate the need for referendum rules to be made by Order in Council. Without generic rules, however, advance drafting of the rules will be essential to enable statutory consultation with the Commission and others, as well as scrutiny, within the 180-day timetable.  1.29&#xa0;&#xa0; The 180-day period will include the time the Commission needs to undertake our statutory assessment of the intelligibility of the referendum question. Our approach to assessing referendum questions takes around 10 weeks to complete, which includes time to undertake public opinion research to see what people think of the question. We need time to undertake any necessary procurement and about two weeks’ notice to start testing the question. 1.30&#xa0;&#xa0; Following receipt of our assessment the referendum question, the Secretary of State will need time to consider our recommendations. It is possible that further iterations will be required before the question can be finalised for inclusion in the Order in Council.1.31&#xa0;&#xa0; The 180-day period should allow sufficient time for assessing and finalising the referendum question for inclusion in the Order in Council, providing advance preparation is undertaken. 

[[[Legislative timetable]]]1.32&#xa0;&#xa0; For completeness, we highlight the need for early consideration of the timetable for the referendum itself. 

[[[We recommended]]] after the referendums held in 2011 that there should be at least 12 weeks between the campaign rules being finalised and the start of the regulated referendum period. This period is important to enable the Commission to publish and disseminate guidance in time to allow campaigners to understand the rules before they come into force. 

[[[Voter information]]]1.33&#xa0;&#xa0; The Draft Wales Bill provides for the Commission to have responsibility for providing information to voters. The provisions mirror those of GOWA 2006 and we are content with their inclusion.

[[[year fixed terms]]]1.34&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft Bill would lengthen Assembly terms from four to five years. Whilst the Commission does not have a specific view on the question of whether an Assembly term should be a four or five year fixed term, we do give our views on particular combinations of elections. The Commission’s position is that each individual proposal should be considered on its merits and we advise on the particular risks and how they could be managed. Our priority is that a poll is well-run and delivered in a way that is easy for voters to understand and participate in.1.35&#xa0;&#xa0; The election schedule is:&#xa0;1.36&#xa0;&#xa0; The combination of a UK Parliamentary general election, Welsh general election and Police and Crime Commissioner elections in 2020 would present significant challenges for voters. It would mean each voter casting ballots in up to three differently-drawn constituencies and an electoral region; on four separate ballot papers and using three different electoral systems. It would also prove challenging for political parties and candidates, not least because of the risk of one campaign overshadowing another and the communication issues that campaigning across multiple elections presents. There would also be administrative challenges for Returning Officers. Overall, these issues would bring significant risks to ensuring well-run elections. 1.37&#xa0;&#xa0; Moving the Assembly term to five years avoids the risks inherent in combining three sets of elections in 2020, although it does then bring combination with local government elections in Wales in 2021. In that combination, each voter would cast ballots in a constituency, an electoral region and a local ward, on three ballot papers and using two electoral systems. There would be risks to address, but less so than in 2020.

[[[Restore the right for candidates to stand on both a constituency and regional list during the Assembly elections]]]1.38&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft Bill provides for the removal of the restriction on standing for election for both constituency and electoral regions. It should be straightforward for people to participate in elections, whether voting or campaigning. This means there should be no unnecessary barriers to standing for election. We made our view clear when the initial proposals to prohibit dual candidacy in Wales were published as part of the Government of Wales Bill 2006 that we did not believe that the case for introducing the change had been made, on the evidence available at the time. 1.39&#xa0;&#xa0; To our knowledge, no further evidence has become available that would suggest that the prohibition should be retained. It continues to be the case that there is no similar prohibition for candidates in Scottish Parliament elections, where the same electoral system is in use.  We agree, therefore, that candidates should be able to stand in a constituency and a region in the same Assembly election. 

[[[Ensure that Assembly Members cannot be MPs at the same time]]]1.40&#xa0;&#xa0; The draft Bill provides for the disqualification of MPs from membership of the Assembly. While we do not have a specific view on the question of multiple mandates, issues to be considered are what the electorate expects of their representatives and how representatives ensure the best possible level of service. Can this be achieved by representing the electorate at a variety of different levels (for example at the UK Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales) and the experience which this brings about or should the focus be entirely on one legislature?January 2014

[[[&#xa0;]]]Annex 1Recommended changes to the conduct and regulation of PPERA referendums1.41&#xa0;&#xa0; To illustrate the scope of the Order-making power that will be needed, below are specific examples of what the rules for the referendum should include and the changes that we recommend to the regulatory controls in PPERA for referendum campaigns.

[[[Rules for the conduct of the referendum]]]The rules should be as contained in the Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Act 2011, including:&#xa0;

[[[Regulation of referendum campaigns]]]&#xa0;1.42&#xa0;&#xa0; The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, our 2011 referendum report, and the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013 also contained a number of other proposed amendments to the generic PPERA controls which reduce the burdens on campaigners and improve the workability and clarity of the rules. There would be considerable benefit in these amendments also applying at future PPERA referendums to:&#xa0;If a designation process is to be used, then it will also be important to consider:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[New recommendations]]]1.43&#xa0;&#xa0; During 2011-12 the Commission undertook a review of the of the UK’s party and election finance laws. We recommended new measures to simplify the registration process, provide more detailed reporting of pre-registration spending, requiring imprints on electronic material and improvements to the workability of the provisions around sanctioning and late payment of fines. We would of course be happy to work with the Government to take these new recommendations forward.&#xa0;
