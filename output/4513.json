"Written evidence submitted by the Disability Law Service (JRR 0039)&#xa0;\nThis is a response to the \ncall for evidence from the Joint Committee on Human Rights \nregarding the Government\n’\ns proposed judicial review reforms.\n  \nThe Disability Law Service \ndisagrees\n with\n the proposed reforms as they fail to \ntake i\nnto account \nof the way\n community care law works in\n practice. We believe that the\n reforms could pot\nentially d\nevastate an important\n area of law \nwhich currently safeguards the \nrights\n to care for\n the most vulnerable in society\n,\n namely those with the most severe \nof disabilities and the elderly.\nWe were\n un\nable to identify\n any adequate attempt to \nconsider the potential\n effects \nof these proposals \non those with disabilities\n. We could not find any consideration of the joint impact of these changes\n \ncoupled with the impact of the\n other legal aid proposal\ns\n upon those with disabilities\n. \nFurthermore, w\ne \nare \nalso oppose\nd to\n the lowering of the \nlegal status of the \nPublic Sector Equality Duty\n.\n \nThe lowering in legal status would remove the current protections that exist for those with disabilities\n and without the \nability to challenge decisions via the court there will be no way\n for the Public Sector Equali\nty Duty to be legally enforced.\nDLS Background&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe provide this account on behalf of the many c\nlients who have sought our services.  The Disability Law Service has been running cases in the area of community care for over 20 years. This has included a number of high profile cases such as the case of  \nElaine McDonald vs the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea [2011] UKSC 33 \nOn appeal from: [2010] EWCA \nCiv\n 1109\n, \nR v Islington ex parte Rixon (1997-8) 1 CCLR 119, \nR (Garnham) v Secretary of State for Health [2009] EWHC  574 (Admin) and others.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;DLS Response Regarding Costs for Judicial Review&#xa0;\nWe object to the proposal\n not\n to pay the costs of a case where permission has not been granted. W\ne are of the opinion \nthat this proposal fails to consider\n the effect that this can have on specific areas o\nf law suc\nh as community c\nare. \nIn this case we expect the following may take place\n: \n&#xa0;\nNo evidence has been provided\n to suggest\n that \nthe system has been misused \nwith\n \nan abundance of\n unmerito\nrio\nus cases within the area of community c\nare.\n Neither have we been provided with any evidence to show a substantial increase in the number of cases within the area of Community Care in general\n. \n We also submit that it is the legal aid agencies job to filter \ncases that are without merit\n which is substantially safer than effectively removing the right of redress by putting in place in impossibly high test for Judicial Review.\n&#xa0;\nDisability and Community Care Law\nCommunity Care is a specialised niche area of law w\nhich on many occasions can require oral permission hearings just so that the judge can understand the area and the surrounding legislation. It is an area w\nh\nere many of those affected by the decisions of local authorities do not get access to advocacy\n or re\npresentation\n and so never receive adequate care. The ombudsman has no power to enforce any action and even to get a determination would usually require a lawyer just to make sense of a situation. We find time after time that local authorities are enacting \npolicies across the board which are unlawful and there is no way to challenge and force a change except via judicial review. \nAs noted above, we provide free telephone advice given by solicitors to the members of the public with community care problems. \nDue to the nature of the area of law, almost every issue concerns a person with a disability. We have found that the number of telephone calls have been increasing as Local Authorities have had their budgets reduced. This has led to those with disabilities\n having their care reduced unlawfully and any changes can only increase this size of the problem. There has been no conside\nration of the effects of such \nproposed changes on those with disabilities. We would request that if there is any doubt as to the natu\nre of the effects on those with disabilities or the levels of problems that they are facing then we would invite anyone from the committee or from the Ministry of Justice to come and listen to our advice lines. \nThis is an open invitation.&#xa0;\nDoes the grantin\ng of permission in Judicial Review cases \nequate to success in a Judicial Review case?\nThe experience of the solicitors acting at the Disability Law Service over the past 5 years is that the granting of permission does not in \nanyway\n indicate \nwhether a case \nhas had merit or has been successful. \nThis is a fundamental flaw which is evident in the proposed amendments. \nAs the following case examples will show, permission rather pertains to whether there is currently still a live matter which has meritorious grou\nnds for challenge. In\n the\n first\n \ncase\n example\n we m\nention\n below, the judge specifically \nreferred\n to the proposed rules and stated that this is a case which would be affected in the future\n should the Government’s \nproposed\n reforms of Judicial Review come into \nforce\n. He said this \nbecause he was\n \nissuing a positive order, yet \nwas not able to grant permission as the local authority had made a last minute concession which meant they were no longer breaking the law\n and instead there was a new decision which could be \nchallenged\n. \nThe concessions which the local authorities make are\n concession\ns\n which they were not willing to make until an application h\nad been made to the high court or they believe that issuing\n of an application for permission to \nproceed\n to Judicial Revie\nw\n is imminent. \n&#xa0;\nFailure to provide funding\nThere is no option to ensure local authorities fulfil their duty to provide care in urgent cases, unless by way of an order issued by the High Court, or alternatively when threatened with a potential Order. \nIn o\nur experience there has been an increasing request for assistance in the area of community care, as local authority funding has been cut. In the past seven days we have received sixty requests for assistance regarding community care issues with local autho\nrities. Earlier this year we discovered one local authority in particular remove twenty four hour care packages from numerous individuals who then sought advice via our service. Fortunately, we succeeded in stopping this \nby sending the local authority in q\nuestion pre-action protocol letters informing\n of the threat of Judicial Review. Removal of the twenty four hour care package would have seen the local authority save thousands of pounds. There remain countless others that encounter such problems of whom ha\nve not sought legal advice. \nFailure to provide funding when\n permission\n has not been granted will\n \nsubsequently\n lead to \nan\n inability to challenge the actions\n of local authorities which infringe \nupon the most basic\n rights\n of the elderly and those of disabilities\n. \nImplementing the proposal \nwill \nexacerbate \nthe \neffects \nof what is already a torturous situation \ngiven that \nlocal authorities \nare cutting funding \nfor care packages left, right and centre\n. It will enable them to cont\ninue violating \nthe most basic \nhuman rights without repercussion.\n \nAs\n \nsolicitor\ns\n practising\n community care l\naw\n,\n \nwe\n \ndo not often have to issue a claim in the high court but conversely we\n \nusually have \nto \nthreaten Judicial Review in \nalmost every one\n of\n our\n cas\nes\n. \nWe have found that \nL\nocal authorities\n appear to be breaking the law across the board in adult social welfare and\n \nonly \nappear to wish to \nrectify wrong doing\n if they\n are of the belief\n that\n \na\nction\n will be taken against them\n. \nLocal authorities have a tenden\ncy to wait until the\n deadline\n date before taking action, knowing that court proceedings will follow. \nSome local authorities will make you issue in the high court and others will wait till the deadline on a letter before claim if they believe you are really\n intent on issuing the case in the high court. \n&#xa0;\nCurrent barriers to funding in Judicial Review cases in community care\nThe proposed changes do not consider the fact that there are already existing obstacles to overcome when attempting to make an applicati\non for Judicial Review. Local Authorities\n are aware that\n cases\n cannot be issued\n in the high court unless we \nhave a meritorious case\n which has usually had a positive advice drafted\n by a barrister where the\n prospect of \nsuccess will invariably \nneed to\n exceed the\n 50%\n mark\n.\n \nWe have known of defendants attempting to contact the Legal Aid Agency just to attempt to have the certificate of public funding removed so that a challenge cannot be brought. \nThis is important as there is no other way to make a loca\nl authority take action. \n \nHowever,\n this would no\nt be such if they thought a case was unlikely to receive funding and subsequently\n \ndoubtful it would reach the High Court.\n \nE\nven \nif a case has a 100% prospect of success this\n does not mean \npermission will be gr\nanted.\n&#xa0;\nCase examples\n - \nThe case of Mr\n A\nThis year we were forced to issue a case in the High Court because a local authority had failed to provide adequate care to an individual suffering from Muscular Dystrophy. This person had been left with no choice b\nut to live on a sofa for five years without any care being offered by the authority in question. The clients’ father, aged 80 had to meet his   son’s care needs, whilst also providing care for his wife, aged 79 whom suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Moreo\nver, the local authority had been obstructing the Claimant’s access to a Disabled Facilities Grant to enable him required adaptations to extend his parent’s house for the purpose of building an additional bedroom.\nWe attempted negotiations for eight months\n and sent numerous letters before action. We applied for judicial review but the local authority had made some concessions the day before a permission hearing. We had a full day\n oral\n permission hearing but we were not granted permission but instead given a\n second permission hearing despite the first hearing resulting in a positive order for our client. The local authority failed to comply with the order and for the second time the\n oral permission\n hearing lasted a whole day. The hearing again resulted in a p\nositive order. However, we were not granted permission due to last minute concessions finally made on the authority’s part following the second order. We were instead given a third permission hearing. Currently, a Disabled Facilities Grant has been agreed \nand a care package offered, yet we were never granted permission by the High Court. This is a common occurrence and the reason why the statistics in community care cases do not provide an accurate picture.  \nThis case would be classified as not having permi\nssion.\n&#xa0;\nThe case of Mr B\nIn this matter the local authority were about to remove a person with severe autism from his care home as they thought it was\n too\n expensive. They had not found an adequate place to meet his needs and had not even carried out a ne\nw needs assessment, care plan or risk assessment of what the effect could be. We were instructed two weeks before the proposed move which his parents had been protesting against. With the threat of judicial review placed upon the local authority the local \nauthority have decided to take no action and stated in correspondence that this was only because of the threat of judicial review. \n We have had to keep this case open as the local authority appear to be waiting until we go away so they can remove him. \n&#xa0;\nTh\ne case of Mr C\nThis client was threatened with being evicted from his care home despite serious safeguarding issues. He was given 7 days notice and told that he should report to the local authority homeless section stating he was homeless. There was no nee\nds assessment \nor care provision put in place. His father contacted us and we contacted the local authority\n. The local authority back\ned\n down immediately with the threat of judicial review. \n&#xa0;\nThe case of Miss D\nThe client was not receiving an amount of care to meet her needs, the local authority would not state how the needs were met or increase the care package. She has Multiple \nSclerosis\n and required a high degree of care. We threatened judicial review which ha\nd no effect so we issued a claim in the high court and they back down immediately agreeing \nto provide\n reasons and to reassess her care package. She was then given an increased care package. \nThis case would be classified as not having permission. \n&#xa0;\nThe \ncase\n of Mr E\nThis case involved a mother whom looked after her severely disabled son whom had a multitude of disabilities. \nIn this matter the loca\nl authority would not provide a \ncarers assessment, we sent numerous letters before claim and had meetings. We fina\nlly issued in the high court and they gave in within one hour of receiving notification from us of having issued the case. In this matter they contacted the LAA and tried to have the certificate taken away. \nThis case would be classified as not having permi\nssion.\n&#xa0;\nThe case of Miss F\nThis case involved a mother with a severe disability who required a Disabled Facilities Grant but the local aut\nhority would not allow her to apply. They stated they were not allowed to under the law. We instructed a barrister, po\ninted out that they had discretion and that there was guidance within the guidance and again threatened Judicial Review. And again they back down \n&#xa0;\nThe case of Miss G\nIn this matter a \nperson with so severe care needs that they required 24 hour care was giv\nen an assessment and then reduced to only a few hours a week. Again we threatened Judicial Review and they put the 24 hour care back in place. \n&#xa0;\nThe complaints procedure\nIt has been often argued that those with disabilities can use the complaints procedure\n. We can state that from our experience and our clients experience that the complaints procedure is not fit for purpose. The local authorities have a vested interest in stating that there has been no wrongdoing on their part. \nOften issues can be matter of \nlife or death \n(i.e. someone’s 24 care package being reduced to 4 one hour visits per day).\n&#xa0;\n Therefore \na \ncomplaint is clearly not a viable option,\nIncreasingly we are hearing reports from callers to our advice line that their complaints are not being dealt with, or are being dismissed out of hand with little or no fair and transparent consideration of the facts by the local authority.\n&#xa0;\n This is sympto\nmatic of a complaints procedure being controlled by the organisation being complained about.\n&#xa0;\n This used to be the case with complaints against the police until it was acknowledged that you need a degree of independence when dealing with issues.\n&#xa0;\n At a time \nwhen local authorities are having their budgets put under increasing pressure, and are having to make financially sensitive decisions, it is vital that an independent body is responsible for dealing with complaints.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nConclusion\nWe have many of these \nexamples and our advice lines show the same material and why there is a need for the Judicial Review or a tribunal with the same powers including the ability to make an urgent and immediate decision which is legally enforceable.\nWe kindly\n request that the \ngovernment reconsider\ns\n this matter in light of the way perm\nission statistics are used, as they do not provide a portrayal as to \nwhe\nther a community care case \n \nhas been successful\n.\n And again we extend the invitation to listen to our advice lines if there is\n any question as to the veracity of the situation within community care or the need for Judicial Review in its current format. \n&#xa0;\n27\n November 2013 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
