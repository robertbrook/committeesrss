If people disagree it is a good way to say we have taken into account public opinion. ... It was very useful when we were questioned by sceptics \nabout why the research was licensed and we could refer back – robust evidence base – and say these are the findings.  We had followed a robust process and this couldn’t be questioned.\"\n \n&#xa0;\n\"It's risk management in terms of investment in science programmes. Also it's finding something you might not have thought about that will give you a different perspective.\"\n \n‘Direct dialogue with the public should move from being an optional add-on to science-based policy-making and to the activities of \nresearch\n organisations and learned institutions, and should become a normal part of the process.’\n3\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/makingsciencepublic/2013/04/07/public-understanding-of-climate-change/\n \n \nhttp://www.sciencewise-erc.org.uk/cms/low-carbon-communities-challenge/\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48459/5790-opm-evaluation-of-the-process-and-outputs-of-the-l.pdf\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48458/5788-low-carbon-communities-challenge-evaluation-report.pdf\n \nSee p6\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48458/5788-low-carbon-communities-challenge-evaluation-report.pdf\n \n \nhttp://sciencewise-erc.org.uk/cms/geoengineering/\n \n \nEvaluation of Defra's public engagement process on climate change\n,\n Diane Warburton, 2008\n \nhttp://www.sciencewise-erc.org.uk/cms/assets/Uploads/Publications/Sciencewise-Evaluation-Report-FINAL.pdf\n \np7 Sciencewise Evaluation Report, Diane Warburton, 2013\n \np8 Sciencewise Evaluation Report, Diane Warburton, 2013\n Select Committee on Science and Technology (2000) \nScience and Society. \nSelect Committee on Science and Technology – Third Report.
