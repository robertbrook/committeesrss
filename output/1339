[normal]              
[normal]The Committee is concerned that the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act of 2012 unduly restricts women’s access to legal aid, as it removes ac
[normal]cess to legal aid for litigation concerning, inter alia, divorce, property disputes, housing and immigration matters. While noting that legal aid is still available for some private family law issues, the Committee is concerned that the Act conditions lega
[normal]l aid upon proof of, inter alia, abuse for victims of violence, and that a proposed residency test is under consultation. It is also concerned at the introduction of court fees under the Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013. The Committee notes with 
[normal]concern reports that these limitations may push women, particularly ethnic minority women, into informal community arbitration systems, including faith-based tribunals, which are often not in conformity with the Convention.
