"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by the Daphne Jackson Trust (WSC0100)Thank you for giving Dr Pia Ostergaard, on behalf of the\n Daphne Jackson Trust\n,\n \nthe opportunity to \ngive \noral \nevidence to the Science and \nTechnology Committee on Wednesday 30\nth\n October. We sh\nould now like to submit furt\nher \nwritten \nevidence that reinforces the importance of drawing on the pool of \ntalented \nwomen who have taken a career break \nand now wish\n return to research\n. These individuals, with appropriate support and retraining, such as that offered by the Daphne Jackson Fellowships, can go on to \nbecome an integral part\n of a diverse and talented STEM workforce.\nWe would like to reinforce the following points:\nCareer break rather than maternity break \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA Fell\now\n graduated from Oxford with a degree in Chemistry and then worked for Kodak for 3 years before returning to Oxford to do a PhD. She got married to an officer in the RAF and soon was expecting their first child. Due to her husbandâ€™s job they were moving e\nvery 2-3 years, and with two young children, a job in chemistry was not feasible. When her children went to school, and the family had a 3 year posting to RAF Brize Norton, she started applying for jobs but with no success. In 1998 the family returned to O\nxford \nwhere\n she \nheard\n about the Daphne Jackson Trust and was awarded a Fellowship. She has been employed by Oxford University since. \nImproving flexible working opportunities\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
