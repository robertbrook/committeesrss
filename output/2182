defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultByways and Bridleways Trust is one of the bodies prescribed in the
default&#xa0;
defaultWildlife and Countryside Act 
default&#xa0;
default1981 to receive notice of public path orders.
default&#xa0;
default Our interest is in the higher status public rights of way, especially in correct recording on the definitive map.
default&#xa0;
default BBT is pleased to answer questions 1 - 7 of the current Call for Written Evidence, and would like at the appropriate time to submit more detailed evidence on Clauses 12 - 18 and Schedule 6.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnswers to General Questions as applying to Clauses 12-18 and Schedule 6 only:-
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1. Not in our opinion.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2. A possible advantage is that amended primary legislation is easier for the citizen to find and understand. The legislative process is more open and can be better informed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3. We have some reservations and would like to offer detailed evidence at the appropriate time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4.
default&#xa0;
defaultEffectively - yes.
default&#xa0;
default Fairly - again we have some reservations, especially for voluntary bodies and individuals.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5. It will benefit businesses concerned with activity in the countryside, if it succeeds in achieving a comprehensive network of bridleways and byways.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6. There is potential for substantial benefit to consumers 
defaultif
default, following legislation, the will is there on all sides to speed up completion of the definitive map and achieve a comprehensive network for riders, horse drivers
default&#xa0;
defaultand cyclists, not just for walkers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7.iv. A fully completed definitive map provides a very useful resource for education in various skills and branches of knowledge at all levels.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default vi.
default&#xa0;
default If the Bill succeeds in getting the historic ways 
defaultfairly
default recorded, it will be of substantial benefit
default&#xa0;
defaultin enabling
default&#xa0;
defaultindividuals to improve their health and well-being by activity in the countryside of their own choice and in their own time, as well as increasing the opportunities available for organised expeditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have to add that the definitive map process, begun in 1949, is a highly complex affair which several successive Acts have not succeeded in simplifying: the present economic climate and cut backs in Local Authority staffing do jeopardise the success of these proposals.
