[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Byways and Bridleways Trust is one of the bodies prescribed in the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wildlife and Countryside Act 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1981 to receive notice of public path orders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Our interest is in the higher status public rights of way, especially in correct recording on the definitive map.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] BBT is pleased to answer questions 1 - 7 of the current Call for Written Evidence, and would like at the appropriate time to submit more detailed evidence on Clauses 12 - 18 and Schedule 6.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Answers to General Questions as applying to Clauses 12-18 and Schedule 6 only:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1. Not in our opinion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2. A possible advantage is that amended primary legislation is easier for the citizen to find and understand. The legislative process is more open and can be better informed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3. We have some reservations and would like to offer detailed evidence at the appropriate time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q4.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Effectively - yes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Fairly - again we have some reservations, especially for voluntary bodies and individuals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q5. It will benefit businesses concerned with activity in the countryside, if it succeeds in achieving a comprehensive network of bridleways and byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6. There is potential for substantial benefit to consumers 
[normal]if
[normal], following legislation, the will is there on all sides to speed up completion of the definitive map and achieve a comprehensive network for riders, horse drivers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and cyclists, not just for walkers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7.iv. A fully completed definitive map provides a very useful resource for education in various skills and branches of knowledge at all levels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] vi.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If the Bill succeeds in getting the historic ways 
[normal]fairly
[normal] recorded, it will be of substantial benefit
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in enabling
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]individuals to improve their health and well-being by activity in the countryside of their own choice and in their own time, as well as increasing the opportunities available for organised expeditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have to add that the definitive map process, begun in 1949, is a highly complex affair which several successive Acts have not succeeded in simplifying: the present economic climate and cut backs in Local Authority staffing do jeopardise the success of these proposals.
