[[[Introduction]]]

[[[1.1]]]              The Ethical Medicines Industry Group (EMIG) welcomes this opportunity to submit to the Science and Technology Committee inquiry into Research and Development Funding for Science and Technology in the UK. 

[[[1.2]]]

[[[              ]]]EMIG is the research based biopharmaceutical trade association that represents the interests of over 200 companies and organisations based in the UK. Our members range from start-ups, whose prime focus is often research and development (R&amp;D), to highly developed businesses delivering essential products to patients and the NHS. They are commonly, but not exclusively, small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Less than 20% of our members are represented by other trade bodies.&#xa0;

[[[1.3]]]

[[[              ]]]The UK life sciences industry provides vital medicines to patients, is at the forefront of medical innovation and is a significant contributor to the UK economy.  SMEs constitute approximately 90% of the total number of biopharmaceutical companies and it is estimated that 80% of innovation is derived from these small companies. EMIG member companies employ approximately 20,000 people in the UK and have a combined annual turnover of £4 billion.&#xa0;

[[[1.4]]]

[[[              ]]]EMIG would be delighted to give oral evidence to the Select Committee if it would be valuable or if any of the points in this submission require further detail.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.1]]]              The National Audit Office’s (NAO) report highlights the significant spend of the UK pharmaceuticals sector on R&amp;D and its contribution as a ‘key driver to innovation in the UK’. However, EMIG shares the NAO’s concerns that the sector is heavily dependent upon two large pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca. It is imperative the life sciences industry is able to continue to grow and contribute to the UK economy but to continue to do so by relying specifically on these two major companies, is deemed, quite rightly, risky.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2.2]]]              It is therefore vital that the UK fosters a regulatory, fiscal and commercial environment which enables a new generation of companies to become significant R&amp;D funders. SMEs in the sector are particularly exposed to the current economic downturn and the uncertainty caused by the current domestic environment. However, SMEs are essential to the economy as when they launch new products, they grow organically and additionally outsource many of their service requirements, stimulating a hinterland of service companies that contribute to employment and the economy. &#xa0;

[[[2.3]]]              As SMEs typically lack the resources required to conduct all the necessary steps, from basic research to marketing, they tend to focus their R&amp;D in a well-defined and narrow field, for example specific indications or pharmaceutical formulations. They also, therefore, frequently out-license or sell their innovations to larger companies. Currently, approximately 25 per cent of the molecules in the development portfolios of large pharmaceutical companies have been acquired from other companies, many of which are SMEs. It is therefore critical that specific measures to nourish and support these companies and their associates are recognised and implemented.&#xa0;

[[[2.4]]]                            EMIG welcomes the support for the sector through measures contained in the Life Sciences Strategy and recent funding for initiatives including the Specialised Services Commissioning Innovation Fund and the Biomedical Catalyst Fund. The Government has also made important strides in fostering a more positive tax environment for the life sciences industry in the UK. Over the last 24 months there have been some welcome changes, in particular, the reduction in business tax rates, the introduction of the Patent Box, R&amp;D above the line tax credits and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) and changes to Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI). However, we believe the following areas require further consideration: &#xa0;

[[[2.5]]]              The NAO’s report separates spending by independent SMEs, those which are not part of a larger enterprise group, from overall SME spend. EMIG is concerned that the report appears to denigrate those SMEs who are R&amp;D investors but happen to be a UK affiliate of a larger global enterprise from those which are ‘home grown’.&#xa0; If so, this risks devaluing the importance of attracting inward investment. EMIG believes both independent and UK affiliate SME funders are important to the nation's economy.&#xa0;
