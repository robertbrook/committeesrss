"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the UK Travel Forum&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe \nUK\n \nT\nravel \nR\netail \nF\norum \nis an industry body which represents most sectors of the duty free and travel retail business. Our members include airports, airlines, shop operators, agents and distributors and the manufacturers of wines and spirits\n, \ntobacco\n, beauty, confectionery and fashion\n.  \n&#xa0;\nWe understand that the Committee is examining\n the rationale for excluding particular types of \nretailer from the proposed levy for single use carrier bags.  We consider that airport retailers in \nEngland\n should be exempt from the levy.\n&#xa0;\nIn summary, these are the reasons for such an exemption:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo show clearly that items which could potentially pose a security risk (particularly liquids, aerosols and gels) have been purchased airside, the mandatory requirement to provide Security Tamper Evident Bags (“STEBs”) means that airside retailers must be allowed to continue to provide bags to customers and that the bags should be exempt from any charge. \nFurthermore, it is essential that all airside purchases are carried on board the aircraft in bags to ensure that they can be securely held in the overhead bins or under aircraft seats and do not pose a danger by becoming loose and falling on passengers below or by obstructing gangways.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo ensure consistency across the \nUK\n and avoid customer confusion, the legislation in \nEngland\n should mirror that already enacted in \nWales\n and \nNorthern Ireland\n, and the Scottish Government’s draft legislation, which all provide for exemption from their respective levies for bags provided by businesses operating airside at airports.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;While security and regulatory requirements are paramount reasons for an exemption \nfrom the levy \nfor airside retailers\n, i\nt is also important to take into account the significant difference between high street retail and \nairport \nshopping\n.  Firstly, passengers come to airports to fly, not to shop and therefore do not come armed with shopping bags as they would to make their weekly supermarket shop.  Secondly, many airport purchases are made on impulse, thus again passengers do not have shopping bags with them.  P\nroducts purchased are often heavy\n, meaning that\n sturdy bags are required\n.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n9 December 2013\n&#xa0;UKTRF \nc/o Sarah \nBranquinho\n (Chair), WDFG, \n4 New Square\n, \nBedfont\n \nLakes\n, Feltham, \nMiddlesex\n, \nTW14 8HA\nTelephone \n07964 666300 e\n-mail \ninfo@uktrf.co.uk\n  \nwww.uktrf.co.uk\n&#xa0;\nVAT \nReg\n No 749099286\nRegistered in \nEngland\n No. 221595\n8\n  Registered Office 1 Paper Mews \n330 High Street\n Dorking \nSurrey\n RH4 2TU \nA company limited by guarantee\n&#xa0;\n"
