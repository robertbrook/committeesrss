[normal]Written submission from the Department of Communities and Local Government (LPG 63)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Local government spends £58 billion
[normal] per year procuring goods and services. This note sets out how DCLG is 
[normal]incentivising
[normal] local government to open up its procurement practices, and become more efficient, transparent and accountable to local communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Significant changes have been made to central government procurement, examined recently by the Public Administration Select Committee in their report published on 16 July 2013
[normal]. The principles behind those changes are the ones councils should be adopting, such as eliminating Pre Qualification Questionnaires for low value contracts as discussed on page 6. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In July 2013
[normal], t
[normal]he Federation for Small Businesses 
[normal]published research which found 
[normal]that
[normal] councils are transforming their procurement process. Specifically they found that there has been a noticed increase in the number of local authorities who adopt different processes for below EU threshold tenders (85% from 74% in 2012)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]recognise
[normal] progress has been made
[normal], 
[normal]however 
[normal]there are still too many councils using overly bureaucratic, disproportionate procurement processes, which unnecessarily discriminate against smaller businesses, and which are not transparent to 
[normal]t
[normal]heir local communities. 
[normal]This has been highlighted by the Mystery Shopper Scheme, which is discussed on page 7. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]t is not for central government to dictate local procurement practices, strategies or structures, 
[normal]but 
[normal]we
[normal] have an important role in 
[normal]incentivising
[normal] service transformation and encouraging
[normal] 
[normal]innovation t
[normal]hrough a number of 
[normal]mechanisms:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rewarding success
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Through “50 Ways to Save – Examples of Sensible Savings in Local Government”
[normal] 
[normal]we provided examples 
[normal]of 
[normal]procurement savings in both big and small projects, by procuring better, tackling fraud, and collaborating
[normal], as discussed in detail on pages 6 and 7
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In January, with support from Lord Young, we started the ‘Best councils to do business with’ contest. The criteria assessed a council’s overall approach to opening up their procurement practices. 67 strong entries
[normal] were assessed 
[normal]by a panel which included industry representation from the 
[normal]Federation of Small Businesses
[normal], Co
[normal]nfederation of British Industry
[normal] and British Chambers of Commerce. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The winners were 
[normal]announced on 15 May
[normal] 
[normal]at a reception at 
[normal]10 Downing Street
[normal], 
[normal]and each showed 
[normal]clear 
[normal]evidence of best practice, valuing small businesses and putting them at the heart of service delivery. We will be working with these exemplar councils to showcase 
[normal]their work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are also currently assessing bids for 
[normal]this
[normal] year
[normal]’
[normal]s Transformation Challenge Award. £6.9m will be available to councils who wish to make savings by transforming and sharing their services with others. We expect to see the innovative use of procurement functions to feature strongly in those bids, which will enable us to reward success and promote exemplars
[normal] even further
[normal].     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Focused intervention 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Central government can act as a key facilitator in specific service areas where significant savings need to be made. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]o assist with
[normal] efficiency and transparency in fire procurement 
[normal]the Department is currently undertaking a joint research project with the Chief Fire Officers Associat
[normal]ion to capture procurement data
[normal]. This is
[normal] due to complete in late 2013. Furthermore, 
[normal]Facing th
[normal]e
[normal] Future
[normal] - t
[normal]he independent review of efficiency and operations in fire and rescue authorities in 
[normal]England
[normal], 
[normal]includes 
[normal]a section on 
[normal]fire procurement. The Government response to the Review will be published shortly. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DCLG, BIS, the Cabinet Office and the Local Government Association have been working together to look at what more councils can do to get best value from their procurement of construction projects.  The government’s industrial strategy for construction was launched on 2nd July
[normal] and sets out how we can work with the construction industry to ensure the 
[normal]UK
[normal] continues to thrive in the face of increasing global competition. The strategy includes a commitment for the Local Government Association to establish a construction procurement group and develop a construction procurement strategy for local government by Spring 2014
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Governing legislation and recommended practice 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Central government clearly has a role to play in ensuring legislation promotes the procurement principles we advocate, whilst allowing significant freedom and flexibility to allow local practices to be adapted to suit local markets and contracts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We will shortly be undertaking a significant consultation on procurement reforms across the whole public sector, which follow on from Lord Young’s report 
[normal]Growing Your 
[normal]Business
[normal]. The consultation will focus on some key themes: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These principles would simplify and standardise the bidding, payment and advertising of contracts, and would remove the complexity, cost and inconsistency when trying to sell to more than one local authority o
[normal]r public sector body. This will
[normal] help 
[normal]small businesses
[normal] access the £230 billion per year that is spent on goods and services across the whole public sector
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore the Department represented local government’s views during the 
[normal]18-months of intensive negotiations between the European Institutions
[normal] on 
[normal]a revised package of EU Procurement Directives. The 
[normal]agreed 
[normal]package
[normal] 
[normal]support
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]our
[normal] priorities of economic growth and deficit reduction by making public procurement faster, less costly, and more effective for business and procurers alike. 
[normal]We are supporting 
[normal]Cabinet Office 
[normal]in
[normal] preparing ambitious plans for early transposition, so 
[normal]we 
[normal]can take advantage of the additional flexibilities in the new rules as soon as possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We have indicated above how DCLG, and central government as a whole, supports and 
[normal]incentivises
[normal] further progress in local government procurement. The following material sets our response to the questions asked by the Committee. As indicated, the Department does not intervene in the detail of local authority roles and responsibilities, but we have provided work undertaken in these areas, and examples of best practice for others to aim for.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How procurement is structured in local government varies greatly. The Department is clear that different structures will suit different organisations. However, the ‘Best councils to do business with’ contest highlighted the need for procurement to be discussed at the top table. Each winner showed a clear procurement strategy, supported by council leadership, and linked in to wider strategies around economic development and growth.  For example, Manchester City Council has a Sustainable Procurement Strategy that shows how procurement supports wider objectives of the organisation and provides economic, social and environmental benefits. The London Borough of Harrow has a procurement policy that elevates procurement activity from ‘spend’ to ‘investment in the community’ 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All strategies should identify the need to work with suppliers at all stages of the process, from pre-market engagement, to 
[normal]after
[normal] the contracts are awarded. They should identify how the council will manage the contract, particularly if it is long-term, to use them as a tool to build relationships with contractors, particularly in 
[normal]their local markets. Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council awarded a £100 million 10 year contract through their Property Repairs and Improvement Partnership which utilised contract clauses to support social and economic regeneration. This resulted in £6 million being spent in the first year within the local supply chain, with 84% of directly employed personnel residing in 
[normal]Barnsley
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To support th
[normal]ose strategies and th
[normal]e wider objectives of procurement functions, DCLG published new Best Value guidance in September 2011
[normal].  The guidance set out reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with 
[normal]providers, including 
[normal]allow
[normal]ing
[normal] organisations and the community to put forward options on how to reshape the service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Best Value Guidance is also clear that councils should consider overall value when reviewing service provision. This is complemented by the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 which requires public bodies to consider the economic, social, and environmental impact of their public service contracts at the pre procurement stage, and to consider consulting with service users. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst 
[normal]the Department 
[normal]do
[normal]es
[normal] not centrally monitor adherence to these objectives, the Mystery Shopper scheme investigate
[normal]s
[normal] any complaints about the Act not being applied
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Significant savings can be achieved from collaboration opportunities in procurement. This can either be through a shared service arrangement, or through individual deals, including those supported by central government. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Consideration of shared services as a solution must now be automatic, particularly in a field like procurement where successful case studies are plentiful and benefits are relatively easy to gain. So we continue to press local authorities to go further on this agenda. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One example of a shared service approach is Procurement Lincolnshire, which is a partnership between eight councils which has transformed services and improved outcomes for it’s customers. By working together, the partnership delivered £5.1 million in cashable savings in 2012/2013 through procurement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Department agrees that local authorities 
[normal]must
[normal] also take advantage of collaborative deals on specific categories of spend, particularly in high cost service areas. For example six councils around Oxfordshire have worked on jointly commissioning and procuring children’s homes and education services for children with complex needs. At least £2.5 million savings are estimated on the commissioning of 20-30 bed children’s homes and education services. This equates to about 15 per cent of annual cost of high cost residential placements for young people.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]During DCLG’s £250 million Weekly Collection Support Scheme a unique opportunity was created for the 82 successful councils to take advantage of joint procurement deals. Many were buying similar goods – wheeled bins and refuse collection vehicles – at a similar time within the thirty month timeframe allowed by the scheme.  Economies of scale would have meant cheaper products for those collaborating. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite a well-attended seminar and subsequent workshops, provided by DCLG with the LGA and other partners, it is felt that authorities did not take sufficient advantage of the procurement opportunity created from the Scheme. Excuses included: working to unique timescales; local sovereignty; and existing contracts, and these were complemented by a lack of understanding of processes and in some cases disinterest – a tunnel vision focused solely on the processes of their local authority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where local authorities have joined up, the advantages have been obvious. The London Waste and Recycling Board coordinated a joint procurement of food waste caddies and caddy liners. Around 250,000 caddies and 9.5 million liners were procured at a total cost of £460,000. This presented a saving over normal cost prices of 25 per cent. One authority did particularly well and achieved savings of 68 per cent compared to what it would have paid if it had procured alone. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]More examples of councils in receipt of Weekly Collection Support Scheme funding joining up to procure waste-related goods are emerging. The more examples presented to local authorities, the more likely it is that they will see the benefits and follow suit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In support of this work, an 
[normal]announcement 
[normal]was 
[normal]made on 24 July 
[normal] that central government is creating a new commercial service for Government to act on behalf of the crown to drive savings for the taxpayer and to improve the quality of commercial and procurement acti
[normal]vity across the public sector. The Crown Commercial Service 
[normal]will work closely with the wider public sector to ensure that the benefits of aggregation and centralisation are shared to maximise savings for the taxpayer
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore the forthcoming consultation on public sector procurement will also examine how transparent centrally negotiated deals are, and whether further data in this area will encourage greater take up. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Shared procurement services also provide an opportunity to create centres of expertise and capability, which maximise skills and market knowledge and create resilience, particularly for smaller councils. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government Procurement Service also provide a range of training tools which are available to local government such as the free e-learning hub as well as access to professional procurement qualification packages. The
[normal]y
[normal] are at the 
[normal]beginning of a programme to roll out the training originally provided to NHS staff, to all central and local governme
[normal]nt procurement/commercial staff
[normal]. The Government Procurement Service have also accepted a few delegates from councils onto the courses aimed at central government officials and are managing levels of demand from local authorities against their current delivery capacity. They envisage an increase in numbers of 
[normal]local government
[normal] delegates over the next 6 to 12 months. 
[normal]They are also a source of skills, expertise, tools and resources that needs to be 
[normal]utilised
[normal] fully by councils.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However the ‘Best Council’ winners showed how procurement skills must also be supported locally, either through professional qualifications, or by mechanisms for sharing best practice or concerns, such as Hertfordshire’s Contract Managers’ Network. More could be done to provide greater peer-support and ownership across local authorities. Whilst there are different opportunities to access to the right skills, there is still a culture of working in isolation that needs to be tackled. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many councils have also identified spend analysis as a key tool. Support in this area is available from a range of sources, from the Government Procurement Service, to consultants, to in-house models. All the ‘Best Council’ winners identified mechanisms for 
[normal]analysing
[normal] expenditure and examining markets. Surrey and 
[normal]East Sussex
[normal] share systems that provide profiles of a supply base and percentage of spend locally, in order to tailor procurement strategies. DCLG is working with the Local Government Association and the Government Procurement Service to examine how similar spend analysis tools could be made more available.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 4
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ability to understand, assess and manage risk is critical to any procurement strategy that aims to reduce bureaucracy, encourage new innovative suppliers and achieve the best outcomes for the community.  The Federation of Small Businesses’ research indicates that councils are increasingly using different approaches to lower value, lower risk contract. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many of the winners of the ‘Best Councils’ contest highlighted risk management as a key part of their procurement process. Halton Borough Council have adopted a process that is risk based not value driven, and which subsequently removes the requirement for Pre Qualification Questionnaires on lower value contracts. It makes the process simple and quick, with turn-around possible in 24 hours. They do not rule out suppliers purely on the basis of a credit reference report, they use all the information available to them. This approach has not only resulted in savings, but has also led to 89% of the council’s procurement spend going to small businesses. They also intend to review current supplier relationships over the next year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst this shows evidence of councils beginning to use risk to tailor tenders to the product and market place, there are still too many examples of over-burdensome selection criteria being applied to low risk contracts, discouraging small businesses from applying and wasting resources for all parties. 
[normal]Councils also need to remove
[normal] unnecessary equality gold-plating, which can push up contract costs and make it 
[normal]more difficult for small and voluntary organisations to bid for contracts
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]recommended by 
[normal]Lord Young, and 
[normal]which will be examined further in the
[normal] forthcoming publication of the public sector equal
[normal]ity duty review. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Mystery Shopper Service provide
[normal]s
[normal] a clear, structured and direct route for suppliers to raise concerns about public procurement practice when attempts at resolving issues with a contracting authority or a first-tier supplier have failed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of the 155 local authority referrals, 32 related to Pre Qualification Questionnaires. That is why we need to do more to tackle this issue. Pre-qualification is a key theme in the forthcoming consultation on public sector procurement reform and we will act on the responses we receive to find a solution that eliminates unnecessary, disproportionate Pre Qualification Questionnaires. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 5 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Councils operate within a robust set of financial regulations which aim to ensure regularity and propriety, as set out in the Department’s 
[normal]accountability system statement. 
[normal]Councils must have a Chief Finance Officer (or section 151 officer) in place who must advise immediately of any illegal spending. Councils must be audited every year by an independent auditor, who looks at the truth and fairness of the council’s financial statements, and their arrangements to achieve value for money. The auditor has the ability to produce a public interest report which examines concerns about at council’s approach to procurement. Recent examples of public interest reports on procurement include Wirral Borough Council’s highways contract, and regeneration schemes in Corby Borough Council.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DCLG identified procurement fraud as one of the 50 Ways to Save, as it is estimated to cost local government around £880 million
[normal] a year. 
[normal]Fighting 
[normal]Fraud Locally
[normal], 
[normal]the local governm
[normal]ent strategy for tackling fraud, was published in April 2012. D
[normal]eveloped by local government for local government, it addresses the need for greater prevention an
[normal]d smarter enforcement. I
[normal]t provides a blueprint for how 
[normal]councils can reduce their
[normal] risk to fraud, realise cash savings, and work together to prevent future fraud losses
[normal]. DCLG is a member of the Board charged with securing implementation of the strategy. Backed by guidance, case studies, advice on powers and penalties and discussion forums, 
[normal]Fighting Fraud Locally
[normal] is an important conduit for councils to understand how they can prevent and tackle procurement fraud.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]National Fraud A
[normal]uthority
[normal] is working with a small group of accountancy firms to develop some pilots with local authorities to provide good practice material on tackling procurement fraud
[normal]. DCLG will soon be publishing a short guide setting out a few simple things that every organisation can do to prevent mandate fraud. The Government will also be publishing its response to its consultation on the 
[normal]Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency
[normal]. This is likely to set out details about information which local authorities must be publishing on forthcoming procurement exercises and contracts that are awarded. Greater transparency should make an important contribution to combating fraud.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 6
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Councils are accountable for the resources that they spend. Where they contract to other parties they are accountable for ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that the services is delivered, value for money is achieved, and where necessary, put contingency plans in place should the contractor fail to deliver the service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government
[normal] 
[normal]believes local 
[normal]services should be accountable to local communities rather than
[normal] 
[normal]Whitehall
[normal].
[normal] It
[normal] 
[normal]continue
[normal]s
[normal] to reduce, unnecessary bureaucratic central performance management burdens on local 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment, at the same time 
[normal]it is
[normal] strengthening local accountability measures such as transpa
[normal]rency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DCLG still has a role in assuring 
[normal]Parliament 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]public money it d
[normal]istributes to local g
[normal]overnment is spent properly
[normal]. 
[normal]The Department publishes its Accountability System Statement for local authorities. The statement sets out 
[normal]the regulatory framework that is already in place for local bodies, to reassure Parliament and the public that 
[normal]councils
[normal] are spending their resources properly. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Mystery Shopper scheme also provides a mechanism for redress, as discussed above. Of the 
[normal]143 closed cases involving 
[normal]councils
[normal], 87 resulted in a future or live procurement being adjusted
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transparency is the foundation to local accountability and the key that gives people the tools and information they need to enable them to play a bigger role in society. The 
[normal]Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency
[normal] was issued, in September 2011, to meet the Government’s desire to place more power in citizen’s hands to increase democratic accountability and make it easier for local people to contribute to the local decision making process and help shape public services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Code 
[normal]list
[normal]s
[normal] key data which local authorities 
[normal]are recommended to 
[normal]p
[normal]ublish, including
[normal] information around contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector.
[normal] We recognise
[normal] that there is potential to go further. At the end of last year, we carried out a public consultation on updating the Code and making it mandatory in order to ensure greater accountability. We will publish the Government's response 
[normal]shortly but it is likely to go further on procured goods and services than the current Code provides for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The forthcoming consultation of public sector procurement reforms will also examine the need for further transparency on procurement data. Between the Code and the consultation, councils and the general public will have a clear understanding of what data should be available on procurement.
