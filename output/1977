defaultLocal government spends £58 billion
default per year procuring goods and services. This note sets out how DCLG is 
defaultincentivising
default local government to open up its procurement practices, and become more efficient, transparent and accountable to local communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultSignificant changes have been made to central government procurement, examined recently by the Public Administration Select Committee in their report published on 16 July 2013
default. The principles behind those changes are the ones councils should be adopting, such as eliminating Pre Qualification Questionnaires for low value contracts as discussed on page 6. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn July 2013
default, t
defaulthe Federation for Small Businesses 
defaultpublished research which found 
defaultthat
default councils are transforming their procurement process. Specifically they found that there has been a noticed increase in the number of local authorities who adopt different processes for below EU threshold tenders (85% from 74% in 2012)

defaultThis has been highlighted by the Mystery Shopper Scheme, which is discussed on page 7. 
default&#xa0;

default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn January, with support from Lord Young, we started the ‘Best councils to do business with’ contest. The criteria assessed a council’s overall approach to opening up their procurement practices. 67 strong entries
default were assessed 
defaultby a panel which included industry representation from the 
defaultFederation of Small Businesses
default, Co
defaultnfederation of British Industry
default and British Chambers of Commerce. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe winners were 
defaultannounced on 15 May
default

defaulttheir work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also currently assessing bids for

defaults Transformation Challenge Award. £6.9m will be available to councils who wish to make savings by transforming and sharing their services with others. We expect to see the innovative use of procurement functions to feature strongly in those bids, which will enable us to reward success and promote exemplars
default even further

defaultDCLG, BIS, the Cabinet Office and the Local Government Association have been working together to look at what more councils can do to get best value from their procurement of construction projects.  The government’s industrial strategy for construction was launched on 2nd July
default and sets out how we can work with the construction industry to ensure the 
defaultUK
default continues to thrive in the face of increasing global competition. The strategy includes a commitment for the Local Government Association to establish a construction procurement group and develop a construction procurement strategy for local government by Spring 2014
default&#xa0;
defaultGoverning legislation and recommended practice 
default&#xa0;
defaultCentral government clearly has a role to play in ensuring legislation promotes the procurement principles we advocate, whilst allowing significant freedom and flexibility to allow local practices to be adapted to suit local markets and contracts.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will shortly be undertaking a significant consultation on procurement reforms across the whole public sector, which follow on from Lord Young’s report 
defaultGrowing Your 
defaultBusiness
default. The consultation will focus on some key themes: 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese principles would simplify and standardise the bidding, payment and advertising of contracts, and would remove the complexity, cost and inconsistency when trying to sell to more than one local authority o
defaultr public sector body. This will
default help 
defaultsmall businesses
default access the £230 billion per year that is spent on goods and services across the whole public sector
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore the Department represented local government’s views during the 
default18-months of intensive negotiations between the European Institutions
default on

defaultagreed 
defaultpackage
default 
defaultsupport

default 
defaultour
default priorities of economic growth and deficit reduction by making public procurement faster, less costly, and more effective for business and procurers alike. 
defaultWe are supporting 
defaultCabinet Office 
defaultin
default preparing ambitious plans for early transposition, so 
defaultwe 
defaultcan take advantage of the additional flexibilities in the new rules as soon as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestionsdefault&#xa0;defaultWe have indicated above how DCLG, and central government as a whole, supports and 
defaultincentivises
default further progress in local government procurement. The following material sets our response to the questions asked by the Committee. As indicated, the Department does not intervene in the detail of local authority roles and responsibilities, but we have provided work undertaken in these areas, and examples of best practice for others to aim for.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 1
default&#xa0;
defaultHow procurement is structured in local government varies greatly. The Department is clear that different structures will suit different organisations. However, the ‘Best councils to do business with’ contest highlighted the need for procurement to be discussed at the top table. Each winner showed a clear procurement strategy, supported by council leadership, and linked in to wider strategies around economic development and growth.  For example, Manchester City Council has a Sustainable Procurement Strategy that shows how procurement supports wider objectives of the organisation and provides economic, social and environmental benefits. The London Borough of Harrow has a procurement policy that elevates procurement activity from ‘spend’ to ‘investment in the community’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll strategies should identify the need to work with suppliers at all stages of the process, from pre-market engagement, to 
defaultafter
default the contracts are awarded. They should identify how the council will manage the contract, particularly if it is long-term, to use them as a tool to build relationships with contractors, particularly in 
defaulttheir local markets. Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council awarded a £100 million 10 year contract through their Property Repairs and Improvement Partnership which utilised contract clauses to support social and economic regeneration. This resulted in £6 million being spent in the first year within the local supply chain, with 84% of directly employed personnel residing in 
defaultBarnsley
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo support th
defaultose strategies and th
defaulte wider objectives of procurement functions, DCLG published new Best Value guidance in September 2011
default.  The guidance set out reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with 
defaultproviders, including 
defaultallow
defaulting
default organisations and the community to put forward options on how to reshape the service.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Best Value Guidance is also clear that councils should consider overall value when reviewing service provision. This is complemented by the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 which requires public bodies to consider the economic, social, and environmental impact of their public service contracts at the pre procurement stage, and to consider consulting with service users. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst 
defaultthe Department 
defaultdo
defaultes
default not centrally monitor adherence to these objectives, the Mystery Shopper scheme investigate
defaults
default any complaints about the Act not being applied
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 2
default&#xa0;
defaultSignificant savings can be achieved from collaboration opportunities in procurement. This can either be through a shared service arrangement, or through individual deals, including those supported by central government. 
default&#xa0;defaultConsideration of shared services as a solution must now be automatic, particularly in a field like procurement where successful case studies are plentiful and benefits are relatively easy to gain. So we continue to press local authorities to go further on this agenda. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne example of a shared service approach is Procurement Lincolnshire, which is a partnership between eight councils which has transformed services and improved outcomes for it’s customers. By working together, the partnership delivered £5.1 million in cashable savings in 2012/2013 through procurement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Department agrees that local authorities 
defaultmust
default also take advantage of collaborative deals on specific categories of spend, particularly in high cost service areas. For example six councils around Oxfordshire have worked on jointly commissioning and procuring children’s homes and education services for children with complex needs. At least £2.5 million savings are estimated on the commissioning of 20-30 bed children’s homes and education services. This equates to about 15 per cent of annual cost of high cost residential placements for young people.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring DCLG’s £250 million Weekly Collection Support Scheme a unique opportunity was created for the 82 successful councils to take advantage of joint procurement deals. Many were buying similar goods – wheeled bins and refuse collection vehicles – at a similar time within the thirty month timeframe allowed by the scheme.  Economies of scale would have meant cheaper products for those collaborating. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite a well-attended seminar and subsequent workshops, provided by DCLG with the LGA and other partners, it is felt that authorities did not take sufficient advantage of the procurement opportunity created from the Scheme. Excuses included: working to unique timescales; local sovereignty; and existing contracts, and these were complemented by a lack of understanding of processes and in some cases disinterest – a tunnel vision focused solely on the processes of their local authority. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere local authorities have joined up, the advantages have been obvious. The London Waste and Recycling Board coordinated a joint procurement of food waste caddies and caddy liners. Around 250,000 caddies and 9.5 million liners were procured at a total cost of £460,000. This presented a saving over normal cost prices of 25 per cent. One authority did particularly well and achieved savings of 68 per cent compared to what it would have paid if it had procured alone. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMore examples of councils in receipt of Weekly Collection Support Scheme funding joining up to procure waste-related goods are emerging. The more examples presented to local authorities, the more likely it is that they will see the benefits and follow suit.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn support of this work, an 
defaultannouncement 
defaultwas 
defaultmade on 24 July 
default that central government is creating a new commercial service for Government to act on behalf of the crown to drive savings for the taxpayer and to improve the quality of commercial and procurement acti
defaultvity across the public sector. The Crown Commercial Service 
defaultwill work closely with the wider public sector to ensure that the benefits of aggregation and centralisation are shared to maximise savings for the taxpayer
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore the forthcoming consultation on public sector procurement will also examine how transparent centrally negotiated deals are, and whether further data in this area will encourage greater take up. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 3
default&#xa0;
defaultShared procurement services also provide an opportunity to create centres of expertise and capability, which maximise skills and market knowledge and create resilience, particularly for smaller councils. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government Procurement Service also provide a range of training tools which are available to local government such as the free e-learning hub as well as access to professional procurement qualification packages. The
defaulty
default are at the 
defaultbeginning of a programme to roll out the training originally provided to NHS staff, to all central and local governme
defaultnt procurement/commercial staff
default. The Government Procurement Service have also accepted a few delegates from councils onto the courses aimed at central government officials and are managing levels of demand from local authorities against their current delivery capacity. They envisage an increase in numbers of 
defaultlocal government
default delegates over the next 6 to 12 months. 
defaultThey are also a source of skills, expertise, tools and resources that needs to be 
defaultutilised
default fully by councils.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever the ‘Best Council’ winners showed how procurement skills must also be supported locally, either through professional qualifications, or by mechanisms for sharing best practice or concerns, such as Hertfordshire’s Contract Managers’ Network. More could be done to provide greater peer-support and ownership across local authorities. Whilst there are different opportunities to access to the right skills, there is still a culture of working in isolation that needs to be tackled. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany councils have also identified spend analysis as a key tool. Support in this area is available from a range of sources, from the Government Procurement Service, to consultants, to in-house models. All the ‘Best Council’ winners identified mechanisms for 
defaultanalysing
default expenditure and examining markets. Surrey and 
defaultEast Sussex
default share systems that provide profiles of a supply base and percentage of spend locally, in order to tailor procurement strategies. DCLG is working with the Local Government Association and the Government Procurement Service to examine how similar spend analysis tools could be made more available.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 4
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ability to understand, assess and manage risk is critical to any procurement strategy that aims to reduce bureaucracy, encourage new innovative suppliers and achieve the best outcomes for the community.  The Federation of Small Businesses’ research indicates that councils are increasingly using different approaches to lower value, lower risk contract. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of the winners of the ‘Best Councils’ contest highlighted risk management as a key part of their procurement process. Halton Borough Council have adopted a process that is risk based not value driven, and which subsequently removes the requirement for Pre Qualification Questionnaires on lower value contracts. It makes the process simple and quick, with turn-around possible in 24 hours. They do not rule out suppliers purely on the basis of a credit reference report, they use all the information available to them. This approach has not only resulted in savings, but has also led to 89% of the council’s procurement spend going to small businesses. They also intend to review current supplier relationships over the next year.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst this shows evidence of councils beginning to use risk to tailor tenders to the product and market place, there are still too many examples of over-burdensome selection criteria being applied to low risk contracts, discouraging small businesses from applying and wasting resources for all parties. 
defaultCouncils also need to remove
default unnecessary equality gold-plating, which can push up contract costs and make it 
defaultmore difficult for small and voluntary organisations to bid for contracts
default,
default 
defaultrecommended by 
defaultLord Young, and 
defaultwhich will be examined further in the
default forthcoming publication of the public sector equal
defaultity duty review. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Mystery Shopper Service provide
defaults
default a clear, structured and direct route for suppliers to raise concerns about public procurement practice when attempts at resolving issues with a contracting authority or a first-tier supplier have failed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOf the 155 local authority referrals, 32 related to Pre Qualification Questionnaires. That is why we need to do more to tackle this issue. Pre-qualification is a key theme in the forthcoming consultation on public sector procurement reform and we will act on the responses we receive to find a solution that eliminates unnecessary, disproportionate Pre Qualification Questionnaires. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 5 
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils operate within a robust set of financial regulations which aim to ensure regularity and propriety, as set out in the Department’s 
defaultaccountability system statement. 
defaultCouncils must have a Chief Finance Officer (or section 151 officer) in place who must advise immediately of any illegal spending. Councils must be audited every year by an independent auditor, who looks at the truth and fairness of the council’s financial statements, and their arrangements to achieve value for money. The auditor has the ability to produce a public interest report which examines concerns about at council’s approach to procurement. Recent examples of public interest reports on procurement include Wirral Borough Council’s highways contract, and regeneration schemes in Corby Borough Council.
default&#xa0;
defaultDCLG identified procurement fraud as one of the 50 Ways to Save, as it is estimated to cost local government around £880 million
default a year. 
defaultFighting 
defaultFraud Locally
default, 
defaultthe local governm
defaultent strategy for tackling fraud, was published in April 2012. D
defaulteveloped by local government for local government, it addresses the need for greater prevention an
defaultd smarter enforcement. I
defaultt provides a blueprint for how 
defaultcouncils can reduce their
default risk to fraud, realise cash savings, and work together to prevent future fraud losses
default. DCLG is a member of the Board charged with securing implementation of the strategy. Backed by guidance, case studies, advice on powers and penalties and discussion forums, 
defaultFighting Fraud Locally
default is an important conduit for councils to understand how they can prevent and tackle procurement fraud.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultNational Fraud A
defaultuthority
default is working with a small group of accountancy firms to develop some pilots with local authorities to provide good practice material on tackling procurement fraud
default. DCLG will soon be publishing a short guide setting out a few simple things that every organisation can do to prevent mandate fraud. The Government will also be publishing its response to its consultation on the 
defaultCode of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency
default. This is likely to set out details about information which local authorities must be publishing on forthcoming procurement exercises and contracts that are awarded. Greater transparency should make an important contribution to combating fraud.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 6
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils are accountable for the resources that they spend. Where they contract to other parties they are accountable for ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that the services is delivered, value for money is achieved, and where necessary, put contingency plans in place should the contractor fail to deliver the service.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government
default 
defaultbelieves local 
defaultservices should be accountable to local communities rather than
default 
defaultWhitehall
default.
default It
default 
defaultcontinue
defaults
default to reduce, unnecessary bureaucratic central performance management burdens on local 
defaultg
defaultovernment, at the same time 
defaultit is
default strengthening local accountability measures such as transpa
defaultrency.
default&#xa0;
defaultDCLG still has a role in assuring 
defaultParliament 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic money it d
defaultistributes to local g
defaultovernment is spent properly
default. 
defaultThe Department publishes its Accountability System Statement for local authorities. The statement sets out 
defaultthe regulatory framework that is already in place for local bodies, to reassure Parliament and the public that 
defaultcouncils
default are spending their resources properly. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Mystery Shopper scheme also provides a mechanism for redress, as discussed above. Of the 
default143 closed cases involving 
defaultcouncils
default, 87 resulted in a future or live procurement being adjusted
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTransparency is the foundation to local accountability and the key that gives people the tools and information they need to enable them to play a bigger role in society. The 
defaultCode of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency
default was issued, in September 2011, to meet the Government’s desire to place more power in citizen’s hands to increase democratic accountability and make it easier for local people to contribute to the local decision making process and help shape public services.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Code 
defaultlist
defaults
default key data which local authorities 
defaultare recommended to 
defaultp
defaultublish, including
default information around contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector.
default We recognise
default that there is potential to go further. At the end of last year, we carried out a public consultation on updating the Code and making it mandatory in order to ensure greater accountability. We will publish the Government's response 
defaultshortly but it is likely to go further on procured goods and services than the current Code provides for.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe forthcoming consultation of public sector procurement reforms will also examine the need for further transparency on procurement data. Between the Code and the consultation, councils and the general public will have a clear understanding of what data should be available on procurement.
