"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Lawrence Lomax (CYS0005)\nThank you for the opportunity to contribute, its greatly appreciated.\n1.)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIs cycling safe, yes largely, but the perception is no.  \n2.)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe perception \nas always \nis a little more complicated, some mornings while commuting I \nthink yes it is safe, but when\n you have a bad experience \nand if you cycle for any length of time\n you’ll have a few\n, \nit quickly becomes a no. When you\n are \no\nn\n a bike you are a lot weaker than a car or truck, so when you have that bad experience it’s a\nn\n unfair contest the cyclist always l\noses. \nCyclist are\n weaker, slower and more exposed. \n3.)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI have been cycling for a number of years now so am quite used to the road conditions, \nI \nrecently had a terrifying experience, \nroad\n rage driver wanted me out the way, narrow road. I went to the police to \nreport this. Complete waste of time, the police said they would not even consider looking into this, no\nt\n \ninterest\ned\n .\n So what do I do, get back on the road knowing there is nothing not even the law protecting me?\n4.)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat should be done\n4.1) Safe infrastructur\ne, the Highway code, item 63 states use the cycle lane “ they can make your journey safer” so how is it a lot/mos\nt\n of cycle lanes are designed to offer no safety benefit at all. As I stated above the cyclist is the one who will lose, it really does not mat\nter \nwho’s\n fault it the \ncyclist who\n suffers. \n4.2)\n \nMixing HGV’s and cyc\nlist \nis\n down\nright silly. HGV’s are designed to be used on motorways and have too many blind spots for use in amongst city traffic, it unfair on the driver and bike.  \nSimply a stupid idea\n.\n4.3) The Police need to take safety seriously, is it a funding issue or a cultural issue?  As cyclist could benefit from training the police should be educated into the challenges and faults in the system cyclist are exposed to. From my experience I will\n never waste my time reporting dangerous driving again. Which I know this is not helping, but it’s a waste of time. Every time the police come out with few day long operations and fiddle around the edges ignoring the Elephant in the room the real safety is\nsues they lose credibility, yes the situation is complex \nbut  challenge\n they face.\n5.)\n              \nIt’s easy to play the blame game, drivers should do this, cyclist that, helmets, ear phone, car radios, tinted window, \netc, \nnone of which is going to resolve the fundame\nntal issue, which is cyclist are weaker \nand need space and the law need to been seen to work, not as one off and not one sided.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
