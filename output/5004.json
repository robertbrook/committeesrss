"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Jerusalem Foundation&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Jerusalem Foundation&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe vital necessity to work toward peace in Jerusalem&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Jerusalem Foundation’s Approach&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA. Education. We \nbelieve strongly in the importance of improving educational opportunities to improve the future for Palestinian residents of Jerusalem. Thus, the Foundation supports numerous ini\ntiatives such as learning centres, professional development for teachers and educators, and more.\n \nThe Evaluation report\n3\n noted that it is key to expand the target population of those involved in peace-building activities to include the mainstream in order \nto broaden its support.\n \nFor this reason the Foundation is also involved in projects such as \nLanguage as a Cultural Bridge\n,\n the \nLiving in Jerusalem Advanced Civics Course\n, the \nErna D. Leir Peace Kindergarten\n and the \nMax Rayne Hand in Hand School for Bilingu\nal Education\n. \nP\nrojects such as \nMICHA\n and the \nHattie Friedland School for the Deaf\n \nprovide vital services for both Jews and Arabs, and are able to bridge cultural gaps through this service provision\n. \nB. Community Development in Palestinian Community. We \nrecognise the importance of services for the Palestinian community in everyday life, especially given its dire socio-economic situation. The Foundation has been instrumental in establishing and supporting community centres and facilities throughout the cit\ny, most significantly in \nWadi Joz, Beit Safafa \nand the\n Muslim Quarter of the Old City\n. We have \nalso aided \nhealth and welfare service providers \nin\n deliver\ning\n necessary care\n, such as in the construction and expansion of the \nSheikh Jarrach Medical Centre, \nand\n in ongoing support for the\n Elderly Services Centre in the Old City.\nC. Developing Agents of Change. \nIn order to systematically advance peace on the ground it is critical to develop agents of change. Two of the Jerusalem Foundation’s \nmajor\n projects in this area are the \nJerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC)\n and the \nAdam Institute for Democracy and Pe\nace.\nD. Rights Advocacy. \nEnabling Palestinian residents to access their legal and social rights is of utmost importance in paving the way for a \npeaceful future in the region. Two examples of important projects, initiated by the Jerusalem Foundation together with its partners, are the  \nAtta’a Assistance Centre for the Rights of East Jerusalem Residents\n and \nGrey Action (Council for the Rights of the\n Elderly).\n&#xa0;\nThe appendix attached describes examples of our work, together with a large number of partners, over the past 48 years. We have seen that little by little, we have the ability to effect lasting change. With additional long-term support from veteran and new partners from around the world, we can do much, much more to advance peace in Jerusalem.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nB.
