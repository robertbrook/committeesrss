[normal]John Thorp – Written evidence[bold]Response on the rights of way reforms (clauses 12-18 &amp; schedule 6) by the Natural England Stakeholder Working Group on unrecorded rights of way 
[normal]Summary[bold]The context for the rights of way reforms is the 2026 cut-off date enacted by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, under which unrecorded pre-1949 rights of way will be extinguished at this date. The Government’s stated aim at the time of the 2000 Act was to provide assistance to bring about completion of the definitive map and statement (the local authority's legal record of public rights of way) by the cut-off date. In 2008, Natural England and 
[normal]Defra
[normal] concluded that the existing processes in this area are too complex and unwieldy to permit the forced completion of the definitive map and statement by 2026. That year, Natural England formed the Stakeholder Working Group and challenged its members to work together to develop a balanced package of deregulatory reforms.
[normal]The resulting 
[normal]report
[normal], published in March 2010, contains 32 proposals for simplifying and streamlining the rights of way policy and legislative framework. It is a coherent blueprint for reforms that will deliver real benefit to all involved – land managers and businesses, users, and local authorities. Moving away from the convoluted and adversarial style of the current regime, and towards a simpler set of processes with more room for local negotiation, has been a key driver behind the Group’s thinking.  As the report makes clear, the Group feels strongly that the changes it advocates are a cohesive package. Any partial implementation of its recommendations would unbalance the position, and damage the consensus behind the proposals. The proposals have since been broadly endorsed though 
[normal]public consultation
[normal] and those that require primary legislation now form clauses in the draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]The Stakeholder Working Group would be pleased to provide a small delegation to appear before the Joint Committee to give evidence and we strongly suggest that the Committee takes up this offer.
