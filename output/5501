defaultWritten evidence by the International Primate Protection LeaguedefaultMy name is Shirley McGreal and I have been working for the protection of primates for 41 years and directing a primate sanctuary.  I am writing your committee 
defaulton behalf of the International Primate Protection League and its 14,000 members around the world, including 
defaultmany in 
defaultthe United Kingdom. 
defaultSummary:default The International Primate Protection League has opposed the pet trade in primates since its founding in 1973, 
defaultwherever the practice occurs. The trade is 
defaultappalling and 
defaultspecies-destructive if the animals sold as pets are wild-caught and cruel if they are born in captivity. 
defaultWe urge your committee to bring the UK pet trade in primates to an end.

defaulty monkeys
default destined 
defaultfor the pet trade, when born in captivity, are removed from their mothers soon after birth. I have video of the removal of a baby gibbon from his mother at a facility in Texas. First the father was separated from his mate and baby. Next the owner of the pl
defaultace started shooting darts at the mother who flew around the cage defecating in panic. Finally a dart hit the mother and the next thing one saw was the baby, wrapped in an orange blanket, being paraded around at a shopping mall.

defaultThis action was cruel and
default it’s the same with other primate species. From the moment of being removed from his or her mother, the baby monkey
default is 
defaultsold 
defaultby animal dealers 
defaultto humans who think that having a baby monkey will be fun. 
defaultMany of the purchasers call themselves “monkey moms” as
default if the monkey emerged from their bodies! Baby monkeys
default attract attention when taken out.

defaultBaby monkeys have a terrible time 
defaultconforming 
defaultto human expectations.
default They often 
defaultare forced to 
defaultwear diapers with holes cut for their tails and some even have their tails removed. As infants they delight their owners
default who often befriend each other
default.

defaultMost purchasers have no clue about primate nutrition with a frequent result be
defaulting rickets or other sicknesses, including stress. Many due young.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe fun for the human being dwindles as the 
default“cute” pet grows up and develops canine teeth that can inflict serious injuries on “owners” and anyone they can get close to. 
defaultLast week, in Ohio
default, 
defaultUSA, 
defaulta two year old baby spider monkey was killed after biting a human who put his hand through the window of the car the owner was driving.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen the “owner” wearies of his once-cute pet, he/she often tries to find sanctuary space which is hard to find 
defaultas most primate sanctuaries are over-crowded and under-funded.
defaultFor all these and other reasons, the International Primate Protection League hopes that the UK trade in pet primates will be brought to an end. Thank you for your consideration of our input.
