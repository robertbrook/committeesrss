[normal]Written evidence from [bold]P[bold]hilippe[bold] S[bold]ands[bold] QC[bold]Professor of Law, University College London[bold]Matrix Chambers, London[bold] (PCD 03)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Given the commitment made by the Foreign Secretary in March 2011, how can progress be made on enshrining in law the necessity of consulting Parliament on military action?
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](A) [bold]Iraq [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]notes the opinion of the Attorney General
[normal] that, Iraq having failed to comply and Iraq being at the time of Resolution 1441 and continuing to be in material breach, the authority to use force under Resolution 678 has revived and so continues today
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]This impl
[normal]i
[normal]ed 
[normal]that the Attorney General had 
[normal]offered s
[normal]uch an opinion
[normal],
[normal] and had done so 
[normal]without caveat. 
[normal]The publication of the full legal 
[normal]advice 
[normal]in April 2005 confirmed that the document offered to the house two years earlier as 
[normal]an 
[normal]‘unequivocal’
[normal] 
[normal]statement
[normal] that the war would be legal 
[normal]was in fact nothing of the sort
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](B) [bold]Syria [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable
[normal]”
[normal]. 
[normal]When I first saw the doc
[normal]ument I noted that it 
[normal]purported
[normal] to set out “the UK Government’s position”, that it was unsigned, and that it made no reference to any advice or op
[normal]inion or ‘view’ of the Attorney-
[normal]General. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] the Attorney 
[normal]General
[normal] makes 
[normal]available to Parliament
[normal], or to a Committee of Parliament, the full legal advice he has offered the Government
[normal];
[normal](ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Parliament 
[normal](or a Committee of Parliament) obtains
[normal] its own legal advice as to the legality of any military action
[normal], from an independent source; 
[normal](iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]individual Members of Parliament obtain legal advice from such independent sources as they consider appropriate.
