[[[&#xa0;]]]Further to your letter of 23 October 2013, I am enclosing hyperlinks to HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ published data on each of the three taxes identified by the National Audit Office (NAO), namely Stamp Duty Land Tax, Inheritance Tax and Capital Gains Tax.&#xa0;Published estimates of Exchequer receipts from 1999-2000 to 2012-13 split between the four countries in the UK for individual taxes including IHT, CGT and SDLT are available on the HMRC website at: http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/receipts/disagg-stats.pdf with further details about the methodologies used at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/receipts/disagg-method.pdf. &#xa0;The data we publish for each tax is slightly different, depending on the tax and below are the relevant links by tax.

[[[ Tax (SDLT)]]]HMRC publishes property data based on SDLT returns in three main publications:(http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/stamp-duty/stamp-tax-sep13.pdf)&#xa0;The first two publications are based on the date the property transaction was completed, whereas the third is based upon the date HMRC issued an SDLT certificate (i.e. after a correct return was received).&#xa0;

[[[Inheritance Tax (IHT)]]]Our latest published estimate for the number of estates passing on death in Scotland with IHT liabilities is around 1,000 for 2010-11 deaths. This estimate has been published on the HMRC website at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/inheritance/table12-11.pdf. Although we have not published any regional estimates for the values of IHT reliefs/exemptions, HMRC’s latest UK-wide estimates of some of the main IHT reliefs/exemptions for estates passing on death in 2010-11 are published at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/inheritance/table12-2.pdf. This is where the net estate value before reliefs and exemptions are applied is potentially high enough to result in IHT liabilities.&#xa0;

[[[Capital Gains Tax (CGT)]]]The latest published tables for information on individuals and trusts with Capital Gains were published on 31 October at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/capital-gains-tax/table14-5.pdf. For the first time these included estimates of the number of taxpayers liable to CGT, amounts of Capital Gains on their disposals, and CGT liabilities by UK country and English region. Unlike the estimates for receipts published at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/receipts/disagg-stats.pdf the liability estimates were only for individuals, and the contribution from trusts was omitted. The published liability estimates also omitted any liabilities which were not reported via the self assessment system although this would only amount to a few million pounds.&#xa0;I hope you and other members of the Committee find this helpful.&#xa0;January 2014
