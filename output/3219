[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.  My Aims[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I am writing as an individual, and one of many,  who would like to live in a rural community, but who is unable to do so for lack of acce
[normal]ss to land whereupon I might be allowed to build a modest dwelling and create my income from that land.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would wish to join forces with others as a co-operative of some description,  in order to buy a woodland with a view to:

[normal]managing the wood
[normal]land for timber, wildlife and 
[normal]fuelwood
[normal] 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]creating a forest garden (food security using perennial woodland and fruiting plants)
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]building our  own houses using the resources of the woodland and the local community to high environmental standards (

[normal]strawbale
[normal] and such like)
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]creating businesses using the resources of the woodland and local community (willow basketry, mushroom farming, market gardening, orchard and berry fruit, cottage food industries, 
[normal]beekeeping, 
[normal]arts and crafts and such like
[normal]-

[normal]hancing the attractions for tourists (woodland walks and bike tra
[normal]ils, activity days for families)
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]enhancing the facilities and attractions for the local community (educational and volunteering opportunities, forest schools, craft workshops and such like)
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]providing work opportunities and training for local youth 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many of these ideas are familiar and have proven exciting and successful 
[normal]opportunities for community-
[normal]owned woodlands, but in order for rural communities to remain sustainable, multi-generational 
[normal]populations and facilities
[normal] are urgently required.  Housing remains a major problem with rural populations ageing, schools closing and along with them the social f
[normal]abric as facilities dwindle (doctors &amp; dentists, shops, libraries, banks, post-offices, bus services etc 
[normal]etc
[normal]).
[normal]  Meanwhile, 
[normal]crofting
[normal] lands are increasingly abandoned and unproductive as their tenants age.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  The land-ownership pattern is sustained and rei[bold]nforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements in [bold]anumber[bold] of ways:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Subsidy and tax advantages inflate land values, which limits new entrants,
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The use of land as an investment vehicle rewards speculation and inhibits innovation
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Subsidy and tax advantages ensure the price of land is divorced from its productive value,  which rewards inertia and inhibits sustainable development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  A Land Agency should
[normal] function to
[normal] enforce and proactively enable Land Reform
[normal] with a view to increasi
[normal]ng productivity, biodiversity, community buy-outs, community owned energy projects and liberating abandoned croft lands, assisting planning permissions for new builds on croft lands, creating new croft and woodland crofts as well as helping newcomers throu
[normal]gh the process of finding and purchasing land and self-build planning.
