[normal]Written evidence submitted[bold] by [bold]UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres (CLC0069)[bold]I write in response to the discussion during the oral evidence session on 9 October 2013 within the 
[normal]inquiry 
[normal]‘Climate: Public understanding and policy implications’. My points relate to the Members’ discussion around the need for trusted mechanisms (a porta
[normal]l) to engage the public with climate science, and if such a mechanism existed. I believe it does, and I outline below the nature of this 
[normal]trusted portal which currently engages 20 million people every year in both cities and rural locations across the UK.

[normal]---------------------------------------------------------
[normal]The 
[normal]UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres
[normal] brings together over 60 of the UK’s 
[normal]major 
[normal]science engagement organisations, including science and disc
[normal]overy centres, national 
[normal]science 
[normal]museums, en
[normal]vironment centres 
[normal]and 
[normal]learned societies. Together, these trusted centres 
[normal]attract over 20
[normal] million 
[normal]visitors each year who 
[normal]take time to explore and delve into science in a hands-on, intriguing and personal way. 
[normal]The Association’s c
[normal]entres span all regions and c
[normal]ountries of the UK and reach into a huge number
[normal] of ‘hard to reach’ communities. They 
[normal]collectively
[normal] 
[normal]engage over 2
[normal] million
[normal] 
[normal]school students from a range of socio-economic 
[normal]backgrounds
[normal],
[normal] who take part in science workshops, 
[normal]discussions, 
[normal]labs and 
[normal]science 
[normal]events.
[normal]Th
[normal]e subjects
[normal] covered by the science and discovery centres 
[normal]range from climate 
[normal]science to
[normal] 
[normal]space science
[normal] and 
[normal]from 
[normal]nanoscience to brain science. However, it is clear to all 
[normal]professionals working within 
[normal]the 
[normal]field of science engagement
[normal] that there is no greater 
[normal]immediate need, nor indeed any greater challenge,
[normal] than to engage people effectively
[normal] and widely
[normal] on the subject of climate science - and to do this very soon.
[normal]The UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres, with its [bold]vibrant and trusted [bold]national infrast[bold]ructure and thousands of [bold]professional [bold]science engagement[bold] specialists [bold]could [bold]play a major role in helping people in all parts of the UK to engage with the latest climate science, and get people talking about the UK’s policy response[bold]. 
[normal]These 
[normal]lively 
[normal]science 
[normal]ce
[normal]ntres 
[normal]already operate 
[normal]successfully 
[normal]and sustainably 
[normal]in this 
[normal]engagement 
[normal]sphere; they are embedded in their local communities with excellent 
[normal]relationships with university science, industrial partners
[normal], schools, teachers and families.
[normal] Indeed, the work they curr
[normal]ently do is 
[normal]valued highly enough by
[normal] 
[normal]families, schools, teachers and the wider public 
[normal]that in most 
[normal]cities
[normal], 
[normal]people
[normal] 
[normal]pay to 
[normal]visit
[normal], 
[normal]and visit repeatedly.
[normal] 
[normal]Science and Discovery Centres 
[normal]are experts in 
[normal]both 
[normal]engagement, 
[normal]and in science. 
[normal]Indeed, it
[normal] is their raison d’être and their charitable mission. They are staffed by talented creative individuals with 
[normal]considerable 
[normal]expertise in all areas of 
[normal]the 
[normal]science
[normal]s
[normal], 
[normal] as well as
[normal] 
[normal]communications
[normal], design, 
[normal]education
[normal], marketing, the arts and 
[normal]more.
[normal] 
[normal]The majority of 
[normal]ASDC member centres (from At-Bristol to the Eden Project, and from W5 in Belfast to the Science Museum in London) have already invested significantly in programmes and exhibitions to engage their publics with climate science. These range from lively evenin
[normal]g events
[normal] 
[normal]for adults, workshops for schools, family shows and 
[normal]carbon 
[normal]competitions right through to full hands-on climate exhibitions and formal dialogue events 
[normal]in partnership with
[normal] ASDC and Sciencewise. They include content in all areas of climate science fr
[normal]om earth observation to the latest low carbon innovations
[normal] and engineering
[normal]. 
[normal]The following gives some examples of the poten
[normal]tial
[normal] science centres 
[normal]have 
[normal]to reach people in all parts of the UK and what could be achieved if these were focussed on climate science.
[normal]  Glasgow Science Centre attracts 
[normal]280,000 people each year of whom 90,000 (32%) are school students brought by their teachers
[normal] 
[normal]to take part in targeted curriculum-linked science workshops and activities
[normal]. Thinktank, Birmingham’s Science Centre attracts 
[normal]260,0
[normal]00 people
[normal] annually
[normal], 
[normal]of whom 
[normal]78,000 
[normal]are 
[normal]school students
[normal] taking part in science workshops and discussions. Family and 
[normal]leisure visitors
[normal] at Thinktank take part
[normal] in 
[normal]science shows, sleepovers, story-telling, 
[normal]meet the scientist 
[normal]and 
[normal]lab
[normal]-based
[normal] workshops
[normal]. This patter
[normal]n is replicated up and down the country
[normal] - 385,000 people visit ASDC member centres every week of the year.
[normal]The key to what science and discovery centres 
[normal]do
[normal] is to start where their public is, and to take them on a journey rather than to impose upon them wha
[normal]t someone feels they should know. Science centres 
[normal]offer 
[normal]families, 
[normal]adults
[normal] and school children
[normal] unusual 
[normal]and exciting 
[normal]opportunities 
[normal]to explore, discover, question
[normal], test and experiment
[normal] on the world around them. 
[normal]The aim is not simply to fill people with facts, b
[normal]ut to take them on a journey to spark their curiosity
[normal] and
[normal] to encourage them to continue asking questions about
[normal] the
[normal] world
[normal] 
[normal]long after they leave our centres. 
[normal]It is clear 
[normal]that 
[normal]the network of UK science and discovery centres and museums could mobilise in a 
[normal]national way to get people across the UK interested and involved in climate science
[normal] and to start asking questions about what we collectively should be doing about it
[normal]. Indeed ASDC already runs national programmes in this way, for example the current ‘Explor
[normal]e Your Universe’ Programme in partnership with the Science and Technologies 
[normal]Facilities C
[normal]ouncil (STFC). Ho
[normal]wever to make a national climate change 
[normal]programme 
[normal]highly 
[normal]effective it needs to be carefully 
[normal]more carefully 
[normal]constructed
[normal] than any other
[normal]. 
[normal]Climate change 
[normal]creates a specific issue in that most people in the UK have considered it at some level, and many have an entrenched position on it. That makes the issues of trust key, and that is in part why I write. Science and discovery centres and museums are trusted 
[normal]voices and environments. They are not arms of Government, they are local, and are always on the side of the visitors. 
[normal]Our approach would be to 
[normal]work with the fields of behavioural psychology, health and social psychology and environmental psychology all 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]who
[normal]m
[normal] have expertise 
[normal]that would shape what we did. In addition we would want to bring together all we collectively and internationally know about behaviour change and 
[normal]game theory, cognitive dissonance and delayed gratification
[normal], all of which have a bearing 
[normal]on 
[normal]why people do and do not 
[normal]choose
[normal] to change
[normal]. Much too is to be learned from all the 
[normal]academic and grey literature 
[normal](formal published non-academic reports) 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]behaviour change in 
[normal]seat belts, drink-driving, 
[normal]smoking, pensions and healthy 
[normal]living. All of 
[normal]this ne
[normal]eds to be applied to any future discussions on climate change.
[normal] Likewise, 
[normal]we would see it important for people to explore
[normal] the process of science and how 
[normal]we get to a point where most scientists agree
[normal], as well as 
[normal]opening up the 
[normal]the mistaken assumption that 
[normal]mo
[normal]st of us have that 
[normal]humans act rationally
[normal].
[normal]We would 
[normal]also 
[normal]want to look at innovative and experimental programmes
[normal] and what 
[normal]has worked
[normal]. F
[normal]or example ‘global conversations’ run by W5, the 
[normal]Belfast science centre
[normal], wh
[normal]ere 
[normal]pupils and teachers from Northern Ireland an
[normal]d Republic of Ireland formed cluster groups with students in Ghana and Ethiopia and shared information on their views on climate change and sustainability 
[normal]and how it affects them
[normal].
[normal] We would also look at the myriad of successful examples from Bristol, a European leader in sustainability and green innovation and communications. Indeed Bristol is the first UK city to win the title of ‘Green Capital of Europe’ which it will host in 2015
[normal] because of its leadership in this area
[normal] and because it has very high city wide rates of indicators such as cycling behaviours.
[normal]As a note, The 
[normal]UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres
[normal] 
[normal]also sees it as vital that people in all parts of the UK have open access to the very latest climate information and evidence. 
[normal]Sir Mark Walport, Chief Science Advisor 
[normal]is therefore visiting a number of UK science and discovery centres 
[normal]to 
[normal]share the latest
[normal] cl
[normal]imate science evidence and policy with
[normal] 
[normal]the public and school students
[normal] so they can hear it first hand.
[normal] 
[normal]As a nation
[normal] and as a global society we have some 
[normal]major
[normal] challenges ahead. 
[normal]Addressing these challenges will require both scientific entrepreneurship and fu
[normal]ndamental societal engagement and change
[normal] and we feel we can help in this
[normal]. 
[normal]We need our young people t
[normal]o be confident to experiment and innovate
[normal] 
[normal]with science, technology and engineering and
[normal] 
[normal]to become trail-blazers 
[normal]for a lower carbon future. 
[normal]We need our adult 
[normal]population to
[normal] better understand the sciences, encouraging them to examine evidence and
[normal] lobby for the policy changes needed for a 
[normal]bright 
[normal]low carbon future.
[normal] 
[normal]We need to 
[normal]help people to find the 
[normal] delight of 
[normal]exploring
[normal] the world around us
[normal] 
[normal]whilst
[normal] 
[normal]reducing our foot
[normal]print on it
