"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Royal Academy of Engineering (ESA018)Introduction &#xa0;The Royal Academy of Engineering is pleased to submit evidence to the House of\n \nCommons \nScience and Technology Select Committee i\nnquiry into the \nEuropean and UK Space Agencies. \nThis response has been prepared following consultation with a\n \nnumber of our Fellows with expertise in this area, both in industry and academia.\n&#xa0;\nKey points: \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;ESA funding: strengths &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nESA funding: weaknesses&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhilst \nESA has been effective in \nfunding\n academics,\n \nt\nhe UK is currently a hub \nof innovative\n,\n small space\n-\nrelated companies and \nSMEs\n \nthat\n are not yet supported b\ny ESA.\n&#xa0;\nIt is well known that \ngrowth \ncan stem\n from \nSMEs;\n therefore, it \nis recommended t\nhat ESA should cons\nider directing funding to SMEs \nworking \nin the space sector\n. \nD\nirecting funding to SMEs \nmay\n be easier if operated independently \nwithin the UK rather than via ESA\n. \n&#xa0;\nESA organisation and work: strengths &#xa0;\n&#xa0;ESA organisation and work: weaknesses&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe \nappropriate relationship depends on the \nrespective roles of \nESA, EU and UK\n. \nESA is a pan-European research and development \n(R&amp;D) \norganisation whereas the EU and UK have a broader interest in the use of space to benefit the European citizen. Any governance regime must acknowledge \nthese differing\n roles and the tensions \nbetween them\n, for example \nan R&amp;D organisation \nis likely to \naim to \ndrive\n technology forward whereas an operational organisation will \nfocus \nmore on minimising costs and schedules. \n&#xa0;\nA\n model that has worked well in \nthe past, such as for \nGalileo\n,\n is where the EU gathers requirements and \nutilises\n \nESA as the procurement agency to procure a system that meets EU’s requirements. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe EU’s framework programmes \nare somewhat slow, with the result that they fail \nto b\ne useful on many aspects of R&amp;D. On average, it\n takes 12-24 \nmonths between coming up with a concept\n and starting a FP7 project. Combining this with the need \nto involve several countries \nmeans that the programmes are not the best way of\n producing competitive commercial products.\n&#xa0;\nInclusion of \nthe \nGlobal Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES)\n \nin \nMulti-Annual Financial Framework (MAFF) \nis welcomed and will \nbring stability to the funding for \nthe \nGMES.\n&#xa0;\nWe \nwould like to \nhighlight again the potential of \nSMEs\n to increase innovation in the space sector\n, which would benefit greatly from \nmore \ndirect EU \nand ESA \nsupport. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The UK space agency generally performs well and is supportive of industry\n; however, its achievements are \noften hampered \nbecause the majority of \nits funding is committed to be\ning\n spent via ESA. The UK stands out as \nan \nanomaly amongst the ‘big 4’ European space \nsector\n nations. In contrast with France, Germany and Italy, who all have a large national programme as well as being major contributors to ESA, the UK has a relatively small national programme. France, Germany and Italy use their \nlarge national programmes\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe UK is regularly approached by other nations \nto \nundertake bilateral missions \non \na ‘no exchange of funds’ basis\n. \nPresently, t\nhe UK does not have significant funding available for these activities\n,\n \npreventing \nthe UK \nfrom taking\n part \nin more \ninternational collaboration\ns. It is \nrecommended that \nincreasing \nthe size of \nand improving the current \nUK national programme will \nfoster more collaboration between the \nUK \nand other key nations in the space sector. \n&#xa0;\nThere is an absence of a \nwell-defined\n space engineering (as opposed to science) research programme in the UK universities. \nThere is a need for a \nnational programme\n \nand\n,\n as part of this\n,\n \nmore low TRL academic research as well as high TRL SME R&amp;D.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is agreed \nthat \nthe \nUK gets good value \nfor money \nfrom\n its membership of ESA for\n large programmes where \nthe \nUK generally finances at GDP proportion (~17%) \nand\n \ngains\n full access to all mission data. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Academy \nrefers the committee\n to \nits\n 2013 report titled \nExtreme space weather: impacts on engineered systems and infrastructure\n. A summary report\n is also available.\n&#xa0;\nThe report identifies and explores in considerable depth the\n consequences \nof \nspace weather events on \nthe electricity grid,\n \nsatellites, avionics, air passengers, signals from satellite navigation\n \nsystems, mobile telephones and more. \nFocusing on the UK\n, it assesses \nthe resilience to \nspace weather \nevents\n on a variety of engineered systems and identifies ways to prepare and mitigate for such events. \n&#xa0;\nThe study demonstrated that solar superstorms are indeed a\n \nrisk to the UK’s \ni\nnfrastru\ncture. \nWith respect to satellites and the services that depend on them, the report made the following conclusions:\n&#xa0;\nSome satellites may be exposed to environments in excess of typical specification levels, so increasing microelectronic upset rates and creating electrostatic charging hazards. Because of the multiplicity of satellite designs in use today there is considerable uncertainty in the overall behaviour of the fleet but experience from more modest storms indicates that a degree of disruption to satellite services must be anticipated. Fortunately the conservative nature of spacecraft designs and their diversity is expected to limit the scale of the problem. Our best engineering judgement\n \nis that up to 10% of satellites could experience\n \ntemporary outages lasting hours to days as a result of the extreme\n \nevent, but it is unlikely that these outages will be spread evenly\n \nacross the fleet since some satellite designs and constellations\n \nwould inevitably prove more vulnerable than others. In addition,\n \nthe significant cumulative radiation doses would be expected to\n \ncause rapid ageing of many satellites. Very old satellites might\n \nbe expected to start to fail in the immediate aftermath of the\n \nstorm while new satellites would be expected to survive the event\n \nbut with higher risk thereafter from incidence of further (more\n \ncommon) storm events. Consequently, after an extreme storm, all\n \nsatellite owners and operators will need to carefully evaluate the\n \nneed for replacement satellites to be launched earlier than planned\n \nin order to mitigate the risk of premature.\n&#xa0;\nIt highly recommends a\n UK Space Weather Board should be initiated within\n \ngovernment to provide overall leadership of UK space\n \nweather activities: observations and measurements, operational services, research and related technology developments. \nIn regard to the latter\n \nthe board should, through its leadership, support and facilitate\n \nthe UK space sector to enable it to respond to ESA and other\n \nspace environment missions.\n&#xa0;\nThe Academy \nwould also like to \nrefer the committee to its 2010 consultation response to the inquiry on \nScientific advice and evidence in emergencies\n.\n \nThe response \nhighlights the importance of international coordination in preparing for and reacting to emergencies\n involving space weather events\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nSpace weather sensors and predictions are an\n \ninternational endeavour; moreover the impact of extreme solar storms will be global.\n \nRealistically, the US will be a focus for space weather monitoring and notification as\n \nUS society and defence are highly reliant on space assets. The US electricity\n \nnetwork is also located at a higher geomagnetic latitude than the UK system making\n \nit more susceptible to such events. ESA has the remit\n \nto provide the civilian focus for solar storm monitor\ning and space weather in Europe \nand will develop high level links into the US programme. \n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nExtreme space weather: impacts on engineered systems and infrastructure\n \nA report reviewing the impacts of space weather on engineered systems and infrastructure (February 2013)\n&#xa0;\n \nExtreme space weather: impacts on engineered systems and infrastructure (\nSummary report)\n(February 2013)\n&#xa0;\n \nScientific Advice and Evidence in Emergencies\nThe Royal Academy of Engineering response to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee\n&#xa0;\n (September 2010) \nhttp://www.raeng.org.uk/societygov/policy/responses/pdf/Response_to_Scientific_advice_evidence_emergencies.pdf\n \n&#xa0;\n"
