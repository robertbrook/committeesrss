[[[Written evidence submitted by Promega UK Ltd (FSS042)]]]&#xa0;Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;NOTE: This list is not intended to be definitive and other chemistries may also be in use in these countries. &#xa0;France is currently using PowerPlex 18D for database samples and PowerPlex 21 for casework.  Spain will be implementing PowerPlex Fusion in the near future for casework and database samples. Belgium is already using European NGC STR systems and are considering moving to a global kit (such as PowerPlex Fusion or GlobaFiler) in the near future. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Declaration of interests:The Authors are employed by Promega UK, a supplier of reagents to the forensic community and a competitor to Life Technologies, the current sole supplier of STR Chemistry loadable to the National DNA Database.  &#xa0;References [1]  http://www.npia.police.uk/en/8934.htm  Accessed 3rd Jan 2013[2] P.
