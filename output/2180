defaultLaw Commission – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultExecutive Summary
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principal matters arising from the evidence of the Law Commission (“the Commission”) may be summarised as follows:
default&#xa0;
default(1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Law Commission (“the Commission”) shares the objectives of Government to make the law more accessible and to remove obsolete legislation from the statute book.
default&#xa0;
default(2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commission has a statutory duty under section 3(1) of the Law Commissions Act 1965 to keep under review all the law of England and Wales with a view, inter alia, to the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments. Since 1965 it has promoted the repeal of over 3000 statutes and many thousands of other provisions.
default&#xa0;
default(3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn performing this work, the Commission has considerable experience and expertise, is able to employ a fast track Parliamentary procedure and has the trust of Parliament.
default&#xa0;
default(4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Triennial Review of the Commission concluded in July 2013 that it is essential that the Law Commission, an expert, independent body, should continue to perform this function
default&#xa0;
default(5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe powers proposed in clauses 50-57, 62 and schedule 16 of the Bill duplicate the provisions in the Law Commissions Act 1965 and do not provide the advantages of the Commission’s statute law repeal procedure. 
default&#xa0;
default(6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Commission is deeply concerned at the impact of being a statutory 
defaultconsultee
default.  It could not perform this role adequately and continue with its own repeal work.
default&#xa0;
default(7)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the specialist nature of statute law repeal work, the importance of accuracy and the need to have an in depth understanding of the consequences of repeal, the Commission proposes that the better course for primary legislation would be to adapt and improve the existing Statute Law Repeal procedure to meet changing needs.
default&#xa0;
default(8)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis would not require legislative change, would be more cost effective and provide legal certainty. 
default&#xa0;
default(9)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is preferable that the repeal of primary legislation be achieved by the existing Statute Law Repeal procedure employing an Act of Parliament as opposed to Ministerial powers.
default&#xa0;
default(10)
default 
defaultThere already exist alternative mechanisms for the repeal of secondary legislation. For this reason the Commission does not currently focus on secondary legislation. It would not be able to perform adequately the role of statutory 
defaultconsultee
default in relation to secondary legislation within existing resources.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe evidence ends with answers to certain specific questions posed by the Committee.

default&#xa0;
defaultQuestions specifically raised by the CommitteedefaultQ10  Is
default a new “power to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe existing statutory powers in the Law Commissions Act 1965 and in the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament enable the Commission (and the Scottish Law Commission) to recommend the repeal of obsolete legislation.  These powers have been exercised regularly over the past 48 years to produce 19 Statute Law (Repeals) Acts which have repealed large volumes of obsolete statutory material.  On that basis, it is not clear why a new power to 
defaultdisapply
default or repeal obsolete primary legislation is needed.
default.
defaultThe position concerning secondary legislation (typically regulations and orders, many of which are contained in statutory instruments) is rather different.  The Commission’s powers to recommend the repeal of obsolete legislation extend to secondary legislation as well as primary legislation. However comparatively few regulations and orders are proposed for revocation by the Commission.  This is partly because regulations and orders often lapse automatically when their enabling statutory power is repealed.  Another reason is that secondary legislation can usually be revoked by the exercise of the same powers that created it.  A new power to 
defaultdisapply
default or revoke secondary legislation may, however, serve 
defaultsome useful purpose in those instances where it is impracticable for some reason to revoke the legislation using existing powers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11  Is
default the meaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear?  In this context, what is meant by “practical”?  
defaultShould it be defined and, if so, how?
default  Will removing any of the provisions proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission considers that the phrase “no longer of practical use” is intended to mean the same as “no longer of practical utility”.  On that basis, the Commission has no comment to make about the phrase and sees no need for it to be defined, given that “no longer of practical utility” has been used undefined and without difficulty in SLR Bills since 1969.  However, this does assume that a court would construe “no practical use” in that way, an issue that simply does not arise on an SLR Bill because it is up to Parliament to decide what “no practical utility” means.  The Commission does not understand why “use” has been substituted for “utility” in an expression that is currently well understood by Parliament.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission has no comment on the effect of schedule 16
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12  Are
default the safeguards regarding the use of the “no longer of practical use” power (set out in Clauses 54 to 56) adequate and appropriate?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main safeguard set out in these clauses is the Parliamentary procedure that will apply to orders under clause 51.  It is plainly essential in constitutional terms that there should be effective Parliamentary scrutiny of orders repealing legislation.  However, the Commission has no practical experience of how the procedures set out in the clauses (or any other procedures that would apply to the order under Standing Orders) would operate in practice.  So the Commission cannot comment on the question whether they are sufficient to ensure that clause 51 is used properly
default&#xa0;
defaultThe safeguard set out in these clauses that is of concern to the Commission is the provision in clause 54 whereby the Minister proposing to make an order under clause 51 must “in such cases as the Minister considers appropriate, consult the Commission, the Scottish Law Commission or the Northern Ireland Law Commission”.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission’s concerns about this provision are set out above. Including the Commission as a statutory 
defaultconsultee
default gives the misleading impression that the Commission will automatically have a view on a repeal proposal. Rather than draw the Commission into a consultation process on repeal proposals that fall outside its current SLR work, it would be better for Departments to invite the Commission to include those proposals in its next SLR Bill. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16  What
default are the risks associated with the proposed new power to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation that is “no longer of practical use”?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission believes that there is a risk that the proposed new power to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation that is no longer of practical use will lead to repeal proposals that are less researched and analysed than is currently the case with the SLR Bill process conducted at the Commission.  This must increase the risk of errors being made.  It is the Commission’s experience that the complexities of the statute book mean that rigorous analysis, research and consultation are needed before it can be said with any certainty that a statutory provision is no longer of practical use and that no saving, transitional or consequential provisions are required if it is to be repealed.  The Commission questions whether Departments will be able to make the time and expertise available to carry out this work properly.  Failure to identify a “live” provision in an otherwise obsolete statute can easily have the unintended effect of taking away rights (as well as obligations and liabilities) that have accrued under that provision.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commission notes in this context that the order-making power under clause 51 arises if the Minister 
defaultconsiders
default that the relevant provision is no longer of practical use.  This is a subjective criterion and it is not clear what evidence a Minister would need before the power could be triggered.  The Commission regards the test for inclusion of 
defaulta repeal
default in an SLR Bill to be a question of fact and legal judgement, and that it is necessary to be satisfied that all relevant facts have been established.  In any event, whatever view is taken within Government on the effect of clause 51, the Commission would expect Parliament to require sufficient evidence to be satisfied that the repeals in an order are well-founded.  Furthermore, as mentioned above, the validity of an order would be open to challenge by judicial review.
