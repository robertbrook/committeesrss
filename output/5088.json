"&#xa0;\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO THE EFRA COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE GLOBAL FEDERATION OF ANIMAL SANCTUARIES (GFAS)January 2014T\nhe EFRA Committee is seeking written submissions of evidence in regard to \nthe following:\nThe following is submitted on behalf of the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS).\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\n1, About GFASThe Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS) is an international non-profit organisati\non dedicated to \nhelping sanctuaries to help animals.\n \nGFAS promotes and validates excellence in sanctuary management and humane and responsible care of animals through a global system of accreditation, collaboration and \nmentoring. \n GFAS promotes the develop\nment of greater recognition and r\nesources for sanctuaries, and works\n to \neliminate the causes of displaced animals.\nGFAS is proud to provide \ncomprehensive\n standards on sanctuary excellence,\n and operates a \nrigorous accreditation system \nby which sanctuaries are assessed against these standards \nthrough a written application, review of documents and site visit, \nin order to achieve\n accreditation and verification. \nThe GFAS Standards of Excellence were developed and reviewed with the input of\n animal \nwelfare experts\n, non-profit professionals, sanctuary managers, \nand veterinarians, utilis\ning existing standards from outstanding sanctuaries as a starting framework and refined/expanded upon based on knowledge and expertise of contributors.\nGFAS con\nsiders a \nsanctuary \nto be \nan establishment that provides lifetime care for animals that have been abused, injured, abandoned, or are otherwise in need. The animals may come from sources \nincluding, but not limited to, private owners, research laboratories, g\novernment authorities, the entertainment industry, and zoos.\nAll GFAS \nsanctuaries\n must adhere to certain policies as set out in our standards, including but not limited to:\nFacilities that are not genuine \nsanctuaries, on the other hand, \nmay \nbuy and sell \nprimates\n, ex\nhibit the animals on and off site, allow the public to \nhave direct contact with primates\n, breed \nprimates\n, and allow the public \nto visit\n on a regular basis without escort. \nIn addition, their \nfacilities \nmay be substandard. \n2. Situation in the UKGFAS has ac\ncredited and verified several primate sanctuaries in North America, where the issue of primates as pets is a particular problem in terms of numbers. \nTo date, GFAS has accredited one primate sanctuary in the UK. We are aware of a handful of other primate-ke\neping facilities across Europe that might also meet the standards for verification or accreditation by GFAS.\nIt is apparent that there is a dearth of suitable facilities for rehoming and rescuing primates. Allowing the ownership and trade of pet primates t\no continue without this safety net would be irresponsible.\n \nWe note that there is currently no definition of an animal sanctuary in UK legislation. We do not consider that this should be an obstacle to a ban on the keeping of primates as pets. Genuine sanc\ntuaries do not keep primates as pets, nor do they keep them specifically for exhibition. Furthermore they do not trade in primates.\n A ban on the keeping of pet primates or on the trade in primates would be unlikely to affect the activities of responsible a\nnimal sanctuaries, particularly if legislation is tailored towards \nbanning \nthe keeping of primates by individuals in a domestic environment.\n3. ConclusionsWe \nare convinced \nthat the keeping of primates in the UK should be restricted to licensed zoos and to genuine animal sanctuaries. We consider facilities \nto be genuine sanctuaries if they \nare already accredited or verified by GFAS, or are likely to comply with GFAS standards\n.\nAt this time, we do not offer comment on whether a ban on the keeping and/or a ban on the trade in primates as pets is the most suitable mechanism for achieving this restriction.\nIn the event of a ban, GFAS remains willing to assist Defra and other stake\nholders in advising on the best options for primates currently kept as pets.\nGFAS looks forward to working with and alongside other stakeholders in verifying and/or accrediting suitable facilities across Europe, where appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nPrepared for GFAS by Chris Draper, GFAS Europe representative&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
