defaultRe: Clause 25 
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter giving careful consideration to the matter identified, I would like the following observations to be taken into account:
default&#xa0;
defaultReferring to Clause 25 (a) The intention to omit Paragraph (a) in Section 269(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 removing the discretion of the Secretary of State to order the whole or part of the Case to be re-heard, should new and important evidence which could not be produced at the time of the initial investigation subsequently be discovered, while on face value this may appear to be a useful and perhaps cost saving exercise, it is respectfully pointed out that in the case of the loss of the MV Derbyshire, that the technological advancement had been such that it was possible to locate the wreck and to ascertain more accurately its true loss and so as to bring about changes in rules of construction that could subsequently save unnecessary burden and expenditure upon industry. This is also an important issue for relatives of those who are lost in incidents be it the MV Derbyshire
default,  FV
default Gaule or the Marchioness. Given that this is an extremely rare event, it would seem pointless in removing this flexibility from the Secretary of State that could be extremely beneficial in both allaying public anxiety following a marine incident and addressing the concerns of those directly or indirectly involved.
default&#xa0;
defaultReferring to Clause 25 (b) 
defaultThe
default intention to omit the word "other" in Paragraph (b) in Section 269(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. It is a welcomed intention that this Sub-Section is to be retained if it appears to the Secretary of State to be grounds for suspecting that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. The intention to omit the "other" it is believed would strengthen Sub-Section (b) regardless whether Sub-Section (a) were removed or retained.  However, the inter-relationship between the two Sub-Sections is acknowledged.
default&#xa0;
defaultReferring to Clause 48 Ambulatory References to International Shipping Instruments to insert after Section 306 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Section 306 A the power to make Ambulatory References to International Instruments appears an entirely sensible procedure so as to facilitate the introduction and implementation of International Instruments. This potentially can save a burdensome legislative and consultative process since amendments to International Instruments are obligatory, particularly where there has been the adoption of the 'tacit acceptance procedure', and are therefore obligatory. Such processes are used by other countries with considerable beneficial effect, including the early implementation of International Instruments.
