defaultWritten Submission by HM Inspectorate of Prisons VEP 0017default&#xa0;
defaultI am responding to your call f
defaultor evidence 
defaultto 
defaultsupport the 
defaultconduct 
defaultof your 
defaultpre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill
default and have set out a number of brief 
defaultobservations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHer Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMI Prisons) is an independent inspectorate whose duties are primarily set out in section 5A of the Prison Act 1952 as amended by section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982. 
default 
defaultHMI Prisons has a statutory duty to report on conditions for and treatment of those in prisons, young offender institutions (YOIs) and immigration detention facilities.
default 
default HMI Prisons also inspects court custody, police custody and customs custody (jointly with HM Inspectorate of Constabulary), and secure training centres (with Ofsted). 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHMI Prisons is one of the organisations that deliver the UK government’s obligations arising from its status as a party to the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. 
default 
defaultOPCAT requires state parties to establish an independent National Preventative Mechanism (NPM) to inspect of all place of detention.  Article 19 (c) of the Protocol sets out the NPM’s powers to submit proposals concerning existing or draft legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrisoners only very rarely raise the right to vote 
defaultwith me or my inspectors during inspections.  That is of some concern 
defaultin 
defaultitself and there is 
defaultsomething 
defaultto be said for the argument that an acceptance of civic obligations which include the responsibility to vote is something that should be encouraged as part of a prison’s work to try and ensure prisoners leave custody less likely to offend than when they entered. 
default 
defaultAs part of the inspection process we will check to ensure that remand prisoners, who are able to vote, are facilitated to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, 
defaultit seems to me 
defaultthat 
defaultthe most important issue in this controversy is that the UK, having placed itself under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, cannot pick and choose which of its judgements it accepts.  I have no view on the first two options set out in the draft Bill.
default 
default I understand the judgement allows considerable latitude in how it should be met but it appears that option 
defaultC
default would not be compatible with it.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my view
default,
default it would be perverse if
default the institutions charged with the punishment of those who have decided not to abide by the law were themselves deliberately to operate in contravention of a court judgement.
default 
default 
defaultIn plain terms, it would set a very bad example.
default 
default 
defaultFurthermore, my I
defaultnspectorate has been part of 
defaulta 
defaultwelcome initiative by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to promote the UK 
defaultprison 
defaultinspection model, its focus on human 
defaultrights and the value of accepting the obligations that arise from being a party to OPCAT to other states
default, particularly where there is a UK national interest in that state’s adherence to human rights standards.
default  I am very clear that our credibility in this regard would be damaged if the UK chose to be in contravention of the ECHR judgement on prisoner voting.
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope these observations are of assistance to t
defaulthe C
