I\nt\n is treated with a healthy diet and increased physical activity. \nT\nablets and/or insulin can be required.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n \nDiabetes is\n one of the biggest health \nchallenges of our time: \n&#xa0;\nCost of diabetes:&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis \nsubmission is divided into three priority sections for improving diabetes care and reducing costs: provision of care; integrated and personalised care and managing contributory factors. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n \nProvision of care\n&#xa0;\nThe scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service redesign for costs and effectiveness and&#xa0;The readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the community2.1\n \nI\nntegrated pathways of care \nmust be commissioned \nacross primary, intermedia\nte and secondary care \nto \nensure people\n with diabetes\n \nget \nthe \ncare\n and \nspecialist \ntreatment \nthey need \nto manage their condition\n. Diabetes care cannot be provided solely in primary and community care. Access to specialist care when re\nquired is vital. In particular\n,\n Type 1 diabetes support should be co-ordinated primarily from secondary care. \n&#xa0;\nStronger\n community and primary care services \nwith appropriate upskilling in diabetes expertise \nshould\n ensure \nthe\n focus of care is\n:\n coordination, prevention, structured chronic disease management\n, \npatient \neducation and\n care planning\n to support \ngreater \nself management\n. This will help \ncut \nwastage and inappropriate hospital admissions\n. \nWhere hospital admissions are needed, ensuring patients have access to specialist inpatient treatment can reduce length of stay \nby three\n days and save £400 per admission\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n \nGood quality care provision in the areas outlined below would help to reduce the need for hospital inpatient care, by improving the ma\nnagement of diabetes within primary and \ncommunity\n services\n.\n&#xa0;\nPrevention and e\narly diagnosis \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n \nUp to 850,000 people are unaware they have Type 2 diabetes\n. By diagnosis, half\n \nshow signs of complications\n. \nEarly diagnosis \nis therefore crucial to ensure \ngood management of diabetes \nca\nn start before \nexpensive and life-threatening \ncomplications develop and\n also\n prevents existing complications getting worse.\n \nIt is estimated that by 2025, five million people will have diabetes – most of which will be Type 2\n. \nI\nnvestment in effective public awareness campaigns (explaining the seriousness of Type 2 diabetes and its complications) and full implementation of the NHS Health Checks programme will help prevention and early diagnosis\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n \n25\n%\n of children and young people are diagnosed with \nT\nype 1 \ndue to being \nadmitted to hospital\n \nwith Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)\n \n.\n \nIncreasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of \nT\nype 1 diabetes, through public health initiatives aimed at schools, the general public and general practice, can \nhelp \nearlier diagnosis \nof Type 1 \nand \ncut \nthe \nnumber of people who suffer \nDKA.\n \n&#xa0;\nProvision of appropriate care checks\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n \nEvery\none\n with diabetes should \nget \na planned programme o\nf NICE\n recommended\n checks each year. \nThey \nare designed to identify the early signs of avoidable diabetic complications. \nHowever, only a third of adults with \nT\nype 1 diabetes and half of people with \nT\nype 2 diabetes are getting all the recommended annual tests. This is compounded by a ‘postcode lottery’ of care, which means the percentage of people receiving all checks ranges from 16 – 71% depending on their location\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n \nThe\nse\n nine \nchecks\n \nmust be made accessible to all people with diabetes \nthrough annual care planning reviews\n.\n The results \nof these checks \nmust be used to ensure effective\n treatment and \nsupport for \nself-management\n and so cut complications.\n Where the checks are delivered within an integrated care pathway, they can make a significant difference in supporting effective self management and reducing complications.\n&#xa0;\nEducation for self management\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n \nIt is estimated that around 95% of diabetes care is self management. NICE guidelines, backed by strong international evidence\n, recommend that structured education is made available to all people with diabetes to help them understand and manage their diabetes. \n&#xa0;\n2.8 But too few people are offered it and not enough attend courses:\n&#xa0;\nThe interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions&#xa0;2.9\n \nThere is a greater prevalence of psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders among people with diabetes than the general population\n. Poor emotional wellbeing is associated with sub optimal blood glucose control, which in turn can lead to the development of complications. For example, depression is twice as common in people with diabetes and can have an affect on an individual’s ability to control their diet or manage their medication\n. \n2.10\n \nDespite this, and the fact that treatment of psychological conditions has been shown to improve psychological wellbeing and other health related\n outcomes\n, 85%\n of people with diabetes have no access to psychological care and \nsupport\n.\n \nAccess to emotional and psychological care \nshould \nbecome a routin\ne part of diabetes management, \nreduc\ning\n the ‘costs’ of untreated psychological conditions.\n&#xa0;\n3. \nSupporting the implementation of integrated \nand personalised care\n \n&#xa0;\nThe practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditions&#xa0;\n3.1\n \nTo achieve maximum efficiency\n, effectiveness\n \nand \nto \navoid duplication and gaps in service, \nevidence shows the need to\n commission fully integrated \nand well co-ordinated \npathways of diabetes care across primary, secondary and community providers. This is key to providing positive health and management outcomes. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n \nThere is a wealth of information to support this: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The extent to which patients are being offered personalised care&#xa0;\n3.3\n \nPeople with diabetes can live for as little as a few years or as long as 80 years with their condition. \nPersonalised care should be coordinated around the person with diabetes, who is enabled to take a proactive \nlifelong \nrole in shaping \ntheir care\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe advantages \nof better \npartnership working\n are \nshown in \nthe 2011 \nYear of Care\n Programme\n. \nC\nare planning \ndeliver\ned\n personalised care in routine practice for people with long term conditions\n,\n using diabetes as an example\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n \nDespite this, \nonly 50% of \nEnglish \npatients\n \nreported that\n \nclinicians share decisions about treatment with them, and\n a \nDiabetes UK \nsurvey \nin 2012 found that only 36%\n \nhad \ndeveloped a care plan \nby discussing their individual needs to set targets\n \nwith their healthcare professional\n. \n&#xa0;\nExamples of effective integrated care&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nNorth West London Integrated Care Pilot: \nIntr\noduced integrated care pathways \nfor \npeople\n \nwith diabetes.

Over one year, \nthe rate \nof hospital admissions for foot ulcerations \nfell \nfrom 84% to 47% and the median length of stay reduced from 16 to 11 days\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIntegrated Care for Patients with Diabetes, The Derby Model: Introduced a new organisation commissioned to provide \nthe routine and specialist aspects of\n diabetes care. \nBetween\n 20\n09\n \nand \n20\n11\n \nsignificant improvement\ns\n \nincluded:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n \nIntegrated foot care pathway\n. \nW\nhere effective services are in place for people with diabetes who have foot problems they are \nat \nmuch lower risk of \namputation\n. As part of the integrated footcare pathway, people with a foot problem should have speedy access to a mul\ntidisciplinary specialist \nfoot \nteam\n. T\nhis has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of amputatio\nn\n meeting national standards, saving costs, feet and lives\n \n. \n&#xa0;\n3.8\n \nWhile \nthese examples are encouraging, \nthey are \nthe exceptions and \nnot \nnationally \nrepresentative\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n \nManaging contributory factors\n&#xa0;\nObesity as a contributory factor to Type 2 diabetes &#xa0;\n4.1\n \nObesity \naccounts for 80-85%\n of the overall risk of developing Type 2 diabetes\n. As almost two in every three people in the UK are overweight or obese\n, the main strategy for reducing the rising prevalence of Type 2 diabetes should be to tackle the rise in obesity. \nF\null implementation of the NHS Health Check programme \nwould lead to better early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes. \nOther \npriorities are: \n&#xa0;\nThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence of diabetes, and the extent to which services have the capacity to meet future demands&#xa0;4.2\n \nOlder people are more likely to have diabetes. \nIn England the prevalence of diabetes across all ages is \ncurrently \n5.5\n%\n. This increases with age to 14\n%\n prevalence in over 65s\n. It is likely therefore, that the ageing population will contribute significantly to the increasing prevalence of diabetes\n and co-morbidities\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n \nCurrent services do not have the capacity to meet predicted future demand. \nThis is largely \nbecause\n diabetes in older people requires careful management due to the complex interaction between the process of ageing, the increased prevalence of co-morbidities, widespread vascular disease and functional loss.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n \nIt is therefore essential that prevention, education, better care and the i\nmplementation \nof integrated pathways of care are prioritised to address this. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n \nConclusion\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n \nPeople with diabetes must have access to high quality services to enable them to effectively manage their condition\n.\n \nCommissioning and care delivery needs to focus on improving organisational proc\nesses,\n \nengaging people with long term condition\ns in\n their own care and changing healthcare professionals\n attitudes across each local care system. \nTo achieve this\n,\n strong national leadership\n, collaboration between multiple commissioners and providers,\n \neffective systems of accountability \nand a joined up system of incentivisation \nare needed to ensure integrated, personalise\nd care is \nthe norm.\n \n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n \nDiabetes UK (2012)\n \nDiabetes in the UK\n Based on the number of diagnosed people (3 million) plus those who are unaware they have diabetes or have no confirmed diagnosis (approx 850,000).\n Figures based on AHPO diabetes prevalence model\n Diabetes UK (2011). \nImpaired glucose regulation (IGR) / Non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH)/ Pre-diabetes. \n WHO.
