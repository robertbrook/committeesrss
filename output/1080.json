"VEP 0035\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by John Hirst VEP 0035&#xa0;1. Introduction\n&#xa0;\n2. It appears to me that this Joint Committee has been set up to buy time and/or waste time. It is a dreadful waste of taxpayers money at a time of economic decline. The Joint Committee only has the power to make recommendations in its Report, which is likely to be ignored by those in power. The Suffragette Movement motto was “Deeds not words” in response to Parliament's wanting to talk about votes for women rather than actually give them the vote. History is repeating itself. We need action not words for convicted prisoners votes. It is over 9 years since the UK was found guilty of a human rights violation in Hirst v UK(No2). It is shameful that this has not been remedied. As a result of this shameless conduct there are now approximately 3,000 more prisoner votes cases backlogged at the ECtHR. The UK State (Executive, Parliament and Judiciary) must now do the right and honourable thing.\n&#xa0;\n3. Hirst v UK (No2) expressly prohibits disenfranchisement which is arbitrarily arrived at. It is arguable that disqualification from voting for those sentenced to 4 years or more is arbitrary. Did someone in Parliament simply throw a dart into a dartboard to arrive at this figure? It used to be the case that 5 years and over signified a long-term prisoner. But this led to empty cells in the Dispersal System and chronic overcrowding in Local Prisons. The solution was to lower the ceiling by 12 months. In any event, Hirst v UK (No2) and Frodl v Austria require that any disenfranchisement must be on an individual case by case basis, and limited to those convicted of electoral fraud or abuse in a public office, for example. The UK is approaching the “Hirst problem” arse backwards. That is, 'who should be enfranchised?' rather than 'who should be disenfranchised?'. In Hirst No2 the ECtHR stated that in a democracy the presumption should be in favour of enfranchisement. If Parliament is undemocratic then it should at least inform the electorate that we are not living in a democratic State.\n&#xa0;\n4. The UK has a bad record of minimal compliance with ECtHR judgments. I doubt that 6 months and over would satisfy the Court that this proposal would abide by the judgment in Hirst No2. In addition to the points there is Sauve No2 cited in HirstNo2 whereby disenfranchisement of all prisoners serving 2 years and over was ruled as unconstitutional.\n&#xa0;\n5. In Hirst v The Attorney General, Kennedy LJ, stated if s.3 of ROPA 1983 could meet the challenge from Article 3 of the First Protocol of the ECHR then that's it. Hirst No2 is evidence that s.3 of ROPA 1983 failed to withstand the challenge and that's it. The law has to be amended. It is \nnot an option to maintain the status quo in the light of Hirst No2. Such a proposal is contrary to human rights, democracy and the rule of law.\n&#xa0;\n6. In 2006, the Republic of Ireland changed the law to allow all convicted prisoners the postal vote and did so to fully comply with Hirst No2. Cyprus also now gives all prisoners the vote. Latvia which joined Hirst No2 as an interested party has also changed the law to allow all prisoners the vote. In Iraq the UK and US granted all prisoners to vote on the ground that it would aid democracy. By the same token, surely, it would aid democracy in the UK?\n&#xa0;\n7. There are no historical or philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the vote since Hirst No2. Kennedy LJ, in Hirst v The Attorney General, erred in law by relying upon Sauve when it had been overruled by Sauve No2. In effect, Kennedy LJ abdicated responsibility with this philosophical cop out. In Sauve v AG of Canada No2 the Supreme Court criticised the reasoning of Kennedy LJ. First Parliament abdicated responsibility on convicted prisoners and the vote, the Judiciary followed suit. Therefore the ECtHR decided the issue in Hirst No2.\n&#xa0;\n8. I consider the right to vote is a human right because of A3P1 of the ECHR and this is confirmed by Hirst No2.\n&#xa0;\n9. It cannot be the case that abusing convicted prisoners by disenfranchisement is a suitable part of their punishment. The punishment is the sentence passed by a magistrate or judge, and there is no provision for this extra sanction.\n&#xa0;\n10. It is not just the hundreds of millions of pounds in potential compensation pay outs to prisoners, but it may well be that the CoE, EU and UN will invoke political sanctions. In my view, I don't believe that the UK can afford to be declared a rogue or pariah State.\n&#xa0;\nHirst No2 and Frodl do not support a voting ban based on sentence length. In Israel, the man sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of the Prime Minister could not be banned from voting for his successor as the court stated such a ban would harm democracy.\n&#xa0;\nThe UK cannot pick and choose which laws and judgments it will abide by. It will only lead to uncertainty. It will lead to a constitutional crisis. The legitimacy of Parliament to govern could be seriously questioned. As I understand it there is a case listed before the UKSC arguing that as EU citizens prisoners have the right to vote in European elections. It may well be that a ruling will be sought from the CJEU. If so, this would have direct effect and become part of UK domestic law. In any event, to remain a Member State of the CoE and EU they must abide by the ECHR and ECtHR judgments. It is likely that other Member States will demand sanctions to force the UK to comply or be suspended or expelled. Even if the UK chose to withdraw from Europe the Hirst No2 judgment and other judgments will remain in force and if the UK returns to the fold then they would have to be complied with.\n&#xa0;\nIt is not just lessons to be learnt from abroad but also from the UK. Maine and Vermont in the US granted prisoners the vote in the last century. Winston Churchill in 1910 said you can judge how civilised we are by how we treat prisoners. We fail this test. In 1937 Denmark granted all prisoners the vote. In 1968 “The Thieves Parliament” succeeded in forcing the State to give all prisoners the vote. From a Prison Law Inside Out perspective it is clear that the UK has failed the Hirst test laid out in Frodl v Austria.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
