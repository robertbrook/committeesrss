[[[National Housing Federation]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1              We support the concept of Universal Credit and its potential to ensure that people are better off in work by reducing benefit withdrawal rates. However, the National Housing Federation has several concerns regarding the reforms, primarily because households do not have a genuine choice to have the housing element of Universal Credit paid directly to their landlord. Many tenants would elect to do this to avoid going into arrears. We are also concerned that the cumulative impact of benefit cuts means that households increasingly cannot afford to cover the most basic costs of feeding their family, keeping their home warm and paying their rent at the same time. &#xa0;1.2              Our response focuses on the case for abolishing the social sector size criteria. Our recent ComRes poll shows that public opinion is shifting against the social sector size criteria with 59% in support of Bedroom Tax repeal, up from 51% in April. In addition, 87% agree that those who need a spare room for sick or disabled family members should be exempt from the policy. &#xa0;1.3              We also outline a number of measures that would ensure the roll out of Universal Credit reduces the risk of tenants going into debt and protects social landlords’ revenue streams. &#xa0;1.4              To ensure we have information on the long-term impact of the Government’s welfare reforms, the Federation has commissioned Ipsos MORI to survey housing associations in autumn 2013 with a large scale tenants’ survey in early 2014. We would be happy to share the results with the Committee in due course. &#xa0;

[[[housing benefit bill down]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              The rise in the housing benefit bill in recent years is a result of higher unemployment, stagnating low wages and rising rent levels in the private rented sector. The consequence is that, of every £1 of government expenditure on housing, 95p is spent on housing benefit and only 5p on building new homes. &#xa0;2.2              Recommendation: the most effective way of redressing the balance and reducing the housing benefit bill is to build more affordable homes. Government investment in new affordable homes not only helps tackle our growing housing crisis, but also has a fundamental role to play in: &#xa0;

[[[and empty homes]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1              In autumn 2012, 84% of housing associations believed that their rent arrears would increase as a direct result of the welfare changes (taking into account direct payments, the social size criteria and the benefit cap). The average increase in arrears expected was 51%. &#xa0;3.2              At the end of 2012, housing association arrears stood at 5.1% (£572m). If a 51% increase in arrears was realised across the sector, actual arrears levels would rise to 7.7% (totalling £865m). This loss in revenue translates into a loss of financial capacity within housing associations to manage and maintain their properties; deliver wider community services and build new homes. If all these losses were diverted away from financing new homes, the country would see 17,480 less affordable homes built in a year. Any impact on house building may be more likely to be felt in the next Spending Review period, as 61% of associations did not think welfare reform would make it harder to deliver on their commitments under the existing Affordable Homes Programme. Though 26% say it would to a fair amount or great deal. &#xa0;3.3              The impact on tenants and communities would also be significant. For individual working-age tenants on housing benefit, the predicted impact would mean outstanding arrears increasing by £250 (up from £492) to £743 on average by year end. Policis, in a separate study for the Federation, found that 50% of social housing tenants were not confident they would be able to keep up rental payments with a switch to monthly payments in arrears within a Universal Credit. Policis identified families with children, those who juggled their finances through weekly cash budgeting and were already under financial stress as most at risk in this move. Policis also found that 32% of social housing tenants had problematic credit use and it was amongst this group that rent arrears were already concentrated and risks to be found. &#xa0;3.4              Recommendation: that households are given a genuine choice to have their housing element of Universal Credit paid direct to their landlord given the level of risk to rent arrears. &#xa0;3.5              Recommendation: we welcome the measures the DWP are trialling in the North West pathfinder areas to identify tenants who are vulnerable and at risk of arrears who will have the opportunity to have direct payments to their landlords. However, we recommend that the DWP accept individual referrals from housing associations as to whom should be placed on direct payments from the outset, or when falling into rent arrears before the arrears trigger comes into play and gives effect to this. &#xa0;3.6              In autumn 2012, 82% of associations expected the social sector size criteria to result in a fall of rental income. Our snapshot survey of 51 associations suggests this has been born out, as by the end of June 2013, 71% of them were reporting that their rent arrears levels had gone up. This took place when Universal Credit had reached only a handful of tenants in the North West so could not be said to be a contributing factor. In the first three months to the end of June: &#xa0;&#xa0;3.7              The first three months does not necessarily indicate what might happen over the longer-term. Some households may get deeper into arrears as they find it difficult to make up the shortfall in their rent week after week, or because Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) awarded for a short time come to an end. Some households may find ways of meeting the extra call on their budgets, by cutting back on expenditure, or boosting their income, for example by taking in lodgers or increasing the number of hours they work. However, not all of these options are open to every household. The Local Government Association has found that people’s ability to move or find work to mitigate the impact of welfare reform is constrained by local housing and job markets. &#xa0;3.8              The impact on rent arrears may be limited by people downsizing, but landlords will suffer a loss in rental income whilst they wait for new tenants to move into empty properties. On average - before the social sector size criteria came in - properties remained vacant for 14 days. However, some landlords are reporting that they are finding it difficult to let larger family homes due to the social sector size criteria, resulting not only in an extended period of rental income loss, but also a waste of a home that a family would welcome. &#xa0;

[[[costs]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              Housing associations are changing their rent collection and arrears management systems in the face of welfare reform and providing additional support for tenants. Both have a cost. In autumn 2012: &#xa0;&#xa0;4.2              For the 60 largest associations (representing 49% of properties in the sector) the average predicted additional spend up to 2013 was £193,000. This is expected to rise to over £456,000 in 2013-14. This suggests for just the largest associations taken together, there will be around £30 million of additional costs in the first year. &#xa0;4.3              Some of the costs of investing in new management systems and ways of working will be greater in the earlier years. Associations may also adjust their expenditure plans upwards as the impact of the social sector size criteria and new payment arrangements via Universal Credit unfold. While it is not possible to predict how this will pan out, it is safe to say that this will take resources away from services and new homes delivery as illustrated above in connection with increasing rent arrears levels.  &#xa0;4.4              Recommendation: DWP agrees to data sharing arrangements for the housing association sector to ensure that arrangements are put in place to reduce fraud, errors and administrative costs. For example, to ensure the DWP has timely information on changes in rent levels and that associations have information on who is moving onto Universal Credit and in and out of direct payment to their landlord. &#xa0;4.5              Recommendation: that the DWP works in partnership with housing associations, as well as local authorities, to put in place local support service frameworks to ensure claimants have ready access to financial inclusion and other services to support them through their claim as needed.  &#xa0;

[[[Support]]]

[[[ed housing]]]&#xa0;5.1              The Universal Credit rules and payment model is unsuitable for people living in short-term supported housing, such as a homeless hostels. The Government is to make proposals for alternative arrangements for exempted supported housing, having stressed it is not a cost cutting exercise. &#xa0;5.2              Recommendation: the supported housing definition must be fit for purpose to ensure that the right people are exempted from claiming housing costs through Universal Credit and directed towards the alternative system.&#xa0;5.3              Recommendation: any new system for determining support for housing costs for people in supported housing should retain the principle of nationally set entitlement and be piloted.&#xa0;

[[[public services]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1              On average, the social sector size criteria will reduce the housing benefit payments of 660,000 people by £728 per year. Many individuals are already reporting that they are finding it extremely hard to cope with the effects. In their survey of social housing tenants in 2012 Policis found:&#xa0;&#xa0;6.2              Having to make up the social sector size criteria shortfall in the rent and make contributions to council tax will add to financial pressures on households. This will take its toll on people’s wellbeing and could lead to greater demands on public services as people: &#xa0;&#xa0;6.3              An estimated 100,000 British households living in social housing with aids and adaptations are also affected by the social sector size criteria. It is likely that many of them would seek their re-provision if they had to move. Sometimes it will be possible to move existing adaptations. On other occasions new ones will need to be specified and fitted to match the design of the new home. In either scenario there are costs involved including assessments by occupational therapists, the labour for removing or fitting the aids and adaptations and the costs of the equipment. Existing adaptations may become redundant if it is not appropriate for them to be moved, or left for the incoming tenant. This represents a waste of historical investment and an environmental cost. The costs of re-providing aids and adaptations represents an extra demand on the disabled facility grant (DFG) budgets of local authorities who have duties to assess the needs of disabled people and to meet the costs of appropriate facilities irrespective of their tenure. The average DFG award is £6,500. In turn, this puts pressure on central government which allocates funding to local authorities for DFG. Housing associations aim to offer people a move to a home which has been built, or already adapted for their needs. However, because of the limited supply of smaller properties this is far from possible in many cases. &#xa0;6.4              The cost to the tax-payer is not the only factor to consider. Many households affected will find it difficult to find a suitable property to move to, or may face additional stresses in trying to co-ordinate moving with the successful and timely re-provision of aids and adaptions. Many will have to choose between making up the shortfall in their rent which would reduce their weekly household budget, and moving to a less suitable property which would put limitations on going about their daily lives. &#xa0;6.5              Government spokespeople repeatedly refer to DHPs as ameliorating the effect of changes to housing benefit, including the social sector size criteria

[[[. ]]]During the passage of the Welfare Reform Act, Lord Freud allocated an additional £30 million to DHP for 2013/14 because of the social sector size criteria, aimed at disabled people living in significantly adapted properties and foster carers. The Government also allocated an additional £35 million in year for 2013/14 to ameliorate the impact of the social sector size criteria. This is part of a wider allocation for 2013/14 which is now up to £190 million against allocations for previous years of £20m. Though this falls well short of the £480 million savings in the first year the DWP predicts tenants affected by the social sector size criteria will make up in rental payments, it is still an additional cost to the tax payer. In addition, an administrative error in the allocations to Scotland has resulted in the Government spending a further £800,000. &#xa0;6.6              It is entirely possible that the Government will continue to allocate further funds to the DHP pot as the impacts unfold. However, individual households cannot rely on DHP payments and local authorities have to make very difficult decisions on how to ration their pot over the year across people in properties owned by private landlords, local authorities and housing associations. Federation research shows that only 21% of local authority DHP awards from April 2013 to end of June 2013 were for six months or longer.&#xa0;

[[[Impact on savings]]]7.1              The Government claims that the social sector size criteria will save the tax-payer £480 million in its first year. Whether or not this is realised depends on the extent to which people downsize into the more expensive private rented sector and who subsequently moves into their vacated home. Riverside, Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing, with support from the Centre for Housing Policy University of York, have run their own data through the DWP’s cost impact model and this suggests that the savings may be considerably less than assumed by the DWP. Their modelling is based on their observed level of moves by tenants affected by the social sector size criteria into the private rented sector. Analysis from the Federation shows that families under-occupying two bedroom homes who move to a one-bed flat in the private rented sector would end up claiming an average of £1,500 more per year in housing benefit – even though they’ll be living in smaller properties..&#xa0;7.2              The Government’s projected savings also fail to take into account the subsequent costs to public services and the costs incurred by landlords as explored above. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.3              The social sector size criteria is not an effective way of tackling overcrowding given the geographical mismatch between households who are under-occupying and high levels of overcrowding. It is also not a good way of making the best use of the affordable housing stock given the limited opportunities for people to move to smaller properties within the sector. For example, analysis from the Federation shows: &#xa0;&#xa0;7.4              Recommendation: the Government should repeal the social sector size criteria.   &#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0; http://www.housing.org.uk/media/press-releases/majority-of-public-believe-bedroom-tax-should-be-abandoned  IPPR, Backing ‘benefits to bricks’: our big cities need deal-wheeling housing powers, May 2013 National Housing Federation submission to the Spending Review 2015/16 available @ www.housing.org.uk Impact of Welfare Reform on housing associations-2012 baseline report for the National Housing Federation, Ipsos MORI and University of Cambridge, 2013 Ipsos MORI 2012 Global Accounts of Housing Associations Ibid Quoted in Ibid Optimising welfare reform outcomes for social housing tenants-understanding the financial management issues for different tenants groups, Policis for the National Housing Federation, 2012.
