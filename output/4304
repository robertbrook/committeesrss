defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
default defaultDr Hywel Francisdefault:default 
defaultGood morning and welcome to this evidence session on our inquiry into access to justice and the Government’s proposals for reform of the judicial review. For the record, could you please introduce yourselves?
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: I am Jeffrey Jowell. I am Director of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law. I am also a practising barrister at Blackstone Chambers, and I am Professor Emeritus at University College London, Professor of Public Law. For the purpose of this meeting, I was the United Kingdom member on the Venice Commission, which is the Council of Europe’s Commission for Democracy through Law, for 11 years—up to two years ago
default.
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: Stephen Sedley. I was a barrister specialising in public law for 28 years, and then for 18 years a judge, first on the Queen’s Bench Division, and then of the Court of Appeal. I retired at the beginning of 2011 and since then have been a visiting Professor of Law at

defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default defaultThank you very much. Thank you again for coming along to speak to us and answer our questions. Could I begin with Professor Jowell? We have heard a lot of complaints that the Government’s proposals will 
defaultfundamentally
default undermine the rule of law. Some of us find the concept too vague to be practically useful when conducting detailed parliamentary scrutiny of these proposals. Can you explain precisely how the proposals threaten the rule of law as a practical concept, and the relationship between the rule of law and what we are particularly interested in—human rights?
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: I mentioned a moment ago the Venice Commission, which did a report a few years ago on the rule of law. If I could preface my remarks by saying the most significant thing about that report was that it received agreement from about 50 countries in the Council of Europe, from diverse legal systems. I chaired the committee that drafted this, and it took five years to get agreement, because initially there was not agreement. It was regarded as a vague concept, suitable perhaps to an Anglo-American system. Then Lord Bingham’s very accessible book on the rule of law came out. It made two very convincing points and allowed a consensus to emerge in the Venice Commission on what the rule of law was: first of all, that it was a universal concept, so the 50 diverse countries agreed that it was an important concept; and secondly, that it was a practical concept that could be reduced to what he called eight ingredients, which I will go over very briefly in just a second, and relate them to this inquiry. It was also regarded as a very powerful concept. It does not exactly coincide with democracy, but it is the spine of democracy. It does not exactly coincide with human rights, but it gives access to human rights. Many human rights are contained in the notion of the rule of law. 
defaultThe content is very straightforward, and is something we all understand. First, we should be governed by law and not by man. Therefore, it excludes anarchy on one side and tyranny on the other. Secondly, law should be equally applied, so there is a strong element of equality there: rich, poor, powerful, marginalised. Thirdly, law should be certain, predictable, so that people can plan their activities by the rule of law. Discretionary power in a complex society 
defaultmust be permitted, but then, as Lord Bingham says so convincingly, “Discretionary power must also be constrained; it must not be allowed to be arbitrarily exercised. It must be fairly exercised and within the law, as laid down particularly by Parliament.” So, that is an essential aspect of the rule of law, which is very relevant here. Then 
defaultThe Rule of Law
default goes on to contain another three or four ingredients that also apply here. You must be able to challenge laws; you must be able to challenge decisions. Obstacles should not be unduly placed in your way to challenge any decision that is made about you, whether by a local official or by the executive, be he ever so high. So, there is a strong element there of access to justice, which is very relevant here. Of course, when you get to the courts, there must be a fair trial by independent judges. 
defaultSo, that is the rule of law, as set out in the Venice Commission paper so clearly, with at the end of it a checklist so that countries could check them all off to see it was a practical concept. One other element that Lord Bingham puts in that is not stressed as much in the Venice Commission paper is that states must fulfil their international obligations; so that is the international rule of law. 
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default defaultSo how do the Government’s 
defaultproposals
default measure up to that checklist
default? 
defaultI noticed in that checklist that cost does not figure
default. 
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: Well, access to justice ought to, if possible, be provided without undue cost. Obstacles ought not to be placed in a way that might inhibit reasonable access to justice. The other aspect that is important here is the question of standing to sue; you might want to come to that later. No breach of the law, whether by an individual or by the state, should really go unremedied, if at all possible. Not every breach will need a remedy, but where possible the breach should be remedied. That is why we have rather broad standing to sue in this country, and it is a jewel in the crown of our judicial review. Not every individual has the means to challenge a decision that is made about him or about his general interests. However, we have NGOs here, and other groups, that can do so in the public interest. 
defaultThe Chairman:default defaultWith regard to the proposals? 
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: The proposals seek to reduce the opportunity for judicial review—to reduce broad standing to sue on the behalf of interest groups and others. They suggest that only an individual whose interests are directly affected may seek judicial review, and there are other aspects of the proposals as well.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Buckland:default Developing 
defaulton
default that point, if
default I may
default, Sir Jeffrey, we all know that the link in the evidence that has been submitted to the Committee, for which we are all grateful, between the legal aid proposals and the judicial review proposals is, according to your paper, access to justice. That is, if you like, the thread that brings them together. I think you were beginning to develop some of the issues that you raise in the paper that may affect that principle of access to justice relating to the reforms. You mentioned already standing and in the paper you talk about costs as well. I wondered if you cared to just enlarge on those points for us.
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: On standing to sue, most countries—not all, but most democratic countries—allow somebody to bring a claim for judicial review to challenge a 
defaultdecision that is made about them by any official themselves, if their interests are directly affected. On occasion they are not able to do so, or unwilling to do so. The decision may affect the broader public as well, such as to build a motorway right through London, or not to prosecute in a situation when there was an allegation of corruption against our purchase of planes from Saudi Arabia. In that case, an interest group, such as the Corner House group in that particular case, or an environmental body, will seek to support the action brought by an individual or bring the action in their own name. I
defaultn deciding whether to give permission to that claim
default,
default 
defaultthe courts 
defaultwill not assess the public interest in the actual substance of the decision, 
defaultwhich is an error in the way this was presented in the proposals—the proposals suggest that the public interest there is a matter for Parliament. However, they are not talking public interest in the sense of whether it 
defaultis a good thing to drive a motorway through London or not
default, but whether the legality of the way that decision was made—its procedures and so on—might be challenged. 
defaultThey will assess that
default 
defaulton the basis of whether the legal issues should really be clarified because they seem prima facie but only prima facie
default and 
defaultthe law has not been correctly applied
default;
default or that there is nobody else
default available; or thirdly that this is a group that can bring some knowledge of the law and perspective about the case to the table. So they allow a group that is representing broader interests to come to the table in that case. It is the same situation in 
defaultFrance
default, and most European countries, in 
defaultSouth Africa
default, and most countries in the Commonwealth, where they have a very broad standing. If you reduce that, you would really reduce the opportunity to challenge these kinds of decisions. Breach of the law may go unremedied and judicial review might well be the preserve of large commercial interests, and indeed the Government. The smaller individuals, or individuals asserting the public interest in a perfectly legitimate, respectable organisation, would be shut out.
defaultMr Buckland:default defaultYes. The thrust of your argument in the paper is that in effect the courts already apply a strict test when it comes to standing. 
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: They do indeed. A very strict test. 
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Buckland:default defaultI was interested in your points about costs, and obviously you set them out very clearly. What one point would you say is of outstanding concern in terms of the proposals with regard to the reform of costs, either pre-permission, permission stage or the wasted costs?
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: I would prefer in that respect to defer to one of the other speakers here on costs. I can make one point about costs. If I may, I see in the next session Michael Fordham QC will be giving evidence. He assisted with this issue—as you see, his name is on there—and I think he is better qualified, as a practitioner who is in court so frequently, to answer that question. However, we did make the point that, in terms of legal aid, legally aided claimants seem to succeed in the permission stage to a greater extent than non-legally aided claimants, and that is a very important point to make. There was a statistical error in the first proposals on that subject, on that point. 
defaultMr Buckland:default defaultThank you very much indeed.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultI should begin by d
defaulteclaring
default an interest as a practising barrister who has appeared both for and against government and public authorities in judicial review cases. Sir Stephen, in your piece in the 
defaultLondon Review of Books
default, you discuss, among other things, the alteration to the Lord Chancellor’s role following the changes in the constitution by the last 
defaultGovernment. Although the role is perhaps secondary to the Secretary of State for Justice, I would like to ask whether you think that, as the Lord Chancellor’s statutory duty is to respect the rule of law and defend the independence of the judiciary, he is entitled to put forward these proposals for reform of judicial review.
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: You have put your finger, Lord Faulks, on a very serious paradox that was created by the Blair Government, which attempted first to abolish the Lord Chancellorship then to reintroduce it as, so to speak, an evening job for the Secretary of State for Justice. I personally do not think the two functions are compatible. The Secretary of State for Justice is a Minister in a Government that will have its own political views and collective responsibility for them. The Lord Chancellor historically has always had a slightly different role in standing up within Government for the interests of the justice system. It is very difficult to see how those two functions could be combined in a single individual. Indeed, when one looks at what is being proposed now, one can see just what the problems are that could arise. The Secretary of State for Justice’s proposals are in large part proposals that a Lord Chancellor, had there still been an independent Lord Chancellor, would have stood up against.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultCan I ask 
defaultyou
default one supplementary question, paying due regard to what you said, which I agree with? The position of the Secretary of State/Lord Chancellor, as he now is, is that he may decide that the cost of judicial review is such that changes ought to be made if possible. Do you think that he is entitled to take into account the cost, in a time of austerity, to propose any changes at all?
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: Certainly, but cost is not a unitary thing. First of all, there is the cost of funding litigation; that falls partly on primary individuals or companies, partly on the legal aid fund, and partly on Government as the typical respondent, or local government as an even more typical respondent to judicial reviews. The cost of going to law may well be part of the cost of functioning at all in a civilised society, not regularly but from time to time. The second tranche of costs is maintaining courts to hear judicial review applications. The judicial review payroll and cost roll has been heavily inflated in recent years by immigration and asylum appeals. They are a tranche that, when I was last sitting in the Court of Appeal, occupied about a third of its entire work. That is being hived off now increasingly to the Upper Tribunal in the tribunal system and contained there, with much more occasional excursions of real issues of law that need a higher court to the Court of Appeal and/or the Supreme Court. So, those costs are well able to be contained in a justice system, which does not have, in order to contain them, to shut out public interest challenges. Indeed, the case for shutting out public interest challenges is destroyed in the consultation paper itself by the admission that they succeed more often than others.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Berridge:default defaultI have a
default q
defaultuestion
default 
defaultfor
default Professor Sunki
defaultn. The latest consultation paper refers to the fact that the use of judicial review has expanded massively in recent years; I do not think a timeframe is given for that. Is there evidence to support that assertion? Can you give us some high-level aspect of any such evidence? 
defaultProfessor defaultMaurice defaultSunkindefault: This is a very key question; it comes back to a point that Professor Jowell was referring to earlier. This is a debate about rule of law. In so far as there are restrictions to the rule of law, those restrictions have to be clearly justified. One of the 
defaultbest ways of justifying restrictions is by producing evidence. The evidence base being used here asserts that there has been a substantial increase in the use of judicial review over the last decades. The inference is that that increase has been generated largely by an increase in the abuse of the system. This assertion is widely made and has been repeated time and time again, but actually, if one looks at the statistics, it is a very difficult assertion to find supported. As Sir Stephen Sedley said, the immigration case load is a very substantial proportion of the judicial review case load, but if one leaves aside the immigration case load, the evidence does not show that there has been a substantial increase in the use of judicial review. In fact, the official statistics used by the courts and Government reveal that, in non-immigration civil judicial review cases over the last 15 years or so, case numbers have remained fairly constant at just over 2,000 a year. That is 2,000 non-immigration civil judicial claims. These are applications for permission. I am not talking about hearings in the court, because of course in judicial review proceedings there are two stages. The claimant first applies for permission and only if permission is granted will the matter get to court. I am talking about therefore applications for permission, which have remained constant at about 2,000 to 2,400 or 2,500. By any measure, that is not a large number compared with the number of decisions taken by Government annually. It is infinitesimal and it has not increased. 
defaultThe big question in my mind is why judicial review is not being used much more than it is. It is a real surprise. If there is a concern about this area, it is about the potential under-use of judicial review. Related to that is the much bigger question of why these statistics, which are clearly misleading, keep being repeated. One can only infer that they are being repeated with the intention to soften up the political and public mood for change and reform. Looking at it as an academic, the statistics do not justify the claim that judicial review is being abused or that it is increasing. 
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Buckland:default defaultThank you very much indeed, Professor, and for your written submissions as well. I note that it was a joint submission with Varda Bondy as well, and we are grateful to her. To be fair to the Government, in the figures that were produced at the time of the original consultation, immigration cases were placed fairly and squarely within those statistics. However, I accept the point that is being made that transfer to the upper tier is likely to produce a change. I was interested in some of the figures that you produced about future projection for JRs. With the change to the immigration cases, what is your view as to the likely number of JRs? I know that you cannot give an exact prediction, but how are things going to look at the end of next year?
defaultProfessor defaultMaurice defaultSunkindefault: It is always much easier to know what is happening now, or what has happened in the past, than it is to predict what is going to happen in the future. With the immigration cases being transferred to the tribunal system, then I would predict the numbers of civil cases will remain fairly constant at around the 2,000 level. There may well be other reforms relating to other aspects of the procedure that will diminish the numbers of those cases as well.
defaultMr Buckland:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Berridge:default defaultSir Stephen, could you outline the 
defaultpowers
default there are, if there are, for the courts to deal with abuses of judicial review process? When you were sitting as a judge, were there abuses of that process that you did not have the power to deal with?
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: There were and will always be attempts of abuse. I am not conscious of ever having had to put up with one that I could not deal with. The typical forms of abuse will not be addressed by the Secretary of State’s proposals, because they are conducted by litigants in person who have a bee in their bonnet, whom very little will deter short of an order barring them from the courts. Even then, they are able to apply to lift the order in any particular case. They are not dependent on legal aid and they are not dependent on getting lawyers to act for them. Over the years I encountered a good many whom it was necessary and perfectly possible to tell, “You cannot come here.” The paper that I have asked if I could supply to you—it seems to be circulated—which is a draft of a lecture that I just happened to have completed when I was asked to come and give evidence, contains some examples of politely showing would-be litigants the door. We are quite good at that. 
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default defaultProfessor Sunkin
default, i
defaultn your research you were able to identify four cases which went to a final hearing in which you said it might be claimed that the claimant had no apparent direct and tangible interest. I ought to declare an interest as the honorary President of one of those organisations, the Child Poverty Action Group. Is that an argument in favour of the proposed changes to a narrower test, because you said it would make a difference in practice? Or were those four cases examples of the kind of judicial review challenges that the rule of law requires that there should be an opportunity to bring?
defaultProfessor Sunkindefault: The first thing I would say is that we were only able to identify four, and of course this is our own identification, so there may well have been some others. These are substantive hearings; these are not applications for permissions. There may well have been others that were brought that the courts have filtered out at the earlier permission stage. That we were only able to identify four certainly shows this does not appear to be a massive problem in terms of numbers. My suspicion is that, whatever one does to the rules, there will always be individual cases of significance and difficulty that may well embarrass Government. That we were only able to identify four certainly shows there is not a new quantitative problem. 
defaultLooking at each of the cases, in none as far as I can remember was the issue of standing raised by the defendant; I do not think the issue of standing was questioned, in other words. In one of the cases there was a comment from the judge, who emphasised it was an issue of public importance that the case be determined. As Sir Stephen Sedley has indicated, when courts are dealing with judicial reviews, they are very astute in trying to identify those who are abusing the system and in exercising their discretion at the permission stage. In relation to the standing issue, they will all take account of the public interest of the matter. In each of those cases therefore, one can assume, and in certainly one of the cases it was specifically said, that there was public interest in having the matter determined. 
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultSir Stephen, in your lecture you defend the concept of public interest litigation. Why are the courts the right place to determine public interest, rather than a democratically elected 
defaultGovernment
default? Is there not a danger, as one of your former colleagues described, that the judges will be the judicial branch of Government?
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: Heaven forbid that that should happen. Neither the judges nor Government would like that to happen. The problem lies in the ambiguous use of the phrase “public interest”. To call it public interest litigation is a shorthand portmanteau term for 
defaultdescribing litigation that is bought not by one individual, or group of individuals, to defend their private interests, but by some organisation or body to stand up for the legality of an action in some public sphere. The other meaning is one the Secretary of State has put on it in paragraph 80 of the consultation paper: “The principle that Parliament and the elective Government are best placed to determine what is in the public interest.’’ That is of course not only right but an essential proposition. However, it is mischievously deployed to suggest that the courts have been usurping that function by themselves deciding what is in the public interest. I hope this Committee might be able to ask the Secretary of State for Justice for a single example of a case in which the court has interfered with or struck down a government measure on the grounds that it is not in the public interest. I am certainly not conscious of ever having done so or indeed having been invited by a responsible lawyer to do so. What the courts are concerned with is the legality of a measure; whether the person coming to challenge the legality of it acts in their private interest or in a public interest does not matter, so long as they have standing. The important thing is the courts do not intervene on the grounds of what they conceive to be the public interest. If I may, I will send the Committee a short passage from a recent tribunal of the Supreme Court proving something I said in that regard, which I believe to be a universal approach of the courts—they do not intervene on grounds of public interest. Paragraph 80 of the paper is wrong to suggest they do.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultOf course, legality has become perhaps a little more flexible as a concept since the Human Rights Act, where the courts are required to take into account the 
defaultStrasbourg
default jurisprudence, the convention being a living instrument. There is room, would you agree, for the judges to have a little more input in interpreting what legality is than perhaps they did before?
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: Yes. Even without the Human Rights Act, proportionality, as you will know, Lord Faulks, would be making its way into public law on the very simple basis that it cannot be lawful to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Legality in that broader sense will of course introduce a measure of value judgment. It is quite true that the courts have to be very careful. I would argue that ever since the Human Rights Act came in, the courts must structure their decisions on proportionality so it can be seen what value they are giving to the different elements, in particular so it can be seen by an appellate court that no more has been done than is proper, to evaluate governmental action without substituting the court’s view on the right way to go. If you take the recent case of the young couple, she British, he Chilean, they could not live together in this country because of an immigration rule that forbad under-21 couples from living together, purportedly designed to strike at forced marriages. The decision had to take a very careful look at whether it was actually going to have much effect at all on forced marriages, compared with the colossal effect it was going to have on perfectly innocent, above-board marriages. The Supreme Court was able, as my court was in that case, to say it just does not add up. I agree; it is a ticklish business.
defaultLord Faulks:default There was a strong dissenting speech from Lord Brown in that particular case.
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: There was indeed.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultCan I ask you now about the Human Rights 
defaultAct
default and the concept of victim? This has been quite elastically interpreted by the 
defaultStrasbourg Court
default and courts following that. However, the suggestion is that there would be a direct interest test for standing, as opposed to the current test, which is arguably a little more elastic than that. Is there anything wrong with 
defaultlimiting somewhat those who can bring judicial review proceedings? Is that an illegitimate restriction on access to justice by the Secretary of State? 
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: No. There is nothing wrong with it at all. As I pointed out in that lecture text, in relation to the 
defaultRose
default 
defaultTheatre
default case, Mr Justice 
defaultSchiemann
default, as he was then,
default put his finger on the fact that if you were too elastic there would be nothing that was not 
defaultsufficient
default in the case to bring proceedings.
default 
defaultThat is why in 200 and more years the courts
default have been very cagey about what they are prepared to regard as a sufficient interest. They have not delimited it to victim status, or some analogue of that in common law. They have equally been very resistant to the idea that anybody can come to court to complain about anything. The paper does trace the care with which the courts attempted to do that. 
defaultWith the elastic formula, as it is, of a sufficient interest, it leaves it for the courts to say what is sufficient. My argument is we that have done really rather well in preventing absolutely anybody from coming to complain about anything, while at the same time being prepared to look at illegalities of the part of central Government that might otherwise go unaddressed. The 
defaultRose
default 
defaultTheatre
default was actually a very good example of that. No individual could possibly claim a personal right or interest in preserving the remains of the 
defaultRose
default 
defaultTheatre
default from destruction. That it was a public issue that anybody ought to have been able to bring to the attention of the court not in their own but in the public interest—using that phrase again—seemed to me incontestable. 
defaultLord Faulks:default Suppose the judges decided—and this is judge-made law for the most part—to extend, and extend, and extend the concept of those who could bring judicial review cases. Would that be something on which a democratically elected Parliament could say enough is enough?
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: A democratically elected Parliament can do anything it pleases, but as to whether it would be justified in doing so, yes, if that postulate were ever to come about. I see nothing in the Government’s consultation papers to suggest that it has come about. If there were something, I would resist it very strongly and suggest that the judges have been over-catholic, over-generous, in whom they are prepared to hear. If anything, the complaints go the other way, and we are a bit too tight about it.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Berridge:default defaultA short supplementary: there is a lot being made of this change from sufficient to direct interest. From the cases you have heard, can you give some flesh on the bones, if 
defaultpossible
default, as an example of a case that might now be caught by that more stringent test and would not satisfy the standing to come before the court? As someone who is not a practitioner, I am struggling to see what practical difference it will make to standing. 
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: I think the Pergau Dam case is actually singled out in the consultation paper as the kind of case that ought not to be brought. I dealt with that in short form in this draft lecture. I should say, if I may, for the record, Lord Chairman, that what I quoted from William Waldegrave on the last page has not yet been checked against the tape—so it should not be taken as verbatim accurate.
defaultBaroness Berridge:default I know that it is the Government’s view actually outlined on that case, but this obviously will be a judicial decision when the standing is changed. Do you agree with the view that this would be the type of case that would now not be able to be brought?
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: That appears to be the intention. I am just looking to see whether the Pergau Dam case is dealt with. In any event, the idea is undoubtedly to do that and shut up public interest challenges, with the illogical exception, which has been forced on central Government by the Aarhus Convention, of environmental cases. The Aarhus Convention gives us an international obligation to entertain environmental challenges to Government, whether there is a personal interest at stake or not. So, the realism of a broad standing rule is recognised by the Aarhus system but for some illogical reason will be confined to environmental cases if the Secretary of State gets his way.
defaultProfessor Sir Jeffrey Jowelldefault: Can I give a further example? Corner House brought the case against the DPP, saying that he really ought to have continued prosecuting for corruption against BAE in respect of the Saudi Arabian sale of planes. This was on the grounds that the prosecution was only abandoned when the Saudi Arabians threatened that they would no longer be involved in sharing intelligence with the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default. They were given very generous standing in that particular case. The result of the case in the House of Lords was that prosecutorial discretion should no longer be available to be challenged. It is a kind of discretion that should be challenged in very rare circumstances. The granting of broad standing in that case allowed the judges to clarify an area of the law that was unclear. It was therefore brought into the public interest in the sense of it being an area of law that should be clarified. They are bringing something to the table that nobody else could bring, and we are using it as an opportunity not to expand interference on substantive grounds but to contract it. 
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: Let me just revert to Baroness Berridge’s question. Pages 8 and 9 of my draft lecture deal with the Pergau Dam case. I will make another point that may go to Baroness Lister’s interests, which is that not all public interest litigation is hostile; it can be creatively used, and has been in the past. The Child Poverty Action Group was a pioneer in this respect, to elucidate the law to the benefit of everybody who is involved. Social security is a very good example, because it is an arcane and hideously complex area of law, where it is easy to get things wrong and a mistake can affect millions of people. It is very much to the advantage of everybody if the Government collaborates with challengers like the CPAG in getting the issue to the core.
defaultThe Chair:default Professor Sunkin, you wanted to make an observation.
defaultProfessor Sunkindefault: I think it has probably already been covered, but in the context of standing, looking at rather more parochial-type issues, one of the difficulties is knowing exactly what would be meant by a direct link. There are a good many cases where there may be a dispute about whether there is a direct link. To take an example, there have been challenges to the closure of libraries. Does a claimant challenging the closure of a library have to be a user of a library or be interested in the closure of the library? Does he have to show how many books he has taken out, and so on and so forth? These sorts of issues are very unclear. At the moment one can deal with this without having to specify whether or not there is a direct link. One of the difficulties is the possibility of unintended consequences of a new generation of quite technical disputes about what does or does not constitute a direct link. That could take our law back to the early years before the reforms of judicial review were introduced in the mid-1970s. 
defaultSir Stephen Sedleydefault: In the 
defaultRose
default 
defaultTheatre
default case, when the company was disaggregated, Laurence
default&#xa0;
defaultOlivier, Peggy
default&#xa0;
defaultAshcroft and the historian Andrew
default&#xa0;
defaultGurr had to be put forward as people with a special interest in the preservation of the remains. There is something utterly artificial about that; we all have an interest in it.
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultWe might all have an interest in the legality of the war in 
defaultIraq
default. 
defaultIt is difficult to establish, unless you have lost somebody or are directly affected, that you have sufficient standing.
defaultSir Stephen Sedley: defaultThat may be an example of why public interest standing is worth having
default. 
defaultSuppose that a 
defaultG
defaultovernment did break the 
defaultNuremberg
default 
defaultl
defaultaw
defaults
default by launching a completely unprovoked war of aggression
default. 
defaultWhy should anybody not be able to challenge that?
defaultThe Chair:default defaultOn that extremely important point
default,
default I would like to thank you all
default. 
defaultWe have finished in time with one minute to spare
default—
defaultthe only evidence session that I have chaired 
defaultsince
default 2010
default where that has happened. 
defaultIt is a comment on your ability to sum up very concisely and I thank you for that
default. 
defaultIf, as you have suggested, you might want to add to this evidence, it would be extremely helpful if you wrote to us
default. 
defaultThank you very much

defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultMichaeldefault&#xa0;defaultFordham defaultQCdefault, 
defaultFeizaldefault&#xa0;defaultHajat OBE, defaultHead of Housing and Community Safety Law, 
defaultBirmingham
default 
defaultCity
default Council
default, and 
defaultKarendefault&#xa0;defaultAshton, defaultPublic Law Solicitors
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default defaultGood morning and welcome
default. 
defaultThis second panel deals with judicial review and access to justice
default. 
defaultCould you introduce yourselves, please, for the record?
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultMy name is Karen
default&#xa0;
defaultAshton
default. 
defaultI am a practising solicitor with the firm Public
default&#xa0;
defaultLaw
default&#xa0;
defaultSolicitors in 
defaultBirmingham
default. 
defaultI specialise in public law and judicial review work and particularly social welfare work.
defaultFeizal Hajat: defaultGood morning
default. 
defaultI am Feizal
default&#xa0;
defaultHajat
default. I am the 
defaultHead of Law at Birmingham City Council Legal Department.
defaultMichael Fordhamdefault: I am Michael
default&#xa0;
defaultFordham
default. 
defaultI have been a barrister specialising in public law for over 20
default&#xa0;
defaultyears and I have represented claimants, NGOs and public authority defendants including central Government.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultFordham, this 
defaultquestion
default is mainly aimed at you but if the other two witnesses wish to add anything, please do so
default. 
defaultCould I ask you, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFordham, what is the link between the provision of legal aid and access to justice in the area of public law
default? Is it purely a question of maintaining compliance with Article
default&#xa0;
default6?
defaultMichael Fordham: defaultNo, not at all
default. 
defaultArticle
default&#xa0;
default6 is an important reference point for access to justice and, no doubt, for this Human Rights Committee, but it is not in any way an exclusive prism through which one looks at access to justice any more than the Aarhus
default&#xa0;
defaultConvention is an exclusive prism through which one looks at the parameters of public interest litigation
default. 
defaultTo take a straightforward example, the Government accepts that high standards of due process are appropriate in asylum cases where you have asylum claimants
default,
default and the courts have always sought to secure effective judicial protection in that as the top of the list of most important cases
default. 
defaultThat is not an Article
default&#xa0;
default6 scenario
default. 
defaultArticle
default&#xa0;
default6 does not cover asylum decision
default-
defaultmaking
default,
default and there are many, many examples of situations, both public law and human rights, where Article
default&#xa0;
default6 does not provide you with the answer as to what effective judicial protection means and
default,
default therefore
default,
default what access to justice under the rule of law means.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default defaultDo either of you want to add to that
default? 
defaultIf not, could I move on then to the question of judicial review and the alleged increase in the cost to taxpayers
default? 
defaultIs this a legitimate concern or is the question an irrelevant one to pose given the evidence that we have just heard?
defaultMichael Fordham: defaultIt is a legitimate concern to look at judicial review and its use and what it means in terms of public money
default. 
defaultFirst, 
defaultto 
defaultleave aside legal aid for a moment, every judicial review case involves a public authority
default. 
defaultEvery judicial review case is therefore defended at public expense
default. 
defaultThat is part of the equation that you will not find in these materials
default. 
defaultIt is very striking that every single proposal that is put forward is a restrictive one that is 
defaultfocused
default on what claimants and NGOs do with any public money that claimants have access to
default. 
defaultThe question of speed and streamlining of public law and the question of cost saving are very important questions that should be being looked at
default. 
defaultI am involved with the Bingham
default&#xa0;
defaultCentre in looking at precisely those kinds of questions, but you have to do it in a broader way and, if 
defaultI may say so, an even
default&#x2011;
defaulthanded way that looks at all of the aspects in which public money is used in public law proceedings.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultDo 
defaultany
default of you have any thoughts or suggestions about how we could have some cost saving within compliance of the rule of law?
defaultFeizal Hajat:default 
defaultLord Chair, if 
defaultI may say a few things on behalf of 
defaultBirmingham
default, w
defaulte are on the cusp of implementing the biggest cuts in our history, to the tune of £130
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, and cost
defaults
default 
defaultare 
defaulta huge thing on our minds currently
default. 
defaultWhat we say about that in relation to judicial reviews and challenges to local authorities is 
defaultwhether 
defaultthere 
defaultare 
defaultother ways in which, as a profession, 
defaultwe 
defaultcan resolve these differences and whether there are more streamlined processes that we can adopt
default. 
defaultI am particularly attracted by the representations made to this Committee by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in relation to the pre
default&#x2011;
defaultaction protocol letter and the requirement for both parties to address whether alternative dispute resolution has been considered and, if it is has, why it has been ruled out
default, and a
defaultlso in relation to neutral evaluation by an independent party, which would offer a quick resolution to, particularly, issues around public sector equality duties
default. 
defaultThe volume of judicial reviews that 
defaultBirmingham
default deals with is twofold
default. 
defaultThere is what I call the transactional in nature
default or 
defaultthose where we are alleged to have not abided by our statutory duty
default—
defaultand it is quite right that where 
defaultBirmingham
default falls down it is challenged
default. 
defaultHowever, it is the nature 
defaultin 
defaultwhich we resolve those challenges and it requires both sides, not just claimants but also defendants, to be able to come together in the interests of the public purse to find other ways to resolve the dispute
default. 
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultFor the purposes of the record, several people have addressed me as Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultChair
default. 
defaultI know that I announced my retirement in 2015 last week, but people should not read into that anything and my colleagues here from the other place will not be offended by this, but I have absolutely no intention at all of becoming a 
defaultP
defaulteer
default. 
defaultLord
default&#xa0;
defaultFaulks.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultThank you, Chairman
default. On t
defaulthe question of the connection between rules on standing and the rule of law, we heard
default—
defaultand I think you heard the evidence
default—
defaultabout the fact that judges generally think that they have had a pretty restrictive approach to who can or cannot bring judicial review cases
default. 
defaultI would like your comments on how that relates generally, the decision 
defaultof 
defaultwho can bring these cases, to concepts of the rule of law.
defaultFeizal Hajat: defaultCan I take it this way
default? 
defaultWe ought to pause in looking at these proposals in isolation and at this moment in time, not least because what 
defaultBirmingham
default has to do going forward will result in what I call the provision of ordinary local authority services, homelessness and the like, by other means of production
default. That is, 
defaultwe will deliver what we would call a multi
default&#x2011;
defaultsector service provision
default,
default where statutory and other duties on behalf of local authorities are delivered by myriad organisations
default. 
defaultIt might be in co
default&#x2011;
defaultproduction with employee co
default&#x2011;
defaultops; it might be in corporate bodies; it might be in relationship with third sector organisations; it might be the likes of Capita, G4S
default. 
defaultWe do not know what the landscape will look like, but the issue of standing becomes much more complicated
default,
default and if you were to 
defaultfocus on the now, by 
defaultlimit
defaulting 
defaultthe type and nature of interest that can bring these proceedings, it would be a mistake
default. 
defaultWe ought to look towards the landscape that is to come in order to enable parties who have different types of interests to be able to
default act. 
defaultThe suppression should 
defaultbe at the pre
default&#x2011;
defaultaction protocol, alternative dispute resolution
default. 
defaultIt is one public purse
default. Is it that
default we all come together as legal professionals and say we all operate within one financial envelope
default? 
defaultRestrict costs on both side
defaults,
default not just one side
default. 
defaultTherefore, in the short
default 
defaultterm we may have more challenges, but the cost incentive is that we all want certainty and to be able to reduce cost.
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultTherefore, you would not want to restrict those who can bring proceedings, but you want to make them cheaper, if possible.
defaultFeizal Hajat: defaultYes.
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultI do not want to try to repeat anything that the first panel said that flows down from bringing great expertise to the subject of standing, but I do want to add one perhaps practical dimension
default. 
defaultThere was a lot of discussion in the first panel about the types of cases where things that are outstanding might prevent a case 
defaultfrom 
defaultbeing brought
default,
default and they are cases that are perhaps most widely discussed
default. 
defaultThere are a number of cases that could be affected by standing that perhaps are slightly lower profile, which are those groups of cases where there are individuals on whom the decision impacts but there is a risk that the case will not be brought if an NGO does not step in and become involved
default. 
defaultThat is especially where the group of people affected are particularly vulnerable or where, if the challenge is brought on a case-by-case basis, the public authority involved might simply resolve that individual case without addressing the underlying systemic issue and so the wider group is still affected
default. 
defaultOne example of that goes back some years now, but it is when Help
default&#xa0;
defaultthe
default&#xa0;
defaultAged became a joint claimant in proceedings brought to challenge a local authority’s approach to provision of residential care for older people where the local authority was not stepping in at the point that the capital threshold was reached
default—I do not want to get too technical with this—
defaultbut was allowing the individual savings to be reduced to the level of funeral expenses before providing residential care
default. 
defaultHelp
default&#xa0;
defaultthe
default&#xa0;
defaultAged became a joint claimant in those proceedings because it was concerned that if it was simply brought by individuals the issue would be resolved on a case
default-
defaultby
default-
defaultcase basis and the underlying policy would not be addressed
default. 
defaultTherefore, there are decisions that do have a direct effect on individuals but none
default 
defaultthe
default 
defaultless will not be resolved
default,
default or their legality will not be properly addressed
default,
default unless an NGO can become involved
default,
default and those cases are at risk as well
default. 
defaultThere is a very important aspect of the rule of law in practice where you have decision
default-
defaultmaking policies that are directly impacting on individuals’ lives but the process simply will not work
default. 
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default 
defaultThat is very helpful and moves 
defaulto
defaultn
default 
defaultto the next question, because in contrast to that the Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultChancellor, as you know, has suggested that charities and similar organisations target the legal system as a way of trying to get their policies accepted
default. 
defaultThis is initially to Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultHajat, but anyone can come in after that, of course
default. 
defaultDo 
defaultyou 
defaultbelieve that judicial review has come to be used as a mechanism to undermine the role of Parliament and of elected local and national Government
default,
default and can you provide us with any examples of cases where you consider the challenge was simply being used as a delaying tactic or a campaigning tool?
defaultFeizal Hajatdefault: I have produced some figures for the Committee; I am not sure whether you have those before you
default. 
defaultThe Chair:default defaultYes, thank you, we did receive them.
defaultFeizal Hajat: defaultAs you will see, most of the proceedings here are what I call transactional
default. 
defaultHowever, if you look at the council tax reduction scheme
default, 
defaultthe background, as you will remember, is the Welfare Reform Act
default; t
defaulthe Government reduced its grant to local 
defaultg
defaultovernment by 10%
default. 
defaultFor 
defaultBirmingham
default, that was a reduction in terms of council tax in the region of £10
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion and there was a requirement on local authorities either to adopt what is called the default scheme or to produce its own scheme
default,
default and a number of local authorities across the country decided to develop their own schemes
default. 
defaultIn terms of campaigning and relationships between voluntary organisations and solicitors, there is some evidence
default—
defaultand I make no 
defaultjudgment
default about the relationship or the reason for bringing proceedings
default—of
default some element of issues of the day or
default,
default if I can call it
default this
default without being too provocative, issue farming, for want of a better word
default. This is
default where solicitors, barristers and groups get together and look at what issues 
defaultthat 
defaultare relevant to those parties and their interests should be challenged and which authority
default. 
defaultIn this case, Lambeth, other 
defaultLondon
default boroughs, 
defaultBirmingham
default and 
defaultSheffield
default all received letters before action
default. 
defaultFortunately for 
defaultBirmingham
default, Lambeth and 
defaultSheffield
default were chosen in relation to proceedings for judicial review
default. 
defaultWe breathed a sigh of relief, although the letters before action required costs 
defaultfor
default counsel in drafting responses to the tune of £3,000, but we would rather that than thousands of 
defaultp
defaultounds defending a claim in relation to judicial review
default. 
defaultIs it incumbent on legal professionals to talk with others 
defaultregarding
default how they pick these challenges
default? 
defaultDoes every local authority have to be targeted in relation to the same issue
default? A
defaultlthough we do not have direct impact
default, 
defaultin relation to campaigning and specific policy matters, we have evidence, both locally and from national solicitors, of this kind of issues of the day and picking of defendants
default. 
defaultThat is what we have and we cannot speak beyond those two things
default. 
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default Does 
defaulteither of you want to make any 
defaultcontribution
default to that
default?
defaultMichael Fordhamdefault: May I just briefly say 
defaultthat 
defaultI cannot see an abuse here at all
default. 
defaultI see no abuse here at all, still less any abuse relating to the standing rule
default. 
defaultThe premise for all of this is that we are talking about claims that can satisfy a conscientious judge at the very start that they are properly arguable points of law, that they have practical substance, 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are brought promptly, 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is no alternative remedy and 
defaultthat 
defaultthe person has a sufficient interest or 
defaultthat 
defaultit is in the public interest that the claim should proceed
default. 
defaultTrue it is there are particular issues that get advanced, but cases that meet those tests are viable and continue
default,
default and cases that do not meet those tests cannot proceed
default. 
defaultI simply do not see an abuse in a process that applies those rigorously and allows only those cases to go ahead.
defaultKaren Ashtondefault: 
defaultCould I
default just make one comment very quickly on this point as well
default? 
defaultI agree completely with Mike about this
default. 
defaultThe evidence in the 
defaultp
defaultaper itself
default—
defaultI think this was mentioned by the earlier panel
default—
defaultis that the cases brought by organisations have a greater success rate
default. 
defaultThis is not about absolutely empty threats or the systematic bringing of cases with no merit
default. 
defaultThis is about raising before the courts real issues of lawfulness of central Government or local 
defaultg
defaultovernment action
default. 
defaultAs I say, there is no evidence in the 
defaultp
defaultaper or elsewhere of any abuse
default. 
defaultI will just make one c
defaultomment on the issue of claimant
default solicitors or legal teams organising themselves
default. 
defaultI do not have direct experience of what has just been described, but none
default 
defaultthe
default 
defaultless, again, if there is a general issue that needs to be brought before the court
default,
default it is in everyone’s interest that that is brought in an organised way by a lead case and we do not have a situation where we have numerous cases being brought in a disorganised way
default. 
defaultIn fact, when that does happen, 
defaultand it 
defaulthappens more frequently than the level of organisation that is being described, in practice the Administrative Court tends to pick that up and liaises with legal teams to decide which should be the lead case
default and
default which cases should be stayed
default. 
defaultIf that can be done before issue, so much the better, in my view.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Berridge:default 
defaultObviously
default,
default at the 
defaultmoment
default what we have is the mixing of the proposals or the effect of the proposals about standing and the proposals, at the same time, regarding legal aid, so we have to try to think of that in one go
default. 
defaultIs there going to be an effect of those two things coming together, in your view, on access to justice?
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultI am not sure this is going to address your question directly, but perhaps I can talk about the impact of the legal aid aspect of the proposals
default,
default and that may lead in to looking at how that relates to or links in with standing
default. 
defaultThe main aspect of the proposals, which is the legal aid aspect, is the proposal not to pay the claimant’s legal team 
defaultfor 
defaultpre
default&#x2011;
defaultpermission costs if permission is refused or the case is issued and is settled or withdrawn prior to the permission stage
default. 
defaultTherefore, in effect, the claimant’s legal team would take the risk of no payment at all for that work
default. 
defaultThat risks having a very serious impact on access to justice because of the impact that is going to have on practitioners who act 
defaultas the
default claimants
default. 
defaultSet that against the backdrop of the current fees paid for legal aid work, which are, in the public law category, a fixed fee of £259 at the legal help level
default,
default and when you go on to certificated rates
default,
default we are talking about a rate of £67.50
default. 
defaultThis is outside 
defaultLondon
default, of course; I practise outside 
defaultLondon
default. 
defaultThat must be compared with the guideline rates currently paid for High Court work, which indicates the normal solicitor and client rates, which vary between, for the least experienced paralegal
defaults and
default 
defaultclaimant 
defaultsolicitors
default,
default £118
default&#xa0;
defaultper hour 
defaultand
default £217
default&#xa0;
defaultan hour for the highest
default-
defaultgrade solicitors, 
defaultwith 
defaultover eight years
default’
default post
default&#x2011;
defaultqualification experience
default. 
defaultI have 20
default&#xa0;
defaultyears
default’
default post
default&#x2011;
defaultqualification experience, so I am paid, for certificated work by the Legal Aid Agency, at the moment, £67.50 compared 
defaultwith
default an accepted general inter partes rate of £217
default. 
defaultIt is less than a third
default: we
default are already acting at risk.
defaultThe Government, if it is not intending to impact on access to justice, must be assuming that practices can have sufficient surpluses to take the risk that is being proposed. That is not the case. We do not have those kinds of surpluses. Therefore, it seems to me that what is going to happen is either practitioners will continue to withdraw from practice in legal aid or—and I think this is the more likely scenario, at least in the short term—practitioners will be forced to add another layer, if you like, of their own eligibility or threshold criteria. Therefore, someone may be eligible for legal aid: they meet the financial criteria; they cannot afford representation themselves.
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultWe do need to make progress now
default, so 
defaultcould you be a little more concise in your answers, please
default? 
default 
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultThere is not a lot of legal aid about at the moment, in general terms
default. 
defaultIf I go into a public hospital and I consider myself to be the victim of medical negligence and I have a substantial potential claim, lawyers will not get legal aid to represent me or anybody else in that situation and, if they want to take the case, will only get paid if they are successful
default. 
defaultThat is, so we 
defaultwere told during the course of the last Bill, because of the financial condition of the country
default. 
defaultWhy is judicial review different where the public authority is being challenged
default? 
defaultI appreciate all that you say about the limited funds available
default,
default and I am not suggesting for a moment that the people who do this work are well paid, but why is there a difference?
defaultMichael Fordham: defaultIn your example, you can take a case on a no win, no fee, but if you win it has an uplift consequence
default.
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultNo, it does not.
defaultMichael Fordham: defaultWell, it depends which case and which model you are operating, but if you are on a CFA that enables you to get paid, you will be able to access an uplift, which can cross
default&#x2011;
defaultsubsidise other work that you do
default. 
defaultWhat is different about this situation is two things
default. 
defaultFirst, these judicial review cases, which in good faith have been judged as viable, where you cannot predict what is going to happen and you cannot be certain or confident that you are going to need or get permission, will not be brought
default. 
defaultThey will not be viable, because legal aid practices will not be able to balance the books if they are not able to be paid for that very important stage of work
default. 
defaultThat is point one
default. 
defaultPoint two—I come back to it—is that public money is spent on both sides in judicial review cases, and I would like somebody to explain, please, why it is that if somebody is spending public money for a good faith judgment of the prospect of success, it is said that they should not be paid if a judge does not agree with them if they act on the claimant side, whereas on the public authority side, they know the importance of effective legal representation, and that means that people should get paid for work that they do, because judicial reviews should be properly argued on both sides.
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultAnother difference with judicial review, of course, is that the kind of case we are talking about is an event that has happened
default;
default it does not change
default,
default and therefore 
defaultyou can
default make 
defaultjudgment
defaults on the basis of possibility of success and it is very easy to define what success means, which is why you have 
defaulta 
defaultconditional fee market
default that has
default developed in relation to private law litigation
default. 
defaultIn judicial review you do not
default; you may well, 
defaultand this is the problem between issuing and permission
default;
default events may overtake the decision that is being challenged
default,
default and the case may become academic or may be settled in different ways
default. 
defaultTherefore, it is much more difficult for that 
defaultkind of 
defaultconditional fee arrangement
default,
default with the necessary insurance products that are associated with it
default, to work,
default and it has not developed with judicial review
default. 
defaultIt is a very different type of litigation.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Buckland:default defaultI want to ask Karen
default&#xa0;
defaultAshton a further question about the proposal within the 
defaultc
defaultonsultation to deal with meritorious claims that are made but are settled before the permission stage is reached
default. 
defaultThere is a proposal there for the LAA to apply some criterion
default,
default in its discretion, 
defaultto 
defaultmake orders where no order for costs has been made
default. 
defaultWhat is your view about that proposal
default? 
defaultDo you think it is a workable solution or do you think it is too narrow?
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultThere is an inherent problem with it, which is it is after the event and the 
defaultjudgment
defaults that we are going to have to make as practitioners are whether we can sustain the financial risk in advance
default. 
defaultWe are going to have to impose, as I say, the decision-making criteria at that earlier stage
default. 
defaultTherefore, there is an inherent problem
default in an after-the-
defaultevent 
defaultdiscretion, particularly when the Legal Aid Agency already is the body that
default grants the legal aid initially
default on the basis 
defaultthat 
defaultha
defaults 
defaultsufficient merit
default—the problem
default 
defaultis the 
defaultidea that somehow it would change its mind at a later date and withdraw
default. 
defaultTherefore, why can there not be a decision in advance
default? 
defaultWhy does it have to be after the event
default? 
defaultHowever, the nature of the particular discretion that is being proposed is on very broad criteria
default;
default it involves factors such as late disclosure, which might affect the assessment of your merits beyond the control of the practitioner, and the 
defaultjudgment
default is being made by the very organisation that will have an interest in not paying
default. 
defaultFor all those reasons
default,
default I do not think it will be the basis on which practitioners will be able to make 
defaultjudgment
defaults on acting that are any better than they would 
defaultbe 
defaultwithout the discretion
default. 
defaultObviously, it is better than nothing, but I do not think it goes very far in solving the problem.
defaultThe other problem with it is the proposal to assess merit, so there is one factor about assessing the prospect of getting permission, but it is at the point of settlement
default. 
defaultThe reason probably the case is being withdrawn is 
defaultthat 
defaultsomething has happened whereby it would be pointless to go to permission
default. 
defaultTherefore, the prospects of assessing permission are necessarily going to be low at that point, so it is assessing merit at the wrong point.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Buckland:default 
defaultI am very grateful
default. 
defaultIn general, do you think that the proposals are going 
defaultto 
defaultlead 
defaultto 
defaulta situation where agreement of costs between the parties will be encouraged or do you think 
defaultthat 
defaultit will have the opposite effect
default,
default 
defaultin
default that we will have more hearings solely on the issue of costs?
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultI think it will go both ways
default. 
defaultThe starting point is there is already an incentive on us to seek and agree costs, because we are already paid at much reduced rates, so
default if we settle with them, there is a great incentive to seek costs;
default it is not that claimant solicitors are not seeking costs
default. 
defaultClearly, the same principles on costs would apply, but there will be pressure on claimant solicitors to make the application for costs if they are not going to sort it any other way and there will be ancillary disputes that develop
default. 
defaultMy other concern is 
defaultthat, 
defaultin discussions to try to get agreement on costs, claimant solicitors are going to be at an unfair disadvantage in those negotiations, because if the alternative is not being paid at all
default,
default it seems to me that the public authority defendant could exploit that negotiating position to their advantage
default. 
defaultIn that situation, claimant solicitors could start accepting settlements that are well below the usual rate for payment
default.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultCan I ask you about the question of investigating a 
defaultcase
default? 
defaultThere comes a time sometimes when your assessment of the prospects of success in a case are such that you do not think it has any future, but you need to investigate it in order to come to that conclusion
default. 
defaultThe Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultChancellor has said that funding will remain for the earlier stages of a case to investigate the prospects and strengthen the claim and for pre
default&#x2011;
defaultaction correspondence
default. 
defaultIf that remains, do you think that is sufficient to maintain access to justice and to comply with the need for there to be such access?
defaultKaren Ashton: defaultI do not want to answer all the questions, but that is something I can answer from the point of view of a practitioner
default. 
defaultThe resources available for investigating a case are either 
defaultto do it
default under legal help with a fixed fee of £259 or, if it is going to involve substantial investigation work, you can apply for an investigative help certificate, which will cover further investigation
default. 
defaultThe guidelines on that used to be if it required six hours of work, but that is to 
defaultthe point of determining whether or not it has more than 50% probability of success
default. 
defaultThat will not necessarily address the situation where practitioners are in some difficulty in taking cases with a lower
default-
defaultend prospect of success, because of the financial risk that they are taking
default. 
defaultTherefore, whil
defaulte
default, yes, obviously we welcome the fact that that funding is to remain in place, it does not address the problems 
defaultthat 
defaultI have already talked about or, in fact, the non
default&#x2011;
defaultpayment of a number of thousands of 
defaultp
defaultounds on permission applications once that stage has been completed in a situation where legal aid practitioners, say, do not have any surpluses to support that kind of financial risk.
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultThe possibility of compulsory pre
default&#x2011;
defaultaction disclosure has been discussed on the basis that
default,
default the more you know at an earlier stage
default,
default the less you may have to spend
default. 
defaultI notice that the Bingham
default&#xa0;
defaultCentre is considering that as a possibility
default,
default and it may be, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultFordham, you have something to say about this.
defaultMichael Fordham: defaultThat is a good idea and it is good that it is recognised that it is important there be public funding at the initial stage
default,
default and it is good that it is recognised 
defaultthat 
defaultthere should be public funding at the post
default&#x2011;
defaultpermission stage
default. 
defaultThe difficulty is the blind spot that takes away funding or introduces such a deterrent that you cannot do the most important thing of all, which is to lodge a proper claim informed by what you have discovered at stage one
default. 
defaultThe second point is that there is a solution
default. 
defaultIf this is about abuse, a judge has a duty to certify cases that are brought unreasonably
default—
defaulttotally without merit
default. 
defaultIf you are going to start depriving people of their fees because you think they have behaved unreasonably, that is the perfect mechanism
default. 
defaultIt does not involve new ancillary proceedings and it is a proportionate solution
default. 
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultLord
default&#xa0;
defaultFaulks, we are going straight to question 21.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultYes
default. 
defaultIf a threshold to determine whether an error would have made no difference is lowered to a test based on likelihood, would it be possible 
defaultfor
default the courts to avoid putting themselves into the role of primary decision
default-
defaultmaker
default? 
defaultI think this is a reference to a number of cases about consultations and reconsulting and then having exactly the same result afterwards.
defaultMichael Fordham: defaultAt the moment, the court will say, “If it is clear that this flaw makes no difference or would make no difference, then we will not grant judicial review
default,
default” and that is because courts recognise cases need practical substance
default. 
defaultIf you recalibrate that
default—
defaultif Government recalibrates the test that the courts have articulated
default—
defaultthen it will inevitably make judicial review more restrictive and it will inevitably make judges descend into the arena of the merits of the decision
default. 
defaultIn a case called 
defaultCotton 
defaultthat the Government refers to in its consultation
default&#xa0;
defaultpaper, these principles were articulated by Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultBingham when he was Lord
default&#xa0;
defaultJustice
default&#xa0;
defaultBingham
default. 
defaultThey have been very well developed and they are there because process matters and they are there because judges do not second-guess public authority decision
default-
defaultmakers
default. 
defaultWhat they do is to make public authority decision
default-
defaultmakers apply the standards of due process unless it is clear that there is no utility in granting judicial review, in which case they save everybody public money.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default 
defaultPerhaps I can address this question particularly to you, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultHajat
default. Regarding t
defaulthe no difference 
defaultargument
default, do you think there is an advantage in considering that earlier in the 
defaultprocess so as to try 
defaultto
default avoid costs
default? 
defaultWould that be an attractive option for, in your case, local 
defaultg
defaultovernment?
defaultFeizal Hajat: defaultIt has been recognised in the 
defaultp
defaultaper itself that the determination of that issue would inevitably result in a full day’s hearing or more
default,
default and I think that there is no saving there
default. 
defaultI am with Michael on the issue o
defaultf
default the current test being applied at the permission stage and for judges to certify whether something is reasonable or unreasonable
default. 
defaultIn our experience, if you look at most of the cases that come before us, they are settled at the letter before action stage and there are the others that go forward
default. 
defaultThe focus should be on the public purse and how to resolve them and I am not sure that that will result in any saving or in 
defaultthe
default cutting of any delay.
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultThank you very much
default. 
defaultAs with the first panel, you have managed to keep to time
default. 
defaultI apologise for cutting you off occasionally
default. 
defaultIf you feel that we have not covered all the points, we would be very pleased to hear from you

defaultTo remind you, we are dealing with judicial review and the public sector equality duty
default. 
defaultFor the record, could you introduce yourselves, please?
defaultHelen Mountfielddefault: I am Helen
default&#xa0;
defaultMountfield QC
default. 
defaultI am a barrister
default. 
defaultI have done a number of cases in the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty
default both for claimants and defendants, including the first case.
defaultMark Hammond: defaultI am Mark
default&#xa0;
defaultHammond
default. 
defaultI work as Chief
default&#xa0;
defaultExecutive of the Equality and Human

defaultRobert Haywarddefault: I am Robert
default&#xa0;
defaultHayward
default. 
defaultI was Chairman of the Public Sector Equality Duty Red Tape 
defaultr
defaulteview undertaken for the Government over the last few months.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultHayward, 
defaultcould
default I begin with your very polite letter of 29
default&#xa0;
defaultNovember, which seeks to make sure that there is no confusion about the steering
default&#xa0;
defaultgroup’s recommendation in relation to 
defaultpublic sector equality duty. 
defaultCan we take it from your letter that you would be opposed to any suggestion that the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty
default ought not to be legally enforceable
default? 
defaultRobert Hayward: defaultAbsolutely
default. If
default I can clarify that, as far as we were concerned the 
defaultr
defaulteview was undertaken relatively quickly
default. 
defaultWe were confronted by a huge range of issues
default. 
defaultWe concentrated specifically on data collection and procurement, but we also touched on other issues
default,
default and our recommendation in relation to judicial review I hope is reasonably clear
default. 
defaultReally, what we are seeking in light of the evidence that we received from councils in particular was
default, 
defaultand I think we have heard from Birmingham just now
default, 
defaultincreased expedition because of the associated cost rather than doing away with the process
default—
defaultquite definitely not.
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default 
defaultThis question follows on from that and your recommendation that there are 
defaultquicker
default and more cost
default-
defaulteffective ways of reconciling disputes relating to the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty. 
defaultCan you perhaps expand a bit on how you reached that conclusion and, more importantly, what you consider would be appropriate alternative ways to reconcile disputes relating to 
defaultthe 
defaultPSED?
defaultRobert Hayward: defaultIn relation to the first half of your question, Baroness
default&#xa0;
defaultLister, can I make an observation
default? 
defaultWhat happened was 
defaultwe 
defaultreceived evidence in a number of different ways, including going out to meet authorities and other bodies
default. 
defaultOne of the things that struck us when we went out to meet authorities, major authorities
default—
defaultone major city council and a county counci
defaultl—
defaultwas how conscious they were of the cases that were going through the process of judicial review and how they tended to freeze decisions
default. 
defaultAs one major city council put it to us, “If we are in the position of either ourselves being taken to judicial review or another local authority where we do the same thing, 
defaultand that
default in quarter one we are trying to effect £1
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion savings, if that takes four quarters to be completed, by the time we get to the fourth quarter we have to make the equivalent of £4
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion of savings, which impacts, clearly, four times as much as it would have done had the action been taken in the first 
defaultquarter
default.
default”
default 
defaultThat is the reason we made the recommendation, because we were struck by councils not only being confronted by their own cases but looking over their shoulder at cases that were applying to other councils; I think we heard that in the previous panel
default. 
defaultWe did not address 
defaultt
defaulthe second point in relation to ideas
default. 
defaultThere was one barrister on our steering group
default. 
defaultI am not a lawyer and therefore we made the recommendation that Government should look at it rather than looking at options.
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default 
defaultT
defaulthis 
defaultis
default t
defaulto our other two witnesses, please
default. 
defaultDo you agree with the steering group’s finding that
default, 
defaulteven when decisions are overturned on judicial review due to non
default&#x2011;
defaultcompliance with the PSED
default,
default it is not uncommon for the initial decision to remain unchanged and “it is not clear how this benefits anyone”?
defaultHelen Mountfield: defaultThere are two answers to that
default. 
defaultThe first is the point that Michael
default&#xa0;
defaultFordham made in the previous session that law is about process
default. 
defaultIt is not telling people what the result is
default. I
defaultt is saying you must think about this
default:
default you must give due—that is, proportionate—regard to it, so that is the appropriate role of the court.
default 
defaultThe second is that I do not recognise that, from the cases that I have done, as the result
default. 
defaultIf I can give you just one or two practical examples
default, t
defaulthere was a case in 2008 against Ealing
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil, which was reconfiguring its domestic violence services in a way that would preclude funding for specialist services for black
default and 
defaultminority ethnic women
default. 
defaultThat decision was quashed on judicial review for failure to give due regard to equality and the grant funding going forward was reconfigured
default. 
defaultThere have been cases involving dress codes in schools, where a dress code says you just cannot wear a bracelet, when it has been said you have not thought properly about equality for Sikhs
default. 
defaultThat uniform code has been quashed and had to be amended
default. 
defaultThere was a case against Haringey
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncil in 2010 when they made a major planning decision to redevelop an area
default. 
defaultThey had a lot of policy guidance on equality, but they had not applied it to the decision
default. 
defaultThey had not thought about the implications of that decision for small and medium
default&#x2011;
defaultsized enterprises that were largely owned by minority communities in the area
default. 
defaultThat decision was quashed and they had to rethink the planning decision, not because it was a bad decision as a whole to redevelop the area, but because that was a factor that must be taken into account and was taken into account
default. 
defaultThere has been a case in 
defaultDevon
default about how you set care home fees and they had not thought properly about the additional costs of care for people with dementia
default. 
defaultConsequently, people with dementia had a smaller choice of private sector provision than others
default. 
defaultThat decision was quashed
default and
default those care home fees were set on a differential basis.
default 
defaultThere have been cases about a taxi licensing decision in Liverpool where they had not appreciated that the taxi they were going to licen
defaults
defaulte that they thought was accessible to all disabled people was not, so they rethought the decision and they made some exceptions to their licensing policy
default. 
defaultThere have been cases in the context of housing where people with mental health difficulties lose their homes as a result of antisocial behaviour
default. C
defaultourts, as a result of the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty
default, will say, before making a possession decision, “Has this person’s community care needs been addressed?” because it may not be proportionate to make them homeless
default—
defaultstreet homeless
default—
defaultin those circumstances if due regard has not been given to their mental health needs.
defaultThat is the practical effect of some of the cases that I am aware of
default,
default and the other important effect is that of course litigation is a longstop
default. 
defaultThis is not all about disputes
default. 
defaultIt is about a duty 
defaultto mainstream thought about equality that, as the courts have said in the past, has played regrettably little role in public sector decision
default-
defaultmaking because it has not been enforceable
default;
default it has fallen off the end of the to
default&#x2011;
defaultdo list
default. 
defaultThe idea, I think, is that you have a duty, the courts explain in quite clear and practical terms what the duty is, that it is enforceable and how it is enforceable, and then decision
default-
defaultmakers feed it into their decision
default-
defaultmaking process because they do not want to act unlawfully
default. 
defaultTherefore, it has an effect beyond the decided cases
default,
default and I am aware of that also from my practice
default:
default that public sector decision
default-
defaultmakers will come and say, “We want to cut this or reconfigure that
default. H
defaultow do we do it in a way that ensure
defaults
default we take into account relevant considerations?”
default 
defaultI do not tell them what to do
default. 
defaultI tell them the sorts of things they need to think about.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Buckland:default 
defaultThis is a question to Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultHayward
default. 
defaultYou have 
defaultalready
default referred to the findings of the steering group relating to judicial review
default. 
defaultIf the steering group did not want to remove it altogether, how did they envisage it remaining available after the exhaustion of alternative processes
default? 
defaultI think the concern of the 
defaultg
defaultroup was duplication
default,
default delay and additional cost
default. 
defaultHow do you see the two systems meshing together?
defaultRobert Hayward: defaultIn relation to alternatives, in answer to a previous question I said that we did not look at that in detail
default. 
defaultWe sought guidance through the Civil
default&#xa0;
defaultService as to whether there may be alternatives, but I do not think it is beyond the wit of man
default. 
defaultAfter all is said and done, there are already some processes under judicial review
default—again, 
defaultI am not here as a legal expert
default—
defaultin terms of permission and the like, and there are other legal matters that I am experienced with in relation to tribunals, et
default 
defaultc
defaultetera, 
defaultwhere one goes 
defaultthrough
default employment tribunals, where one goes 
defaultthrough
default reviews and the like
default. 
defaultHowever, we are talking here about expedition, primarily, and that was our key objective and our key concern
default—
defaultthat things were not drawn out, because we received this series of evidence not that cases would not be won but that they were taking so much time that the net effect was to hit the budgets of the councils in a disproportionate way
default. 
defaultMr Buckland:default 
defaultTherefore, you think alternative methods could reduce that cost and delay.
defaultRobert Hayward: defaultWe hoped that they could
default. 
defaultWithin the legal frameworks that are in operation
default,
default we hope that people would be able to find ways of achieving that.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Berridge:default 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultHammond, can 
defaultI 
defaultbring you in at this point
default? 
defaultWhat would be the effect, if any, in your view, of the removal of judicial review on the effectiveness of the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty? 
defaultHave you given some thought to what alternative mechanisms, if that were to happen, for enforcing the 
defaultd
defaultuty would better ensure that the needs of those people with protected characteristics were taken into account in decision
default-
defaultmaking?
defaultMark Hammond: defaultWe have given some thought to it but
default,
default as Rob has outlined, it is still fairly early days in its consideration
default. 
defaultWe have a number of specific enforcement powers around the PSED, as having broad oversight of it, but we very much view those, as Helen said, as a longstop ourselves
default. 
defaultOur objective with the PSED is that everyone achieves 
defaultthe
default better policymaking that the 
defaultd
defaultuty entails rather than that we are able to say we have managed to take enforcement against A, B and C
default. 
defaultThat is why we have put so much effort into the guidance and advice and encouragement and cajoling that we have with public bodies
default. 
defaultI can see a slight danger in looking at alternative mechanisms, as the previous panel echoed
default. I
defaultf one introduced a mandatory judicial review mechanism in between, say, a pre
default&#x2011;
defaultaction letter and the courts
default,
default that might divert a certain number of cases and reduce a certain amount of cost
default. 
defaultH
defaultowever, it would open up a seriou
defaults question then as to whether that was mandatory only for those cases that had already qualified, as the previous panel was 
defaultsaying
default, or whether you would then need to widen the funnel to those that might not have qualified for a full judicial review because of some factor but ought to qualify for some mandatory mechanism
default. 
defaultIt would be possible to construct mechanisms that ended up costing the public purse more rather than less, depending on how widely that funnel ran.
defaultOur own powers, as I say, are available on the general duty but are very cumbersome in terms of the pre
default&#x2011;
defaultactions and the terms of referencing that we have to do
default. 
defaultThey are simpler on the specific duties, but they are so narrow that it does not really have any
default real
default impact
default. 
defaultWe would be happy, certainly, to look at a role we might play in some sort of mandatory mechanism, but we would need to look at the powers we have
default. 
defaultHowever, we would always argue that it is essential that judicial review does remain as a final option in any instance.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Berridge:default 
defaultGoing back to the first part 
defaultof
default the question and the other side of the coin, what do you think would be the effect of the removal of judicial review for the equality duty?
defaultMark Hammond: defaultIf I put 
defaulton 
defaultmy previous hat 
defaultas 
defaultthe Chief Executive of a council, I think it would be that some of the impetus
default or
default imperative to make sure that the decisions we were taking were fully in accordance with the PSED would undoubtedly be lost.
defaultHelen Mountfield: defaultCould I just chip in there
default? 
defaultBefore the first modern 
defaultpublic sector equality duty
default was 
defaultintroduced, the r
defaultace equality duty, there was in fact an equivalent
default but
default only target
default 
defaultduty on local authorities
default,
default and it was never enforced and no
default 
defaultone was aware of it
default. 
defaultIn that first case, which was brought against the Ministry of Defence in 2005, the reason the Ministry of Defence lost that case was they had simply not given any thought at all to the 
defaultd
defaultuty when they were doing something that obviously had serious race implications
default. 
defaultTherefore, if you do not have something legally enforceable, people are not aware of it.
default 
defaultThe other important point is that if you took that public law wrong
default—
defaultyou must do this
default, 
defaultbut you cannot enforce it legally
default—
defaultit would be contrary to the rule of law and it would also send a message that giving due regard to equality does not matter anymore; you cannot do anything about it if somebody does not
default. 
defaultTherefore, it is an essential mechanism
default.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default 
defaultI have two questions for Ms
default&#xa0;
defaultMountfield
default. 
defaultYou were implicitly partly answering the question 
defaultin
default your previous answer to me, but in your own experience acting in judicial reviews involving PSED disputes how important have these cases been to the overall equality law framework
default? 
defaultWhat do you think would be the potential impact, if any, on protected groups of people if it was not possible to enforce the duty through judicial review?
defaultHelen Mountfield: defaultThey play an enormously important part in the framework because
default,
default of course
default,
default since the 1970s brave individuals have been able to take 
defaulttort claims
default if they think that they have been discriminated against
default. 
defaultHowever, that is practically impossible and it does not address structural questions
default. 
defaultThat is why the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty
default was introduced in the 
defaultlight of the findings of the Stephen
default&#xa0;
defaultLawrence 
defaulti
defaultnquiry
default. 
defaultWhen Sir
default&#xa0;
defaultWilliam
default&#xa0;
defaultMacpherson talked about institutional racism in the police, he was not talking about an institution full of racists
default. 
defaultHe was saying
default,
default 
default“H
defaultere is an institution where the needs of minority ethnic communities have been left out of our thinking
default,
default and what this is for is to ensure that we, as public authorities, guard against that future disadvantage
default.” 
defaultTherefore, when it was introduced with all
default&#x2011;
defaultparty support, that duty was introduced to ensure that it was no longer just lip
default&#x2011;
defaultservice and not the people who make decisions and know what they know just making the decisions as they go, but asking the questions to enable them to identify what we need to do to promote equality of opportunity,
default and
default what we need to do to foster good relations
default. 
defaultIn the first case, Lady
default&#xa0;
defaultJustice
default&#xa0;
defaultArden 
defaultin the 
defaultElias
default case
default said 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is an integral and important part of the mechanisms for ensuring the aims of anti
default&#x2011;
defaultdiscrimination legislation
default. 
defaultMy perception, having practised in discrimination law for 20
default&#xa0;
defaultyears or so, is that it has had an enormous effect just on awareness of what those aims are and a normative language that these things matter because Parliament has said they are needs
default. 
defaultWe should be trying to do it; this is a useful way of doing it.
default 
defaultI have said that I think the duties have a practical effect; they are not just red tape
default. 
defaultThey change the way people think over time
default. 
defaultWe are in early days and I agree with Rob
default&#xa0;
defaultHayward and his 
defaultr
defaulteview that you cannot abolish something until you have seen how it works.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Faulks:default defaultMs
default&#xa0;
defaultMountfield, you said that you are asked to advi
defaults
defaulte quite often about the 
defaultpublic sector equality duty
default and you do not tell the 
defaultbodies
default what decision to make but tell them how to make it
default. 
defaultIn your experience, do public authorities or those who have to take these decisions find it difficult to interpret what the duty is?
defaultHelen Mountfield: defaultI think they find it less difficult in light of the 100
default 
defaultor so court decisions that have now gone through, particularly the key decisions of the Court of Appeal, because those set out in very clear and practical terms what authorities do
default. 
defaultThey say this is not about filling in a particular form
default. 
defaultThis is not about thinking about the impact of buying air
default-
defaultconditioning units on transgender people
default. 
defaultIt is about saying what equality effects might this have
default. 
defaultLet us think about how this might affect people
default. 
defaultLet us think about what we do not know and let us find out, so that we do give due regard to equality
default. 
defaultIf we are going to reconfigure our libraries so that there are fewer of them, let us address the obvious accessibility issues and see what we can do within the available budget to avoid it having that effect
default. 
defaultIf we are going to have a school uniform policy, let us think about whether it is a policy that is appropriate to foster good race relations or relations between different religious groups
default. 
defaultWhat are the issues
default? W
defaulthat should we be thinking abou
defaultt? W
defaulthat information do we need
default? I
defaultt really is in support of good public sector decision-making and best value and ensuring people are included.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default 
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultHammond
default—
defaultMr
default&#xa0;
defaultHayward, you might want to comment as well
default—t
defaulthe steering group made recommendations with regard to the role of the 
defaultc
defaultommission, other regulators, inspectorates, and relevant ombudsmen in supporting the implementation of the duty
default. 
defaultCould you please outline briefly the 
defaultc
defaultommission’s view of its own enforcement role and that of the regulators, inspectorates and relevant ombudsman services?
defaultMark Hammond: defaultCertainly
default. 
defaultAs I started to say in talking to Baroness
default&#xa0;
defaultBerridge’s question, our objective in this exercise entirely 
defaulti
defaults that all bodies are abiding by the standards Parliament has said they should
default. 
defaultWe do not count success, as it were, in the number of cases we end up taking
default. 
defaultIn a sense, that is a failure on our part to bring people into compliance
default. 
defaultTherefore, the 
defaulttwo legs that we have particularly concentrated on are the material we provide to all forms of public authority, both generally on the duty and what is required and with specific sectors and decision
default-
defaultmaking
default. 
defaultThat remains a key part of it and, as the 
defaultr
defaulteview suggested, we will continue with our board to look at the material we provide and how we can improve that in the light of the feedback we get.
defaultWe also work directly at times both with groups of public bodies, through 
defaultbodies such as the 
defaultLocal Government Association, 
defaultand with 
defaultsome of the regulators
default. 
defaultI was meeting last week with the Chief
default 
defaultExecutive of the Care
default&#xa0;
defaultQuality
default&#xa0;
defaultCommission, which is a very important partner of ours, talking exactly about how the work they do can pick up our expert input into the sort of assessments they do of how people that they are responsible for are complying
default. 
defaultTherefore, the more that we can work through other regulators, through the forum that we convene among regulators
default,
default to ensure that everyone understands what is required for compliance, how that can be done
default and 
defaultwhat sort of cases, as Helen said, have come along that might change the view people take
default—
defaultthe more information they are able to have, hopefully, through us
default—
defaultthen the higher the standards they will be able to meet.
defaultRobert Hayward: defaultI do not have anything to add at this stage, in the interests of brevity as much as anything else.
defaultBaroness Lister of Burtersett:default I am sure the Chair will be pleased.
defaultThe Chair:default 
defaultI am getting something of a reputation
default. 
defaultWe have been extremely successful this morning
default. 
defaultI congratulate you
default,
default along with the other two panels, 
defaulton 
defaultgetting
default through an enormous amount of work on time
default.
