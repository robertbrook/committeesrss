[normal]ICAEW welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence in connection with the House of Lords 
[normal]Economic Affairs Committee: Finance 
[normal]Bill Sub-committee’s call for evidence for its inquiry into the Finance Bill 2014
[normal] draft clauses, including the taxation of partnerships
[normal].
[normal] Comments have been invited on two topics, namely
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould be happy to discuss any aspect of our comments and to take part in all further consultations on this area
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Information about the Tax Faculty and ICAEW is given below. We have 
[normal]also set out, in Appendix 
[normal]1
[normal], the Tax Faculty’s 
[normal]Ten T

[normal]a referral scheme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Draft Finance Bill 2014 clauses propose legislation affecting four aspects of partnership tax:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In this submission, we confine our comments to the first two of these proposals as these will be of the greatest concern to a large number of partnerships.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The law on partnerships dates from the Partnership Act 1890. A partnership is transparent for tax purposes. Consequently, although a partnership must submit a tax return each year 
[normal]showing
[normal] the 
[normal]partnership profits, any profits are allocated to the partners and taxed on them, with individual partners paying income tax in respect of any allocated share of partnership profits through their own personal tax returns.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Limited liability partnerships (L
[normal]LPs) were introduced in 2000 to provide an alternative business structure. However, the tax rules for LLPs follow those for ordinary partnerships. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All partnerships are treated in the same way no matter how many partners are in the partnership. Historical
[normal]ly there were some limits on the number of partners that could form a partnership although many types of professional partnerships were exempted from this requirement and in 2002 the upper limit was abolished entirely. The vast majority of partnerships in 
[normal]the UK have only 
[normal]two
[normal] or 
[normal]three
[normal] partners
[normal],
[normal] but some (usually professional) partnerships are very large, with 500 partners or more. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The tax rules for partnerships are not 
[normal]always 
[normal]easy to understand. Most of the guidance on practical application 
[normal]and 
[normal]practices 
[normal]for taxing partnerships is set down by HMRC in guidance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The increasing divide between employment law and tax law leads to more uncertainty, complexity and unfairness as individuals are taxed as employees
[normal],
[normal] but w
[normal]ithout
[normal] equivalent 
[normal]employment rights. The proposals to tax LLP salaried partners as employees will add a further group of individuals who will be in this position. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The papers
[normal] and supporting documents
[normal], published on 10 December 
[normal]2013 
[normal]run to 
[normal]a total of 
[normal]117 pages. The draft legislation is highly complicated and we are still analysing the detail of the proposals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are concerned that the proposals are too complex for practical implementation and are disproportionate to the problem
[normal]s
[normal] they are attempting to resolve. The stated 
[normal]objectives
[normal] of the proposals are to level the playing field and to tackle tax avoidance, but we are not convinced these proposals support the objectives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LLPs are a flexible and competitive commercial structure 
[normal]and
[normal],
[normal] since they were introduced
[normal],
[normal] the number of them ha
[normal]s
[normal] grown considerably. However, the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these new rules will significantly undermine the 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]case for using an LLP. There are serious commercial implications to 
[normal]this new legislation and we consider it likely that business
[normal]es
[normal] will now favour using 
[normal]a company structure, even if an LLP might have been a better structure
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The anti avoidance legislation in new s
[normal] 
[normal]863C, ITTOIA 2005 is particularly 
[normal]difficult to understand
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]appears to 
[normal]rely on deciding whether arrangements have been put in place with a main purpose of ensuring that someone is not a salaried member. 
[normal]On our reading of this legislation, potentially all salaried members would be within the legislation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Exam
[normal]ple 17 of the Technical guidance provides a simple illustration
[normal] of the problem
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P has been an employee of the DEF LLP. She has reached that point in her career where she is offered membership.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In order to become a member, P needs to invest in the LLP. Sh
[normal]e has some capital of her own, and the LLP arranges with the Bank for her to have a normal commercial loan to cover the balance. An undertaking is given that on P’s retirement from DEF LLP, the firm will pay back the loan directly out of P’s capital accoun
[normal]t and, if necessary, any undrawn remuneration, with full recourse against P if these amounts prove insufficient.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These arrangements have been put in place to enable P to become a full member of the DEF LLP. They have not been put in place to enable P to e
[normal]vade 
[normal](sic)
[normal] 
[normal]being a Salaried Member. P faces genuine risk, she has invested in the DEF LLP and does owe the Bank money, which she will need to repay and, in the interim, she will have to pay interest.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In our view, b
[normal]ecoming a full member
[normal],
[normal] on terms akin to t
[normal]hose of a partner in a traditional partnership, is not avoiding being a Salaried Member
[normal] and should clearly not be within the ambit of the legislation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]While we are pleased with this conclusion, and with the other 
[normal]examples designed to show the working of th
[normal]e Salaried Members test as a whole, we do not consider this compensates for the overly complex legislation itself
[normal]. T
[normal]his appears to be another example of ‘taxed according to the law but untaxed by concession’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, part of the rationale behind the
[normal] new rules is to stop profits being held in corporate form; but this will still 
[normal]happen
[normal] using simpler corporate structures instead.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Office of Tax Simplification has been conducting a review of partnership tax, the results of which were published on 22 
[normal]January 2014. Introducing complex legislation which will affect many businesses, potentially leading to structural change while the results of the review are still being considered
[normal],
[normal] seems an unnecessary complication
[normal] and does little to provide much needed s
[normal]tability and certainty to the UK tax system
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These proposed new rules introduce a significant additional compliance cost for LLPs. These are complex rules that will impact on 
[normal]setting up new business structures and then again to any 
[normal]change
[normal]s in business structures. Seeking advice on such rules will always tend 
[normal]to be 
[normal]more expensive 
[normal]due to 
[normal]its
[normal] highly specialist nature
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The guidance runs to 56 pages and includes numerous examples to assist users. While this is most welcome and helps users to 
[normal]understand the intended application, it is no substitute for simple 
[normal]and 
[normal]clear legislation. 
[normal]The rules appear to be quite widely drafted and potentially catch a number of situations which we do not think should be caught. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We agree that there should not be a presumption of self-employment for a member of an LLP, but 
[normal]conversely 
[normal]nor should there be a presumption of employment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HMRC’s guidance states that ‘The salaried member legislation is being introduced 
[normal]so that those members who are effectively in the position of employees will be taxed as employees whilst those members who are in a position equivalent to partners will continue to have the same tax treatment as partners.’ The proposals do not achieve this
[normal]. To do so
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]any tests should be by reference to the 
[normal]existing status test rules for income tax
[normal]. Instead, we have an entirely new set of 
[normal]tests proposed as new s
[normal] 
[normal]863B, ITTOIA 2005.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The existing rules for determining an individual’s employment status could be
[normal] used for an LLP. Since a large number of LLPs are likely to be professional partnerships, these are most likely to have the expertise necessary to interpret the exi
[normal]s
[normal]ting status test rules correctly. 
[normal]Thus, f
[normal]urther law should not be necessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These propos
[normal]als suggest that 
[normal]the existing law for identifying 
[normal]whether a person is 
[normal]employ
[normal]ed or 
[normal]self employ
[normal]ed is inadequate. If so, then we would have thought that those rules need to be reviewed and a comprehensive rule introduced that works for all business forms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he key issue here remains the disparity between the tax 
[normal]cost
[normal] of employment as opposed to self employment. This is a structural problem within the tax system caused by employers
[normal]’
[normal] NIC. This difference creates tension for many more taxpayers than just those i
[normal]n partnerships and is particularly problematic for freelancers. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]29.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are numerous practical problems with the detail of the legislation. 
[normal]Four e
[normal]xamples given to us by our members so far include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]30.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]hose 
[normal]LLP members subject to the new legislation 
[normal]will be taxed as employees from 6 April 2014.
[normal] This is too short a period to make any necessary changes given that at that date many LLPs will be part way thro
[normal]ugh an accounting period.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]ABC LLP 
[normal]has a year end of 30 April. Under the new rules, 
[normal]C 
[normal]will be 
[normal]treated as an employee from 6 April 2014. If the partnership decides to actually make C an employee from 2014/15, rather than just deeming him to be s
[normal]o for tax purposes, there is 
[normal]in our view 
[normal]insufficient time to rearrange his employment status.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe any change should apply from the start of the first accounting period after 6 April 2014.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are also concerned that the Real Time Information 
[normal]requirements have not been considered. The new RTI penalty rules are also effective from 6 April 2014 and we believe that the combination of the two could give rise to considerable administrative burdens
[normal] and practical implementation problems
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While we agree that the use of mixed membership partnerships for the sole purpose of avoiding tax on the profits drawn out of a business should be addressed to ensure that a fair amount of tax is paid
[normal], we do not agree with all the 
[normal]changes proposed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposals fail to accommodate the commercial and historic reasons why some businesses have a mixed partnership structure. For example, many businesses hold land within a corporate partner or use such a member to build up working cap
[normal]ital requirements. The fundamental rule of partnership tax is that all the profits are allocated each year to the partners and then each must pay their share of the tax. Of course the business could then choose to physically retain the cash representing so
[normal]me of the partners’ profit shares, but 
[normal]this results
[normal] in a relatively high charge on reinvestment as compared to retaining profits in a company
[normal].
[normal] The use of a company within an LLP structure therefore helps to narrow the tax disincentive to retain and reinves
[normal]t earnings which comes with just using an LLP.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Other mixed partnerships include a corporate partner as a member in order to access reliefs or tax credits only available to companies such as research and development tax credits
[normal] or for employee share schemes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]36.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As far as mixed partnerships are concerned
[normal],
[normal] we would like to see a de 
[normal]minimis
[normal] in order to exclude many of the small
[normal]est
[normal] businesses from the
[normal]se
[normal] proposals; we would prefer to see them excluded by legislation rather than by guid
[normal]ance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]37.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]After a period of consultation
[normal],
[normal] the Government adopted the Tax Consultation Framework in March 2011. The Framework set
[normal]s
[normal] out five stages of consultation: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]38.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In cases where tax avoidance was in point there might be the need to introduce measures without the prior consultation envisaged in the Framework. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The framework has provided an improved approach to designing, developing and implementing tax policy. How
[normal]ever, we have two particular concerns about it:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]40.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The problem with these impact assessments is that the figures o
[normal]ften appear to be based on a wholly unrealistic assessment of what changes are actually needed to implement any proposals and what management and due diligence processes are needed to ensure that any changes are correctly implemented. There is a need for c
[normal]onsultation with business and professional advisers at an early stage to identify in detail what needs to be done and by whom
[normal] so that such processes can be built in to any 
[normal]costings
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]41.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In relation to the second point, w
[normal]hile generally the process has improved there have been some examples where this has not been the case. 
[normal]I
[normal]f we take RTI again, we raised numerous concerns during the consultation process, particularly in respect of the timetable and the need to submit returns ‘on or before’ the payment date. While there have been welcome changes made as a result of the consult
[normal]ation process, we believe there should have been greater prior recognition of the potential problems and how they could have been addressed. 
[normal]We 
[normal]also 
[normal]have similar concerns with the rules 
[normal]that were 
[normal]introduced imposing an annual tax on enveloped dwellings
[normal] whi
[normal]ch looked to us to be largely unworkable
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In our meetings with Ministers we have said that we want the Chancellor to re-commit to a simpler tax system 
[normal]to
[normal] restore the tax system’s reputation for simplicity, stability and predictability. 
[normal]In our view t
[normal]he
[normal] pa
[normal]rtnership 
[normal]proposals are in direct conflict with that aim
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In November 2010
[normal],
[normal] the Government published a Roadmap for Corporation Tax which has been welcomed by business. We would now like a similar document to be published for perso
[normal]nal tax. Certainty about the taxes individuals must pay on their income and chargeable gains is a contributory factor to a business’s decision to base itself in the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]44.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The key elements of the business roadmap were: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]complex new rules on partnerships and offshore intermediaries 
[normal]should not be allowed to 
[normal]impact o
[normal]rdinary transactions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]46.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At Budget 2013, the Chancellor announced that the government would consult on changes to two aspects of the tax rules on partnerships in order to prevent tax loss ar
[normal]ising from: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]47.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It was proposed that t
[normal]hose changes w
[normal]ould 
[normal]take effect from 6 April 20
[normal]14. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]48.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The initial proposals were published in May 2013 and we responded to those in TAXREP 35/13
[normal] where we raised a number of concerns about the proposals
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]49.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While some of our concerns have been addressed, the fundamental challenges we made then are still present in the revised 
[normal]proposals set out above
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]50.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In summary, w
[normal]hile we welcome the new approach to tax policy making with 
[normal]its emphasis on 
[normal]i
[normal]mproved 
[normal]consultation, we consider that Government and its advisers 
[normal](
[normal]both 
[normal]in HM Treasury and 
[normal]HMRC
[normal])
[normal] need to 
[normal]do more to address 
[normal]the 
[normal]legitimate concerns 
[normal]on proposals 
[normal]expressed by business. 
[normal]In particular
[normal], creating more employees for tax purposes without regard to the e
[normal]mployment law position
[normal], while underestimating the costs and not recognising that 
[normal]business
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]may wish 
[normal]to retain profits for working capital
[normal],
[normal] shows a failure to understand 
[normal]how 
[normal]business
[normal]es operate. 
[normal]T
[normal]he proposals fail to reflect the need for a tax system that i
[normal]s simple and certain to operate and which aligns with business needs.
