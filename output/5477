defaultICAEW welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence in connection with the House of Lords 
defaultEconomic Affairs Committee: Finance 
defaultBill Sub-committee’s call for evidence for its inquiry into the Finance Bill 2014
default draft clauses, including the taxation of partnerships
default.
default Comments have been invited on two topics, namely

default,000 chartered accountants around 
defaultthe world. Through our technical knowledge, skills and expertise, we provide insight and leadership to the global accountancy and finance profession.
default&#xa0;
default5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur members provide financial knowledge and guidance based on the highest professional, technical and eth
defaultical standards. We develop and support individuals, organisations and communities to help them achieve long-term, sustainable economic value.
default&#xa0;

defaultThe Tax Faculty is the voice of tax within ICAEW and is a leading authority on taxation. Internationally recognis
defaulted as a source of expertise, the faculty is responsible for submissions to tax authorities on behalf of ICAEW as a whole. It also provides a range of tax services, including 
defaultTAXline
default, a monthly journal sent to more than 8,000 members, a weekly newswire and 
defaulta referral scheme.
default&#xa0;
default7.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Draft Finance Bill 2014 clauses propose legislation affecting four aspects of partnership tax:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn this submission, we confine our comments to the first two of these proposals as these will be of the greatest concern to a large number of partnerships.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default9.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe law on partnerships dates from the Partnership Act 1890. A partnership is transparent for tax purposes. Consequently, although a partnership must submit a tax return each year 
defaultshowing
default the 
defaultpartnership profits, any profits are allocated to the partners and taxed on them, with individual partners paying income tax in respect of any allocated share of partnership profits through their own personal tax returns.
default&#xa0;
default10.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLimited liability partnerships (L
defaultLPs) were introduced in 2000 to provide an alternative business structure. However, the tax rules for LLPs follow those for ordinary partnerships. 
default&#xa0;
default11.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll partnerships are treated in the same way no matter how many partners are in the partnership. Historical
defaultly there were some limits on the number of partners that could form a partnership although many types of professional partnerships were exempted from this requirement and in 2002 the upper limit was abolished entirely. The vast majority of partnerships in 
defaultthe UK have only 
defaulttwo
default or 
defaultthree
default partners
default,
default but some (usually professional) partnerships are very large, with 500 partners or more. 
default&#xa0;
default12.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe tax rules for partnerships are not 
defaultalways 
defaulteasy to understand. Most of the guidance on practical application 
defaultand 
defaultpractices 
defaultfor taxing partnerships is set down by HMRC in guidance.
default&#xa0;
default13.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe increasing divide between employment law and tax law leads to more uncertainty, complexity and unfairness as individuals are taxed as employees
default,
default but w
defaultithout
default equivalent 
defaultemployment rights. The proposals to tax LLP salaried partners as employees will add a further group of individuals who will be in this position. 
default&#xa0;
default14.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe papers
default and supporting documents
default, published on 10 December 
default2013 
defaultrun to 
defaulta total of 
default117 pages. The draft legislation is highly complicated and we are still analysing the detail of the proposals.
default&#xa0;
default15.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are concerned that the proposals are too complex for practical implementation and are disproportionate to the problem
defaults
default they are attempting to resolve. The stated 
defaultobjectives
default of the proposals are to level the playing field and to tackle tax avoidance, but we are not convinced these proposals support the objectives.
default&#xa0;
default16.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLLPs are a flexible and competitive commercial structure 
defaultand
default,
default since they were introduced
default,
default the number of them ha
defaults
default grown considerably. However, the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these new rules will significantly undermine the 
defaultcommercial 
defaultcase for using an LLP. There are serious commercial implications to 
defaultthis new legislation and we consider it likely that business
defaultes
default will now favour using 
defaulta company structure, even if an LLP might have been a better structure
default. 
default&#xa0;
default17.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe anti avoidance legislation in new s
default 
default863C, ITTOIA 2005 is particularly 
defaultdifficult to understand
default 
defaultand 
defaultappears to 
defaultrely on deciding whether arrangements have been put in place with a main purpose of ensuring that someone is not a salaried member. 
defaultOn our reading of this legislation, potentially all salaried members would be within the legislation. 
default&#xa0;
default18.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExam
defaultple 17 of the Technical guidance provides a simple illustration
default of the problem
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultP has been an employee of the DEF LLP. She has reached that point in her career where she is offered membership.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order to become a member, P needs to invest in the LLP. Sh
defaulte has some capital of her own, and the LLP arranges with the Bank for her to have a normal commercial loan to cover the balance. An undertaking is given that on P’s retirement from DEF LLP, the firm will pay back the loan directly out of P’s capital accoun
defaultt and, if necessary, any undrawn remuneration, with full recourse against P if these amounts prove insufficient.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese arrangements have been put in place to enable P to become a full member of the DEF LLP. They have not been put in place to enable P to e
defaultvade 
default(sic)
default 
defaultbeing a Salaried Member. P faces genuine risk, she has invested in the DEF LLP and does owe the Bank money, which she will need to repay and, in the interim, she will have to pay interest.
default&#xa0;
default19.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn our view, b
defaultecoming a full member
default,
default on terms akin to t
defaulthose of a partner in a traditional partnership, is not avoiding being a Salaried Member
default and should clearly not be within the ambit of the legislation
default.
default 
defaultWhile we are pleased with this conclusion, and with the other 
defaultexamples designed to show the working of th
defaulte Salaried Members test as a whole, we do not consider this compensates for the overly complex legislation itself
default. T
defaulthis appears to be another example of ‘taxed according to the law but untaxed by concession’. 
default&#xa0;
default20.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, part of the rationale behind the
default new rules is to stop profits being held in corporate form; but this will still 
defaulthappen
default using simpler corporate structures instead.
default&#xa0;
default21.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Office of Tax Simplification has been conducting a review of partnership tax, the results of which were published on 22 
defaultJanuary 2014. Introducing complex legislation which will affect many businesses, potentially leading to structural change while the results of the review are still being considered
default,
default seems an unnecessary complication
default and does little to provide much needed s
defaulttability and certainty to the UK tax system
default.
default&#xa0;
default22.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese proposed new rules introduce a significant additional compliance cost for LLPs. These are complex rules that will impact on 
defaultsetting up new business structures and then again to any 
defaultchange
defaults in business structures. Seeking advice on such rules will always tend 
defaultto be 
defaultmore expensive 
defaultdue to 
defaultits
default highly specialist nature
default. 
default&#xa0;
default23.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe guidance runs to 56 pages and includes numerous examples to assist users. While this is most welcome and helps users to 
defaultunderstand the intended application, it is no substitute for simple 
defaultand 
defaultclear legislation. 
defaultThe rules appear to be quite widely drafted and potentially catch a number of situations which we do not think should be caught. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default24.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe agree that there should not be a presumption of self-employment for a member of an LLP, but 
defaultconversely 
defaultnor should there be a presumption of employment. 
default&#xa0;
default25.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHMRC’s guidance states that ‘The salaried member legislation is being introduced 
defaultso that those members who are effectively in the position of employees will be taxed as employees whilst those members who are in a position equivalent to partners will continue to have the same tax treatment as partners.’ The proposals do not achieve this
default. To do so
default,
default 
defaultany tests should be by reference to the 
defaultexisting status test rules for income tax
default. Instead, we have an entirely new set of 
defaulttests proposed as new s
default 
default863B, ITTOIA 2005.
default&#xa0;
default26.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe existing rules for determining an individual’s employment status could be
default used for an LLP. Since a large number of LLPs are likely to be professional partnerships, these are most likely to have the expertise necessary to interpret the exi
defaults
defaultting status test rules correctly. 
defaultThus, f
defaulturther law should not be necessary.
default&#xa0;
default27.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese propos
defaultals suggest that 
defaultthe existing law for identifying 
defaultwhether a person is 
defaultemploy
defaulted or 
defaultself employ
defaulted is inadequate. If so, then we would have thought that those rules need to be reviewed and a comprehensive rule introduced that works for all business forms. 
default&#xa0;
default28.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe key issue here remains the disparity between the tax 
defaultcost
default of employment as opposed to self employment. This is a structural problem within the tax system caused by employers
default’
default NIC. This difference creates tension for many more taxpayers than just those i
defaultn partnerships and is particularly problematic for freelancers. 
default&#xa0;default29.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are numerous practical problems with the detail of the legislation. 
defaultFour e
defaultxamples given to us by our members so far include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default30.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthose 
defaultLLP members subject to the new legislation 
defaultwill be taxed as employees from 6 April 2014.
default This is too short a period to make any necessary changes given that at that date many LLPs will be part way thro
defaultugh an accounting period.
default 
defaultFor example, 
defaultABC LLP 
defaulthas a year end of 30 April. Under the new rules, 
defaultC 
defaultwill be 
defaulttreated as an employee from 6 April 2014. If the partnership decides to actually make C an employee from 2014/15, rather than just deeming him to be s
defaulto for tax purposes, there is 
defaultin our view 
defaultinsufficient time to rearrange his employment status.
default&#xa0;
default31.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe any change should apply from the start of the first accounting period after 6 April 2014.
default&#xa0;
default32.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are also concerned that the Real Time Information 
defaultrequirements have not been considered. The new RTI penalty rules are also effective from 6 April 2014 and we believe that the combination of the two could give rise to considerable administrative burdens
default and practical implementation problems
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default33.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile we agree that the use of mixed membership partnerships for the sole purpose of avoiding tax on the profits drawn out of a business should be addressed to ensure that a fair amount of tax is paid
default, we do not agree with all the 
defaultchanges proposed. 
default&#xa0;
default34.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals fail to accommodate the commercial and historic reasons why some businesses have a mixed partnership structure. For example, many businesses hold land within a corporate partner or use such a member to build up working cap
defaultital requirements. The fundamental rule of partnership tax is that all the profits are allocated each year to the partners and then each must pay their share of the tax. Of course the business could then choose to physically retain the cash representing so
defaultme of the partners’ profit shares, but 
defaultthis results
default in a relatively high charge on reinvestment as compared to retaining profits in a company
default.
default The use of a company within an LLP structure therefore helps to narrow the tax disincentive to retain and reinves
defaultt earnings which comes with just using an LLP.
default 
default&#xa0;
default35.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOther mixed partnerships include a corporate partner as a member in order to access reliefs or tax credits only available to companies such as research and development tax credits
default or for employee share schemes
default.
default&#xa0;
default36.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs far as mixed partnerships are concerned
default,
default we would like to see a de 
defaultminimis
default in order to exclude many of the small
defaultest
default businesses from the
defaultse
default proposals; we would prefer to see them excluded by legislation rather than by guid
defaultance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default37.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAfter a period of consultation
default,
default the Government adopted the Tax Consultation Framework in March 2011. The Framework set
defaults
default out five stages of consultation: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default38.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn cases where tax avoidance was in point there might be the need to introduce measures without the prior consultation envisaged in the Framework. 
default&#xa0;
default39.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe framework has provided an improved approach to designing, developing and implementing tax policy. How
defaultever, we have two particular concerns about it:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default40.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe problem with these impact assessments is that the figures o
defaultften appear to be based on a wholly unrealistic assessment of what changes are actually needed to implement any proposals and what management and due diligence processes are needed to ensure that any changes are correctly implemented. There is a need for c
defaultonsultation with business and professional advisers at an early stage to identify in detail what needs to be done and by whom
default so that such processes can be built in to any 
defaultcostings
default.
default&#xa0;
default41.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to the second point, w
defaulthile generally the process has improved there have been some examples where this has not been the case. 
defaultI
defaultf we take RTI again, we raised numerous concerns during the consultation process, particularly in respect of the timetable and the need to submit returns ‘on or before’ the payment date. While there have been welcome changes made as a result of the consult
defaultation process, we believe there should have been greater prior recognition of the potential problems and how they could have been addressed. 
defaultWe 
defaultalso 
defaulthave similar concerns with the rules 
defaultthat were 
defaultintroduced imposing an annual tax on enveloped dwellings
default whi
defaultch looked to us to be largely unworkable
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default42.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn our meetings with Ministers we have said that we want the Chancellor to re-commit to a simpler tax system 
defaultto
default restore the tax system’s reputation for simplicity, stability and predictability. 
defaultIn our view t
defaulthe
default pa
defaultrtnership 
defaultproposals are in direct conflict with that aim
default.
default&#xa0;
default43.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn November 2010
default,
default the Government published a Roadmap for Corporation Tax which has been welcomed by business. We would now like a similar document to be published for perso
defaultnal tax. Certainty about the taxes individuals must pay on their income and chargeable gains is a contributory factor to a business’s decision to base itself in the UK. 
default&#xa0;
default44.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe key elements of the business roadmap were: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default45.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default 
defaultproposed 
defaultcomplex new rules on partnerships and offshore intermediaries 
defaultshould not be allowed to 
defaultimpact o
defaultrdinary transactions. 
default&#xa0;
default46.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt Budget 2013, the Chancellor announced that the government would consult on changes to two aspects of the tax rules on partnerships in order to prevent tax loss ar
defaultising from: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default47.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt was proposed that t
defaulthose changes w
defaultould 
defaulttake effect from 6 April 20
default14. 
default&#xa0;
default48.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe initial proposals were published in May 2013 and we responded to those in TAXREP 35/13
default where we raised a number of concerns about the proposals
default.
default&#xa0;
default49.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile some of our concerns have been addressed, the fundamental challenges we made then are still present in the revised 
defaultproposals set out above
default. 
default&#xa0;
default50.default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn summary, w
defaulthile we welcome the new approach to tax policy making with 
defaultits emphasis on 
defaulti
defaultmproved 
defaultconsultation, we consider that Government and its advisers 
default(
defaultboth 
defaultin HM Treasury and 
defaultHMRC
default)
default need to 
defaultdo more to address 
defaultthe 
defaultlegitimate concerns 
defaulton proposals 
defaultexpressed by business. 
defaultIn particular
default, creating more employees for tax purposes without regard to the e
defaultmployment law position
default, while underestimating the costs and not recognising that 
defaultbusiness
defaultes
default 
defaultmay wish 
defaultto retain profits for working capital
default,
default shows a failure to understand 
defaulthow 
defaultbusiness
defaultes operate. 
defaultT
defaulthe proposals fail to reflect the need for a tax system that i
defaults simple and certain to operate and which aligns with business needs.
