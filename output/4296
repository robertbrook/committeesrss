default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable Plastics Association (OPA) is a not-for-profit Association whose objects are to 
defaultexplain and promote the concept of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradability of plastics and the science and technology relating thereto.
default It represents manufacturers, traders, and commercial users of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics based in 65 countries around the world. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Association has encountered a lot of confusion caused by public statements made by people who are experts in polymers, or in recycling, or in environmental science, but are not experts in 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable polymers. The OPA therefore welcomes the opportunity to give written evidence to the Committee, and has offered to provide an expert in 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology and an expert in recycling of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics, to give oral evidence.  
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe British Plastics Federation and 
defaultPlasRecycle
default do not represent the 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics industry and are not experts in 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDECLARATION OF INTERESTdefaultNone.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultEVIDENCE default&#xa0;default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe OPA considers in detail item 3 of the Terms of Reference, namely 
default“defaultthe impact on the use of biodegradable bags and the impact on plastics recycling.”default  It also offers evidence on the other issues specified in the Committee’s Terms of Reference
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultItem 3 – Biodegradable Bagsdefault&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLightweight plastic shopping bags offer a very useful and low-cost way to carry food and other goods and to protect them from contamination. They can carry more than 2,000 times their own weight and stay strong when wet. A typical plastic carrier bag uses 70% less plastic today than 20 years ago.  
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere appear to be three reasons for seeking to reduce the use of such bags by means of a 5p levy:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs to 6(a)  - LITTER
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic is designed according to ASTM D6954
default to 
defaultdegrade and then biodegrade at the end of its useful life in the open environment in the presence of oxygen in whatever approximate timescale is desired.  It is not therefore necessary to restrict this type of plastic bag, and 
defaultan exemption from the levy, or a reduction in the levy, should be granted, as already envisaged by the government.default 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven if a levy is imposed there will still be very large numbers of plastic bags in circulation.  The government currently has no policy for those which cannot realistically be collected, unless the levy is higher on conventional plastic than on 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic so as to encourage a switch to the more environmentally beneficial option.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt needs to be clearly understood that there are two very different types of biodegradable plastic products:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne common misunderstanding that the OPA has encountered is that biodegradability and 
defaultcompostability
default are the same thing. This is far from true. The environment of an industrial composting facility is quite different from that to which 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics are expected to be exposed in the open environment on land or sea. 
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-degradation is defined by CEN
default in TR15351 as “
defaultdegradation resulting from oxidative cleavage of macromolecules
default.”  And 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradation as “
defaultdegradation resulting from oxidative and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively
default.”
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic does not just fragment, but will be consumed by bacteria and fungi after oxidative cleavage has reduced the molecular structure to a level which permits living micro-organisms access to the carbon and hydrogen. It is therefore "biodegradable." This process continues until the material has biodegraded to nothing more than CO
default2
default, water, and humus, and it does not leave fragments of petro-polymers in the environment. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDEFRA accepts
default that 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics are biodegradable. The 
defaultabiotic
default phase can be as short as a few months depending on the heat, UV light, and stress in the disposal location. As the residues are invisible and non-toxic at the end of that phase it is not important how long they take for total 
defaultbioassimilation
default in the open environment.  Materials such as twigs and straw, which are obviously biodegradable, will usually take much longer than 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic to completely bio-degrade.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradation of polymers has been studied in depth in many scientific publications
default - most recently at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.  A peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol. 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation &amp; Stability (2011) at pages 919-928.  It shows 91% biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months in tests performed according to ISO 17556. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA Life Cycle Analysis conducted by 
defaultIntertek
default for the UK Environment Agency in 2011
default showed that plastic shopping bags have better environmental credentials than paper, cotton or bio-based plastic.  A further LCA by 
defaultIntertek
default in 2012
default showed that 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic has the best environmental credentials of all the materials studied. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe process of making paper bags causes 70% more atmospheric pollution than plastic bags.  Paper bags use 300% more energy to produce, and the process uses huge amounts of water and creates very unpleasant organic waste. When they degrade they emit methane and carbon dioxide.  Paper bag production use and disposal results in 3.3 times the greenhouse gas emissions associated with HDPE plastic bags.  The global-warming impact of paper bag use is almost twice that of conventional plastic bags.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
default“
defaultThere have been unforeseen consequences in the Irish Experience … increase in the use of paper bags which are actually worse for the environment
default …”
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic is tested according to ASTM D6954 to prove that it does degrade and biodegrade, that it is not eco-toxic and that it does not contain significant amounts of gel which might inhibit biodegradability.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic products can be made at little or no additional cost by British factories with their normal equipment, workforce, and polymer resins.  This is not the case with bio-based compostable plastic.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDEFRA has found no evidence that degradable plastics of any kind encourage littering, and 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic bags look and feel exactly the same as ordinary plastic bags. Whilst people should still be fined for disposing irresponsibly of their waste, degradability recognises the fact that it is not practicable to collect 100% of the waste.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic is designed to be inert deep in landfill so that it does not generate methane
default – a powerful greenhouse gas. 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic does not contain heavy metals, and the metal salts contained within it are at such low concentrations that they are unlikely to be toxic to the environment. This is confirmed by research commissioned by DEFRA.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic has not been designed for composting, because plastic (even if EN 13432-compliant) cannot be made into compost.
default  It is useful only for 
defaulttransporting organic waste to a composting facility, and 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic has been tested and found satisfactory for that purpose.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFragments found in the oceans are predominantly from conventional plastic.
default  An 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic converts at the end of its useful life into a low molecular-weight material which is no longer a plastic
default and is biodegradable.
default 
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere would be no point in an exemption for bio-based compostable plastics, because 
default(a)
default              
defaultthey are tested to biodegrade not in the open environment but in the special conditions found in an industrial composting unit
default 
default(b)
default              
defaultthey cannot be recycled with conventional plastic
default 
default(c)
default              
defaultthey cannot be made into compost
default  
default(d)
default              
defaultthey therefore contribute to climate-change 
default(e)
default              
defaultthey are thicker and heavier, requiring more trucks to transport them using more road-space and emitting more pollution 
default(f)
default              
defaultthey generate methane in anaerobic conditions in landfill 
default(g) the European Parliament
default has resolved not to encourage the use of land and water resources for producing bio-fuels (and the same reasoning applies to bio-plastics) and 
default(h) they are much too expensive for everyday use.
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Environmental Audit Committee itself has found
default that "the stimulation of 
defaultbiofuels
default production by the [UK] Government and EU is reckless in the absence of effective mechanisms to prevent the destruction of carbon sinks internationally" The Committee continued "A large 
defaultbiofuel
default industry based on current technology is likely to increase agricultural commodity prices and, by displacing food production, could damage food security in developing countries."
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn 6th March 2008 the United Kingdom’s Chief Scientific Adviser warned that if this continues the world will soon be unable to feed itself.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs to (b) – OIL-PRODUCTION
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOil is extracted to make petrol, diesel and other fuels, and an inevitable by-product (naphtha) is used to make plastic.  The same amount of oil would therefore be extracted even if plastics did not exist, and it makes sense to use the by-product.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBio-based compostable plastic can be considered “renewable” only if you ignore the oil-based content (which can be 40% or more) and if you ignore the fossil fuels burned by machines which clear the land, plough the land, make the fertilisers and pesticides and carry them to the farm, harrow the land, spray the crops, harvest the crops and carry them to a factory for polymerisation, and the energy consumed by the machines at that factory. Insofar as the growing crops absorb CO
default2
default, that would be true of the vegetation which was there before.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs to (c)  - SYMPTOMATIC?
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLightweight plastic shopping bags are symptomatic of a society which has changed radically since the days when people bought milk in jugs from the milkman and carried their food home from the corner-shop in small quantities in paper or cotton or wicker bags.  Lightweight plastic shopping bags do not need to be thrown away, and re-use should be encouraged. They are 
defaultcompact enough to be put in a pocket or handbag.  
defaultAfter use for the primary purpose they can be re-used many times for many purposes, and 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics can be designed to a timescale which allows multiple re-use.
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn its 2011 LCA
default 
defaultIntertek
default said “We have avoided calling lightweight bags “single use” or “disposable”, because consumers are increasingly reusing lightweight carriers for shopping. Additionally high proportions were used as a genuine replacement for another product and the secondary reuse of these bags plays an important part in reducing their global warming potential.”
default&#xa0;
defaultRECYCLING
default&#xa0;
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOxo
default-biodegradable plastic is an oil-based plastic and can (despite claims by some recyclers to the contrary) be safely recycled with conventional plastics without the need for separate collection.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultExtensive tests by Dr. A H A 
defaultRoediger
default were reported on 21
defaultst
default May 2012  and he concluded that “
defaultPlastic products made with 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology may be recycled without any significant detriment to the newly formed recycled product.”
default&#xa0;
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDr. 
defaultRoediger
default has examined
default the report by 
defaultTransfercenter
default 
defaultfür
default 
defaultKunststofftecknik
default GmbH (“TCKT”) dated 12 November 2013 prepared for European Plastic Converters (“
defaultEuPC
default”). He agrees that the report confirms that compostable plastics cannot be recycled with conventional oil-based plastics, but sees nothing in the report to change his opinion about 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe OPA has offered to conduct trials with recyclers, but there has been no response.  An OPA member-company has made an offer to DEFRA to purchase for recycling all the conventional and 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic shopping bags collected in England for recycling if 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastic is exempted from the 5p levy. 
default&#xa0;
default36.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no need for separate collection of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable plastics for recycling, but a tracer could easily be included to make separation a simple matter.
default&#xa0;defaultINTERNATIONAL
default&#xa0;
default37.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe governments of Pakistan
default, the United Arab Emirates
default and seven other countries carefully considered the effectiveness and safety of 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology before passing legislation which makes it mandatory to use the technology, and rejecting the bio-based alternative. These have a combined 
defaultpopulation of 195 millions, and other countries may decide to follow their example. British factories and retailers cannot now export to those countries unless their disposable plastic products and packaging are made with 
defaultoxo
default-biodegradable technology.
