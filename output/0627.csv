defaultWritten evidence submitted by the defaultInstitute of Physics (ESA020)default&#xa0;default1default.  default  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agencydefault&#xa0;default?default&#xa0;default1
default.  
defaultThe European Space Agency (ESA) operates with a clear mission-led focus and a structure that ensures buy-in from nation states and other space-related organisations
default.  
defaultAs a technical, rather than political, organisation, the ESA is able to concentrate on the issues which are essential to achieving its objectives.
default&#xa0;
default2
default.  
defaultIts key strengths are its leadership and mode of governance
default.  
defaultTh
defaultrough 
defaulta 
defaultmember-based structure, 
defaultthe 
defaultESA is able to bring together 
defaultdifferent
default aspects to create a stronger whole
default.  
defaultFor example, the UK’s strength in small satellite production and space science enables it to contribute to these programmes within the ESA at a high level, and 
defaultto 
defaultbenefit at a similar level
default.  
defaultWithin this
default arrangement
default, stability and commitment in funding through multi-year plans agreed with member states results in well-defined projects and measurable outcomes of projects and programmes
default.  
defaultThe dependence 
defaultof the ESA 
defaulton the funding decisions of member states could be seen as perhaps a weakness as well as a strength
default.  
defaultBut this in many ways is mitigated by strong technical leadership within the organisation and the high-level 
defaultagreement of long-term
default arrangements.
default&#xa0;
default3
default.  
defaultThe ESA’s ability to leverage the strengths of its member agencies allows it to deal as an equal with larger and perhaps better equipped space agencies such as a NASA and the Russian Space Agency
default.  
defaultThese relationships, along with the ESA arrangements with other national spaces agencies, such as the Canadian, Swiss and Norwegian agencies, also means that ESA is well-placed to offer contract services to other nations.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.  
defaultOne of t
defaulthe drivers of the ESA’s
default success is 
defaultits
default geo-return policy (
defaultjuste
default&#xa0;
defaultretour
default)
default 
defaultwhich enables the nation states to retain a focus 
defaulto
defaultn their 
defaultchosen areas
default –
default 
defaultfor example,
default 
defaultstronger domestic industries, government priorities or academic strengths
default – 
defaultconfident that the ESA will reward 
defaultthem
default with equivalent value in contracts
default.  
defaultThe ESA also enables member states access to expertise and experience not necessarily available domestically
default.  
defaultFor example, Belgium has no distinct ‘space agency’, but instead funds the ESA directly and allocates its share of 
defaultjuste retour
default monies to companies and sectors it feels are beneficial to its national economy
default.  
defaultTh
defaultis method of allocating funding does increase the overall cost of ESA missions but 
defaulthas shown success in connecting with different priorities of national governments over many years
default.  
default&#xa0;
default2default.  default  In light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between ESA and the EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regimedefault&#xa0;default?default default Whydefault&#xa0;default?default&#xa0;default5
default.  
defaultThe relationship between the ESA and the E
defaulturopean Commission
default is complex and it should be noted that the ESA, and European space science and technology in general, is succeeding under the 
defaultcurrent governance arrangements
default.  
defaultFor example, programmes such as the Galileo 
defaultNavigation S
defaultystem have been successfully developed and deployed though a partnership between the ESA and a number of other European and national agencies
default.  
defaultIndeed, it may be that some of the current tensions could be avoided with a clearer statement on the future management arrangements for Galileo and the roles of the 
defaultEuropean GNSS Agency (GSA)
default.  
default&#xa0;
default6
default.  
defaultThe ESA is a technical operation
default that operates within a narrow 
defaultscope
default.
default The focus that can result from what is essentially a single-mission agenc
defaulty should not be lost within an 
defaultunderstandable enthusiasm to centralise the European science landscape
default.  
defaultWhile closer collaboration with other European science programmes, particularly the Horizon 2020 programme
defaults
default, will undoubtedly generate some advantages and efficiencies, this may well 
defaultalso 
defaulthave a cost
default.  
default&#xa0;
default7
default.  
defaultUnder the current governance arrangements, the space agencies of member states have a clear and direct influence of the direction of the ESA
default.  
defaultThis model, combined with the recent introduction of the UK Space Agency (UKSA) has benefited the UK
default.  
defaultThe UK’s strength in telecommunications and small satellite technologies has allowed it to take a lead in this area within the ESA
default.  
defaultThe recently
default 
defaultsecured funding for the ISIC in Harwell, and the decision to base new telecoms satellite monitoring headquarters in the UK 
defaulti
defaults a vindication of this approach
default and an illustration of the advantages to the UK of the current governance structures
default. 
default 
default3default.  default  How effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector?default default What effect have changes to the Multidefaultadefaultnnual Financial Framework default(MFF) defaulthad on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?default&#xa0;default8
default.  
defaultIt is 
defaulttoo 
defaultearly 
defaultin 
defaultthe cycle of the MFF to make a clear judgement on the effect
defaults
default of changes 
defaultto the budgets of
default European space science and technology, and it should be noted that the way in which the ESA is funded – though multi-year contributions from member states directly, rather than through central EU budgeting – will insulate it from 
defaultsuch changes
default.  
defaultAt this stage it is possible that the proposed Horizon 2020 budget may be subject to a significant redu
defaultction over the spending period
default.  
defaultB
defaultut even if this is avoided, it is clear that there will be challenges ahead if European space activities are to maintain their current position
default.  
defaultAs with other 
defaultinternational
default projects, it should ideally be the case that the
default 
defaultESA 
defaultbudget should have long-term stability as far as possible given the funding pressures on all research budgets. 
defaultIts role in the global space science and technology communities requires that it is seen as a ‘reliable partner’, able to engage confidently on the timescales scales required for launches and their longer term developments that typically take years and in and in some cases decades.
default4default.  default  How effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be madedefault&#xa0;default?default default Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be donedefault default?default&#xa0;default9
default.  
defaultSince its establishment in 2010, the 
defaultUKSA
default has been working to bring together many disparate fields and cultures under a single umbrella
default.  
defaultThe transition of
default some areas of
default administrative and governance functions to the UKSA areas has not been simple
default or smooth
default, and there remains work to be done to ensure that relationship
defaults
default between UKSA and closely-related research councils such as STFC and NERC, and their respective academic communities, are maintained and strengthened
default.  
default&#xa0;
default10
default.  
defaultHowever, the rationale for the creation of a UK 
defaults
defaultpace 
defaulta
defaultgency has not changed
default.  
defaultA single focal point, nationally and internationally, will enable a more coherent space science and technology sector within the UK, and allow the UK to punch its weight with international agencies
default,
default particularly within the ESA
default.  
defaultThe recent announcement from the ESA to locate its tele
default-
defaultcommunications hub in Harwell is a very positive sign
default.  
default&#xa0;
default11
default.  
defaultAdditionally, when talking about the ability of the UK to exploit and build on the strength of its space sector across the broader economy, the role of the ESA and the need for a strong, central UK voice should not be neglected
default.  
defaultJudicious allocation of 
defaultjuste retour
default (understanding the roles of SMEs) and other intangible benefits, and more specifically, working to ensure that ESA’s focus is closely aligned with the sectors in which the UK economy has strength, will be essential.
default&#xa0;
default1
default2
default.  
defaultThe UKSA is still very much a new organisation, building on the work of the previous 
defaultBritish National Space Centre (
defaultBNSC
default)
default, and the establishment of a steering group that embraces a range of larger companies and stakeholders within the leadership function of 
defaultthe 
defaultUKSA was a welcome development
default.  
default There is a concern that, if the UK economy is to fully benefit from the investment through both the UKSA directly, and also through the ESA programmes, greater use should be made of smaller companies in the supply chains and enabling technology sectors
default such as photonics
default.  
defaultWhile the space sector is a significant contributor to the UK economy
default, and has been identified as one of the key technologies to bring the UK economy back to growth, 
defaultsuch 
defaultstrategies should take account of 
defaultthese technologies and businesses
default.  
defaultT
defaulthe space sector does not exist in a vacuu
defaultm and a
default strong, broad industrial base is 
defaultessential
default to 
defaultensuring
default that the UK can involve itself in high-value supply chains
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1
default3
default.  
defaultAs it develops, we would look to the UKSA to bridge some of the gaps that have been apparent in the past between space technology and research
default.  
defaultIt is currently the case that, broadly, the ESA will undertake technical programmes while the national science agencies will take on the data analysis and research
default.  
defaultThis differs from the approach taken by, for example, NASA which will typically support both the mission and the exploitation of the data produced
default.  
defaultThere have been recent cases where UK researchers have been involved at a high level in the design and commissioning of ESA programmes, but were unable to access the results of the missions due to funding not being awarded 
defaultby
default domestic research councils.  
defaultFor 
defaulta 
defaultsplit arrangement to 
defaultbe efficient and functional
default, 
defaultthe 
defaultUKSA and
default the
default ESA must work with domestic agencies
default at an earl
defaulty
default stage
default, 
defaulton the 
defaultunderstand
defaulting
default that
default any
default UK research council
default funding will be awarded on a 
defaultcompetitive, 
defaultpeer reviewed basis.  
default 
default5default.  default  Does the UK get good value for money from its membership of ESAdefault&#xa0;default?default&#xa0;
default1
default4
default.  
defaultIt is clear that the
default UK
default 
defaultreceives
default a significant proportion of what it invests in science
default back
default through ESA contracts that 
defaultsupport 
defaulthigh-technology companies
default.  
defaultThis, together with the opportunities that such high
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel, high
default&#x2011;
defaulttechnology international collaborations bring suggests in fact that the UK receives a significant return on its investments
default.  
defaultFor example, investment through the Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) has been reported to have 
defaultproduced
default 
defaultreturns
default of 7:1.
default&#xa0;
default1
default5
default.  
defaultAs such, the questions should perhaps instead be : How does the UK’s return on investment compare to 
defaultthat in 
defaultother countries
default 
default?  And how well does the UK steer this reciprocal investment to best g
defaultrow its space-related economy ?
default 
default 
defaultThese are
default area
defaults
default that the committee might consider.
default&#xa0;
default1
default6
default.  
defaultThe ability of the UKSA to drive the ESA 
defaultinto areas 
defaultwhere the UK has strength is important, but also important is the strength of the broader UK science and technology base, and the capability of it to ‘absorb’ this investment
default.  
defaultThe recent strategies for the space sector have been an advantage 
defaultand
default they ar
defaulte long-term ventures 
defaultrequiring
default a
default long
default-
defaultterm commitment from government will be required if the UK is to keep pace with European competitors

default.  
defaultAt the ESA ministerial council on November 2012 the UK agreed to invest £6 million in the ESA Space Situational Awareness programme which retains a focus on monitoring developments in space debris and space weather, and links closely with other national and international programmes
default.  
defaultAt the same meeting the programme’s mandate was extended to 2019
default.  
defaultThis was a welcome 
defaultextension

default.
