PPPO (2011) \nLearning from PPO investigations: violence reduction, bullying and safety\n \nThe only other avenue of “appeal” available to bereaved families is \nby persuading the Attorney General to exercise his or her power of fiat under s.13 of the Coroners Act 1988. \nThis \nsets a high threshold to be met for an inquest verdict (inquisition) to be quashed and for ordering a new inquest into a death. It involves a complex and lengthy process which requires the Attorney-General’s consent. The Attorney General can only exercise his fiat if there is new evidence to be considered. As a result, this remedy has only been granted to bereaved families in rare cases – the most recent example being the quashing of the original inquests into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough Stadium in 1989. \n \nR (Pounder) v HM Coroner for the North and South Districts of \nDurham\n and \nDarlington\n \n[2009] EWHC 76 (Admin). \nR (Pounder) v HM Coroner for the North and South Districts of \nDurham\n and \nDarlington\n \n[2010] EWHC 328 (Admin).\n For full details see INQUEST press release, 27 January 2011 “\nSerco and youth justice agencies condemned for unlawful treatment of vulnerable boy in custody”\n available from \nwww.inquest.org.uk\n \n Para 1, the independent review of Coroner Services commissioned by the Home Office and chaired by Tom Luce, \nDeath Certification and Investigation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\n, 2003.\n See INQUEST’s e\nvidence based reports such as \nHow the Inquest System Fails Bereaved People\n (2002) and \nUnlocking the Truth – Families’ Experience of the Investigation of Deaths in Custody \n(2007): both included in-depth surveys which sought bereaved families’ views and experiences of the inquest process\n Government Briefing on the Public Bodies Bill, DEP2011-1213 available from \nwww.parliament.uk\n \n"
