defaultChair:default 
defaultProfessor Gallagher and Mr 
defaultHoltham
default, thank you very much indeed for coming along here this morning. I am David Davies, Chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee
default. W
defaulte are here to scrutinise the new Government of Wales Bill, as you probably know. 
defaultIf I may, I will
default turn
default to Mark Williams to start with.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultThank you very much
default and thank you, gentlemen; i
defaultt is good to see you here. My questions relate to improving financial accountability. Silk was very clear in his report when he said 
defaultthat “
defaultthe current funding arrangements for the Welsh Government do not meet the re
defaultquirements of a mature democracy”.
default In the foreword to the draft Bill
default,
default the Secretary of State for 
defaultWales
default has said that 
default“
defaultThese changes will give 
defaultWales
default more fiscal autonomy, and will make the Assembly and the Welsh Government more accountable to
default” the
default people 
defaultof
default 
defaultWales
default.
default Do you accept that improving financial accountability is the key argument for devolving taxes?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultIn general, yes, I think that that is right. Gerry will speak for himself, but I suspect he may agree with me
default here.
default 
defaultW
defaulthat is very striking about the devolved bodies across the 
defaultUK
default, including in 
defaultWales
default, is that they were
default set up from former Government D
defaultepartments whose job was to spend rather than to raise money, but once they become Governments
default,
default they ought to have the power to raise money as well as spend it. Raising it gives them the option of having some say over how much they spend
default,
default and setting a tax rate makes them fiscally accountable to their voters.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: Yes, indeed;
default I entirely agree. I think one should note in the Welsh case how very small a step this is. The three small taxes under consideration might have a revenue yield of £200 million a year, which, against a budget of £15 billion, verges on insignificant. It is a 
defaultgood gesture, but it is not much more than a gesture. Of course, if the referendum is held and income tax is partly devolved, that will be somewhat more significant.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultNotwithstanding what you 
defaulthave 
defaultsaid about the scale of the changes and the figures you mentioned, what hard evidence is out there and available to us to show that fiscal devolution does indeed promote greater accountability? I do not know what indicators we should be looking for
default—
defaultperhaps you have 
defaultlooked at
default that in your respective work
default—but what is the
default hard evidence that this does improve the
default situation?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultInternationally
default,
default there is some evidence that fiscal devolution leads to
default a flattening of tax schedules 
defaultbecause tax competition is more effective at the top end. People on basic rate tax do not move because the basic rate changes. If you think about it, putting a penny on the basic rate cannot cost anybody more than £300 or £400
default a year
default, which does not pay for a removal van
default;
default so nobody is going anywhere. But if you start taxing millionaires, they can move around. 
defaultT
defaulthe presence of tax devolution means that there is some tax competition among authorities
default,
default and that does tend to flatten tax schedules. I do not know whether you would count that as 
defaulta 
defaultresponsibility
default,
default but it shows 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople are responsive to the opportunities that tax devolution affords them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultAs a very general
default,
default almost kick
default&#x2011;
defaultoff question
default—
defaultmy colleagues are going to go into some of these issues in more depth
default—
defaultwhat are the advantages and disadvantages associated with the devolving of income and land taxes?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultLand taxes are a fairly obvious thing to devolve
default,
default and that is probably why local authority taxation in the UK has always been based on some form of property tax
default—
defaultthe old rates and now council tax
default—
defaultbecause the tax base is n
defaultot mobile. I
defaultt is easy to identify and 
defaultit is a tax that is 
defaulthard to evade
default; it is 
defaulta rooted tax base. 
defaultI
defaultf you are looking to extend the tax base of authorities that do not have an adequate tax base, looking for more taxes related to land does make sense, I think. 
defaultThe point about income tax is that it is a tax 
defaultthat
default is very broadly paid and therefore it affects a large proportion of the electorate. 
defaultAs such, i
defaultt increases the visibility of the tax policies of the devolved authority and, as such, it is a good tax from an accountability point of view. Unlike houses, people can move about, so there are consequences in terms of tax competition, as I have said, but in terms of being a broad
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default and highly visible tax, and therefore serving accountability, it is a good one.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI would add two things
default to that
default. I agree with Gerry that, for decentralisation, immobile tax bases are the best
default,
default and therefore property, being immobile, is very good. People are less mobile than some other potential tax bases
default—
defaultfor example, corporate profits, which can be moved around. 
defaultIf you look at the taxes that are available for devolution,
default there are only three big taxes. T
defaulthere is VAT, which cannot be decentralised under European law; 
defaultthere is 
defaultnational insurance, which is like income tax, but, in my view, for other reasons should not be decentralised; and there is income tax. As Gerry says, income tax is spread across the population
default—
defaulta lot of people pay it
default—and it is also very perceptible;
default people notice it. If you ask someone about tax 
defaultrates, most often they would begin by talking about income tax rates. So it is a good tax for devolution because it can be decentralised and it is noticeable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultI would like to take you up on that issue of 
default“
defaultnoticeable
default”
default, if I may. 
defaultW
defaulthen you are talking about the other 
defaulttaxes—the stamp duty, the land
defaultfill and an
default adjustment to the block grant—they
default may not have much of an impact on people in the same way that a council tax bill comin
defaultg through the door will or they see
default 
defaultin 
defaultthe newspaper 
defaultit 
defaultsays they are going up 4%, or whatever. They see their bill
default,
default and they think they are paying for all the council services
default,
default when in fact there is 
defaultactually
default a block grant element there
default. H
defaultow do you envisage it becoming visible for people? 
defaultIn w
defaulthat way would that income tax power have to be used for people really to feel that they were having a say in whether the Welsh Government spent more or 
defaultspent 
defaultless
default?
default 
defaultD
defaulto you think it is realistic that the Welsh
default Government would do something—i.e. raise it or lower it—
defaultand how would that impact on people? Do you think it would actually happen?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: There are two issues here: p
defaulterceptibility
default, first of all. D
defaulto people notice the tax at all? Quite often
default,
default people would not notice an indirect tax like VAT or duty because they are not absolutely sure what proportion of what they are paying is for the product and what proportion is for the tax. At the other extreme, as you say, you have council tax where the bill comes through the door and you have to fork out the cash. That is extremely perceptible. 
defaultIncome tax is pretty perceptible for two reasons: one, because you see it in your pay slip every month and, two
default—
defaultand this is where we move into the question of accountability
default—
defaultbecause the Assembly would have to set a tax rate. It would have to make a tax decision. One of the interesting things about the way in which devolution has been funded in the 
defaultUK
default hitherto is that, for the most part, the devolved bodies, including the Welsh Assembly, do not have to make any tax decision but the money still flows. The Scottish comparison is interesting here because
default, although,
default in principle, the Scottish Parliament had the power to vary income tax, it did not have 
defaultto 
defaultdo anything
default—and, f
defaultunnily enough, it did not do anything. 
defaultThe advantage of an income tax power
default—
defaultor, to a lesser degree, the small taxes
default—
defaultis that the Assembly will have to take a tax decision and take a view as to whether it is better, to use Gladstone
default’
defaults words, to allow the money to 
default“
defaultfructify
default”
default in the profits of the taxpayers or whether to spend money on services. 
defaultT
defaulthat is the decision they have to make. 
defaultThe issue you raise is an important one
default,
default and that is that the total budget in comparison to the tax income is not that great
default,
default and that 
defaultdoes dilute the accountability—I agree—
defaultbut one has to have a look at the relative spend and the tax base that is available. There is no system all across the world in which a sub
default&#x2011;
defaultnational
default Government gets all its money from the taxes it raises itself. They are all dependent on a mixture of some form of central subvention
default—
defaulta central grant, a share of taxes allocated or something of that sort
default—
defaultand taxes they raise themselves. 
defaultIn the Welsh case, we have to bear in mind 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a substantial spending need and a relatively weak income tax base. Therefore, income tax is never going to be a huge proportion of the total Welsh spending. Nevertheless, it can be a significant one.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default I will just try
default to bring 
defaultin 
defaulta couple more people 
defaultbriefly on this question.
default Geraint Davies is next.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultThe case has been made that Wales is underfunded in terms of Barnett, certainly versus Scotland
default,
default on the revenue side, and in terms of our share of capital
default investment
default, as far as the UK is concerned, again we are underfunded. 
defaultI
defaultn terms of accountability, is it not the case that
default,
default if the Gov
defaulternment are switching the focus o
defaultn
default 
defaultto borrowing, and indeed tax
default&#x2011;
defaultraising
default powers to pay for that borrowing for Wales, that the focus will go on to Wales and
default,
default therefore
default,
default there will be a reduction in the accountability of the UK Government
default,
default who should be brought to account?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThere are a number of issues there. 
defaultIt is true, and w
defaultork we did back in 2010 suggested
default,
default that
default,
default if Wales were a region of England and you simply applied 
defaultin Wales 
defaultthe needs
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default formula
defaulte used in England to distribute 
defaulthealth spending and local government revenue support
default around England, 
defaultyou would come to the conclusion that Wales is slightly un
defaultderfunded by 2% or 3% 
defaultrelative to what it would get if it were an English region. 
defaultI regard that as l
defaultess serious than the other fact
default that
default,
default with the 
defaultBarnett formula
default, if unreformed, once public expenditure growth resumes
default—I do not mean real growth but
default just growth in nominal terms
default—
defaultthe share of spending in Wales will fall relative to England. This is just a consequence of the 
defaultway the formula is set up. Let’
defaults say in 
defaultEngland
default 
defaultthe Government decide
default to spend £5 a hea
defaultd more on any service you like. I
defaultf that is a devolved service, 
defaultWales
default would get £5 a head more. B
defaultut if you are starting from a situation where English expenditure is £100 a head, £5 on for £100 is 5%. If we are starting in 
defaultWales
default where it is 110%
default—as it would be, let’
defaults say, in the north
default&#x2011;
defaulteast of 
defaultEngland
default and other poorer areas
default—
default£5 on £110 is 4.5%, or something. So you are going to get a slow move to squeeze 
defaultWales
default down to the average expenditure level in 
defaultEngland
default, which does not happen in any of the areas of 
defaultEngland
default. If needs
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default assessment says the north
default&#x2011;
defaulteast is poorer and should get more, it gets more; it is not squeezed to some average. 
defaultThe difficulty here is that the income tax devolution will necessarily
default—
defaultand
default,
default in my opinion
default,
default appropriately
default—
defaultincrease the risks on the Welsh Government because you are replacing part of the block grant with your own income tax take, which will depend on the growth of the income tax base in your economy. If that grows more slowly than public expenditure in 
defaultEngland
default, you are worse off as a result of this devolution. That is a risk. I think you have to take it because
default,
default otherwise
default,
default the Welsh Government 
defaultare
default currently in a position where
default,
default if the economy goes to heck in a 
defaulthandbasket
default,
default 
defaultthey get
default exactly the same money, or
default,
default if 
defaultthey introduce
default wonderful policies that result in the Welsh econo
defaultmy booming, they see no benefit and still get
default the same money. 
defaultUnfortunately, you cannot disentangle the necessary incentives and responsibility from that other risk that, for reasons you cannot control, your income tax base grows more slowly. 
defaultI
defaultt is a consequence of responsibility that you have to take that risk. But it would be very helpful if the other
default,
default totally unnecessary risk implied by the 
defaultBarnett formula
default were removed. To me, the obvious thing to do here is to say, 
default“
defaultIf you pass this income tax in a referendum, at the moment it is passed and you assume responsibilities for income tax
default,
default we will put a floor under Barnett and cease the Barnett squeeze.
default”
default That would at least remove one ris
defaultk—an unnecessary and unfair risk—
defaultat the same time that you are imposing a necessary risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultBut surely you have described an incentive for the Welsh Government to spend more money on economic development when 
defaultthey are
default not in charge of 
defaulttheir
default own destiny
default,
default and that will cut funding for education and health
default,
default which are the main reasons that people would inward invest in 
defaultWales
default, other than the countryside, versus other parts of 
defaultBritain
default. Surely
default,
default this is a recipe for disaster, is it not?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultNo. The Welsh Government would have the same choices after this change as 
defaultthey have
default now. 
defaultThey themselves have
default to decide how much of 
defaulttheir 
defaultrevenue 
defaultthey spend
default on health education or economic development
default,
default if 
defaultthey are
default able to do that. That is unchanged. All we are talking about is whether some of the resources that 
defaultthey get
default should be under 
defaulttheir
default own control. 
defaultTheir
default freedom of action is unaffected.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultLet me bring in 
defaultHywel
default Williams. I am conscious of the time. I am really grateful for the detail that you are giving us
default, 
defaultand I genuinely mean that
default, 
defaultbut we have to be slightly aware that we only have an
default hour or so—maybe a bit longer if you gentleme
defaultn can stay a bit longer
default—on this session, 
defaultand we are still on question 2 at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultBriefly, 
defaultgoing 
defaultback to Professor Gallagher, you were talking about models from other parts of the world. When thi
defaults Committee visited the Basque c
defaultountry some years ago, we were told in some detail about their tax arrangements, 
defaultwhich I have to confess I can’
defaultt remember now. 
defaultAre there particular lessons or i
defaults there a particular model there which would be an alternative?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultNo, I do 
defaultnot think there is. The Basque c
defaultountry is often cited as an example of so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled full fiscal autonomy. The headline description 
defaultthat
default is given, which is not wholl
defaulty accurate, is that the Basque c
defaultountry decides on and collects all the taxes and remits a so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled 
default“
defaultc
defaultupo
default”
default to 
defaultMadrid
default. That is slightly misleading for three reasons. First,
default it is not actually the Basque c
defaultountry itself but s
defaultubsidiary levels in the Basque c
defaultountry 
defaultthat
default decide and collect taxes. Secondly, many of the taxes they do not actually decide but are simply responsible for collecting, such as value
default 
defaultadded tax. Thirdly, one of the very major taxes they neither decide nor collect, which is social security contributions
default,
default are decided and collected by the Government in 
defaultMadrid
default. The final constraint is that their capacity to vary taxes compared with the rest of 
defaultSpain
default is limited by the Spanish constitution. 
defaultI
defaultt is almost never sensible to try and pluck 
defaulta
default model from somewhere else and transpl
defaultant it—y
defaultou have alwa
defaultys got to look at the context—b
defaultut
default,
default of all the models you might pluck, I would not suggest the Basque one.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I slip 
defaultin a question
default myself, if I may, just before Jessica Morden? You have obviously studied a lot of countries around the world. You have made the point that Wales would only be responsible
default for raising a tiny proportion—
defaultprobably under 1%
default, I should think—
defaulto
defaultf the total £15 billion budget. That is 
default£20
default0 million out of £15 billion;
default I cannot remember the figures.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: Yes;
default for the minor taxes it is about a third of 1%, maximum
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIs there a model anywhere in the world that you think is a standard model, either in the B
defaultasque c
defaultountry, 
defaultItaly
default, 
defaultGermany
default or any of the devolved regions, for the percentage that a devolved region could normally be expected to raise by itself?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI do not think there is a model
default,
default and one must remember here that there are two variables. The
defaulty
default are what proportion of spending is decentralised and what propor
defaulttion of taxing is decentralised.
default The proportion, therefore, of the devolved budget that is supported by tax depends on those two variables. 
defaultI
defaultf you have a big budget, as the Welsh Assembly does
default—
defaultit is responsible for pushing 40%, I think, off the top of my head, of public spending in Wales, 
defaultand 
defaultpossibly more
default—
defaultand a small tax base, you therefore have a very small percentage of your budget. You could argue that
default,
default if you wanted to gain greater, as it were, physical autonomy
default,
default you should spend less and therefore have a greater proportion, and I do not think anyone is recommending that in this context. There is
default,
default therefore
default,
default no standard formula. I absolutely agree that
default,
default even if you include local taxes, where 
defaultWales
default is today
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultdoes not allow it any meaningful fiscal accountability. I do not think
default,
default in practice
default,
default it is going to be possible to get to even the proportions that are conceivable in the case of Scotland, but it should be, in practice, possible, if you include income tax, to get to proportions 
defaultthat
default are at least comparable to those in local government.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultWe have seen your submissions that the tax take in 
defaultWales
default is considerably lower
default, and
default I think you put it at 
default£
default1,300 as opposed to 
default£
default2,000 in the 
defaultUK
default as a whole. Given as a proportion of the budget of the Welsh Government, would the pain be worth the gain in them putting on 1p extra on that small slice of income tax
default,
default which they would have the power to do? In other words, 
defaultwould 
defaultthe amount they could raise really 
defaultbe 
defaultof any significance in that budget?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThe short answer is no. There is a great flaw with this Bill, which stems from the fact t
defaulthat the British Government take
default the view that 
defaultWales
default cannot possibly have anything that 
defaultthey have
default not already given to 
defaultScotland
default. 
defaultWe are the runt of the litter: 
defaultbasically, we get the hand
default&#x2011;
defaultme
default&#x2011;
defaultdowns that the other people have had and
default,
default 
default“
defaultDon
default’
defaultt, for God
default’
defaults s
defaultake, ask for anything different.”
default 
defaultI
defaultt was pointed out by the Silk Commission, and 
defaultindeed by the C
defaultommission that I chaired, that this lockstep arrangement
default—
defaultwhereby you have the same tax rates for basic and higher rates and
default,
default if you increase the tax
default,
default you increase everybody
default’
defaults marginal rate
default—
defaultwill make the tax in Wales virtually unusable. As an equalitarian myself
default,
default I regret this, but one has to face reality
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultn 
defaultWales
default,
default you simply cannot afford to r
defaultaise the top rate of income tax; y
defaultou just cannot do it. 
defaultPeople move, 
defaulton average, once every 10 years;
default 50% of the Welsh population lives within 
default25
default miles
default of the border. Anybody on £1 million or £500,000 a year has probably got two homes. You are just going to lose more money than you will gain over a five and 10
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period
default. R
defaultaising the higher rate of tax is impossible in 
defaultWales
default unless you wish to lose revenue. Therefore, if you want to raise tax
default,
default you have to raise the basic rate only. If you want to cut tax, you can cut the top rate
default,
default but these things are ruled out by this legislation. You are making sure that this is a power that is very unlikely to be used.
defaultChair:default We must move on; t
defaulthank you. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultIn your written evidence, Mr 
defaultHoltham
default, you said you think the weakness of the Bill is that much of it would remain a dead letter. Is there anything you wish to add to that
default,
default given your previous comment?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultYes, because you are asking Welsh politicians to fight a highly losable referendum. Tax is not popular
default,
default and, to be frank, neither are politicians at the present time. It is most unfair, but there it is. 
defaultY
defaultou are asking them to fight a losable referendum for a t
defaultax power they can’
defaultt use. It does not look like a high
default&#x2011;
defaultodds
default proposition to me. The only incentive the British Government 
defaultare
default giving them is to say, 
default“
defaultIf you get this power, we will let you borrow a bit more.
default”
default The difference, as far as we can tell, is between borrowing £500 million and £1
default,
default200 
defaultmillion 
defaultor £1
default,
default300 million. Maybe that will be enough, but I rather doubt whether it will. From an electoral point of view, it is great to have accountability, but who the hell wants to be accountable if they can avoid it? You are telling politicians, 
default“
defaultYou be more accountable and we
default will give you a power you can’
defaultt use. Now go out and persuade people to let you have tax powers.
default”
default It is not exactly odds on, is it? 
defaultI think the Bill needs to be augmented, as I was saying earlier, by a promise that
default,
default if this referendum is held and passed, at that po
defaultint there will be an amendment—
defaultnot a wholesale
default reform but a simple amendment—
defaultto the 
defaultBarnett formula
default to put a floor in place, which would at least give the politicians something to go with when they are talking to the electorate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultThank you for that. Can I ask Professor Gallagher about the Scottish experience? In terms of the Scotland Act 2012, what are the differences between this and the draft Wales Bill?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultVery few. The scheme 
defaultthat
default is in this Bill is essentially the same scheme in respect of income tax and small taxes as it is in the Scotland Act 2012. That went through the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Parliament supported it
default,
default and, provided another referendum goes the way in which the UK Government would like it to go, that scheme will come into effect in 
defaultScotland
default in 2016. 
defaultW
defaulte have no experience, as yet, of operating it. 
defaultI suppose I might add, however, two caveats to what Gerry said. The first is if I might address Ms Griffith
default’
defaults question rather more directly. Your question was not about the variability of rates but whether it was worth the pain because you did not raise very much more money. That is a real constraint, but nevertheless there may well come an occasion when a Parliament wants to raise some more money and the tax will allow it to do so. Conversely, in principle, in 
defaulta 
defaultParliament the gearing works the other way in relation to saving money. If you want to cut the taxes, it does not cost you very much pain in reduced services proportionately. So that gearing argument cuts both ways.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultCan I just come back
default on that
default? As they are so similar, people obviously argue 
defaultthe 
defaultdesign for 
defaultScotland
default applied to 
defaultWales
default.
default I think we have heard Mr 
defaultHoltham
default’
defaults
default view on that
default, but 
defaultwould you like to say how appropriate you feel that is?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultMy own view is that
default,
default if we maintain the 
defaultUK
default as a union with a numb
defaulter of different countries in it,
default we need to have a form of home rule, if that is the phrase one wants to use, which is appropriate to each of the countries. I do not think it is absolutely the 
defaultcase that every detail of the home rule scheme for 
defaultScotland
default and 
defaultWales
default needs to be the same. Obviously
default,
default in relation to powers, there is already a difference, principally the Scottish Parliament building and the fact that 
defaultScotland
default,
default always 
defaulthaving 
defaulthad a legal system
default,
default has power over legal issues that are 
defaultnot currently devolved in 
defaultWales
default.
default I 
defaultdo 
defaultagree with Gerry that it would be possible to adjust the funding system to reflect the realities of life in 
defaultWales
default where the tax base is weak and the spending need is high. 
defaultH
defaultis idea of at least considering whether there could be a floor to the 
defaultBarnett formula
default is a perfectly sensible one
default,
default which I do not think would have an undesirable 
defaultread-
defaultacross to either 
defaultScotland
default or 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. 
defaultAs far as the variability of tax rates is concerned, there are two difficulties with this. One is the argument of principle 
defaultthat
default was used in creating the Scotland Act scheme, which was that questions of progressivity or 
defaultregressivity
default in the tax systems were ones 
defaultthat
default were best dealt with at 
defaultWestminster
default because issues of redistribution were best dealt with at this level. The second difficulty is 
defaulta bit 
defaultcruder. Gerry puts the positive side for allowing 
defaultWales
default a degree of f
defaultlexibility over the higher rate
default to stop people leaving 
defaultWales
default, but, of course, it might also be seen as a way of attracting retired bankers and premiership footballers to move across the border a
defaultnd hand over their tax revenues.
default I am a bit uncomfortable, I have to admit, with that kind of tax farming.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultMr 
defaultHoltham
default,
default is it your understanding that the £500 million borrowing is available before any referendum? You talked about £500 million and then £1
default,
default200 million earlier on.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultYes. As I understand it, it has been agreed between the Welsh Government and the UK Government that £500 million total borrowing is available on the basis of the smaller taxes that are being devolved in any event before the referendum. I do not think a final number has been agreed, but that is the gen
defaulteral understanding, and the £1.2 billion/£
default1.3 billion is what would happen if a similar settlement to the Scottish one were adopted after the income tax referendum
default,
default if it were to happen and to be passed. That is the difference between the two numbers, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am happy to go on with this, but we have a load of questio
defaultns on borrowing afterwards. If m
defaultembers of the Committee want to, I am 
defaultquite 
defaulthappy to go to it now if you feel it is more appropriate. If not, I have one quick question on tax because, happily, you managed to answer all the ones on my list in your previous comments. Would there be a difficulty in def
defaultining who a Welsh taxpayer is? 
defaultClearly, it is obvious in most cases, but there are people with two homes or 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho move around a bit. MPs, for example, could well be spending more time in 
defaultLondon
default than they are in 
defaultWales
default if they are assiduous in their duties.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThat is certainly an issue. The basis of this is residential. It is not your place of work; it is your primary residence. The fact that it has happened already in 
defaultScotland
default and the Inland Revenue has had to wrestle with this issue is an advantage because many of the issues and the administrative procedures they have to put in place will be there because of 
defaultScotland
default and they can simply apply them in 
defaultWales
default. But, yes, there is no doubt tha
defaultt to some extent
default wi
defaultth this tax, for certain people,
default there will be a voluntary element. If you have a house in both places and you are spending equal time in 
defaultboth places
default, there is a degree of latitude. From the point of view of outright evasion, if people want to tell their employers that they 
defaultlive where they do not, the Government 
defaultare
default not going to make the employer legally responsible for the accuracy of his records when it comes to where people live. 
defaultO
defaultne just has to accept that there is an unavoidable margin for avoidance or evasion in this.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultTo 
defaultadd to
default that, there are two points. The first is, as Gerry says, 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have had, in principle at least, this possibility in 
defaultScotland
default since 1999, so the Revenue was obliged to maintain a list of Scottish taxpayers
default.
default 
defaultIn very simple terms, people’s
default national insurance numbers would have an 
default“
defaultS
default” on them; t
defaultheir tax reference number is the same but they have an 
default“
defaultS
default”
default on it. What the Bill provides for is a system 
defaultthat
default is exactly analogous to the questions of domicile used in deciding whether someone is resident in the 
defaultUK
default or not
default,
default because, obviously, if you are resident in 
defaultWales
default,
default you are resident in the 
defaultUK
default. The principal challenge in administering this is making sure that employers apply the correct tax code, though I have a feeling
default—and 
defaultI have not checked the Bill on this
default—
defaultthat elected representatives are held to be resident in the place which they represent
default—
defaultChair:default 
defaultI t
defaulthink we have given ourselves an
default extension
default—
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: so that should make it easy
default for you.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultI have had a quick look and I think you may have answered a few of the questions that 
defaultHywel
default and 
defaultNia
default were about to put to you, but 
defaultNia
default wanted to ask something in between
default,
default so I will let them work out whether they need to ask more.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultJust on that one, imagine you are Airbus doing payroll
default,
default so you have a huge work
default 
defaultforce and you have people living both sides of the border. You are saying it would be quite simple
default; y
defaultou would just have a tax code and it would sort itself out.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultFor most people, this will be done by payroll software
default,
default and for a long time in respect of 
defaultScotland
default all the payroll software, in order to be compliant with Revenue relations, had to be able to administer a potential Scottish income tax. The same should apply in relation to 
defaultWales
default. I am not saying it will be without problems, but, by comparison with what other countries manage, this is pretty simple.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultMr Davies used the term 
default“tax farming”,
default which brings something to mind. The Inland Revenue certainly will charge
default,
default or is proposing to charge
default,
default the devolved Government for the extra costs of collecting their tax. In my opinion, this needs to be subject to a very specific contract
default,
default and I would make it a tax
default&#x2011;
defaultsharing
default arrangement. In other words, 
default“
defaultWe are not going to give you the fee you want. We are going to give you some proportion of it
default,
default plus a proportion of the tax revenue we receive,
default”
default because otherwise I have no confidence that the Revenue will be particularly assiduous in making sure that all the revenues 
defaultthat
default are due to Wales will actually come in. There might be a reverse Goldman Sachs process where they are not careful enough.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI am not sure I agree with that.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultI would give them an incentive to make sure that these administrative arrangements are thoroughly applied. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default Mr 
defaultHoltham
default, could an income tax-
defaultsharing model be adopted before reform of the 
defaultBarnett formula
default? Is this desirable?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultAnything can happen. The First Minister of 
defaultWales
default, of course, is on the record as saying he thinks that a reform of Barnett is a precondition for accepting income tax reform. For the reasons I have given, I certainly think it would help matters and would help to secure and win a referendum, if that is what you want. 
defaultI do think he has maybe focused on slightly the lesser of the problems with the 
defaultBarnett formula
default. There is this calculation that we made that 
defaultWales
default is slightly underfunded, but it is 2% or 3%. These things are infinitely discussible. It is not a massive amount. The current austerity, of course, puts the Barnett squeeze into reverse so that the Welsh shortfall is becoming slightly smaller. It still exists, but it is becoming smaller. To me, that is a second order issue compared 
defaultwith
default this issue that
default,
default once growth resumes
default,
default the squeeze will go on and in 10 years
default’
default time, unless nothing is done, you will not be a 
defaultfew hundred million underfunded—
default you will be a billion or more underfunded. So it is essential, I think, to stop the squeeze. I would not worry too much about the 2% or 3%, but that is just my opinion. Certainly
default,
default some reform, I think, would be necessary to lubricate this process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultQuickly, to pick up with Professor Gallagher, about comparing the mobility of taxpayers between 
defaultScotland
default and 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultEngland
default, it is not the same 
defaultbecause
default the border is closer and more porous. 
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultThat is right
default,
default yes.
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultMy father
default&#x2011;
defaultin
default&#x2011;
defaultlaw is something of a nationalist and he usually greets me with, 
default“
defaultHow goes it on building the eastern seaboard?
default”
default, but we actually do
defaultn’t
default have one.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultYou are absolutely right. One of the interesting pieces of work 
defaultthat
default Gerry did in the 
defaultC
defaultommission on funding for 
defaultWales
default was to analyse where the taxpayers were. Of course
default,
default there 
defaultare
default a large number of taxpayers within a relatively short distance of the Welsh border, whereas
default,
default if you look
default at the Scottish
default&#x2011;
defaultEnglish
default border,
default the taxpayers get pretty 
defaultthin round there and
default there are more sheep than taxpayers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultCan I follow up on that? Is there any merit in the argument that a higher tax rate which would be lowered would increase the take, as it were
default—
defaultlower tax, higher take
default—
defaultif we attracted people in?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultIt depends what you regard as a good thing. If you think attracting higher rate taxpayers in from 
defaultEngland
default is a good thing for the Welsh economy and will produce revenue for the Welsh Government, then the opportunity for doing that in 
defaultWales
default is much greater than in 
defaultScotland
default. If, on the other hand, you think that encouraging people to move from one place to another in order to minimise their tax liability is a bad thing, then there is less of that danger in 
defaultScotland
default and more of that danger in 
defaultWales
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt depends what you value.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultCan I insert a word there? 
defaultI
defaultt is a perfectly reasonable point
default 
defaultthat you do not want to create a situation in which the tax base is cannibalised because there is a competition 
defaultto reduce taxes. On the other hand, Governments quite happily spend money on regional policy
default,
default and what the hell is a regional policy except an attempt to move economic activity from one area to another? 
defaultIn
default my way of thinking, you have to limit this. Nobody is suggesting that Wales should be able to abolish the top tax rate and become the Isle of Man
default—
defaultthat is not the suggestion
default—
defaultbut a limited ability to do that is just a tax expenditure and it can be seen in exactly the same terms as any Government expenditure aimed at promoting regional development when you have large inequalities in regional activity across the country.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI would just like to add, partly in support of that, 
defaultthat 
defaultof course this would be very significant for 
defaultWales
default, but the loss would not be very significant for 
defaultEngland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default 
defaultI have a brief question on the point you have just made. Clearly
default,
default there 
defaultare a
default lot of people who take the view that the lockstep is not sensible because it renders it unusable, and I may have some sympathy with that view. But you have just said that
default,
default if there was not a lockstep, there should in fact be a limitation on the degree. In 
defaultScotland
default, it was 3p—
default3%. If there was no lockstep, would you still envisage, for it to work properly, that there would be a limitation on
default, say,
default the amount you could reduce the top rate by?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultYes. We must 
defaultnot take too binary a view here:
default either you have no control over the tax or you can do anything you like with the tax. If you have frameworks for what a devolved authority can do with the tax, it greatly opens up the possibilities for devolution; you can partially devolve things that you could not dream of fully devolving. I do not think you should devolve the income tax to 
defaultWales
default and say you can do anything you like with the top rate. I do not think the Welsh Government would do it
default, but that would be 
defaultto invite a tax
default&#x2011;
defaulthaven
default kind of strategy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOr possibly the opposite.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThe opposite?
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf I may say so
default—
defaultif I may come in with something
default—
defaultyou are making the assumption
default that
default, if the Welsh Assembly had that power, it might see some financial gain 
defaultin reducing the top rate of tax. B
defaultut I personally think, and I do not know what your opinion is, it is equally possible that the Assembly may say, 
default“We actually don’
defaultt like the rich very much. We are a left
default&#x2011;
defaultwing party
default”—whichever one is in
default charge, possibly not including the Conservatives
default—“
defaulta
defaultnd we are going to tax these so-and-
defaultsos.
default”
default Is that not equally likely to happen?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: If you look around the world,
default that is not what tends to happen. I acknowledge there are those instincts in certain quarters in 
defaultWales
default, but the brute fact is th
defaultat a left
default&#x2011;
defaultwing Government serve
default 
defaulttheir
default people by providing public services that they could not afford if they were provided privately. The way 
defaultthey do
default that is by maximising 
defaulttheir
default revenue
default,
default and raising the top rate of tax is not going to maximise their revenue. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is not a lesson that has been grasped in all quarters yet.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default L
defaultook at 
defaultFrance
default at this point in time. I think political parties often do go with their instinct rather than 
defaultwith 
defaultcommon sense.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: S
defaulto did Mitterrand, but then he reversed 
defaultit 
defaultwithin 18 months
default,
default and I will give you 
defaultquite 
defaulta 
defaultfluid 
defaultprediction about 
defaultHollande
default now.
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultBut they do 
defaultdo
default it.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThere are certain realities and it is very hard to
default—
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultI absolutely agree with you.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI started this and I deserve 
defaultit
default, but I am going to call 
defaulton 
defaultGeraint.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultI will not comment on 
defaultHollande
default’
defaults
default instincts either
default,
default but my understanding is that there 
defaultare 
defaultabout 8,000 people in 
defaultWales
default who are on the top rate of 45p
default,
default and, therefore, if you wanted to raise the same money at 40p
default—
defaultif you reduced it from 45p to 40p
default—
defaultyou would 
defaultonly need 9,000. S
defaulto the change in the number of rich people in 
defaultWales
default to balance the books at a significantly lower rate is very small
default.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultExactly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultTherefore, if these people are sitting on the border, the idea of tax farming and migration of large numbers of very rich people is a real opportunity for 
defaultWales
default,
default or, if you like, if you do not like the idea, the c
defaultannibalisation is there as well. B
defaultut if there was not a lockstep, would you agree that there is a very significant opportunity for more money for 
defaultWales
default from richer taxpayers?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThat is my view and, as I say, I think you should restrict that. I take the point that they may not do it, but I do not think you should give them the opportunity to completely cannibalise the 
defaultUK
default tax system. 
defaultThat
default is no part of my argument
default.
default 
defaultBut 
default1p, 2p or 3p is not going to have a material effect in 
defaultEngland
default;
default it could have a material effect in 
defaultWales
default.
defaultChair:default Thank you;
default this is a fascinating debate, 
defaultbut perhaps we should move on to 
defaultGuto
default 
defaultBebb
default on the costs of a referendum.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultI am not sure whether I am that interested in the question of the costs of the referendum
default;
default I am more interested in the question of the concerns that have been expressed by you as to whether we should have a referendum on the tax i
defaultssue. I understand the arguments
default that you are making, which is that the gains from having the powers to vary tax might be small and therefore the risk is high, but surely a significant change of this nature should be subject to a
default vote among the people of Wales.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: Yes, 
defaultI do not disagree that we have established a precedent that significant constitutional change requires a referendum, but we have got into an unfortunate position in 
defaultWales
default,
default whereby we are doing devolution on the instalment plan.
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultThere is always a process, not an event.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThat may be perfectly sensible, by the way
default—
defaultI do not think that is necessarily stupid
default—
defaultbut it would have been good to have had a r
defaulteferendum at the start that 
defaultsaid
default, 
default“
defaultShall we do devolution on the instalment plan?
default”
default and
default,
default if you had got a yes vote
default,
default you then did not have to have a referendum on every minor adaptation. Even with the one on legislation, 
defaultit
default is going to allow you 
defaultto have 
defaultprimary legislation in
default—
defaultI forget the numbers
default—
default28 areas
default,
default with 32 exceptions. The public is not interested in that degree of detail. I think they want to vote on a principle and then leave it to the politicians to sort 
defaultit 
defaultout.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultBut the point made about income tax being devolved is the fact that it is visible and it will have an impact in terms of people being aware that the Welsh Government 
defaultare
default raising taxes. 
defaultS
defaulturely
default,
default the point you make about devolution of powers is not the same as devolution of income tax
default,
default because that sheer visibility does demand, I would argue, that the people of 
defaultWales
default have a vote on the issue.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultYes, I do not disagree in principle that a shift of tax
default&#x2011;
defaultraising
default powers should be subject to some sort of referendum at some point, but I suppose I am making the Irish argument that we should not be starting from here really. I am not sure what I would say about the present situation, but it is the case that we are holding a series of referendums on w
defaulthat are relatively small shifts—
defaultand that cannot be sensible. It would be better to have one and say, 
default“
defaultLook, we are on a process.
default”
default After all, political parties can run for office in 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultWestminster
default on whether they want more or less
default, and we are supposed to have a p
defaultarliamentary democracy. So I think we are overdoing the referendums.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI think 
defaultWales
default has overdone their referendums
default,
default but we are where we are. The lessons I would draw from that are, 
default“
defaultPlease do not overdo them again.
default”
default It is inevitable, I think, that there is going to have to be a referendum before there are income tax powers. That is the political and the legislative reality. I suppose the question is
default,
default if people are at any point thinking of further development of devolution, which is by no means
default out of the question, please don’
defaultt put the Welsh people through yet another referendum afterwards. Could you not get this one in a job lot?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultI had better identify the issue of the cost. What, roughly, would you be anticipating the cost of a referendum on income tax to be to the Welsh Government?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultI have no idea.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI am sorr
defaulty—
defaultI have not done that sum.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI do not think that was a question actually. 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default No; it was a question 
defaultI was asking 
defaultjust 
defaultout of interest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies: defaultI want to pursue this issue of the referendum because, perhaps unusually in my party, I am not in favour of a referendum. I think we 
defaultshould announce at the general e
defaultlection that this is our view and if the people vote us into office then we can carry it through. But I think that is probably 
defaultjust 
defaulta view I hold and 
defaultit 
defaultis not going to happen. 
defaultW
defaulthat worries me a bit more is that what we would be doing is having a referendum 
defaultthat
default might deli
defaultver a system that is not usable; i
defaultt just wo
defaultn’t
default be usable. Then do we have to have another referendum to amend it to 
defaultmake it usable
default,
default by removing the lockstep or whatever? I 
defaultjust 
defaultsee having a referen
defaultdum on something that is not us
defaultable as completely mad.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: T
defaulthe answer to that is probably no
default.
default 
defaultThe reason the answer is no is that,
default if you look at the Scottish precedent, 
defaultthe reason why 
defaultthere has been no subsequent referendum in Scotland on extending the powers of the Scottish Parliament to the tax powers it has now under the 2012 Act is that the initial referendum in Scotland was, if you remember, a two
default&#x2011;
defaultquestion
default referendum, 
default“
defaultShould there be a Scottish Parliament and should it have tax powers?
default”
default Admittedly, those tax powers were relatively limited
default,
default but the principle was there in the Scottish referendum. Unfortunately, the 1999 referendum in 
defaultWales
default did not mention tax powers
default,
default and at some point, I guess, therefore, tax powers are going to have to be subject to the view of the people. But subsequently adjusting the tax powers is a different matter, as the Scottish precedent shows.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThe referendum should be framed in sufficiently general terms that it covers subsequent changes
default.
default I think 
defaultthat 
defaultis the point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultFollowing on from that, not
default least, we have the spectre of P
defaultart 
defaultII
default of Silk and 
defaultthe 
defaultpossible transfer of all powers, so there may well be a referendum linked up with that lot. I hesitate to ask this question now
default—
defaultit is rather tame and I think I know the answer
default—
defaultbut what difference will the devolution of stamp duty land tax and the landfill tax make to W
defaultelsh financial accountability? 
defaultGiven the scale of what you are saying, very little, but none the less
default—
default 
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultYes, relatively little, I think it is only fair to say. Stamp duty is a visible tax. People do buy and sell houses and they a
defaultre very aware of it at the time, s
defaulto
default,
default if the 
defaultWelsh Government do
default anything with it, it will attract attention. I would not say there was no gain in accountability, but it is limited
default,
default certainly.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultIt is worth spotting that accountability and autonomy go together and these are powers 
defaultthat the Welsh Government—the Welsh Assembly—
defaultwould exercise first of all to influence their total budget, but sec
defaultondly, in relation to the taxes.
default 
defaultT
defaultaxes are also policy instruments. 
defaultS
defaulttamp duty is a policy instrument in relation to the housing market, and, of course, most of the other powers in relation to the housing market are devolved to the Welsh Assembly. 
defaultT
defaulthat extends the policy tools available to the body
default,
default and that is a good thing, in my view.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultThe same 
defaultcan be said 
defaultfor the landfill tax
default.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultIndeed, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultOther than the taxes 
defaultyou have 
defaultalready mentioned, were there additional areas that you felt that Silk perhaps should have looked at, and perhaps the Government should look at
default—
defaultother taxes that should be devolved?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultAs Professor Gallagher has said, within an economic union there are certain restrictions on which taxes it is sensible to devolve. One of th
defaulte things that both the 
defaultCalman
default C
defaultommission and Silk said might be devolved is air passenger duty, which I know the Welsh Government 
defaultare
default keen on. It has been devolved in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default for long
default&#x2011;
defaulthaul
default flights only
default,
default and I think restricting it to long
default&#x2011;
defaulthaul
default flights does remove most of the objections to devolution. Obviously, if you devolved air passenger duty to 
defaultWales
default and the Welsh Government abolished it for 
defaultCardiff
default a
defaultirport, 
defaultBristol
default would have a comp
defaultlaint, but if it is long 
defaulthaul there is no long runway in 
defaultBristol
default—
defaultthey do not do long haul
default—
defaultso, to that extent, it is less of an issue. I think it would have been possible to devolve long
default&#x2011;
defaulthaul
default APT. It is a fairly minor matter, but it could have been done
default,
default and I am not quite sure why the Treasury is so hostile. In the case of 
defaultScotland
default, there 
defaultis not much competition in long 
defaulth
defaultaul between Scottish airports as t
defaulthe nearest one is 
defaultManchester
default, I suppose, so I am slightly puzzled by their reticence there
default. B
defaultut there is that one. 
defaultI myself do not take the same view as Professor Gallagher about the impossibility of
default devolving corporation tax, but—but—
defaultyou certainly again could not just do it. You would have to have very strict protocols on what could be done. It would require a reform in the way that corporation tax liability is assessed. At the moment
default,
default it is a brass
default&#x2011;
defaultplate
default operation. If I put my brass plate in 
defaultSwansea
default,
default then I pay my tax there, which is why the London Mayor is able to go around claiming that all the economic activity occurs in 
defaultLondon
default, but t
defaulthat is because all the companies are registered here and this is where the corporation tax is. The fact that the factory is in
default 
defaultthe Wirral or somewhere does not seem to matter. If you had a system whereby, as 
defaultthey
default do in the 
defaultUnited States
default, corporation tax liability depended on where your payroll was, then you 
defaultwould 
defaultcollect it centrally and hand it out according to such criter
defaultia. If you did that and you restri
defaultcted the extent to which changes could be made in it, you could devolve corporation tax, but there are two very big 
default“
defaultifs
default”
default there
default,
default and it is not on the agenda at the moment.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI agree with that analysis. If you are going to devolve corporation tax, the way to do it is the way in which Gerry has described. I suppose the reservations I have about corporation tax can be summed up in the words 
default“
defaultStarbucks
default”
default and 
default“
defaultAmazon
default”,
default in that
default 
defaultthe more complexity you put into the tax system
default,
default the more oppo
defaultrtunity you give for evasion. 
defaultJust to complete the picture, there are a few other small taxes you might think about. In principle, you might think about capital gains tax on real property to complete the property tax bundle, although the administration of that would be very difficult because you would have to think about separate capital gains limits for real property and other assets
default,
default and that might be difficult for the rest of the 
defaultUK
default. The other one is inheritance tax, which is a personal tax. It raises relatively small sums of money. The precedent from 
defaultAustralia
default for decentralising it is not a very attractive one
default,
default but, in principle, I guess it would be possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultVery briefly, in your opinion does the revenue stream available from the minor taxes such as SDLT and aggregates constitute an independent revenue stream
default,
default which may in turn trigger the £500 million borrowing limit?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultMy understanding is that 
defaultthat 
defaulthas more or less been agreed and, if you think about it, we are fortunate, in a sense, to be living in a time o
defaultf low interest rates. I
defaultf they can borrow at 4%, a shade over Treasury rate, then £500 million is only going to cost you £20 million a year. The new taxes will bring in maybe £200 million a year, so certainly there is no issue about carrying capability there.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI agree with that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultThere are two parts to my question. First, is there any motivation for the Welsh Government to vary stamp duty or landfill tax because of what would happen to the block grant? Secondly, what flexibility would they have
default—
defaultin other words, to charge different values of property different amounts
default—
defaultand, in practice, would they use it?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThe first thing to say is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Act is mute on exactly how the block grant will be adjusted for once the taxes are devolved. There are various ways to do this and I am the world
default’
defaults greatest bore on this subject. There is a lot of algebra in the report 
defaultof the Commission 
defaultthat I chaired on exactly this issue. 
defaultI
defaultt really depends on what discussions result in
default,
default 
defaultin 
defaultterms of how the block grant is to be adjusted. It is not s
defaulto much the immediate adjustment—y
defaultou can guess 
defaultwhat revenue is going to be this year, 
defaultor you can count what revenue is thi
defaults year and take that off the blo
defaultc
defaultk grant—
defaultbut it is what you do going forward that is the big issue.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultGiven how small the sums are, that should not be a major problem to negotiate with the Treasury. The interesting one is what you do if you devolve income tax.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: That is absolutely right.
default 
defaultT
defaulto an
defaultswer the rest of your question as to 
defaulthow attractive it will be
default, it 
defaultdepe
defaultnds really on those discussions,
default but, yes, as far as I can understand
default it,
default they would have complete control of the structure of these taxes as well as the rates. It is not like income tax. If they want to abolish them or change them radically, they are able to do so, and indeed in Scotland there has been a lot of discussion about reform of the tax on housing transactions because it is 
defaulta 
defaultso
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled slab
default&#x2011;
defaultsided tax
default,
default which leads to big jumps at certain house prices
default,
default and trying to flatten that out is one of the things that they have been looking at in Scotland. It is quite difficult to do without causing big winners and losers as you go up the schedule, so it is not that easy, but 
defaultit is 
defaultthe sort of thing they would have to think about.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultIf I could add to that, there is, as it were, a relatively limited opportunity simply to consider reforming the stamp duty land tax, which I think most economists would agree is not a particularly well designed tax
default,
default for the reasons that Gerry says. But if the Bill goes through
default,
default 
defaultwe will have
default a system under which all property taxation in 
defaultWales
default will be able to be looked at in the round and
default,
default indeed
default,
default in 
defaultScotland
default as well. One of the UK
default’
defaults long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm strategic issues for the tax system is that we under
default&#x2011;
defaulttax
default property
default,
default and this gives both th
defaulte devolved A
defaultdministrations the opportunity to have a root
default&#x2011;
defaultand
default&#x2011;
defaultbranch
default look at how we tax all property, both on an ongoing basis and in relation to transactions. There is an economic argument 
defaultthat
default says you should tax property more continuingly rather than at the time of transaction. It is handy to do it at the time of transaction because there is cash around
default,
default but, of course, putting a tax on a transaction may discourage a transaction when a transaction might well be economically desirable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultAre you saying the power is here not only to have that transaction tax but to have the equivalent of a mansion tax?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultThe mansion tax would be done by altering the bands in the council tax, which, to my recollection, is within the powers of the Assembly.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultIn fact, they already have introduced an additional band in council tax above those that exist in 
defaultEngland
default,
default and they have the power to completely reshape that if they wish to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultIs there any concern with the devolution of income tax and increased borrowing powers that 
defaultwe will go
default to a situation where the borrowing powe
defaultrs are maximised, therefore top-
defaultslicing the block grant, or indeed income tax, to undermine revenues in Wales
default,
default at a time 
defaultwhen
default maybe we should be talking about getting our fair share of capital spend in the UK?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultWhen you say a 
default“fair share of capital spend,”
default are you referring to things like Network Rail or public agencies? 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultIf you took HS2, you could argue that 
defaultWales
default should have an extra £2 billion as the share of 
defaultthat infrastructure investment. It is 
defaultcontroversial, but it dwarfs what we are talking about here. Is it not the case that what has happened is the political agenda has been refocused on these marginal borrowing powers
default,
default when really what we want in 
defaultWales
default is capital investment? We have our eye off the ball. 
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultPut it this way: the 
defaultBarnett formula
default has no statutory basis, so if the Treasury want to move the goalposts, they can put them on the halfway line and there is nothing to be done about it. When you are looking at something like HS2, if they determine that, 
default“
defaultLook, this is in the interests of the 
defaultUK
default as a who
defaultle. I
defaultt is not specifically for 
defaultEngland
default and therefore there is no question of a Barnett consequential,
default”
default there is no Court of Appeal except for making a big political fuss. That is a situation which has persisted
default—
defaultand I make no partisan point
default—
defaultwith every British Government that I have 
defaultever lived under. 
defaultNone of them has shown any appetite for reforming this, so I do not know that we are diverting attention
default;
default there was not any attention there in the first place.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI am not sure I quite swallow the premise of your question, Mr Davies. To the extent that the 
defaultBarnett formula
default is properly applied, 
defaultWales
default gets a share of relevant capital spending. You might well run an argument 
defaultthat
default says, 
default“
defaultGiven the economic development needs of 
defaultWales
default, the 
defaultUK
default should divert substantial investment by the UK Government into 
defaultWales
default.
default”
default That is a perfectly plausible argument, though I have not actually heard it made. But I do not think giving 
defaultWales
default the power to borrow and invest is anything other than a good thing for 
defaultWales
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultCan you comment on the right level of borrowing for 
defaultWales
default? I know we have been talking about £500 million and that is explained, but what do you think,
default over time, would be a sensible 
defaultlevel of borrowing limit for 
defaultWales
default?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultThe Welsh capital budget at the moment under the block grant is,
default I think, roughly £1.5 billion—of that order—
defaultso the amount of borrowing ought to be at least in the same order of m
defaultagnitude as that, by which I don’
defaultt mean £1.5 billion but rather having 
defaultat least the same number of digits as that. So
default,
default 
defaultfor £500 million, £1.2 billion to £1.3 billion
default does not seem to me to be, as it were, out of the ordinary. 
defaultTwo things are striking. The first is that 
defaultthe 
default£500 million comes, as it were, with the very small taxes, but the great slug of income tax only brings another £700 million or so. So there is no particular proportionality there. You might argue that, therefore, the £700 million was a bit weak. On the other hand, you might say the £500 million was maybe a bit generous. Provided that the borrowing is repaid, and borrowing has to be repaid, and that the Welsh Government
default—
defaultI say this very carefully because Governments struggle sometimes
default—are
default capable of investing it in a way 
defaultthat
default will be economically wise, and I am sure 
defaultthey
default can do that but 
defaultthey have
default to be very careful, I do not see why in principle it should not be 
defaulta bit 
defaultmore than that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultMay I s
defaultay that in the past as to this—whatever it is—
default£15.7 billio
defaultn that the Welsh Government get
default, to a certain extent there has been flexibility between whether they invest that in revenue and capital
default,
default and
default,
default given that if they had much greater borrowing powers they could bring forward investment in, for instance, hospitals and the like
default,
default and spread that cost over many years through borrowing, especially if they fixed them at low interest rates now, you could make the argument that the borrowing powers for Wales should be much higher
default,
default irrespective of devolution of income tax
default?
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultI think you could
default,
default and one of the things that underpins that argument would be that, for reasons good and bad, Wales has invested much less in private finance arrangements of the PFI or PPP type, and
default,
default therefore
default,
default there are very low liabilities in Wales compared 
defaultwith
default Scotland or, indeed, England. 
defaultSo t
defaulthe Welsh Government 
defaultare
default not carrying any particular burden of debt at the present time. If you included that, there is quite a large capacity. If you think about it, what proportion of your revenue might it be sensible to commit to debt servi
defaultcing? If you said 5%
default for example, that would enable 
defaultWales
default to borrow several billion. 
defaultI think the powers post-
defaultincome tax are fairly tight. They could be enlarged somewhat without risk to prudence, I think.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultAre we all working on the assumption that the UK Government would underwrite any bond
defaults
default that the 
defaultWelsh Assembly Government issued—
defaultany borrowing that 
defaultthey
default made?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI do not think it is proposed in the Bill that the Welsh Assembly Government would get 
defaulttheir
default borrowing by issuing bonds directly. 
defaultThey
default would borrow the money from the Treasury and, therefore, 
defaulttheir
default obligation would be to the Treasury rather than the markets. That is perfectly sensible because the UK Government will get a better interest rate than the Welsh Government would
default,
default just in the nature of things.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThat is true in general, absolutely, although having the ability to issue bonds has the wonderful effect on the rates
default that get quoted to you by the Debt Management O
defaultffice. Only because local authorities could issue bonds if they wanted to
default,
default did the Debt Management Office suddenly find it could charge them 40 basis points over rather than 140 over, which it was trying to do. 
defaultT
defaulthe Silk Commission did recommend that the Welsh Government should have the power to issue bonds, but this was another area where the Scots 
defaulthaven’t got it, so we can’
defaultt have it either.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default A
default quick question, to finish off on the referendum point, is to ask whether either of you have turned your mind to a form of words 
defaultwhich
default the Electoral Commission may be comfortable with and which would, I think, summarise the conversation that we have had today in
default a way that could be understood.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThe short answer, I am afraid, is no, I have not. Maybe other later witnesses for whom this is an area of speciality can help you more. My only thought, as I said earlier, is that the thing should be phrased sufficiently generally that we do not feel the need to keep coming back and having these very detailed referendums.
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI agree with that. It would have to mention the words 
default“income tax”.
default Beyond that, I would not like to do the drafting. The last referendum wording started out bad and got, if anything, marginally worse, but this one is not such a convoluted proposition.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultI should ask you about the estim
defaultated cost of the implementation of
default the financial settlement. The sections of the Scotland Act, I understand, were £40 million to £45 million, including £10 million on the IT and £4.2 million on annual running costs. What costs do you anticipate for the Welsh Government in connection with the implementation of this Bill?
defaultProfessor Gallagherdefault: 
defaultI have not personally made an estimate of the costs. Those Scottish numbers will probably turn out to be wrong in one direction or another because it has not yet been done, though the work is going on just now and the Revenue 
defaultis
default getting ready for 2016. It would be sensible to make a better estimate of the Welsh costs once we have seen what the Scottish costs actually are, but we are certainly talking about
default two figures of millions, that’
defaults for sure.
defaultGerald defaultHolthamdefault: 
defaultThey will be a lot less than 
defaultScotland
default simply because there was an element of fixed cost in this in devising and setting up the procedures
default,
default and that has been done for 
defaultScotland
default and can be applied to 
defaultWales
default. Professor Gallagher is quite right in that we are talking millions, but it will be a lot less than 
defaultScotland
default, I think.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much indeed and thank you for staying on a little bit. We apologise for running over. It has been a very interesting session and it could have turned into quite a lively debate at one point as well, so we are very grateful to both of you. Thanks a lot.
defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultProfessor Richard defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault, Director, and 
defaultProfessor Roger Scullydefault, Wales Governance Centre, 
defaultCardiff
default 
defaultUniversity
default, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Professors 
defaultWyn
default 
defaultJones and Scully, we have met you before, obviously, at various village halls, I think, in Monmouthshire. It is nice to see you 
defaultboth 
defaultagain. I am the Chai
defaultr
default of the 
defaultSelect Committee. We are just going to start off, and a
defaultpologies that we are a bit late,
default but we got into a bit of a discussion there. Could I start with 
defaultGuto
default 
defaultBebb
default, please?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultGood morning.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultBore 
defaultda
default.
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultWe have heard a lot of evidence this morning which has highlighted the fact that, despite the significant differences between 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultScotland
default, a lot of the draft Wales Bill appears to be very similar to what has been proposed and implemented in 
defaultthe
default Scottish context. Do you think that is a weakness or a strength of these proposals
default,
default and can you explain your response?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultI think
default,
default in particular
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthe position in the Bill on the lockstep is deeply problematic. It runs against all the evidence in 
defaultHoltha
defaultm
default, in particular, 
defaultwhich I think everybody accepts 
defaultis 
defaultth
defaulte authoritative source on this; it runs 
defaultagainst the arguments in Silk and it renders the income tax power as pretty much unusable; to vary from England is pretty much inconceivable. 
defaultOf course t
defaulthe thing 
defaultthat
default is radically different from the Scotland Act 2012 is the referendum provision, and I hope at some stage you will ask me for my views on that. 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default I am sure I will, b
defaultut I wanted a wider response to this first question.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIn terms of the detail, it follows 
defaultScotland
default,
default and in ways which are unhelpful and not supported by the evidence that we have.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultYou have highlighted the lockstep. Are there any other areas where you would highlight the similarities being a concern?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultI would say personally that is the key element of this Bill. That and the referendum provisions are the really problematic elements in this Bill.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultI would broadly agree with Richard and, I suppose, maybe anticipating some later discussions. Personally, I am not particularly persuaded of the principal case for a referendum, although I think as to that argument things have moved on. 
defaultI
defaultf you think about practically what a referendum would look like, it starts to look very problematic in terms of who is going to be motivated to go out and campa
defaultign for what looks like a close-to-
defaultunusable power.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultJust to clarify 
defaulton 
defaultthe issue of the referendum, since both of you have raised it, I take it that it is not necessarily the principle of having a referendum on the devolution of income tax powers 
defaultthat
default is 
defaulta concern; it is
default rather the fact that the powers for income tax variation as it stands in the current draft Bill would be practically unusable even if there was a yes vote in the referendum. Is that your real 
defaultposition
default?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultNo, that is not my position, but I do not know about Roger
default’
defaults. My own position is that I am against this on principle, and can I explain why?
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultYes.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultThe argument has been accepted by all parties that you need tax powers to make devolved Government properly accountable. Fiscal responsibility is an argument 
defaultthat
default is there in 
defaultHoltham
default, in 
defaultCalman
default and in Silk. It underpins the Scotland Act 2012. It has been accepted 
defaultvery
default widely. My question to you is, 
defaults
defaulthould responsibility and accountability be optional?
default 
defaultSh
defaultould those things be optional? 
defaultI think no. That is my view. In principle, there should
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultA response from m
defaulte
default would be that the consent of the people is pretty important as well and, after all, the original devolution powers granted in 
defaultScotland
default did include a vote on the issue of whether there would be tax variation. So the principle of tax variation was part and parcel of the 1997 settlement in 
defaultScotland
default, but there was no such vote in 
defaultWales
default.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultThere are basically three arguments put forward as to 
defaultwhy we should have a referendum.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultfirst is the so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled Scottish precedent; 
defaultthe second is that
default there is a kind of fundamental constitutional principle here; 
defaultthe third is that
default the public somehow demand or expect it. 
defaultIn terms of the Scottish precedent, the fact is
default—
defaultand this is not a facetious point
default—that 
defaultthere is a precedent for almost everything in British constitutional history. In fact, 
defaultScotland
default offers two precedents on this issue. They had a referendum in 
default1997, a
default second question, which was the optional power to vary the basic rate. 
defaultCalman
default changed the whole premise of that and said, 
default“
defaultActually, you should be forced 
defaultto make decisions on income tax.”
default 
defaultT
defaulthere was no referendum involved there at all. 
defaultT
defaulthat was a 
defaultvery different argument,
default 
default“
defaultIt is not an option; you are being forced to do this to be responsible.
default”
default So I would say the Scottish precedent is much less compelling tha
defaultn people assume. 
defaultIn terms of the fundamental constitutional principle, is making an already existing layer of Government more accountable a breach? The Silk Commission ties itself into knots because it argues that there is a fundamental constitutional issue around income tax powers but not around minor taxes. They struggle. 
defaultT
defaulthe argument they end up with 
defaultis scholastic in the extreme. 
defaultI
defaultn terms of 
default“
defaultDo the public accept it?
default”
default we have two bits of data
default on that
default: something in the Silk Commission, 
defaultwhich is 
defaulta very broad
defaultly framed
default question about devolving income tax powers completely, which is not there, and then there is also, of course, a majority there for a referendum on minor tax powers
default, which nobody is talking about.
default Then we have some evidence 
defaultfrom
default just before Silk
default,
default trying to ask people
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte assume that a lot of people would say yes to a referendum on anything
default. W
defaulte do not want to have a referendum on everything, do we
default, so the key question is, i
defaults this an issue which is 
defaultparticularly important, which 
defaultpeople feel particularly strongly about
default?
default 
defaultT
defaulthe evidence that we have is no. 
defaultThe issue of s
defaulthared income tax powers is not 
defaultone 
defaultthat people have a very strong feeling for. In fact, there was not a majority for a referendum on that in the data that we collected.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultCan I follow up on one or two points there? In the UK in general we, frankly, have got ourselves in a little bit of a mess in terms of what are the sorts of issues on which we should have referendums and the sorts of things which should be properly left to representative democracy. We elect people, broadly speaking, 
defaultto 
defaultmake the decisions
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultHouse of Lords Constitutional Affairs Committee
default,
default a few years ago I think
default,
default published a very good report on this, the broad thrust of which was arguing that
default,
default essentially
default,
default there has been no principle in terms of when we hold referendums and not. It has been much more political opportunism. The Lords Committee was broadly suggesting that we should reserve referendums for major matters of constitutional principle, 
defaultsuch as abolishing the monarchy, the
default House
defaults
default of Parliament or maybe setting up a devolved institution. Like Richard, I am not at all convinced that devolving income tax powers in the manner suggested by Silk is compelling. Given, as Richard said, 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are precedents for almost everything, we have in recent decades, for instance, established two wholly new systems of local government taxation in the community c
defaultharge, poll tax and council tax
default without, I think, even the suggestion of a referendum on either. Is transferring partial responsibility over an 
defaultexisting tax from one level of g
defaultovernment to another 
defaultreally 
defaultmore fundamental? I do not think so myself. 
defaultRichard 
defaultmentioned
default some of the evidence we have gathered
default. W
defaulte even asked people 
defaultabout 
defaultwhat we thought were blatantly ridiculous items to have a referendum
default on, such as 
defaultthe 5p charge on carrier bags
default. Y
defaultou still get over 30% 
defaultof people 
defaultsaying
default yes,
default we should have referendums on that. If people are asked
default,
default 
default“
defaultDo you want a say?
default”
default they tend to say, 
default“
defaultYes
default.”
default It does not follow from that, however, that they will want to take part
default,
default be interested and go o
defaultu
defaultt and vote in the referendum when it actually happens.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultIt is an interesting discussion 
defaultthat 
defaultwe can have. 
defaultT
defaulthe demand for a referendum does reflect the loss of confidence in the political class as a whole and I think that is why people do generally say yes
default,
default they want a referendum because there is a feeling that they do want to take part and have an influence
default. 
defaultG
defaultoing back to the original question, in view of the fact that we are 
defaultnow 
defaultdebating 
defaultor
default scrutinising the draft Wales Bill as it stands, is it your given position that you are opposed to a referendum, full stop, or would you prefer to see that referendum become a meaningful referendum because of the issue of the lockstep?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultMy own view
default—
defaultand Richard may have a slightly different view
default—
defaultis 
defaultthat 
defaultI am certainly not persuaded by the principal case for a referendum
default,
default and I thought the Silk Commission I report was intellectually a very impressive document until the couple of pages when they discuss the referendum
default,
default when the s
defaulttandard dives down dramatically—
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default That 
defaultis where the politics came in.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: a
defaultnd then 
defaultdives
default back up. I am not myself a diehard opponent of referendums, but there are probably more compelling things to have referendums on than this. My biggest co
defaultncerns, frankly, are practical
default. As 
defaulthas been
default 
defaultsaid
default already 
defaultin the previous session 
defaultby people who
default know far more about it than us, 
defaultthese look 
defaultto be 
defaultfairly unusable powers
default. I
defaultn practice
default,
default who is going to go out and campaign for this referendum on either side, perhaps particularly the 
defaulty
defaultes
default side?
default 
defaultWe may have at least one individual here. 
defaultI suspect
default 
defaultthat, frankly, this referendum would make the March 2011 referendum look like a triumph of participatory democracy. I would not be at all surprised if you got turnout levels below 25%. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default Just as a final question, i
defaults it your view that the powers envisaged to be transferred as a result of a referendum, as it currently stands, are so inconsequential that there will not be a referendum called?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIn order to unlock these powers, why would you bother? You cannot meaningfully vary the rates, so why would you bother? The only reason to bother is to make the borrowing envelope bigger. It is surely perverse to have a referendum 
defaultthat
default is practically about the size of a borrowing envelope. That is just perverse, in my view. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default 
defaultTo some extent
default—
defaultespecially Richard
default—
defaultyou are giving an opinion in terms of the referendum, which is right. To challenge that opinion with another opinion, I have always thought that the view of the people is important
default,
default but I do not think a referendum is the right way to get it. Personally, one would be content if the parties 
defaultthat
default formed the next Government had made it clear in their manifesto that this 
defaultis what they were in favour of. 
defaultI personally interpret that as being the
default will of the people. If that had
default not been clear in the parties
default’ 
defaultmanifestos, the case for a referendum is much stronger, but that is obviously not a constitutional thing; manifestos are not constitutional documents. So 
defaultthis
default is an area 
defaultwith 
defaulta lack of clarity, but I do think to move forward to this without the view of the people in one form is quite a dangerous thing to do.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultThat would seem to me, Glyn, to be a sensible way of doing this if one wanted to do it. What I was trying to get at very briefly, Chair, is that the justifications that are being offered for a referendum seem to me to be very weak.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe had better move on to dual candidacy
default,
default and we will try and come back afterwards if there is time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultProfessor Scully, you have very consistently argued the case against the ban on dual candidacy
default.
default I recall you both came before the Select Committee at the time
default of 
defaultthe Government of Wales Bill in 2006. You have reiterated your opposition to the ban. Can you remind the Committee why you have taken such a strong stance against the ban?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: A
defaults I articulated in the written evidence that I submitted, the arguments against dual candidacy are flawed 
defaultboth 
defaultin principle and have problematic practical implications. I know some people feel very strongly against dual candidacy and I do not challenge the sincerity of their views, but I do believe that they are based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the electoral system that was introduced for Assembly elections. In particular, the argument is made that defeated candidates at the constituency level have b
defaulteen rejected by the electorate and, t
defaultherefore, they should no
defaultt be able to enter the Assembly. B
defaultut the pr
defaultoportional variant
default of AMS that we use for Assembly elections that is used in quite a few other countries around the world now is a voting system whereby parties
default,
default through the list seats
default,
default are compensated if they have been relatively unsuccessful in the constituencies. Parties who have been, in a sense, if you want to put it like that, rej
defaultected at the constituency level
default still 
defaultget some representation in the C
defaulthamber
default,
default and it is difficult to see a strong principled reason why what applies to parties should not also apply to individual candidates. 
defaultThe other reasons why I am opposed to a ban on dual candidacy 
defaultare
default, first, it creates potentially perverse incentives, which I do not think legislation ought to
default do. For instance, if you have 
defaultseparate constituency and list
default 
defaultgroups of candidates
default, 
defaultthe list ones then effectively acquire an incentive for their party
default’
defaults c
defaultonstituency candidates to lose—an
defaultd
default,
default indeed
default,
default one or two people here know about that directly
default. That is not 
defaulta sensible sort of incentive to build into a system. Also for the voters, if you particula
defaultrly favour a list candidate now,
default you maybe would want to vote against that party at the constituency level. 
defaultBut I think there is a third reason 
defaultthat
default is specific to 
defaultWales
default. Havi
defaultng a very small Assembly of 60 M
defaultembers, various people, including my colleague here, have argued 
defaultthat 
defaultthat is insufficient. Having such a small body, we need to do everything possible to maximise the quality of the representation within that body
default,
default having, in particular, so few people to do the Committee work and all the various roles other than leadership and ministerial. We have a relatively small number of people spread pretty thinly and we need to do everything possible to make sure that those people are of the maximum quality. The 
defaultNew Zealand
default inquiry into this system
default articulated the case very well
default that d
defaultual candidacy can help parties not ensure but 
defaultmake more likely the election of the people who those parties believe are their strongest candidates. In 
defaultWales
default,
default that is something we should be doing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultWe will come on to the size of the Assembly in a minute. You touched on international work. Can you remind us of other example
defaults where such a ban exists? 
defaultI seem to remember one country that was used remorselessl
defaulty—unsuccessfully as it happened—
defaultat the time of the Government Wales Bill, but can you remind us of those international precedents?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultThere a
defaultre two variants of these mixed-member systems: mixed-m
defaultember proportional, where the list seats are allocated in a way that compensates for the co
defaultnstituency results; and a mixed-member 
defaultmajoritarian
default,
default where there are effectively two 
defaultseparate elections. Among mixed-m
defaultember proportional, 
defaultWales
default leads the world. We are the only sub
default&#x2011;
defaultstate
default nation, region or country that has introduced a b
defaultan like this. I am aware that it was considered
default seriously in two Canadian provinces but not ultimately introduced. It was considered in two Canadian provinces, 
defaultPrince Edward Island
default and 
defaultNew Brunswick
default, I believe. It was also looked at 
defaultvery 
defaultseriously in a very detailed review of this system in 
defaultNew Zealand
default but decisively rejected. The only examples 
defaultthat 
defaultI am aware of where a ban has been introduced has been in the systems where you have ostensibly
default 
defaultconstituency and list
defaults
default 
defaultrunning as
default two separate elections. I am aware certainly of four national systems that have introduced a ban
default—
defaultSouth 
defaultKorea
default, 
defaultTaiwan
default, 
defaultThailand
default and the 
defaultUkraine
default, the last two of which are not particularly examples of good democratic practice. 
defaultGlyn Davies:default 
defaultThank you for that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultMoving on, you talked about the size of the Assembly. The draft Bill does nothing to change the size of the number of Assembly Members. I think 
defaultProfessor
default Scully has indicated, and many of us would agree
default, that
default it s
defaulthould. The size of the Assembly,
default Professor 
defaultWyn
default Jones
default—
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultRichard has been involved in work on this.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: Yes. 
defaultWe published a report with the rather low
default&#x2011;
defaultbrow
default title 
default“Size Matters”,
default which looked at the size of the Assembly and I think has been the only serious attempt to look at the size of the National Assembly for Wales. There was no process. If you look back at the Labour party
default’
defaults internal processes in the 1990s 
defaultthat led to the 60
default&#x2011;
defaultMember proposal—
defaultand of course the Assembly had very different powers in the early days anyway
default—
defaultthere was no
default 
defaultsystematic look at the size of the Assembly and the implications of that. We tried 
defaultto do that and tried to marshal
default as much international evidence as 
defaultwe could.
default 
defaultO
defaultbviously
default,
default I would refer colleagues to the report for the detail, but the headline is 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are 42 Assembly Members to do all the work that is required in terms of scrutiny. That is a very smal
defaultl number in international terms and
default a low number when one considers, in comparative ter
defaultms, the relative power of the 
defaultNational Assembly
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultur best estimate of the right kind of size
default—
defaultI accept that people would have different views and it is not an exact science
default—
defaultis that around 100 Members would make sense in terms of the relative powers of the Assembly. 
defaultA
defaultlso
default,
default I would make 
defaultthe point
default that there is a context here of where do Welsh elected representatives sit? I think it is still on the statute book as a proposal that the number of Welsh MPs gets reduced
default—
defaultmaybe I should not mention that in present company
default—
defaultbut we also now have some leaks
default coming out of the 
defaultWilliams report suggesting a major cut of councillors in Wales. We have, in comparative terms, arguably too many MPs, certainly too many councillors
default—
defaultwe can probably all agree on that
default—
defaultand we look light in terms of holding what is now a powerful Welsh Government to account in the Assembly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default So t
defaulthe fact that the draft Bill leave
defaults
default in place the current linkage between the size of the National Assembly and the number of Welsh MPs is unhelpful.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIn my view, yes, absolutely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default N
defaultot least, as you say
default, if
default we were to go down the line in 
defaultWestminster
default at some future point in terms of reduction of MPs, then the fears that have been raised in the past would be realised again. Do you have anything to add to that?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultNo. On this issue, at least, I broadly agree with my colleague.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Williams:default 
defaultGood. Finally, Professor Scully, you argue in your written evidence that it would be more appropriate for the National Assembly to be responsible for decisions about its own ele
defaultctions. As a good devolutionist,
default I agree, but why?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultIn the long term, I am not convinced it is really appropriate for Parliament here to be deciding major matters on the electoral arrangements for another body with its own democratic mandate. I have also suggested
default,
default as part of that
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultone might look to build in some sort of structures to ensure that any future changes to electoral arrangements command broad cross
default&#x2011;
defaultparty
default support. As I mentioned in my written evidence, parties are
default inherently interested parties—interested actors—
defaultwhen it comes to electoral arrangements. That is unavoidably so. That being the case, I think it should be 
defaultmade difficult 
defaultfor politicians to change electoral arrangements. It should not be easy to change the electoral system in a 
defaultway which may just happen to be more favourable to your own party. 
defaultI
defaultf at some point the power over setting the rules for Assembly elections is transferred to the Assembly, that should be done perhaps
default,
default but only with a sort of supermajority requirement imposed. My suggestion is that 
defaulta 
defaultpretty high
default majority—actually a three
default&#x2011;
defaultquarters
default majority—
defaultshould be needed
default 
defaultfor any substantive changes in electoral arrangements. It should not be possible for one party, or a coalition with a very narrow majority, simply to change the rules to make things a bit more helpful to themselves. That goes for whoever is in power at whatever time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default Going b
defaultack to dual candidacy
default, 
defaultthe famous example of this is Clwyd West where
default,
default in 2003
default,
default 
defaultAlun
default Pugh gets in and 
defaultall the other three 
defaultcandidates end up on the list. Clearly, that is ludicrous. How would you defend that particular result, where all three losers end up on the list?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultI would not myself attach that particular description to those individuals.
defaultJessica Morden:default All right; t
defaulthat is a fair point
default—
defaultthe losing candidates.
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultCould I just add to that
default?
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan we have an answer first?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default If I could just ask this, 
defaultit is 
defaulton the same question.
default 
defaultE
defaultssentially
default,
default 
defaulton 
defaultthe impact assessment, a majority of the respondents would agree with 
defaultwhat 
defaultJessica Morden
default has just said. T
defaulthey find it very difficult to conceive. They have said they would like to keep the ban
default in place. How does that play? 
defaultIt is the public perception.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultFirst of all, on Ms Morden
default’
defaults question, Clwyd West was clearly an extreme example of the general phenomenon 
defaultthat
default dual candidacy allows for. It is, I suppose, a relatively exceptional instance of wha
defaultt the system is set up to allow.
default 
defaultI
defaultf parties happen to put particular individuals high on the list, parties being compensated for their relative lack of success in the constituencies, you can see those individuals being elected through the list. It is very unusual that they all happen to come from the one seat. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultIt was because it was a marginal seat, was it not?
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultA marginal
default—
default 
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultThat is basically what the system exists to do. That is how the system operates internationally and was understood at the time of the 1998 legislation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultGutodefault defaultBebbdefault:default 
defaultWould the concerns being expressed about Clwyd West have b
defaulteen mitigated if we had had an open-
defaultl
defaultist system rather than a closed-
defaultlist system? The problem with the closed
default&#x2011;
defaultlist
default system is that it is very much in the hands of the part
defaultie
defaults, whereas people would have a feeling that they had voted for somebody on an open list. 
defaultW
defaultould the open
default&#x2011;
defaultlist
default system mitigate the concern that losers, for example, are still returned?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultAs to an open
default&#x2011;
defaultlist
default system where the list votes were cast perhaps for that particular individual on a party list, that would need to be looked at. That possibly complicates the system a little bit further. But, yes, if people really want to re
defaultject particular individuals, the
defaultn an open
default&#x2011;
defaultlist
default system clearly facilitates that. 
defaultTo move on to Ms Griffith
default’
defaults question on what the people think about this and so on, I do not think we have yet really had any robust evidence on this. Sure, people write in with their views and so on. At the time of the 2006 Act
default,
default arguments were made by the then Government 
defaultthat
default certainly went well beyond the evidence on public attitudes that existed to support them. 
defaultIn terms of relevant evidence from the vast amount of survey work that we have done, we do not find that many people seem to be greatly bothered about this. The only two ways you could try and get at public opinion systematically would be, first, a fairly large amount of focus group work conducted by genuinely neutral parties putting the cases both for and against and walking people through the arguments on both sides. If you did that with a sufficiently large number of people, you might come to a clear view. The other sort of evidence one could 
defaultuse
default on public attitudes is 
defaultthat, 
defaultif the public really objected, that would presumably hurt the parties that most use dual candidacy. In 
defaultScotland
default,
default it has
default been used heavily by the SNP and i
defaultt is not self
default&#x2011;
defaultevident that that has harmed them a great deal. In 
defaultWales
default in 2003
default,
default dual candidacy was used by far the most by the Labour pa
defaultrty and the Conservative party—
defaultthe two parties who actually increased their share of 
defaultthe 
defaultvote and their representation. So
default,
default again
default,
default it is not obvious that there is a major negative public reaction there 
defaultif we look 
defaultat the behaviour of the voters.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are going to have to gently move on again, looking at the time. It is a related issue, so perhaps I could ask Professor 
defaultWyn
default Jones about this
default. W
defaulte h
defaultave dealt with dual candidacy, but we also want to ask about double-
defaultjobbing. Obviously, I have to declare an interest having been an AM and an MP for two years. My view is that there is no reason why that should not happen. You don
default’t
default get two salaries for it and I feel strongly that people should be able to go backwards and forwards. I think it was to the benefit of the
default Assembly that a number of—may I 
defaultsay
default?—mainly Labour and Plaid 
defaultCymru
default MPs 
defaultbecame Members of the Welsh Assembly to give it some experience, if you like, when we started off. But anyway, this is not my evidence session. What do you think about that?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultI am not sure I have a professional opinion on this. I have a personal prejudice, which I am happy to share with you.
defaultChair:default 
defaultTell us
default.
defaultSimon Hart:default Let’
defaults hear it
default.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIf
default I was a voter, I would want somebody concentrating full time on a particular job, but my general position is that it is up to the electorate to decide. If the candidate is being up front, then the electorate is perfectly within their right to make the call either way. I personally have a view, but
default—
default 
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultI have one very minor point on this. It does, to some degree, get back to the whole issue of the size of the Assembly. Again, if we were only g
defaultoing to carry on having 60 AMs—
defaultthe whole point 
defaultbeing 
defaultthat we really need them to be working across a pretty broad 
defaultrange, 
defaultso 
defaultwe
default need very high-quality people—
defaultwe almost certainly need them there full time, working flat out. I
default dare say people who are double-
defaultjobbing for a while would do it with the best of intentions, but presumably their work as an MP would also be fairly arduous.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhat about the fact that there is no ban on people being councillors or MEPs at the same time
default,
default or
default,
default indeed
default,
default in having outside work
default,
default just as many Members of Parliament manage to combine the role of MP and Minister
default,
default and a Minister presumably has a pretty big role, as does an MP. I absolutely do not see that it is impossible and I felt personally that I was able to 
defaultcarry out
default the role perfectly well in both places.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultThe view I was articulating is my personal preference. There are lots of things I feel but I would not want to h
defaultave laws passed to enforce them, and I think t
defaulthis would be one of them. I would not necessarily go as far as saying this should be absolutely prohibited in all circumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultNiadefault Griffith:default 
defaultCan I raise the issue of the actual legislation here
default,
default which has a six
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth limit? Do you see that as the most sensible and workable limit? I am taking 
defaultan
default example now
default of
default supposing 
defaultthat 
defaultsomebody in 2015 who is currently an AM becomes an MP, which is quite likely because there are some candidates
default. I
defaultf they then h
defaultave to give up after six months,
default they would be causing a by
default&#x2011;
defaultelection
default;
default whereas if there were a d
defaultifferent limit,
default 
defaultthey
default could be in the 2016 Assembly election. What 
defaultdo
default you think would be workable in this legislation?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultIf you are going to do this, possibly a slightly longer term to allow for precisely the sort of situation that you referred to would be sensible. To some extent, it mig
defaultht depend, in the long 
defaultterm, how long 
defaultthe gap 
defaultis going to be between general elections and Assembly elections. If it is continuing to be 12 months, maybe a short extension of this period towards 12 months, or at least up to the point at which the Assembly is devolved and you have the campaign, would presumably be sensible.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultAs I understand it, the timetables are now locked in, so it would make sense. That is a very good example of a problem you could avoid by having that as a year. That makes a lot of sense to me.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultIn the draft Bill
default,
default there is the mention of changing the term of the length of the Assembly from four to five years. Do you think that is desirable?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: I think i
defaultt is probably inevitable. I do not think it was particularly desirable. 
defaultW
defaulte are only now starting to work out some of the implications of extending the Assembly term. For example, the affordability of the Welsh Government
default’
defaults commitment around higher education for that extra year is going to be very difficult indeed. But once they moved this place to a five
default&#x2011;
defaultyear fixed term cycle, it was inevitable that that would happen in 
defaultWales
default. It is very important to avoid having devolved and 
defaultWestminster
default elections at the same time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultJessica Morden:default 
defaultWhy is that? What is wrong with having elections on the same day, which would save a lot of money, thereby reducing the cost 
defaultof politics and increasing turn
defaultout?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt is about accountability. It is about making sure that you are trying to focus on the level of Government which is responsible for whatever particular issue that you have feelings about. There is a real problem in the Welsh context
default—
defaultand it does not work very well for MPs
default—
defaultin terms of how the electorate attribute performance. I am not sure if you are aware of this, but when things are going well
default,
default the electorate think it is all down to the Welsh Government
default,
default even in non
default&#x2011;
defaultdevolved
default issues
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthen in devolved issues
default,
default when it is going badly
default,
default they blame you guys. It is quite amusing, but it is not 
defaultactually 
defaultgood for democracy. So trying to separate these is quite important.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultHyweldefault Williams:default 
defaultIs there a Scottish example that we could look at as having simultaneous elections?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: I was saying that 
defaultI do not favour simultaneous elections. I think it is important to try and separate out accountability. It is imperfect, but having it all on the same day makes it very difficult.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default 
defaultIt seems to me an interesting point. Again, I am not wholly comfortable with changing to a five
default&#x2011;
defaultyear term; I think a four
default&#x2011;
defaultyear term is more suitable, generally. You sound as if you might agree with that.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultYes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultGlyn Davies:default 
defaultBecause we are having so many elections now
default—
defaultEuropea
defaultn elections, council elections and referendums—
defaultthere are bound to be things happening on the same day. So why is it specifically different such that an Assembly and a parliamentary election 
defaultcannot be held on the same day—o
defaultr a month apart
default?
default The rules allow for them to be a month apart.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultPossibly a month apart would be the worst of all worlds in that both the voters and the campaigners would be just about getting over one election 
defaultwhen
default they would have to launch straight back into the next. Whichever set of elections came second
default,
default the campaigners would get a 
defaultvery
default rough reception from the voters, 
default“
defaultNot you lot again.
default”
default The voters need to have some time to recover from the first election. In the Welsh context, though, having a relatively weak Welsh news media, it is all the more important
default,
default if you are going to have an Assembly
default,
default that the election should be separate from the Westminster election because
default,
default otherwise in Wales
default,
default all issues related to
default the Assembly, its competencies and
default policy prog
defaultrammes of the different parties
default would get completely swamped by the agenda of the London
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default news media. It would raise some problematic questions about the legitimacy of the mandate of whoever was in power in 
defaultCardiff
default 
defaultBay
default. Just to go back to a point Richard was making
default and expand on it slightly, if I may—
defaultGlyn Davies:default S
defaulto if it is six years, you 
defaultwould 
defaulthave 
defaultgot 
defaultsix years.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultWe have gathered quite a lot of very systematic evidence on this in Wales
default,
default and it is a repeated finding year after year in surveys 
defaultabout the
default lack of clarity of attribution for policy responsibilities, 
defaultwith
default people for devolved or non
default&#x2011;
defaultdevolved
default issues being overly likely to attribute good news to people
default in Cardiff Bay and
default bad news to people in London. It is amusing if you go and tell an audience of people in 
defaultCardiff
default 
defaultBay
default that
default,
default b
defaultut it should not be like that. 
defaultIt is really quite unhealthy. If people in the devolved institutions are messing up, they should be held responsible for that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default 
defaultJust on a practical point, we have talked also about adjusting the number of AMs and MPs, so that will inevitably result in constituency boundaries 
defaultthat
default are not identical
default. T
defaultherefore
default, if you have
default concurrent elections on different boundaries, do you agree that that compounds the problem?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultThat would be just one more complication. That would also make things rather complicated for a lot of the people who do the mundane work of electoral administration, which is an unglamorous but very important job
default,
default and we do not particularly need to make their job any harder.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe are running out of time a little bit so I am going to 
defaultask 
defaultGeraint Davies to ask the next question
default quickly
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultProfessor
default&#xa0;
defaultScully mentioned that when you ask people
default,
default 
default“Do you want a say?”
default 
defaultand 
defaultit was in relation to referendums, they tend to say
default y
defaultes. Would you agree then that
default,
default if you say, 
default“
defaultWould it be better, other things being equal, to decide things locally rather than over there?
default”
default they also say yes
default?
default 
defaultA
defaultlso
default,
default you mentioned that people at the moment tend to sort of blame 
defaultWestminster
default and praise 
defaultCardiff
default. 
defaultD
defaulto you think there are inherent problems 
defaultand 
defaultthat we may end up with a situation where people have referendums where they vote for something 
defaultthat
default is not in fact in their interests because there are economies of scale, or whatever it is?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultI am not sure about that. If you ask people and they have not been thinking about it a great deal, 
default“Do you want a say?”
default they tend to say yes. If you ask them about which level of politicians 
defaultthey
default trust most, it tends to be those who are a little bit closer to t
defaulthem physically, 
defaultgeographically. When it comes, though, to real referendums, asking people about their views, slightly different dynamics start to kick into play. First of all, a lot of people who said, 
default“Yes, I want a
default say,
default”
default do not get interested at all and do not turn out and vote. Of those who do participate, there is pretty robust international evidence, with which I think British experience is consistent, that there is a reasonably strong sort of status quo bias to referendums. In other words, if people are unsure, they tend to vote for what they have now. 
defaultT
defaulto get people to vote for substantial change
default,
default you do generally have to make a reasonably compelling case.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultI am just making the point that you sort of made the point that, other things being equal, the proposition of devolution is very attractive because it is always, 
default“
defaultWe will do more here,
default”
default even if in the outcomes it is not always as attractive.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultWhat we are finding from our public survey evidence is that 
defaultit 
defaultis more about attributions, particularly of blame. If you think things are going badly
default—
defaultand most people think lots of things are going fairly badly much of the time
default—
defaultwho ultimately is going to be responsible for that, or who are you most likely to attribute blame to? People in 
defaultWales
default are disproportiona
defaulttel
defaulty likely to attribute that to Government in 
defaultLondon
default and to 
defaultWestminster
default,
default and they have lower levels of trust in MPs than they do in AMs, even though I do not think there is any very detailed evidence that people know more about their AMs or whatever.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultI think Professor 
defaultWyn
default Jones mentioned that he thought we should have 100 Members in the Assembly and that would be representing 3 million people in Wales
default,
default 
defaultbut, of course, there are
default nearer to 60 million across the United Kingdom
default. D
defaulto you think, from your point of view, it would be 
defaulta 
defaultgood ide
defaulta to have 20 Assemblies of 100 M
defaultembers with devolved powers everywhere? Obviously, I appreciate that 20% of people in 
defaultWales
default speak Welsh, but
default,
default putting that to one side, in terms of the efficacy of 
defaultg
defaultovernment, do you think there is a case for more and more of these units, localised Welsh Assembly
default&#x2011;
defaulttype
default Governments elsewhere?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultI am happy to discuss my views on how you govern the 
defaultUK
default, but the point
default—
defaultGeraint Davies:default I am thinking of t
defaulthe cost and the overheads of administration as well
default.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultI am trying to make and the report tries to make is a different one. We have now in 
defaultWales
default a powerful Welsh Government. It has a large budget and extensive powers
default,
default and the question is
default,
default is it being held effectively to account and can 42 
defaultB
defaultack
default B
defaultenchers do that? I think the evidence suggests not. 
defaultI
defaultt 
defaultis in the context of an already-
defaultexisting Government: is that being held properly to account? 
defaultI
defaultt is not a general point about, 
default“
defaultShould you have regional devolution in 
defaultEngland
default?
default”
default or whatever
default.
default I happen to think not, but that is beside the point
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultGeraint Davies:default 
defaultWhy not? Why should they not have it?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultBecause there is no demand at all in 
defaultEngland
default for regional devolution
default—
defaultat all.
defaultGeraint Davies:default So it is about demand—
defaultnot outcomes then.
default 
defaultIt is a political question.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe are probably getting slightly off argument, but it is a very good question and I 
defaultfi
defaultnd myself in some sympathy with my colleague here. If you do not think they should have regional devolution, do you not think they should have in 
defaultEngland
default an English Parliament—
defaultthe equivalent of the Welsh Assembly or Scottish Parliament?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultPersonally, yes.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is a great short answer. Can I turn to Simon Hart who has one final question?
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt is not a UKIP answer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default 
defaultIt is a sort of 
default“And finally”
default question
default,
default but I just wondered what you read into the rebrand
defaulting
default of 
default“
defaultWelsh Assembly Government
default”
default to 
default“
defaultWelsh Government
default”
default. What does that mean to you and what does it mean to voters?
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: 
defaultMy own view is that it is essentially recognising a fact on the ground. This has become customary usage. It is the term that has been adopted a little bit like
default,
default in the 2006 Act
default,
default the recognition of the effective de facto abolition of the body corporate and the establishment of 
defaulta 
defaultseparate Executive and legislature. That had become an established fact on the ground and was recognised in legislation. I think this is fairly similar really.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultJust to add to that, we were talking ea
defaultrlier about attribution and who 
defaultis responsible for what. Clearly, there was huge confusion in the early years of devolution and a lot of frustration that people were not recognising a difference between the National Assembly for 
defaultWales
default and what the Executive in the Assembly was doing
default. T
defaulthere was not that kind of awareness. 
defaultW
defaulte have seen since then a gradual attempt to make sure 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople 
defaultare 
defaultaware there is a Government 
defaultthat
default is being held to account by the Nati
defaultonal Assembly. I think that WAG—
defaultthe 
default“
defaultAssembly
default”
default there
default—
defaultwas
default probably
default slightly confusing
default. T
defaultherefore
default,
default 
default“
defaultWelsh Government
default”
default probably makes 
defaultit 
defaulta little bit clearer that there is an Executive and a legislature
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default 
defaultIs there any evidence that suggests that vote
defaultrs have cottoned on to that yet?
default I have to say
default,
default if our constituency caseload is anything to go by
default,
default there is precious little evidence that that has made any difference at all.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultThere is some evidence that, over time, there is a little bit more clarity than there was
default,
default but there was complete confusion in the early years of devolution.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Hart:default 
defaultSo it is now only partial confusion.
defaultProfessor Scullydefault: Yes. I
defaultt is improving from a 
defaultlow 
defaultbase
default;
default I think 
defaultthat 
defaultis the technical term.
defaultProfessor defaultWyndefault Jonesdefault: 
defaultIt is improving from a low base, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe will end on that positive note. Thank you both once again. It was entertaining, interesting and useful
default,
default so we are very grateful.
