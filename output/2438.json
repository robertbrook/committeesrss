"&#xa0;\nAssociation of British Insurers – Written evidence&#xa0;The ABI is the voice of insurance, representing the general insurance, protection, investment and long-term savings industry.  It was formed in 1985 to represent the whole of the industry and today has over 300 members, accounting for some 90% of premiums in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nDraft Deregulation Bill&#xa0;\nThe ABI supports the overall aim of the Draft Deregulation Bill \nto remove unnecessary\nbureaucracy that costs British businesses and hinders individuals in their daily lives. However, we would have concerns about specific areas of the Bill that would benefit from additional consideration.\n&#xa0;\nSCHEDULE 3 MOTOR INSURANCE INDUSTRY: CERTIFICATES OF INSURANCE&#xa0;The consequences of these changes would be to continue to allow insurers to issue certificates, but that the surrender of the certificate by the consumer upon cancellation of the policy would no longer to be necessary. This change would therefore abolish the offence of not returning a certificate upon cancellation of a motor insurance policy.\n&#xa0;\nThe ABI estimates that this change would save around 6 million people a year having to return their certificates. Many of those who fail to return their motor insurance certificates are currently in breach of the law but enforcement is almost non-existent. \nWe estimate that by using the Motor Insurance Database as evidence of cancellation the overall cost saving to the industry will be in the region of £45 million.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of this would be for more claims to fall on the Motor Insurance Bureau (MIB) and fewer on insurers directly, but the gross level of claims would be unaltered and, so, motor insurance costs would remain unchanged. The MIB would determine how the additional cost of claims would be allocated between its members.\n&#xa0;\nWe do not think the Bill, written in its current format, is clear on where policy restrictions can be put and we have outlined our proposed amends below.\n&#xa0;Proposed Deregulation Bill changes to the original wording:&#xa0;\n148 Avoidance of certain exceptions to policies or securities.E+W+S(1)\n \nWhere a certificate of insurance or certificate of security has been delivered under section 147 of this Act to the person by whom a policy has been effected or to whom a security has been given, so much of the policy or security \nWhere a policy or security is issued or given for the purposes of this Part of this Act \nas purports to restrict— \n(a) \nthe\n insurance of the persons insured by the policy, or \n(b) \nthe\n operation of the security, \nCommentThe “as purports to restrict” previously followed from “so much of the policy…” which has now been deleted. To make it clear that the policy can contain restrictions, we think the words ‘so much of the policy’ should remain. The wording would be:\n&#xa0;\n148 Avoidance of certain exceptions to policies or securities.E+W+S(1)\n \nWhere a policy or security is issued or given for the purposes of this Part of this Act\nWhere a certificate of insurance or certificate of security has been delivered under section 147 of this Act to the person by whom a policy has been effected or to whom a security has been given\n, so much of the policy or security as purports to restrict— \n&#xa0;\n(a) \nthe\n insurance of the persons insured by the policy, or \n(b) \nthe\n operation of the security, \n&#xa0;\nSCHEDULE 9 ENFORCEMENT OF TRANSPORT LEGISLATIONPART 1DRINK AND DRUG DRIVING OFFENCESThe ABI is supportive of the draft text contained within the Draft Deregulation Bill. Introducing legislation that will remove the statutory option is sensible step as \ncurrently,\n the Road Traffic Act 1988 provides that out of the two specimens of breath provided, it is the one with the lower proportion of alcohol in the breath that is used (the other being disregarded). Section 8(2) of the RTA provides that if the lower specimen of breath has a reading of no more than 50mcg/100 ml of breath, then that person has the right to elect to have that specimen replaced with a blood or urine specimen. The removal of the statutory option to have a blood or urine test will make it harder to pass the breath test and will send a signal that the Government is serious about clamping down on drink driving. We support the drafting of the bill in its current form.\nCLAUSES 58 to 61: EXERCISE OF REGULATORY FUNCTIONS: ECONOMIC GROWTH&#xa0;The ABI is concerned that clause 58 of the Bill (Exercise of regulatory functions: economic growth) may have consequences for workplace health and safety outcomes depending on its practical application. Specifically, there is a danger that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), in carrying out its regulatory functions, will have two potentially conflicting regulatory objectives if they have to consider the impact of their actions on growth whilst at the same time considering workplace safety.\n&#xa0;\n This would effectively remove their original regulatory purpose.\n&#xa0;\n It may also lead to the deterioration of standards over time, as well as fuelling a more general perception that health and safety is not the important consideration for organisations that it once was.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
