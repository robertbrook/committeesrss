"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. \nI am a climate researcher and Professor of Geosystem Science in the University of Oxford\n’s\n School of Geography and the Environ\nment and Department \nof Physics\n. \nI have served as a lead author on detection of climate change and attribution of causes in the Third and Fifth Assessments (2001 &amp; 2013) and as Review Editor on Global Climate Projections fo\nr t\nhe Fourth Assessment (2007). I\n \nhave recently criticized the IPCC practice of producing exhaustive Assessments on a 6-year cycle\n because I did not feel it best served the interests of the governments whom IPCC is intended to inform, and represented an excessive burden on the scientific c\nommunity. C\nontrary to some reports, I did not call for the IPCC itself to be closed down\n. \n&#xa0;\nHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there \nto question of the report’s conclusions?\n&#xa0;\n2. \nCore factual conclusions of the AR5 are broadly in line with national and independent scientific assessments of the climate issue and consistent with current evidence and understanding. \nNo scientific document is\n infallible, and the process of multiple authorship and review does not guarantee \ninfallibility. In addressing criticisms of previous reports, the focus has been on making the review process more bureaucratic and further tightening the criteria for inclusi\non and exclusion of material. \n&#xa0;\n3. \nIn my view, th\ne suggestion that a formal process can itself guarantee the \nabsolute \naccuracy of a\nny\n document and put its conclusions beyond question is a misrepresentation of the way science works. \nIt is often suggested th\nat, because they have been restricted\n to p\neer-reviewed sources and passed\n through multiple stages of review, the \nIPCC’s conclusions are beyond \nreasonable doubt\n. This is misleading, because it focuses attention on the process, rather than the evidence itsel\nf (indeed, the thrust of the committee’s questions does raise con\ncerns that the committee \nhas allowed itself to be misled in this regard).\n&#xa0;\n4. \nHaving been involved in three IPCC assessment cycles, I do not see that the measures taken since the 2007 report \nhave significantly altered the robustness of core conclusions\n, \nbecause these were already\n as robust as any scientific assessment process could make them. The committee should be aware that the importance of errors in previous assessments has been wildly ex\naggerated. \n&#xa0;\n5. \nNo one has ever argued that errors \ndeep\n in the \nImpacts section of the \n2007 Assessment had any \ninfluence\n whatever on \nthat report\n’\ns\n core scientific co\nnclusions\n. \nI can attest that \nthe \nauthors of the \nGlobal Climate Projections chapter\n of Working Group 1 were completely unaware of the suggestion that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035\n when we were formulating our conclusions\n – indeed it was a Working Group 1 author who firs\nt drew attention to this error.\n&#xa0;\n6. Likewise, \nI can also\n confirm that \nthe particular reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere temperatures over the past millennium\n (the so-called “Hockey Stick”), which subsequently came in for considerable criticism, was not in any way central to the conclusions of the 2001 Assess\nment regarding attribution of \ncauses of\n recent\n warming. We were aware of these\n proxy climate reconstructions, but did not give them much weight in the attribution ass\nessment because the statistical methods\n used were \n(and arguably still are) rather opaque. \nI remember specific discussions among the attribution chapter authors questioning the error \nbudgets\n of tho\nse reconstructions, and concluding that it would be premature to \nrely\n on them\n \ntoo \nheavily\n. With the benefit of hindsight, these discussions seem remar\nkable prescient, and confirm the importance of scientific judgment in the IPCC process.\n \n&#xa0;\n7. The problem with \nIPCC’s response \nto criticis\nms of previous assessments is that the focus has been entirely on formalizing procedures, whereas the reports ultimatel\ny depend on the collective scientific judgment of IPCC authors and reviewers. In some respects\n,\n tighter procedures may\n even\n have a distorting effect, particularly when coupled with the infrequency of IPCC reports. For example, I am aware of two papers (on \none of which I was a co-author) being accepted on the day of the deadline for inclusion in the IPCC 5\nth\n Assessment, both of which provided evidence for a downward revision of the uncertainty range for climate sensitivity. A third paper, providing evidence \nfor a higher value for climate sensitivity, was accepted two days later, and hence could not be included. The fact that the first two papers and not the third contribute to the \nofficial \nconsensus view on climate sensitivity for the next six years is clearl\ny absurd.\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?\n&#xa0;\n8. \nIn chapters \nthat \nI have been involved in I have seen a painstaking effort to reflect the full range of views among climate scientists. If anything, authors \nprobably\n take more\n care to \ndiscuss and \nreflect ‘skeptical’ \nthan ‘alarmist’ \nviews, for obvious reasons. The \nreputational cost of being seen as naïve or politically motivated is far greater than the cost of being seen as over-cautious.\n&#xa0;\nCan any of the areas of the s\ncience now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty\n?\n&#xa0;\n9. It is unhealthy to declare any area of science finally settled: I welcome the fact that there are still\n a few scientists questioning the theory of relativity, although I feel no inclination to join them. Likewise, the fact that \ngreenhouse gas emissions are\n having \na substantial\n impact on climate at a global scale is sufficiently well attested that further research into \nalternative hypotheses is unlikely to be particularly fruitful, although it should \nof course be \nencouraged\n to\n continue. \n&#xa0;\n10. The most obvious and important area \nin which further effort is required to reduce uncertainty is the implications of these global changes for regional climate and extreme weather events. It is shameful, in my view, that we are still unable as a community to quantify the role of human influen\nce on high-impact \nevents like Typhoon Haiyan. The IPCC process may inadvertently have contributed to this situation through its focus (mandated by the commissioning governments) on long-term projections of global climate change, which are necessarily relia\nnt on coarse-resolution models.\n&#xa0;\nHow effective is AR5 and the summary\n for policymakers in conveying \nwhat is meant by \nuncertainty in scientific terms\n? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?\n&#xa0;\n11. This is a question for a user of IPCC \nreports rather than an author.\n&#xa0;\nDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?\n&#xa0;\n12. \nThis question is so broad that almost any answer is possible. Yes, the IPCC does consider the reliability of climate models and finds they are much more reliable f\nor some variables (like global temperature) than others (like local precipitation). \nIf the question is posed as “are the models reliable in all respects”, the answer is trivially “no”. \nThe global coupled climate models that form the backbone of these asses\nsments are found to be consistently unreliable in their representation of extreme weather, which is the main reason we are unable to say more\n at present\n about human influence on weather extremes. \n&#xa0;\nHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the wide\nly reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?\n&#xa0;\n13. The AR5 has demonstrated there are a number of possible reasons for the hiatus and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to attribute it to any specific cause. Temperature trends ove\nr a 15-year period have limited relevance to constraining long-term climate projections\n, and average temperatures over the past decade have been precisely in line with projections made back in the 1990s\n. That said, the fact that the very rapid warming betw\neen the mid-1990s and the \nfirst half of the\n 2000s \nhas not continued does provide some evidence that the highest responses in the current generation of climate models are unrealistic, and this is reflected in the AR5 projections of near-term warming\n. It als\no\n contributed \nto \n(although it was not the main factor\n in) \nthe decision to reduce the lower bound of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity to 1.5 degrees\n.\n&#xa0;\nDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to\n prevent dangerous climate change?\n&#xa0;\n14. \nThe key conclusion that strengthens the case for some actions to prevent dangerous climate change is the fact that cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide emissions over the entire industrial epoch are the main determ\ninant of eventual warming, not emissions in any given year or commitment period. This highlights the importance of policies to address the long-term stock of fossil carbon, as opposed to measures to control the flow of greenhouse gas emissions that are the\n focus of \nalmost all climate policies at present.\n \n&#xa0;\n15. As an aside, it seems \nstrange\n to ask about the economic implications of a report that is explicitly \nand exclusively \nfocused on Physical Science. \nThis question might be more appropriate when the Assess\nments of Working Groups 2 and 3 are available.\n&#xa0;\nWhat implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally?\n&#xa0;\n16. \nBoth UK and international climate policy are exclusively f\nocused on reducing \nthe flow of \nemissions in the relatively short term, out to 2030 or so. This is resulting in a dangerous underinvestment in technologies like carbon capture and sequestration \n(CCS) \nthat are relatively expensive as short-term emission redu\nction measures. These technologies will\n, however,\n almost certainly be required eventually if we are to limit warming to two or even three degrees, given the overwhelming economic incentives to burn more fossil fuels than can be released into the atmosphere\n consistent with these temperature goals.\n&#xa0;\nIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for a\nssessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focus\ned on providing a justification for political commitment?\n&#xa0;\n17. The response of \nparticipants in \nthe UNFCCC process \nto \nthe cumulative carbon budget conclusion is very instructive. Negotiators have been openly critical of the IPCC for what they see as an “unhelpful framing” of the problem. This illustrates that the IPCC is doing its job of highlighting important policy-rele\nvant science, not simply providing justification for any particular political decision.\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis summary?\n&#xa0;\n18. I was not involved in the Stockholm plenary, \nbut the revisions agreed following the final government review stage did not impact the core conclusions of the report.\n&#xa0;\nIs the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Scien\nce Basis report?\n&#xa0;\n19. The problem is not so much the rate as the manner of these reductions. \nThe AR5 report highlights the critical importance of option value. \nT\nhere has been no substantial reduction in the overall \nuncer\ntainty in the climate response: \nthe \nincrease in the range of uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity was appr\noximately compensated for by a\n modest reduction in uncertaint\ny in \nthe \ntransient response. At the same time, the cumulative carbon budget demonstrates that, regardless of whethe\nr the response is at the high or low end of the current uncertainty range, emissions will eventually have to be reduced to zero if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. \n&#xa0;\n20. \nHence policies should focus on the development of technologies that would al\nlow rapid and substantial reductions in global emissions in the future, should they prove necessary\n. If this is\n at the expense of investment in short-term \nemission reduction measures\n,\n which might ultimately prove \nunnecessary\n if the response is at the low e\nnd of the current range\n, then so be it\n. \n&#xa0;\n21. To put it bluntly, we \nalready \nknow the costs and externalities of wind power. \nRapid deployment of wind power in the UK and Germany\n \ntoday will therefore \nmake \nrelatively little difference \nto the opt\nions we have a\nvailable for dealing with climate change on a global scale in the 2030s. \nWe have much less idea about the relative merits of different CO2 geological storage options, which will take decades to evaluate. If temperatures reach 1.5 degrees and global emissio\nns are proving impossible to reduce through substitution measures, we are likely to need the option of deploying CCS on a very large-scale. The way things are going, we won’t have it, because we are \npouring subsidies into\n windmills instead. \n&#xa0;\nWhat relevanc\ne do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?\n&#xa0;\n22\n. \nReiterating the points made above, i\nt is imperative that the Carbon Budget review should take into account the need to limit the overall stock of global carbon emis\nsions in setting \ntechnology \npriorities.\n An exclusive focus on \nreducing \nthe flow of \nemissions \nin the short \nto medium \nterm has become counterproductive.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
