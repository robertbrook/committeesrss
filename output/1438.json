"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Rural Community Council of Essex (TIC 028)RCCE\n (Rural Community Council of Essex) is an \nindependent charity\n helping people and communities throughout rural Essex create a sustainable future. We have been working with local community groups, Parish Councils, Village Halls and Community Buildings across Essex \nto address some of the issues they face, \nsince being e\nstablished in 1929.\n \nRCCE is an influential voice for rural communities at local and national level. We enjoy strong working relationships with Essex County Council, local District and Borough Councils, and\n DEFRA. \n As one of England's 38 county Rural Commu\nnity Councils, we are a member of ACRE (Action with Communities in Rural England). Together we aim to meet the needs of 11,000 rural communities nationwide.\n \n1.1 \nEssex County Council (ECC) uses Accession mapping software, which uses the latest census data to map access by public transport to key services for both rural and urban areas. ECC holds \nmeetings with commercial operators, key stakeholders and the voluntary sector to identify demand and improve services. Area reviews have been carried out to give a more detailed assessment of needs.  The needs identified for each rural area vary and the re\nsulting outcomes reflect this.  For example, weekly Braintree shopper bus services improved access to local market towns.  In the Dengie Peninsula\n*\n a Demand Responsive \nTransport \nScheme\n**\n (DRT), i\nnitia\nlly DaRT 99, followed by DaRT 5,\n \nwas introduced.\n \n[\n*\nThe \nDengie Peninsula is a particularly remote and isolated area of rural Essex, \nbounded\n by \nthe sea to the east and the Blackwater and Crouch rivers to the north and south.  The low population density and isolated nature of the area make provision of convention\nal bus services difficult, having lost most of its commercial operations since 1985 and the county council increasingly having had to contract services. \n**\nA DRT scheme is a taxi-bus service which operates a core \nroute but can be booked in advance to pick \nup from a passenger’s house from outlying areas. Services can be timetabled or fully flexible within an operating period.\n]\n1.2 \nECC have contracted RCCE in the past to conduct \nindependent\n area reviews which included extensive bus passenger surveys. RCCE collated, analysed the results and presented them to ECC, however these contracts have stopped since the council cutbacks.\n2.1 \nEssex County Council say w\nhen looking at requests for additional services and making decisions over \nreplacing withdrawn c\nommercial services, each case is\n considered on its merit and the particular situation of specific service users/groups are considered in reaching decisions on service provision along with costs. \n \nIn a more general way ECC uses ‘Accessi\non’ accessibility mapping software to identify the ability of people in different groups (employed, elderly registered disabled \netc.) to access key services ( shopping, e\nmployment health and education). They\n use this formation to help shape service decisio\nns.\n Again, the independent area surveys conducted by RCCE under contract fed into this process until 2011.\n3.1 \nWith regards to\n buses, by their nature isolated rural areas have small populations whose travel needs are not easily aggregated into a financially sustainable commercial bus network. Contracted bus services can easily become unsusta\ni\nnable \ndue to demographic shifts or rising costs. \n In addition, i\nt is \nmore difficult to manoeuvre\n large buses\n around narrow lanes where potential additional passengers may be (who are unable to get to the main route)\n. \nEven DRT is made less sustainable due \nto the high levels\n of dead mileage and escalating\n fares impacting on demand. Therefore public transport in these areas will always require public funding support in on\ne sense or another. Within this\n, kick-starting DRT services ( and thus removing some or a\nll of the entry cost barrier to service provision)  is possibly a better approach than long term service purchasing, if sufficient attention is paid to the marketing and organisational structure of the services. Either CT or taxi services can in theory mak\ne use of this approach, but in either case an excellent understanding of the potential market and its needs is necessary.\n Flexibility is a key factor, and the ability to call in additional vehicles (as the Essex DRT scheme is run by a taxi company) has pro\nved invaluable.\n3.2 \nFor rail it is arguable that many of the same arguments apply. There are not enough passengers to make improved rail services economically viable and if they are considered socially necessary, then public funding will be required to keep them going. As the\nre is no real equivalent to the DRT \napproach, \nlong term financial subsidy (\neither directly by service or cros\ns subsidy through franchising) \nis unavoidable. In its absence,\n Bee\nching style cuts are unavoidable. \n3.3 \nConnectivity \nis an important factor, \ne\nnsuring services are useful in their timings \nand\n connecting to other bus/rail services\n will attract more users, making services more viable\n. \nThe DRT 5 provides a rail header service, connects with a main route bus service and the other DRT service DaRT \n99\n.\n \n3.4 \nReliability \nis a key area of concern. S\nome operators \nrun\n an unreliable service, either not investing in their vehicles so\n that buses\n regularly breakdown, or not enough staff to cover for absences, \nleaving passengers stranded, and \nleading to potential\n bus passengers using other means of transport (\nsuch as a \ncar\n if they have access to one\n, \nwhich can be \nmore costly \nwhen taking\n petrol\n and parking into consideration\n), lifts, taxis\n, walking\n or not making journeys\n at all\n. Other knock on effects are missed ap\npointments eg. medical, costing the NHS. There is little recourse for complaint with commercial\nly run\n services. Individual complaints to bus companies hold little sway, the county council has no jurisdiction over \na commercial\n service, \nand \npeople are often \nunaware of where else to go to complain. \n3.5 \nL\now-level \npassenger \nflows\n in \nsparsely\n populated areas p\nrevent large bus operation from being commercially viable\n. S\nubsidy is needed to get services \nlike DRT \noff the ground until they are capable of being self-f\nunding\n.\n&#xa0;\n Another \nkey\n issue is competition, while good in the sense of driving forward savings, no sensible operator will risk starting a rural route, where once he/she has developed the trade, \nany competitor\n can just start up alongside, thus diluting the r\noute back to a non-profitable operation\n. \n Rural PTEs \ncan help \nin this regard, where some control of route licensing is practised.\n&#xa0;\n \nThis will reduce the need for subsidy in many cases, as operators would then be able to risk running new services to \nr\nural co\nmmunities, knowing they could one day reap the rewards of the initial investment made.\n&#xa0;\n 3.6 Examples of how these challenges can be overcome.3.6.1 \nIn Essex on the Dengie peninsula a group called \nD\nengie \nH\nundred \nB\nus \nU\nser \nG\nroup\n (DHBUG)\n, is an excellent \nexample of good practice\n of members of the community coming together to influence service provision.\n \nThey\n formed in 2010 as a result of the withdrawal of \na\n bus service from most of the village of Althorne but at \ntheir\n inaugural meeting, it became clear tha\nt there were plenty of other issues in the Dengie, including the punctuality and reliability of the \nbus service\n and inadequate services to many of the villages\n.\n \nTheir achievements include having\n set up a partnership with First \nGroup \nto monitor and\n \nimprove \nthe performance of the \nbus service\n and \nthey\n meet with them regularly\n, \nthey \ninfluenced the \nintroduc\ntion of\n a new service which filled a long-standing gap in the timetable\n; have the facility for the public to\n file reports on \ntheir website; \ntook part in the c\nonsultation process for the \nEssex County Council local service\n contract\n; \nworked with the Community Rail Partnership to improve access to rail stations\n; influenced the provision of the DRT scheme to additional areas; \nliaised with \nthe \nC\nounty \nC\nouncil\n and the \nbus operators at times of road\n \nclosures and displayed posters relating to alternative arrangements, e.g. during Carnival, to provide information to encourage people to continue to use the bus\n. They hold public meetings twice a year which are very well a\nttended, and invite some influential people to speak and take questions, including \nGiles Fearnley, M\nanaging Director\n of First's UK Bus Division\n and Stephen Morris, Deputy Chief Executive of Bus Users UK.\n3.6.2 \nThe DRT scheme in Essex has overcome some of t\nhe challenges discussed above. Initially the service (DaRT 99) was established in May 2011 to improve access to two h\nospitals from the Dengie area. \nThe service offers a fixed link\n \nbetween Maldon, neighbouring Heybridge and Chelmsford\n \nhospital, with a \ndemand responsive service to outlying\n \nvillages in the Dengie Peninsula. It runs between 0600 and\n \n2100 Monday to Friday. Fares are set above the comparable\n \nbus journey, reflecting the additional convenience and\n \ncomfort of the service and to avoid underminin\ng the\n \ncommercial indirect links (involving one or more changes).\n \nConcessionary bus passes are accepted.\n \nThe service received one-off £65,000 ‘kick start’ funding from\n the \nLAA Partnership\n via RCCE\n, following a competitive tender exercise\n \ncarried out by RCCE\n. It has seen increasing passenger use and viability over the\n \nperiod\n and f\nrom May 2013, the service \nwent\n fully commercial.\n \n \n3.6.3 \nThe success of the \nD\n99 \nand the expiry of service contracts \nled to the development of another DRT service in the area, \nthe D5,\n which serves the most isolated parishes in the Dengie. \nIt replaced a\n \nconventional bus service which gave 4 off-peak return\n \njourneys on Monday - Friday and two return journeys on a\n \nSaturday to the local town. DaRT 5 is a fully flexible service,\n \navailable f\nrom 0600 to 2000 Monday - Saturday. All journeys\n \nmust be pre-booked at least one hour before travelling and\n \npassengers must be prepared to change, as the service feeds\n \ninto other bus and rail services.\n \nThe service was introduced following extensive consult\nation,\n \nwhich highlighted a desire for greater choice of times and\n \ndestinations.\n \nThe service was expanded in October 2012 to meet demand\n \nfrom a neighbouring community.\n \n3.6.4 \nPassenger numbers have grown significantly. The \nprevious D5 service\n \ncarried an ave\nrage of 5 passengers per weekday and 1.5 on a\n \nSaturday.\n  In July the average number of passengers per day \nwas 59, and the\n cost per passenger is now down to \naround \n£3.13p\n. \n91% of passengers are concessionary travel pass holders. Users are deciding to make m\nore use of the service and are\n \nintroducing new customers. For example, a single journey\n \nfrom a Residential Park to the Conservative Club started off\n \nas one person travelling once per week; now there are 4 or 5\n \ntravelling daily. A few of the new users \npreviously used taxis.\n Some\n commuters use the service from the villages to the\n \nlocal station.\n \nFeedback has been very positive, with specific praise for the\n \nregular driver.\n \n3.6.5 \nThe service allows individuals who were previously isolated\n \nto go out and be \npart of the community. There are a number\n \nof older people who were unable to walk up the hill to the\n \nnearest bus stop and were therefore unable to access public\n \ntransport. The wide net of the DRT service has removed\n \nthis problem and they are now regular tr\navellers, using the\n \nservice to access shops, medical\n \nfacilities, clubs and social\n \nevents.\n \nOne lady is currently in the situation where she is unable\n \nto drive or walk any distance. The door to door nature of\n \nthe service has been invaluable to her. Anothe\nr elderly lady\n \nsaid that previously her family and friends had to do all her\n \nshopping for her; now she can do her own shopping. She said\n \ni\nt has “opened up my life again” and has enabled her to choose her own food, improving her diet and consequently her he\nalth.\n3.6.6 \nConventional buses are often seen as a meeting place by\n \nolder users. One concern of introducing DRT was that there\n \nwouldn’t be the same opportunity to socialise. A pattern of\n \ngroup booking is emerging from elderly people and people are\n \nusing it\n to go out socially.\n3.6.7 \nA recent Age UK report highlights the importance of bus\n \ntravel to not only accessing services but to contributing to\n \nthe quality of life for older people\n (\nhttp://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/16946/\n)\n. The service may extend\n \nthe time individu\nals can live independently, reducing health\n \nand social care costs. This saving is difficult to monetise,\n \nbut the cost of delaying progression to more costly care has\n \nbeen valued at £181 per week (£9,412 per year). The cost\n \nof an individual moving to a care\n home is valued at £27,000\n \nper year. Therefore, If only three people are prevented from\n \nmoving into a care home, then this service will reduce the\n \noverall cost to the public purse.\n3.7 The DArT works in the Dengie Peninsula because:3.8 \nThe DaRT has been nominated and shortlis\nted for two N\national \nTransport A\nwards.\n4.1 \nCurrently Essex County Council supports 12 community transport schemes across Essex; most are run as independent charitable organisations, although one is run by a district council and one is currently run in house by Essex County Council.  \n4.2 Community \nTransport schemes provide transport for individuals who cannot access conventional services, whether due to restricted mobility or living in isolated areas not serviced by public transport. The quality of service provided is high, being personalised, flexi\nble and reliable. As a result, CT has a very high user satisfaction rating. The annual cost to the council is £1.3 million. \n4.3 \nEssex County Council\n current strategy sees Community Transport as providing a safety net for those unable to access local bus s\nervices and thus filling in areas where conventional local bus service provision is not practicable. \n4.4 Most CT schemes provide a range of services. These include:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDial-a-ride services – demand responsive individual journeys usually carried out by access\nible minibuses and often by professional drivers.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSocial Car services – volunteers using their own cars to provide journeys, only receiving expenses in return.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVehicle Brokerage – working with a range of different organisations to make their vehicles avail\nable for group hire during ‘down’ periods\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Buses\n - \nRegistered local bus services, using larger vehicles and in the main paid drivers run under a S\nection \n22 permit, often with a semi DRT element.\n4.5 \nT\nhe model employed is heavily dependent on the \nuse of volunteers, both to driver and to perform ‘back office’ functions. As schemes grow, an increasing degree of \nprofessionali\ns\nation\n is required to manage the additional complexities of operation and ensure reliability. However, there are limits to how f\nar such a business model can grow due to their reliance on voluntary support.  All the schemes struggle to recruit new volunteers; often due to exacting behavioural standards required to allow a person to transport vulnerable people.  \n4.6 Currently Commun\nity Transport schemes receive a grant made under Service Level Agreement with ECC and in some cases with district councils\n, which \nset targets for passenger numbers, performance and value for money. \n4.7 \nThe number of passengers travelling using Community T\nransport in some districts/boroughs has declined; this is thought to be in part due to the impact of the provision of free transport on local \nbus services. Older passengers, who make up the majority of community transport users, can travel on local buses f\nor free.  Though the cost of using community transport is subsidised, charges are \nm\nade and passengers would like to be able to use their concessionary pass and travel for free.  Section 22 licences and registered bus services have allowed some of the sc\nhemes to introduce travel which is free to the users, being reimbursed by the concessionary fare scheme.\n4.8 \nCoverage by CT schemes is patchy – not all areas in need have a service. As schemes are independent there is no consistency in how they run and ope\nrate, although some flexibility is useful to account for local needs, a more consistent approach would \nhelp users to better understand and access the services on offer. The fact that some schemes have Section 22 licences and allow passengers to use bus\n pas\nses while others don’t make \nit confusing.  Consistent regulation would be \nextremely \nbeneficial\n.\n5.1 \nGiven the low number of individuals living in isolated communities providing services commercially is not an option and therefore will always be reliant on the local authority providing financial support for services.  This is not a \nstatutory\n requirement a\nnd given the current economic pressures is becoming more challenging.\n5.2 \nTaxis are cost prohibitive for many people in isolated areas, plus there may be limited supply in some areas. Nor can concessionary passes be used in taxis. DRT can work very effecti\nvely in some areas\n where it is appropriate.\n&#xa0;\n \nI’ve covered \nthis question\n \nin previous answers\n.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
