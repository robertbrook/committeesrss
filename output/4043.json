"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Department for Communities and Local Government (BRC 44)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Response to the Committee’s questions&#xa0;\ni) the extent to which\n members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nii) the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements \nof the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\niii) the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work revi\newed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\niv) the adequacy of the review of electrical wor\nks carried out by Competent Persons;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nv) the effect of competition between accr\neditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nvi) the adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes\n;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex A&#xa0;Section 3: Certification, inspection and testing &#xa0;General3.1\n              \nFor n\notifiable electrical \ninstallation \nwork\n,\n one of the following \nthree\n procedures\n must be used\n to \ncertify\n that the work complies with the requirements set \nout in the Building Regulations.\na.\n              \nS\nelf-certification by a \nregistered competent person\n.\nb.\n              \nT\nhird-party certification by a \nregistered \nthird-party certifier\n.\nc.\n              \nC\nertification by a\n \nbuilding control body\n.\n3.2\n              \nTo verify that the design and installation\n of\n \nelectrical work \nis adequate\n,\n and \nthat installations will be \nsafe to use, maintain and alter, the electrical work \nshould be inspected and tested in accordance with\n the procedures in \nBS 7671.\n \n              NOTE: Electrical inspection\n and test forms should be given to the person ordering the work. Build\ning Regulations certificates should normally be given to the occupier, but i\nn the case of rented properties\n may be given to \nthe person ordering the work and copied to the occupier.\n&#xa0;Self-certification by a registered competent person3.\n3\n              \nElectrical installe\nrs \nwho are \nregistered competent person\ns\n \nshould complete \na \nBS 7671 \nelectrical installation\n certificate \nfor\n every job they undertake. \nThe electrical installer should give \nthe certificate to the \nperson ordering the work\n.\n3.\n4\n              \nThe installer or the installer’s \nregistration body must\n \nwithin 30 days of the work being completed\n do both of the following.\n \na.\n              \nGive\n a \ncopy of the \nBuilding Regulations compliance certificate\n \nto\n the occupier\n.\nb.\n              \nGive the certificate, or \na copy of the information on the certificate\n,\n \nto t\nhe\n \nbuilding control body\n.\n&#xa0;Certification by a registered third party 3.\n5\n              \nBefore work begins, an installer who is not a \nregistered competent person\n may \nappoint \na \nregistered \nthird-party certifier\n to inspect and test the work as necessary\n.\n \n3.\n6\n              \nWithin 5 days of completing the work, the installer must notify the \nregistered third-party certifier\n who, subject to the results of the inspection and testing being satisfactory,\n \nshould \nthen \ncomplete a\nn electrical installation\n \ncondition report\n and give \nit\n \nto the \nperson ordering the work\n.\nNOTE: The\n e\nlectrical\n installation condition report should be the model \nBS&#xa0;7671 form or one developed specifically for Part P purposes. \n3.7\n              \nThe registration body of the \nthird-party certifier\n must\n within 30 days of a satisfa\nctory condition report being issued do both of the following.\n \na.\n              \nGive a copy of\n \nthe\n \nBuilding Regulations compliance certificate\n to the occupier\n.\nb.\n              \nGive the certificate, or \na copy of the information on the certificate\n,\n \nto t\nhe \nbuilding control body\n.\nCertification by a building control body3.\n8\n              \nIf an installer is not a \nregistered competent person\n \nand has not appointed a \nregistered third-party certifier\n,\n \nthen b\nefore work\n begins the installer must \nnotify a \nbuilding control body\n. \n3.9\n              \nThe \nbuilding control\n body\n will determin\ne\n the extent of inspection and testing needed\n for it\n to establish that the work is safe\n,\n based on the nature of the electrical work and the competence of the inst\naller. T\nhe \nbuilding control body\n \nmay \nchoose to \ncarry out any necessary \ninspection and testing\n itself, or \nit may \ncontract a specialist\n to carry \nout some or all of the work \nand furnish it with an electrical installation condition report\n. \n3.10\n              \nAn installer who is \ncompetent to carry out inspection and testing \nshould\n give \nthe app\nropriate\n \nBS 7671 certificate\n \nto the \nbuilding control body\n, who will then take the certificate \nand the installer’s qualifications into account in deciding what further action\n, \nif any\n, \nit needs to take. \nBuilding control bodies\n \nmay \nask installers for evidence\n \nof their\n qualifi\ncations\n.\n3.11\n              \nThis \ncan\n result in a lower building control charge as, when setting its charge, a local authority is required by\n the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 2010 \nto take account of the amount of inspection work that it\n considers it will need to carry out.\n3.12\n              \nOnce the \nbuilding control body\n has decided that, as far as can be ascertained, the work meets all \nB\nuilding \nR\negulations requirements, it will issue to the occupier a \nB\nuilding \nR\negulations completion certificate (if \na local authority) or a final certificate (if an approved inspector).\n \n&#xa0;Inspection and testing of non-notifiable work3.1\n3\n              \nN\non-notifiable \nelectrical installation\n work\n, like notifiable work,\n should be \ndesigned and installed,\n \nand inspected, tested and certifi\ncated \nin accordance with \nBS 7671.\n3.14\n              \nIf local authorities find that non-notifiable work is unsafe and non-compliant, they can take enforcement action.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8385/2077837.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-electrical-safety\n \nPlease see page 9 in the linked document at\n \n \nwww.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_AD_P_2013.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-regulations-third-party-certification-schemes-for-electrical-installations-in-dwellings\n \nht\ntps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competent-person-schemes-conditions-of-authorisation\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-work-replacements-and-repairs-to-your-home\n \nhttp://electrical.theiet.org/building-regulations/eas/index.cfm\n \nhttp://www.competentperson.co.uk/\n \n \n"
