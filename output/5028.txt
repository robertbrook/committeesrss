&#xa0;Written evidence from the Surrey Police and Crime Panel [PCC Progress 19]Declarations of Interest: There are no specific declarations of interest. The opinions below are those of the Surrey Police and Crime Panel and have been agreed by the Panel as a whole. The Membership of the Panel, including Political affiliation, is detailed on page 4 of this document. &#xa0;

[[[1. The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area: ]]]&#xa0;1.1 When agreeing the local Police and Crime Plan, Surrey’s Commissioner stated that he did not believe in micromanagement or setting a raft of targets which could skew police activity towards chasing numbers rather than doing the right thing for the public. As a result, the final published document contains no specific numerical targets against which the Surrey Police and Crime Panel (PCP) can easily measure performance. &#xa0;1.2 At present the PCP makes use of Police performance data and quarterly (mostly qualitative) progress updates from the Commissioner to assess whether the Force is “moving in the right direction”, but it is nevertheless difficult to say with any degree of certainty whether the Commissioner has been effective in reducing crime and delivering a more effective Police service in Surrey. &#xa0;1.3 However, the PCP acknowledges that the post of Commissioner is still relatively new, and that it is perhaps still too early to pass judgement on its effectiveness. &#xa0;

[[[2. The role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account: ]]]&#xa0;2.1 The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act (2011) is clear that PCPs must carry out specific functions such as scrutinising a Commissioner’s proposed precept, scrutinising senior appointments and considering non-criminal complaints. However, the Surrey PCP quickly acknowledged that it would not be able to provide an adequate level of oversight by simply fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, and Members are committed to providing both robust challenge and support in all areas of the Commissioner’s work. &#xa0;2.2 However, for the PCP to effectively hold a Commissioner to account, Members need access to timely and detailed information. Whilst the Commissioner and his Office are usually responsive to requests for information, the Panel remains concerned that there is little incentive for Commissioner’s to volunteer information that is likely to be met with resistance. In essence, it is extremely easy for Commissioner’s to side-step the PCP. For example: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.3 An added complication is caused by the split between operational and strategic matters. In the case of the Neighbourhood Policing review detailed above, it was not clear whether the decision to implement the recommendations rested with the Chief Constable or the Commissioner, and this ambiguity hampered the Panel’s attempts to get involved. &#xa0;2.4 The PCP has also fed into research conducted by the Centre for Public Scrutiny (CfPS) which it understands has been submitted to the Home Affairs Select Committee to inform its investigations. &#xa0;

[[[3. The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011: ]]]&#xa0;3.1 The Panel supported the Commissioner’s proposals to transfer the majority of staff to the employment of the Chief Constable, with the Commissioner retaining the small team which supports his office. &#xa0;

[[[4. The role of commissioners in budget and precept setting: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1 The Panel remains concerned that the precept setting timescales, as set out in the Police and Crime Panels (Precepts and Chief Constable Appointments) Regulations 2012, do not provide Members with enough time to scrutinise proposals. Despite being one of only two functions where the PCP holds the power of veto, Members have just 5 working days to consider the proposals, during which the PCP must meet and draft a formal response. &#xa0;4.2 The late availability of the precept proposals also means that the Panel is unable to comply with the requirements of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985, with papers not available 5 clear working days before the meeting. Given that the PCP is responsible for ensuring that residents have access to the information they need to hold their Commissioner to account, this is unacceptable and needs to be reviewed. &#xa0;4.3 The short timescales have, in Surrey’s case, been exacerbated by the Commissioner’s reluctance to share provisional ideas with the PCP prior to the notification deadline, meaning that Members have little time to digest the information before having to make a decision. &#xa0;

[[[5. The effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities: ]]]&#xa0;5.1 The Panel has previously commended the Commissioner on his attempts to engage with local communities, through Local Policing Boards, Crime Summits and other consultation events. &#xa0;5.2 One area where the PCP has queried the Commissioner’s effectiveness is in his ability to communicate his policing priorities to serving police officers, particularly his concept of zero tolerance policing. &#xa0;

[[[6. Progress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policing organisations and partners:]]]&#xa0;6.1 The Commissioner has been very vocal about his wish to establish collaborative agreements with other forces / partners and, generally speaking, the Panel supports this ambition. It also acknowledges that the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act (2011) is highly supportive of this approach. 6.2 However, whilst the Panel supports collaboration, there is concern that the Commissioner is ultimately pushing for full amalgamation and that the current collaborative work with Sussex is simply setting the groundwork for a future merger. &#xa0;6.3 The Panel is of the view that should this be pursued, the public should be formally consulted or, better yet, invited to participate in a referendum. &#xa0;
