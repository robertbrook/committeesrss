"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nBikebiz\n Magazine (CYS 065)\n&#xa0;\nCYCLE SAFETY: HoC Library Briefing Document on Vehicle Excise Duty\n&#xa0;\nCould members of the transport select committee please read \n˜Roads: vehicle excise duty (VED) - Commons Library Standard Note”\n. This gives the history of vehicle excise duty and confirms that “road tax”\n does not exist and has not existed since 1937.\n&#xa0;\nSome motorists use the belief in this long-dead tax to bully and intimidate cyclists, both verbally and physically and use of the phrase by MPs shows ignorance of Britain’s\n tax \nsystem and how roads are funded.\n&#xa0;\nIf MPs wish to call VED by an easily understood term, use car tax, as VED is a tax on cars and other vehicles, not a tax on roads or a fee to use them.\n&#xa0;\nMotorists do not pay directly for the roads. Roads are paid for via g\neneral and local taxation. In 1926, Winston Churchill started the process to abolish road tax. It was finally culled in 1937.\n&#xa0;\nCar tax is based on amount of CO2 emitted so, if a fee had to be paid, cyclists - who are sometimes branded as 'tax dodgers' by s\nome motorists - would pay the same as 'tax-dodgers' such as disabled drivers, police cars, the Royal family, and band A motorists, \nie\n Â£0.\n&#xa0;\nMost cyclists are also car-owners, too, so pay VED.\n&#xa0;\nHoC Library Document: http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/\nSN01482\n&#xa0;\nIronically named campaign website: http://ipayroadtax.com\n&#xa0;\nBBC article on use of “road tax”\n as a bullying tactic against cyclists: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23694438\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
