[normal]&#xa0;[bold]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These issues affect men and women but in general the consequences for women’s careers and career choices tend to be more pronounced.
