IntroductionPHE was established on 1 April 2013 to bring together public health specialists from more than 70 organisations into a single public health service. Within the organisation several departments, which were formerly part of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), contribute expertise to increase understanding of the epidemiology of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease

[[[ ]]](CJD) and abnormal prion disease and to prevent person-to-person spread. These include: &#xa0;&#xa0;In addition, the HPA provided medical and scientific secretariat support for the CJD Incidents Panel between 2003 and its dissolution in 2013. PHE continues to support the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) TSE subgroup, which provides expert advice on the risk assessment and risk management of potential person-to-person spread of CJD through healthcare. PHE also has expert representation on the UK Blood services prion working group and The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), which has developed and published guidance relating to the prevention of CJD transmission, among other infections. &#xa0;This submission focuses on aspects of risks of person-to-person spread of vCJD and abnormal prions, and provides written evidence in respect of questions 2 and 3 of the Parliamentary Science and Technology Select Committee:&#xa0;3. Question 2 

[[[Is the Government and its scientific advisory structure sufficiently responsive to the threat posed by emerging diseases being transmitted through blood and blood products, tissues and organs?]]]&#xa0;The expert groups, for which PHE provides or has provided scientific secretariat support and/or expert contribution, bring together national expertise and experience to help interpret limited evidence and scientific uncertainty regarding vCJD. They commission, consider and interpret risk assessments of the potential for vCJD transmission through blood components and other aspects of healthcare. New evidence is regularly reviewed in order to formulate strategies and recommendations for risk management and risk reduction.&#xa0;The number, format and specific functions of these expert groups have changed over the years. The ACDP TSE group, and its predecessors (the ACDP TSE Risk Management group and the TSE Working Group) own and oversee the national guidance on TSE infection prevention and control, and these documents are maintained and updated regularly to reflect new evidence and policies (such as decontamination policies) as they arise. &#xa0;&#xa0;4. Question 3

[[[Has the threat of ongoing transmission of vCJD through the blood and blood product supply been adequately mitigated?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Measures currently being taken to limit known risksA number of safety measures are in place to prevent person-to-person spread of vCJD, both through blood and blood products and through surgical procedures. These measures concern transmission risks both from patients who have been diagnosed with clinical vCJD, and those who are healthy but who have been exposed to an increased risk of vCJD through their healthcare. &#xa0;This second group of patients may never develop the disease but because there is no in-life test to detect asymptomatic infection, there is a potential for transmission of infection to occur before symptoms become apparent during a possibly prolonged incubation period to vCJD. Therefore, a precautionary approach is taken with the formulation of infection prevention and control advice, given the many uncertainties in this area, and the serious consequences of hidden transmission. &#xa0;Identification and follow-up of individuals at increased risk of vCJD &#xa0;There are around 3,500 individuals in the UK who have been informed that they have an increased risk of vCJD (see Annex A). This figure comprises a mix of:&#xa0;&#xa0;All people who are “at increased risk” of vCJD are asked to help prevent any further possible transmission to other patients by following the advice beneath, published by the ACDP TSE group (see box).&#xa0;

[[[Box: Public health advice on how to stop CJD spreading to other people]]]&#xa0;This advice is for people who have been identified as being at increased risk of CJD. To reduce the risk of spreading CJD to other people please follow this advice:&#xa0;Through its past work with the CJD Incidents Panel, PHE has had a role in identifying and informing individuals of their increased risk of vCJD. This was done in collaboration with the National Blood service (now NHS BT) and the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors organisation. Long-term public health follow-up is in place to detect any new diagnoses of vCJD in these individuals. This systematic co-ordinated follow-up was put in place after the identification of three transfusion-associated cases of vCJD and the detection, post mortem, of prion protein deposition in tissues from two individuals (one with a history of blood transfusion, and the other of plasma product treatment) neither of whom had symptoms of vCJD. Any further detection of iatrogenic transmission of vCJD via blood, tissues, organs or surgery, would be immediately notified and would lead to a re-assessment of current guidance and precautions.&#xa0;&#xa0;Measures being taken to limit unknown risksRelated to blood transfusion and surgery&#xa0;The public health actions described above apply to individuals who have been identified and informed about their vCJD risk status or transfusion history. In addition, there are a number of universal precautions in place to protect public health from the unknown but potential risk of undiagnosed vCJD infection within the general population. These include donor deferral of any person who has received a UK blood transfusion since 1980 and universal leucocyte depletion of blood used for transfusion [1]. &#xa0;In addition, public health guidelines from NICE protect the general population from surgical risk by recommending, among other things, the use of segregated sets of neurosurgical instruments on patients born after 1996, who are presumed not to have been exposed to the dietary risks of vCJD [2]. This is to prevent accidental transmission following neurosurgery on an individual in the population exposed to dietary BSE who could theoretically be carrying an undiagnosed vCJD infection which could be passed on.&#xa0;Related to decontamination and sterilisation of surgical instruments&#xa0;A further general approach to reducing the risk from vCJD to the general population is the improvement of decontamination techniques to remove prion protein from surgical instruments. PHE hosts the national expert RRP, which provides a prompt assessment of new and novel equipment, materials, and other products or protocols that may be of value to the NHS in improving hospital infection control and reducing hospital acquired infections. For a full description of the RRP, its role, remit and procedures, see Annex B.&#xa0;The RRP reviewed the application from DuPont for the product “RelyOn Prion Inactivator” (RelyOn-PI) on two occasions. RelyOn-PI is DuPont’s patented solution claimed to “very substantially reduce the risk of transmission of prions bound to surgical instruments”. The modus operandi of RelyOn-PI can be found in Annex C, Section 2.5. &#xa0;The first application concerning RelyOn-PI was reviewed by the RRP in June 2007, awarded a level 3 recommendation (“A potentially useful new concept but insufficiently validated; more research and development is required before it is ready for evaluation in practice”), and the applicants provided with detailed feedback concerning gaps and weaknesses within the evidence base.&#xa0; At a second review in December 2008, the RRP awarded a level 2 recommendation (“Basic research and development has been completed and the product may have potential value; in use evaluations/trials are now needed in an NHS clinical setting” – see Annex D). This second commentary to the company outlined concerns with the product which DuPont had yet to address. These were communicated to DuPont after both applications in 2007 and 2008 (Annex E for the full 2008 commentary). &#xa0;Specifically in the RRP feedback following the 2008 review, DuPont was “again advised to engage with the Department of Health’s Engineering &amp; Science Advisory Committee for the decontamination of surgical instruments including Prion Removal regarding compatibility with existing procedures and how the product will fit into practice”. The RRP secretariat is aware that in April 2010 DuPont approached Infection Control Product Specialist Dr Beryl Oppenheim (consultant microbiologist, City Hospital Birmingham) who convened an expert group to work with and advise DuPont.&#xa0;&#xa0;Prion prevalence surveys of appendix tissue to further inform risk assessmentsPHE undertakes anonymised population prevalence surveys to increase understanding of the epidemiology and scale of background undiagnosed abnormal prion infections. The results have helped to inform public health guidance. The most recent survey, which tested tissue archived following routine surgery, demonstrated a 1:2000 prevalence of abnormal prion deposition in appendices of individuals born between 1941 and 1985 [3]. Although it is not known whether this finding equates to infectivity in tissues or in the blood of those with prion deposition, on a precautionary basis it supports the maintenance of the current public health safety measures, until a practical and reliable screening test for asymptomatic infection becomes available.&#xa0;A further anonymised appendix study in UK populations assumed non-exposed to dietary BSE is under way (again PHE co-ordinated and in collaboration with a range of partners). Appendices removed from patients (of any age) prior to 1979 and from those born after 1996, when full safety measures to protect the food chain were in place are being tested. This will provide a comparison population result to help interpret the findings from the earlier survey. The latest survey will conclude in 2015. PHE will present any interim findings from the appendix study on an ongoing basis to the relevant expert groups. &#xa0;&#xa0;Establishing the prevalence of abnormal prions in blood:If the current appendix study demonstrates that the deposition of abnormal prion protein is confined to the population that was exposed to the BSE epidemic, the case for an anonymised population blood prevalence survey would be further increased – although there are a number of associated issues which would have to be considered very carefully. If there is no difference the priorities for further research and the implications for current public health protection measures would have to be re-evaluated. &#xa0;Since 2006/7 the advice of HPA (now PHE) experts and others has been that it is a priority to establish the prevalence of TSE reactivity in UK blood donations. Five years ago a protocol for an unlinked anonymous survey of 50,000 UK blood donors was developed jointly by the HPA and NHS-BT, and Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained, in anticipation of a suitable “medium to high throughput” blood test becoming available, the results of which could be usefully interpreted [4]. Although this protocol needs updating to take account of new developments, it remains an important expression of HPA/PHE thinking with respect to a blood survey of abnormal prion prevalence. All technical experts who have considered the matter are aware that the blood test requirements for an unlinked anonymous prevalence survey need not be as rigorous as a blood test for strengthening blood safety (i.e. screening and excluding blood donations).&#xa0;The results of the second appendix survey [3] (in the absence of further appendix prevalence results – paras 18-19) strengthens arguments for establishing the prevalence of “prionaemia” in UK blood. The assessment by the current relevant national UK advisory committee (The ACDP TSE RA Sub-Group) of the second appendix survey results (http://transparency.dh.gov.uk/2012/08/13/tse-risk-assessment-july-2012/) was that “gaining further information on prevalence of infection also remains a key area, especially through the investigation of tissues from groups unexposed to BSE and of the feasibility of surveying the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in blood”. The full results of the second appendix survey included the conclusion that “it would be prudent to measure the prevalence of abnormal PrP in human blood. As soon as a satisfactory human blood screening test becomes available in a scalable format, such an unlinked anonymous survey should be undertaken”. [3]&#xa0;Since 2011, HPA/PHE experts have had exploratory meetings to develop ideas as to how a blood prevalence survey could be progressed. Issues discussed include a) uncertainty about the specificity of available blood tests (since addressed through additional work) b) the need for at least a “medium-throughput” format test for a survey on the scale required, and c) challenges in confirming and interpreting “positive” results. On this latter point, however, there is appreciation that further investigation of reactive specimens would be facilitated by i) the likely availability of surplus suitable specimens (ie the remainder of any reactive blood specimen – unlike the situation with appendices), ii) the field of possible confirmatory tests has been progressing steadily, and iii) the unlinked-anonymous design would avoid the difficulty of having to convey uncertain results directly to subjects from whom blood specimens are obtained (as is the case for the positive appendix specimens). The critical aspect was identified as having the primary test in a format that could be used relatively efficiently and consistently when testing approximately 50,000 specimens.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.
