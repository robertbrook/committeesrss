[[[ (PEX 0023)]]]&#xa0;The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) plays a leading role in the delivery of high quality patient care by setting standards of medical practice and promoting clinical excellence.  We provide physicians in the United Kingdom and overseas with education, training and support throughout their careers.  As an independent body representing almost 29,000 fellows and members worldwide, we advise and work with government, the public, patients and other professions to improve health and healthcare. Our primary interest is in building a health system that delivers high quality care for patients. &#xa0;The RCP welcomes the opportunity to submit written evidence to the House of Commons Health Select Committee inquiry on Public expenditure on health and social care. We would like to make the following comments. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 20132
