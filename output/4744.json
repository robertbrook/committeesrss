"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Malcolm McBain [FBB0100]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe inquiry into the future of the BBC is of profound importance to all thinking\n \ntax payers. However, BBC staff as commentators of events are not more\n \nimportant than legislators. Legislators have to take responsibility for their\n \nactions. BBC staff should not therefore be paid at grossly higher rates than\n \nlegislators or civil servants. \nIt\n \nis a scandal that the BBC is able to persist in\n \nconcealing the main facts abo\nu\nt their pay scales from the public which pays for\n \nthem through taxation.\n&#xa0;\nMany other scandals have come to light in recent years but \nit \nseems to me that\n \nthe power to form and \nguide public opinion, which the BBC possesses in\n \nabundance, may be being abused. \nIt \nmight, for example, be being used, by\n \nrestricting publicity about it, to downgrade the importance of this inquiry into\n \nthe future of the Corporation. The BBC is extremely \nskilled in the task of\n \nguiding public opinion. This tendency needs to be brought under public control\n \nif some acceptable formula for this can be devised.\n&#xa0;\nThe method of choosing public figures to express views on radio and television\n \nabout current question\ns of public interest is not clear. \nI \nsuspect that people\n \nexpressing views critical of the BBC \nmay\n find themselves overlooked when\n \nchoices are made about whom to invite onto political programmes of public\n \ninterest. \nIf \nso, it is improper use of public funds \nby a supposedly impartial\n \npublicly funded corporation.\n&#xa0;\nI \nam particularly incensed by the way the BBC has glossed over the question of the excessive pay and allowances paid to senior staff of the Corporation. \nIt \nseems clear that the BBC employs specialist \nadvisers to recommend the taking of measures to evade or reduce income taxes by staff or favoured contributors.  If\n \nmore modest emoluments are recommended by Parliament, the BBC will need to be examined critically to ensure it does not devise further craft\ny ways of finessing any reductions that may be attempted by Parliament or the Government in future. The Committee needs to be particularly alert to this and to the ability of the BBC to deny or curtail the publicity it gives to its critics.\n&#xa0;\nThe scope of \nthe BBC to enlarge its activities beyond the key duty of spreading\n \nfactual and truthful information about Britain and the world should be\n \nconsiderably reduced, Too many news bulletins are taken up with idle chatter and speculation about future events.  The\n “Today” programme, for example, too frequently tells us what is going to be announced later that day before it has happened.  There are too many instances of vulgarity, bad language, gratuitous sexual scenes, violence etc in entertainment programmes.  The\nre seems to be a definite attempt by the BBC to dumb down a population that seems to have been cowed into accepting a general lowering of moral standards.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
