[[[&#xa0;]]]Career breaks

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Unconscious bias&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?&#xa0;These issues affect men and women but in general the consequences for women’s careers and career choices tend to be more pronounced. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Good practice

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We suggest HEFCE reviews the REF process to check for any potential, unintended effects on the gender balance in STEM disciplines. Procedures that may have unintended consequences are those that do not recognise collaborative ways of working, which women tend to prefer, and procedures that lead to (or reflect) particular individuals having a celebrity-like status within their community – the majority whom are currently men due to the existing demographics – all of which may further exacerbate unconscious bias issues.Current REF processes which should be given consideration include that: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0; Maximising women’s contribution to future economic growth; Women’s Business Council (supported by Government Equalities Office); June 2013 Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey 14 August 2013  Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Student Record 2004/05 - 2011/12 &amp; HESA Staff Record 2004/05 – 2011/12).
