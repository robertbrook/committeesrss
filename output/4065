[normal]Written submission from the [bold]Federation [bold]o[bold]f Master Builders[bold] [bold](BRC 55)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]Federation of Master Builders (FMB) 
[normal]is the largest trade association in the UK construction industry, and with 
[normal]more than 
[normal]9,
[normal]000 members
[normal], it
[normal] is the recognised voice of 
[normal]small and medium-sized (SME) 
[normal]construction 
[normal]firms
[normal]. 
[normal]Established in 1941 to protect the intere
[normal]sts of SME building firms, the
[normal] 
[normal]FMB is independent and non-profit-making, lobbying continuously for
[normal] 
[normal]members’ interests at both national and local levels. 
[normal]T
[normal]he FMB is a source of knowledge, professional advice and support 
[normal]for its members 
[normal]across the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Inclu
[normal]ded in this is the
[normal] FMB
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]route to certification and registrations
[normal] 
[normal]services as part of its ‘complete solution’ service 
[normal]to
[normal] member
[normal] firms
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] are committed to delivering the highest standards of customer service and workmanship in the building industry.
[normal] 
[normal]The F
[normal]MB 
[normal]route to certification 
[normal]is 
[normal]offer
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]through
[normal] a service agreement with NAPIT and provides FMB members with
[normal] a route to 
[normal]Competent Person Scheme Registration
[normal], 
[normal]Electrical Installer Certification, 
[normal]Green Deal Installer Certification and Microgeneration (MCS) Installer Certification

[normal]THE FMB’S VIEWS ON BUILDING REGULATIONS CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRICAL INSLATTAION AND REPAIRS IN DWELLINGS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The FMB 
[normal]argues
[normal] that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he majority of the
[normal] consumers
[normal] 
[normal]lack 
[normal]awareness
[normal] 
[normal]of competent persons scheme
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in general 
[normal]and 
[normal]do not know 
[normal]that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]‘
[normal]Electrotech
[normal]nical Assessment Specification f
[normal]or 
[normal]use by 
[normal]Certification a
[normal]nd Registration Bodies
[normal]’ is sufficiently robust in setting out the technical competence requirements for a business to be certified/registered as competent to undertake electrical work. However, 
[normal]the FMB does have a concern that in some scheme
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] the number of electrical operatives that a ‘qualified supervisor’ is responsible for may be excessive. 
[normal]We have been reliably informed that a ratio of one qualified supervisor to 25 operatives 
[normal]is
[normal] permitted in some schemes. If this is 
[normal]the case
[normal],
[normal] we consi
[normal]de
[normal]r that the ratio to be far too high;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]ithin the electrical competent persons scheme
[normal], the vast majority of
[normal] 
[normal]those carrying out electrical works
[normal] do 
[normal]review 
[normal]their work sufficiently
[normal] to ensure that it meets the requirements of the 
[normal]Building 
[normal]Regulations;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C
[normal]ompetit
[normal]ion between certification/registration bodies is both healthy and necessary. Many electrical installers have an established and long-term relationship with their certification/registration body and 
[normal]any move to force installers to 
[normal]use a single certification
[normal]/registration body would not be well received by the e
[normal]lectrical contracting industry;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he creation of t
[normal]wo separate registers of electricians i.e. ‘ElectricSafe Register’ and 
[normal]‘Electrical Safety Register’ was a negative 
[normal]and inappropriate 
[normal]step
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, given the general lack of 
[normal]consumer 
[normal]awareness of the two registers, at this stage the impact of the creation of two registers on 
[normal]public confusion
[normal] is limited
[normal]. 
[normal]There is still a great opportunity to establish a single register that, if 
[normal]correctly market
[normal]ed and supported, could play a significant 
[normal]role
[normal] in raising public awareness, improving electrical safety and increasing compliance with the Building R
[normal]egulations;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he relationship between the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment endorsed TrustMark scheme
[normal],
[normal] and registration of electr
[normal]ical contractors
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]needs to be considered
[normal]. The TrustMark scheme include
[normal]s
[normal] registration for electrical work
[normal]. The fact that TrustMark is so consumer focussed has the potential to confuse the general public if they are faced with what in effect is an
[normal]other regis
[normal]ter of electricians;

[normal]T
[normal]he adequacy of the supervision by 
[normal]the 
[normal]D
[normal]epartment for 
[normal]C
[normal]ommunities and 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment (DCLG)
[normal] of the 
[normal]electrical competent person scheme operators has
[normal], to 
[normal]date
[normal],
[normal] not been as robust as it 
[normal]perhaps should 
[normal]have 
[normal]been
[normal]. 
[normal]However, given that the
[normal] revised
[normal] competent person
[normal]s
[normal] scheme
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]Conditions of Authorisation
[normal]’
[normal] include
[normal]s
[normal] a requirement for UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 (or latest equivalent) 
[normal]we consider that going forward the supervision via UKAS will be 
[normal]quite
[normal] adequate.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]RECOMMENDAT[bold]IONS TO [bold]THE CLG SELECT [bold]COMMITTEE[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The FMB urges the Committee to make the followin
[normal]g recommendations to government, ensuring that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal] single register of 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]electricians
[normal] exists
[normal];

[normal]The register 
[normal]offer
[normal]s
[normal] a single

[normal]T
[normal]he register 
[normal]is
[normal] inclusive and 
[normal]open to all 
[normal]existing and 
[normal]any 
[normal]future 
[normal]UKAS accredited
