&#xa0;Written evidence from Mr Stephen Bellows (CYS0041)1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I cycle for pleasure and fitness, usually alone, occasionally with one other person.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;   I am increasingly concerned for my safety when cycling on the roads where I live.3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;   This is due not only to some people driving without due care and attention but primarily because of the hostile attitude of a significant minority of motorists.I use the word significant because that is what the consequences for me could be if an accident occurs. Some shout abuse or threats, some make it clear that in their view I should not be using the road.Some overtake at speed, without any attempt to give me any space, even if the road is wide and otherwise empty.Some overtake and pull back in very close to the front of my bike, rubbing their wheels into the verge.&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;   While these things do not occur every day, it is usual to experience hostile driving at some point every week.All of these things make me feel as if I am being bullied off from the road. There is often little or no margin for error on my part.There are some cycle paths in the area where I live but they are unsuitable for adult / competent cyclists who wish to cycle distances or at much above walking pace.&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;   I would like to see a high publicity safety and awareness campaign, with the backing of both government and police, aimed at establishing the right of cyclists to use the national road network and re enforcing the responsibility in law of taking due care and attention while driving. A clear and unequivocal statement from the Prime minister would make a good start.6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I realize that the recent fatal accidents in London must take some priority for cycle safety but rural roads are not the blissful places that others may believe.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
