defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultDeightondefault Pierce Glynn (LAI 0034)defaultThis document is submitted on behalf of Deighton
default Pierce Glynn solicitors to address the Government’s proposals to transform legal aid
default, particularly on the issue of the residence test
default. 
defaultDeighton Pierce Glynn is a national law firm which is committed to using 
defaultthe law to enforce the rights of the disadvanta
defaultged of society, hold the state to account for its actions, challenge discrimination and fight human rights and environmental abuses.  
defaultResidence testdefaultThe government’s
default belief that legal aid should be prioritised for those who have a sufficiently strong conn
defaultection to the UK
default is erroneous and misconceived.
default 
defaultThe real issue is that of the jurisdiction or reach of the law impacting upon a person’s life. 
defaultThe fact that a person may not be lawfully resident does not somehow diminish the gravity of the consequences for
default that person if he or she is adversely affected by the actions of the UK State. 
default 
defaultThe conformity of the law for those affected by it within the ambit of its jurisdiction was stated by Lord Scarman in R v SSHD ex.p Khawaja [1982] 1WLR 321 
default              
default67. ……Every pers
defaulton within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws. There is 
default              
defaultno distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is 
default              
defaultentitled to its protection….’ 
defaultWhilst 
defaultKhawaja’s
default case concerned liberty it was the indivi
defaultsible concept of those being within the jurisdiction of the English law being entitled to its protection that was in issue.  Further, it is not just the mere existence of the protection of the law which engages the rule of 
defaultlaw 
defaultbut effective access to it; l
defaultegal protection which is not accessible 
defaultrenders such protection meaningless
default. 
defaultThe government is of the view that the exceptional fun
defaultding regime adequately provides
default for those excluded 
defaultby the residence test to apply for legal aid.  This 
defaultis not correct becaus
defaulte t
defaulthe bar to qualifying for exceptional funding has been set far too high
default to render any potential access to funding by this route ineffective
default. 
defaultThe exceptional funding guidance
default 
defaultstates that, 
default‘the overarching question to consider is whether the withholding of
default legal aid would make the assertion of the claim practically impossible or lead to an obvious unfairness in proceedings.
default’
default This is a very high threshold.
default The guidance 
defaultpositively discourages the grant of funding
default, does not adequately allow for urgent cases an
defaultd excludes those with private and family life reasons (Article 8 ECHR) for needing to remain in the UK and seeking support. 
defaultThere is also a significant amount of non-funded work which would necessary making this process to be financially unsustainable ove
defaultr time; this is because the rates of pay for publicly funded work mean that it is unsustainable to do much, if any, non-chargeable work. 
defaultThe effect of the test for exceptional funding is to create a two tier system for legal aid (a non-migrant service and
default a migrant service) with the latter being much more difficult if not impossible to access.  This is obviously unfair where the legal issue requiring resolution is just the same with the adverse consequences even harsher for the migrant applicant. On its fa
defaultce such a system is 
defaultdiscriminatory which is not jus
defaulttified in all the circumstances.  T
defaulthere needs to be a heightened sense of fairness when dealing with vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied minors 
defaultThe residence test will 
defaultrequire suppliers and the Legal 
defaultAid Agency to carefully assess applicants’ immigrations status. This is a time consuming and complicated task. The government has grossly underestimated the practical implication of implementing the residence test.  It applies
default to 
defaulteveryone
default with a civil lega
defaultl aid case (save possibly those people with 
defaultcases
default of the kind that are listed under para
defaultgraph
default 125 of Appendix B to Transforming Legal Aid Next steps). Most will pass it, provided they can prove past lawful residence (and there are problems for many) and ar
defaulte physically present. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe scale of what
default i
defaults involved in administering the test is immense. In 2012-13 alone there were:
default&#xa0;
default 
defaulta.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default590410 Civil Legal Help funded acts of assistance;

default&#xa0;
default 
default139,083 authorised acts of certificated representation.
defaultSee: 
defaulthttp://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/corporate-reports/legal-services-commission
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn this one year alone, each of these 729,483 acts of assistance would have 
defaultneeded to be preceded by a residence test administered by their solicitors, before any funding was available.
default&#xa0;
defaultThose that the residence test is proposed to exclude from access to legal aid are often extremely vulnerable and many are unable to leave the UK 
defaultthrough no fault of their own. The proposal will leave them without a legal remedy when their fundamental human rights are at stake, undermining the rule of law in the UK, and the “access to a fair open justice system” referred to in the introduction to co
defaultnsultation. Legal aid ensures access to basic legal entitlements to housing or subsistence. Without legal aid, many will be left street homeless and without sufficient food, including families, people fleeing domestic violence and people with physical or m
defaultental disabilities, breaching their fundamental human rights. There will be an increased burden on safety net public authorities such as the police, A and E departments and social services.  
defaultIt is a poor use of resources to transfer the duty of the state 
defaultto cater for the needs of vulnerable litigants in person, who speak English as a second language, onto the courts. Similarly, the requirement for 
defaultevery
default legal aid applicant to satisfy an immigration and residence test is disproportionate. Eligible applicant
defaults may not have the correct documents. Many legal aid suppliers do not have the skills to fairly apply such a test. The increased visibility of a migrant community which is street homeless because it cannot easily access social welfare provision risks damag
defaulting race relations. The proposals are open to challenge on discrimination grounds, particularly in relation to EU nationals.
defaultDetailed points
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposed residence and immigration test does not necessarily identify the claimed objective or those with a 
defaultstrong connection to the UK. For example, a person may have been born in the UK and lived here all their life but not have leave to remain;
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe measure proposed will have a disproportionate adverse effect on legal aid applicants with a strong connection t
defaulto the UK by subjecting them to an unnecessary immigration and residence test. The client group in receipt of legal aid is primarily a vulnerable group. It 
defaultincludes: disabled people, people with mental health needs and learning disabilities, women leaving d
defaultomestic violence or trafficking, and homeless families. It is inappropriate to subject those in this group, who are otherwise eligible for welfare and support services, to an immigration and residence test. They may be in urgent need of legal services but 
defaultunable to produce the relevant documentation. As a result, essential legal aid advice and representation may be refused or delayed, causing extreme hardship;
default&#xa0;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAssessing immigration and residence issues is a specialist skill. The 
defaultsubmissions of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA)
default in relation to the c
defaultomplexity of this are adopted and so not repeated here. An applicant may have lea
defaultve to remain even though it is not referred to in a document. Errors will be made, resulting in those who are entitled being excluded; 
default&#xa0;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs stated above, the issue of lawfulness of residence is complex. It may be the subject-matter of the case, requiring f
defaulturther investigation in order to assess it. For example, a person may have been refused homelessness assistance, healthcare, community care, asylum support etc.  because they were treated as ineligible because of their immigration status. They need legal a
defaultid to be able to get advice on whether those decisions were correct and to make appropriate challenges. These challenges often turn out to be successful at the end of the case. Who will decide whether the person is eligible for legal aid at the beginning o
defaultf the case, when a lot of investigation needs to be carried out into the assessment of the person’s immigration status? The LAA? The ‘non-immigration’ specialist solicitor? 
default&#xa0;
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe applicant may not have leave to remain due to delay or error on the part of U
defaultKBA. Legal aid may be needed to challenge these failures (see case study below);
default&#xa0;
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThose who are ineligible for legal aid under the new provisions are likely to be the most vulnerable people in society, including families with children. Some of them may be 
defaultunable to leave the UK through no fault of their own, such as having an outstanding application with the Home Office; pregnancy; ill-health preventing air travel; or a lack of relevant documents;  
default&#xa0;
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultApplying the residence test to a recently arrived EU nati
defaultonal who is in the UK exercising an EU Treaty such as the right to work or look for work will amount to discrimination under EU law, as between UK and EU nationals; 
default&#xa0;
defaulth)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals exclude asylum seekers from the residence test, as well as those who have m
defaultade a fresh asylum claim. However, whether a fresh asylum claim in fact amounts to a fresh asylum claim, under para 353 of the Immigration Rules (the test referred to in the consultation document), is often contentious, and subject to litigation. If a pers
defaulton is seeking to get legal aid in any area of law outside of asylum/immigration, e.g. housing, community care, family etc., it is unclear whether it will be sufficient for them simply to have submitted a fresh asylum claim to be eligible for legal aid, or 
defaultwhether this would have to be recorded as a fresh claim by the Home Office. If it is the former, will non-immigration solicitors need to make a decision about whether the fresh asylum claim meets the test in para 353, or will the submission of a fresh clai
defaultm on its own be enough? If it is the latter, this is problematic 
defaultbecause in general it can take the Home Office weeks, months and sometimes years to make an initial decision on whether a fresh asylum claim is a fresh asylum claim. Even then, this may be su
defaultbject to successful litigation if it is wrongly not treated as a fresh asylum claim – with the result that people in urgent need of legal aid, for example to prevent homelessness, are denied access to this because of Home Office delay.
default Further, the curren
defaultt system operated by the Home Office for submitting fresh asylum claims means that there may be a delay of several weeks, sometimes a month or two, before an appointment is given for a fresh claim to be submitted. If a person is homeless, or refused other 
defaultrights in the interim, s/he would not have access to legal aid to access rights they may have to services, and for example, would be destitute and homeless as a result of the proposals; 
default&#xa0;
defaulti)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf there is a dispute between the legal aid provider and the solicit
defaultor about the eligibility of the client, will the solicitor get paid for challenging this decision if they turn out to be correct? (Currently there is no legal aid available for challenging decisions about funding once a certificate has ended.);
default&#xa0;
defaultj)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe propos
defaultals will result in considerable additional costs to local authorities. By way of illustration, this would include the extra costs to Social Services where the lack of advice or representation has resulted in families, pregnant women, or disabled people bei
defaultng evicted and/or being unable to access housing under s4 or s95 Immigration and Asylum Act 1999;
default&#xa0;
defaultk)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals will result in additional costs to the NHS of migrants in need of A and E care due to street homelessness and lack of subsistence;
default&#xa0;
defaultl)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposa
defaultls will place increased costs and burdens on the civil court system, in dealing with litigants in person, many of whom may have English as a second language and a limited grasp of the process. This may result if delays for other applicants; and

defaultA provisio

default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral point
defaults
default&#xa0;
defaultMigrants who are here unlawfully are generally excluded from housing, 
defaultwelfare 
defaultbenefits, asylum support, community care
default and healthcare
default,
default by virtue of s115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and s54 and Sch 3 to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. On the whole, the people who are not excluded from these support services are unable to return to their country
default for a variety of reasons
default.
default 
defaultThis might be because
default there is a pending immigration claim (non-asylum), 
defaultthey are 
defaultnot medically fit to travel due to ill health or pregnancy or
default they are
default waiting for travel documents to return to their country. So
default,
default there are alrea
defaultdy provisions in place to exclude unlawful migrants from support. The proposed reforms to legal aid will mean that people who are not excluded from the 
defaultabove services will not be able to have access to a solicitor if they are refused services
default to
default which they
default would otherwise be entitled.
default For example, a homeless family with an outstanding article 8 ECHR application, who would be eligible for accommodation from the social services department, would be unable to challenge a decision to refuse them accommodation, 
defaulteven though there was a duty in law to provide this; a person beaten up in police custody would be unable to get legal aid to seek redress through legal aid; a homeless applicant granted refugee status or other leave to remain within the last 12 months wou
defaultld not be able to get legal aid to challenge a local authority’s refusal to process his/her homeless application. The examples are endless, and can be applied in all areas of law. People will have rights to services, but will be unable to challenge an unla
defaultwful refusal of those rights. The result will be that many vulnerable people will be without the support to which they are legally entitled. The state would be free to act with impunity against migrants, including those here lawfully but for less than 12 m
defaultonths, making decisions it knows to be unlawful, knowing that the migrant has no access to legal aid to challenge these unlawful decisions. This is completely against the rule of law, a system which, so far, the citizens of the UK have been rightly proud o
defaultf.    
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a firm specialising in migrant support, we deal with a huge number of cases where migrants, who would be excluded from legal aid should the reforms be implemented, are wrongly refused housing, 
defaultwelfare 
defaultbenefits, asylum support, community care and
default healthcare. Very often we receive referrals of these cases by local and national advice charities who have been unable to secure these rights for the clients themselves. Generally, 
defaultit is 
defaultonly after we send a letter before claim or issue proceedings 
defaultthat
default t
defaulthe relevant support provided. This demonstrates that a solicitor is needed for this type of work, because clients and advice agencies are unable to achieve 
defaultthese outcomes
default themselves. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase Studiesdefault&#xa0;defaultW, a Guyanandefault man who came to the UK in 1965 is currently ready to leave a west London hospital, where he was admitted from street homelessness due to paranoid schizophrenia and physical disabilities.default We have legal aid to challenge the social services’ decision not to 
defaultsupport him; assuming we succeed, he will be able to be discharged from hospital where he is “bed-blocking”. He has not managed to access legal aid advice to regularise his immigration status because of the April 2013 exclusion of immigration advice from s
defaultcope. 
defaultUnder the new regime he would not be entitled to assistance despite living in the UK for 58 years, resulting in ongoing costs to the NHS and/or a risk that he will be returned to the streets in a psychotic state with his zimmer frame.
default&#xa0;defaultWe acted for Mdefault, a woman in her 30s with mental health needs who was street homeless.default As a result, she was sleeping on buses and eating irregularly at drop-in centres. Her mother was seriously disabled and supported by social services. UKBA had decided to grant her leave
default to remain 3 years earlier but failed to send her the documents. Without these documents she was unable to work or get social assistance to housing, social services or welfare benefits. We only discovered this decision had been made after by requesting a c
defaultopy of her Home Office file. We then made formal complaints to UKBA and sent a series of letters which were ignored. Only after we eventually issued judicial review proceedings, both she and her mother were issued with immigration status documents granting
default leave to remain. 
defaultIf we had not assisted her, it is likely she would eventually have been hospitalised.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultD had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and was in immigration detention but not receiving any medical treatment.default He did not have leave to remain 
defaultin the UK, but attempts to remove him since 2005 had failed, in part due to his mental condition. We were instructed by him but his mental health worsened  to the extent that he lacked mental capacity to give us instructions. The Official Solicitor then in
defaultstructed us on his behalf. The case was complicated and included an appeal to the Court of Appeal. We applied for judicial review. He was eventually released and the court made a finding that his rights under article 3 ECHR had been breached and his detent
defaultion was unlawful. 
defaultWithout legal aid we would not have been able to represent in such a high risk complex case and it is likely that D would remain in detention, with worsening mental health, at considerable cost to the tax-payer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultL had PTSD and depressiodefaultn after being tortured by a foreign government.default He was held in detention under threat of removal to Ireland. His wife and school-age children were settled in the UK. He received immigration advice which resulted in him being granted leave to remain and rel
defaulteased from detention. He was represented in a claim against UK government departments arguing they were complicit in his torture. This resulted in him receiving damages. 
defaultWithout legal aid, L would probably have been removed to Ireland, separated from his c
defaulthildren and the important issues raised by his case in relation to torture would never have been addressed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultS is the 21 year old step-daughter of an EU national who fled her parents’ home because of physical abuse from her father, and stayed in a refugedefault.
default She was working part-time on a low wage and studying. Her application as a homeless person was wrongfully refused on the basis that she did not have a lawful right to reside in the UK. An Advice Agency helped her to request a review which was also refused
default. We then assisted her to appeal to the County Court, making complex EU law  arguments until the council agreed to rehouse her. 
defaultWithout our assistance, she could have become street homeless and/or at risk of sexual exploitation to survive. 
default&#xa0;
defaultR is a Polish defaultnational who had very late stage breast cancer.default She had been refused treatment for three months by the hospital, which had resulted in the tumour growing to the size of a football and her needing to have the open wound cleaned and dressed every few hours. 
defaultHer and her partner had been working in the UK for over 6 years. In any event, she should not have been refused the treatment because the medical staff treating her had said she was unfit to travel due to the high risk of infection, but the hospital was re
defaultfusing to budge. Only after threatening legal action did the hospital agree that R was lawfully entitled to the treatment, and this was then provided immediately. 
defaultR might have died if she had not received timely advice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe acted for F in 2 applications fdefaultor judicial review of a decision of the CPS not to prosecute her ex-partner with rape and sexual offences.default  F resides in Ireland with her 2 small children.  Both applications challenged the decisions of the CPS who had failed to protect F as a victim of se
defaultxual abuse and prosecute her abuser.  The CPS in particular failed to follow their guidance and 
defaultbuild a prosecution case and instead sought to identify a series of obstacles to it.  
defaultThe Lord Chief Justice granted our application, highlighting that this was
default exactly the type of case where judicial review should be sought.  The CPS will now have to consider whether to charge F’s ex-partner with rape and other sexual offences.  
defaultWithout 
defaultlegal aid F, a victim of abuse, would not have been able to challenge the un
defaultlawful decision of CPS or have that decision quashed 
default&#xa0;
defaultMr R, Mr D and Mr Ra had each been detained in immigration centres for several years.default They had applied to UKBA for a bail address but, in common with many other detainees, they had been waiting for many months for an address to be offered. Without a bail address they were unable to apply to the tribunal for bail. Despite our letters before
default claim UKBA did not provide bail addresses. It was only after we applied for a judicial review that bail addresses were provided which enabled Mr R and Mr D to successfully apply for bail and secure release. At the final hearing of the JR the court ordered
default that the Home Office policy on bail addresses was unlawful in that detainees who were considered “high risk” and therefore not suitable for the usual type of bail accommodation, and who were therefore waiting for bail addresses for very long periods, were
default not being notified that they had been so classified and were being given no opportunity to respond. As a result of the judgement, the Home Office was required to amend the procedure so that it operates fairly. 
defaultWithout legal aid, Mr R, Mr D and Mr Ra would
default have been unable to challenge the unlawful Home Office policy and would have been unable to make an application for bail. Mr R and Mr D, would have been unlawfully detained for even longer than they were. Others in the same position have benefited from th
defaulte judgement with the improvements in the Home Office policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultM suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and was in immigration detention for 5 years 5 monthsdefault. He is from Zimbabwe. Throughout much, if not all, of his detention the Home Office was unable to effe
defaultct returns to Zimbabwe and so, there was no lawful basis to detain M. Further, UKBA had not kept to its policy of not detaining those with mental illness save in very exceptional circumstances. M was not released until we started a judicial review and the 
defaultHigh Court ordered bail. The Home Office has since agreed to pay significant damages. 
defaultLA, a single man in his 60s, is from the Caribbean.default&#xa0;default He came to the UK a few years ago to join his partner, but they split up.default&#xa0;
default He is destitute, deaf, mute, illiterate a
defaultnd does not know sign language.
default&#xa0;
default He has been looked after by a family friend for the last couple of years, who has fed and accommodated him, but she cannot do so any longer because she is a local authority foster carer and therefore cannot have him living 
defaultthere any longer.
default&#xa0;
default He agreed to voluntarily return to his country of origin, but before flights could be arranged he fell gravely ill and was hospitalised.
default&#xa0;
default He has been diagnosed with inoperable kidney cancer which has spread to the lung, and because of hi
defaults immigration status he has been denied life-extending chemotherapy unless he pays a deposit of £50,000.
default&#xa0;
default He is medically unfit to fly, however, so he cannot leave the UK.
default&#xa0;
default The hospital wants to discharge him but he has nowhere to go; his immigration statu
defaults means he is not entitled to housing or social security.
default&#xa0;
default The local authority social services department refuses to assist.
default&#xa0;
default Without our help to challenge the local authority he cannot be discharged, so he will block a bed, and every day will cost the hos
defaultpital more than it costs to pay us to secure his safe discharge.
default&#xa0;
default Without our help treatment he will become progressively sicker, and will require emergency intensive care within weeks, which cannot be withheld pending payment and which will cost as much i
defaultf not more than the chemotherapy.
default&#xa0;
default Without treatment he is expected to die within months.
default&#xa0;
default Under the new proposals he will not be entitled to legal aid because of the new residence criteria, and will thus cost the taxpayer many times more than it would cos
defaultt to provide legal aid to address these issues.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultK was a torture survivor from Iran who had recently been granted refugee status. defaultHe suffered from very severe mental health problems due to his torture experiences. After he was granted refugee status his H
defaultome Office accommodation was withdrawn because he was no longer an asylum seeker. 
defaultHe became homeless. He approached the local authority to make a homeless application, but he was turned away, without any decision, and continued to be street homeless. This 
defaultwas completely unlawful, as a local authority must provide accommodation to a homeless applicant pending a written decision, but this happens frequently. Only after his solicitors sent a letter before claim threatening judicial review did the local authori
defaultty agree to provide K with accommodation pending a decision on his homeless application. His application was eventually allowed, because it was accepted that he was ‘in priority need’ – a high threshold to pass. K would not have got legal aid under the ref
defaultorms as he did not have his leave to remain for at least twelve months. 
default&#xa0;
defaultM was a heavily pregnant woman who was homeless.default Her asylum claim had been refused and she had submitted a fresh claim. This had not yet been recorded by the Home Office, and it ther
defaultefore appears from the consultation document that she would not be eligible for legal aid until the fresh claim had been recorded as such. She was eligible for accommodation from the Home Office under s4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. However, the
defaultre had been a substantial delay in the Home Office processing her application for s4 accommodation, even though the Home Office was aware of the delay and with a national charity advocating for her. Only after we sent a letter to the Home Office threatenin
defaultg court action was she immediately provided with accommodation. Under the reforms she would not have been eligible for legal aid. 
default&#xa0;
defaultP was a single parent who had been in the UK for ten years.default She had an article 8 ECHR application outstanding with the UKBA 
defaultfor over four years. Her and her children were homeless. She approached the local authority for assistance. They told her that if she wanted accommodation for her children they would remove her children and put them into care, but would not support them as
default a family. This happens a lot, in order to make parents stop asking for assistance that they are entitled to under s17 of the Children Act 1989. Only after her solicitors sent a letter before claim to the Social Services Department was accommodation provid
defaulted to the client. She was subsequently granted leave to remain in the UK by the Home Office. If the legal aid proposals come in someone in her circumstances would not get legal aid. 
default&#xa0;
defaultC was a refused asylum seekerdefault who had a child, born before the asylum cl
defaultaim was refused. This meant that for asylum support purposes she was still eligible for support under s95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 – as she continued to be treated as an asylum seeker. However, the Home Office and the Asylum Support Tribunal 
defaultwrongly decided that she was no longer entitled to asylum support. Only after her solicitors threatened judicial review did the Home Office reconsider their decision and reinstate her s95 support. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ was an Iranian refused asylum seeker.default He was willing to return to Iran but did not have a passport and the embassy in London had closed. Therefore it was not possible for him to return, despite him taking all steps open to him, including signing up with the voluntary returns scheme. In such c
defaultircumstances, a refused asylum seeker would be entitled to accommodation under s4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. However, the Home Office and the Asylum Support Tribunal wrongly decided that he was not taking all the steps he could to return to Ir
defaultan and refused him support, leaving him destitute. Only after his solicitors sent a letter threatening legal action did the Home Office accept that in fact he was taking all the steps he could and provided him with accommodation, ending his destitution. 
default&#xa0;
defaultP was a single parent. She did not have leave to remain in the UK under domestic law, and her children were British.default The family were homeless and the local authority refused to provide any accommodation, either from the Housing Department or the Social Ser
defaultvices Department. At that time, domestic law treated her as not having a right to reside in the UK, although her solicitors argued that the law was being interpreted wrongly. By the end of her case, some 18 months later, the government accepted that the la
defaultw was not being interpreted correctly and that she did have a right of residence right from the outset when she asked for help with accommodation. This was a tricky case about the immigration status of the client. Because of the uncertainty over her immigr
defaultation status she would have been refused legal aid and her and her children would have been homeless, even though it was eventually accepted by all concerned that she was eligible for accommodation from the local authority. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultgovernment’s equality impa
defaultct assessment (EIA)
default is completely inadequate. It does not  reference the statistics, which the LAA collects for gender, race and disability status of legal aid applicants and consider the impact of the proposals on this group but simply makes a vague compa
defaultrison between British and 
defaultnon-British
default nationals. This is a test which will also require British nationals to produce evidence of lawful residence etc. and there is no consideration of how the test will impact on protected groups within that category, e.g. 
defaultif they have a cognitive impairment or are not British by origin. In relation to justification, there is no evidence either as to the impact or as to what the costs-saving is.  Nor is there any evidence or consideration of potential additional costs e.g. t
defaulto providers/the LAA in conducting the test, or to other public bodies. 
defaultIn relati
defaulton to mitigation
default, we would propose there should be an exemption from the test for protected groups, or where urgent legal aid is needed e.g. to apply for an injunction as part
default of a judicial review to enable a woman fleeing domestic violence and her children to access emergency housing. Exceptional funding is not an adequate form of mitigation since there is no funding to apply for it, and it delays the process. Finally, there i
defaults no detail on how ECHR or EU requirement will be met, so the consultation does not allow respondents to assess or consider this issue.
default&#xa0;defaultPaying for permission work in judicial review casesdefaultThe government asked at Q5 of 
defaultits
default consultation document ‘do you agr
defaultee with the proposal that providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for judicial review, including a request for reconsideration of the application at a hearing, the renewal hearing, or an onward permission appeal to the Court of
default Appeal, if permission is granted by the Court (but that reasonable disbursements are paid in any event)?  Please give reasons.’
defaultSummary
defaultNo, we do not agree with this proposal.  
defaultReason 1: Clients will be unable to secure legally-aided representation even defaultfor strong casesdefault defaultThe impact assessment acknowledge

defaultWe have costed the impact of this proposal. Our clear conclusion is that it will render our legally-aided judicial review work unviable. In particular, because of the risk that even in strong cases in which successful outcomes are secur
defaulted the work we carry out will go unpaid (see reasons 2 to 7 below). Therefore our response will be to cease to represent members of the public seeking to bring judicial review claims who cannot afford to pay us. The availability of CFAs does not ameliorate
default the access to justice impacts of this proposal in any way given the failure to implement Jackson’s LJ’s proposal for qualified one-way costs shifting in judicial review and because in judicial review an inter partes order does not necessarily follow even 
defaultif the client secures a successful outcome. In light of this, it is clear to us that the proposal will unlawfully restrict access to justice and legally aided representation. It is also appears that the proposal has been prompted by complaints by Ministers
default in other departments about their decision-making being subject to judicial scrutiny. The proposals represent a serious and unjustified attack on the rule of law.
defaultReason 2: defaultRdefaultemoving legal aid for claims which are not issued is not sustainable defaultParagraph 3.

default 
defaultThe 
defaultMOJ has ignored a
defaultn
default email sent by this firm on 17 May 2013 seeking clarification. 
defaultI
defaultt appears that w
defaulthat
default is proposed is that if a claim is not issued then it will only be the
default work conducted under the Legal Help scheme or under Investigative Representation funding that will be paid for. 
default 
default 
defaultIf so, t
defaulthat is very problematic because of the need to carry out a
default significant amount of work between the point at which a pre-action protoco
defaultl response is received or ought to have been supplied (at which point the Legal Help or Investigative Representation funding will cease) and the point at which the claim is issued 
default- 
defaultwork 
defaultthat is 
defaultfunded 
defaultby 
defaultFull Representation. 
defaultA significant amount of work i
defaults necessary because
default judicial review work is heavily front-loaded
default;
default so
default, for example, 
defaultall the evidence

defaulta 
defaultclaim is issued, along with detailed grounds and an indexed bundle.
default 
defaultThe effect of the MOJ’s proposal would 
defaultappear to be that all of this work will go unpaid if the claim is never issued
default.
default 
defaultThe effect of this will be very significant not least given that t
defaulthere is no scope for costs to be recovered on an inter partes basis 
defaultif
default 
defaulta 
defaultjudicial review claim
default is never issued
default. 
defaultThe most common reason why some or all of this work may be carried out but 
defaulta
default claim is never issued is that the claim is belatedly conceded
default;
default for example
default,
default where a need for interim relief and/or a potential delay problem has required the claimant to press o
defaultn with the preparation of the claim before a protocol response has been supplied, or where an opponent changes the position communicated in a protocol response because new information has come to light or as a result of action by a third party. The other c
defaultommon reason is why some or all of this work may be carried out but the claim is never issued
default is
default that when carrying out the post-protocol pre-issue work a previously unidentified weakness in the proposed claim is identified. At present
default,
default such claims are lik
defaultely to be abandoned; whereas this proposal 
defaultwill create a strong incentive for legal representatives to press on and issue the claim in any event in the hope that permission is granted, given that the abandonment of the claim will result in all the
default post-pro
defaulttocol pre-issue work
default going unpaid.
defaultReason 3: the proposal will affect the amount and quality of the work carried out post-protocol pre-issuedefaultOne impact of the uncertainty as to whether legal aid suppliers will be paid for post-protocol pre-issue preparator
defaulty work is that they will cut corners of this work to limit the risk to which they are exposed to. This will have knock on detrimental effects on clients who will have less well prepared claims and be less likely to succeed as a result. These detrimental ef
defaultfects will be felt most acutely by categories of clients with personal characteristics which will tend to require greater amounts of preparatory work, for example children, clients with mobility or sensory disabilities, clients with learning disabilities, 
defaultthe mentally ill, and those with limited English. This will also have knock on detrimental effects on courts and public bodies who will be faced with more poorly prepared judicial review claims, claims which require significantly more time and resources to
default deal with. 
defaultReason default4default: Claims which are issued but withdrawn pre-permission are not weak cases which have little effectdefaultMOJ proposes
default non-payment 
defaultnot only 
defaultin cases where permission is 
defaultrefused
default, 
defaultbut also
default non-payment in any 
defaultissued 
defaultcase which 
defaultis withdrawn befor
defaulte the court makes a permission decision. Such an approach does not meet the MOJ’s purported objective of reducing weak claims. The main reason why significant numbers of claims are withdrawn post-issue but pre-permission is that they are strong cases which
default have forced concessions from the defendant. There will also be many claims which were strong claims when the claim was issued, but in which there has been a change of circumstances which has meant that the claim is no longer necessary and/or viable. 
defaultReasdefaulton default5default: defaultTdefaulthe limited scope for inter partes costs recovery when claimsdefault defaultare issued bdefaultutdefault withdrawn pre-permissiondefault defaultThe reasoning at paragraph 3.76 of the consultation paper ignores the limited scope for inter partes
default costs recovery when judicial review claims are issued but then withdrawn pre-permission. If an opponent concedes by agreeing to provide some but not all of the relief sought in the claim form, or by taking steps to resolve the dispute in some other way, t
defaulthen the court is unlikely to make an inter partes order. Even if an opponent concedes by providing all the relief sought the court an inter partes order is not guaranteed, for example where the opponent asserts that the concession has resulted not from the
default existence of the claim but for some other reasons, for example action taken by a third party or a change in the law. In Freedom of Information Act response FOI/81225 MOJ acknowledged that it has no idea of the proportion of cases in which the Administrati
defaultve Court makes inter partes orders in cases where the court is asked to consider making such an order following the settlement of a judicial review claim.
defaultReason default6default: Offers of settlement on basis that there is no order for costsdefaultIt is common for public bodi
defaultes to offer to settle issued claims by offering to provide what the claimant wants but only on condition that there is no order for costs. The best interests of the client will be served by accepting such an offer. However, a funding system which not only 
defaultrequires legal representatives to work for free where claims fail, but also to work for free where claims succeed is unworkable.
defaultReason default7default: defaultPdefaultermission may be refused even if the claim hadefaultddefault very good merits when issueddefaultThe proposal incorrectly assumes that if
default permission is refused then the claim should never have been brought. However, permission is often refused even though the claim had merit when it was issued because the court decides that circumstances have changed so that the claim has become academic (e
default.g. as a result of the grant of interim relief) and/or it ceases to be arguable. 
defaultReason default8default: incorrect understanddefaulting defaultof when the court would refuse costs but nonetheless make an inter partes orderdefault defaultParagraph 3.75 misstates the position as to recovery of costs if a claim becomes academic.  
defaultIn particular, i
defaultt is 
defaultin
defaultaccurate to say that a costs order is based on whether “arguably the proceedings have brought abou
defaultt the making of the decision”. 
defaultThe test is 
defaultconsiderably mor
defaulte onerous and complex than this. The proposal has been developed
default 
defaulton the basis that claimants 
defaultroutinely recover their costs in this situation which is not the case.
defaultReason default9default: No justification for refusing to pay for cases reasonablydefault defaultbrought defaultand which achieve benefits for claimants defaultThere is a leap of logic and inherent unfairness in th
defaulte
default proposal. The Government recognises that 
defaulthundreds 
defaultof cases are reasonably brought and achieve benefits for claimants (including a large number of cases in whi
defaultch permission is refused), but states that fees in those cases should not be paid if permission is not granted as it is “
defaultnot appropriate
default” to retain funding for those cases. This is an unjustifiable restriction on access to justice for those claimants, and 
defaultno explanation is provided as to why payment is “
defaultnot appropriate
default”.  
defaultFurther, whilst we do not accept the premise underlying this proposal (in essence, that the Legal Aid Agency is incapable of assessing the merits of judicial review cases and has been 
defaultinappropriately funding significant numbers of weak judicial review claims), if the object is to ensure that suppliers are not paid for claims which should have not been brought then the rational and proportionate response would be
default 
defaultto refuse to pay for tho
defaultse claims where
default permission 
defaulthas been 
defaultrefused on the basis that the claim is “totally without merit”.
defaultReason default10default:default defaultManydefault public bodies do not set out fully the basis upon which permission is to be resisted until after the claim has been issueddefault 
defaultThe proposal inc
defaultorrectly assumes that suppliers can conduct an accurate assessment of the likelihood of permission being granted or refused at the protocol stage. In reality this is often not possible either because the case is so urgent that there is no time to go throug
defaulth the protocol, or because letters before claim are ignored, or because the basis for resisting permission is not set out fully until after the claim has been issued. Further, if this proposal is implemented one likely impact will be that some defendants w
defaultill ignore protocol letters or to provide only a cursory response, given that in those circumstances those in receipt of legal aid will find it very difficult to persuade their representatives to proceed with a claim given that the prospects of permission 
defaultbeing refused or of the claim having to be withdrawn will be very difficult to assess.
defaultReason default11default:default Comparison with Upper Tribunal immigration and asylum appeals misconceiveddefault: defaultAs to paragraph 3.70, a
default judicial review 
defaultclaim 
defaultis not 
defaultmaterially 
defaultcomparable with 
defaulta

defaultImmigration and As
defaultylum Upper Tribunal appeal. In such appeals the amount of work that needs to be carried out at risk is much more limited because the evidence gathering and refinement of the issues in dispute will already have taken place at first insta
defaultnce. In addition, in an appeal the decision-maker’s position 
defaultwill already have been fully set out; whereas in judicial review most public bodies do not set out fully the basis upon which permission is to be resisted until after the claim has been issued. 
defaultReason 1default2default: Proposal widefaultlldefault discourage settlement pre-issuedefaultAt present, m
defaultany claims are settled pre-issue efficiently and effectively with relatively low costs

defaultbecause if the claim settles post-issue but pre-permission, or if permission is refuse
defaultd, they will not be paid.
defaultReason 1default3default: Proposal will create perverse incentive to continue to litigate once claims are issueddefault defaultIn providing that work will not be paid for unless a positive permission 
defaultdecision is secured
default, the rational response of legal aid su
defaultppliers will be to pursue all claims to a permission decision and to challenge permission refusals given that in most cases this will be only way to secure payment for the work that has been carried out. 
defaultReason 1default4default: Increased burden on courtsdefaultThe proposal 
defaultif implemented will significantly increase the burden on the Administrative Court, primarily in three ways. First, the withdrawal of firms such as Deighton Pierce Glynn from the provision of legally aided representation to judicial review claimants will re
defaultsult in a significant increase of self-represented litigants, many of whom will be bringing claims without merit because they have been unable to secure advice. The additional time and resources needed to determine claims brought by self-represented claima
defaultnts is well understood by the judiciary if not by the MOJ. Second, at present the court is asked to determine whether an inter partes costs order should be made following the settlement of a claim in only a small proportion of case (215 cases in 2012: see 
defaultFOI/81225
default). The volume of cases in which the parties seek and challenge such determinations is likely to increase significantly if this proposal is implemented. Third, inevitably more claims will proceed to the point at which a permission decision is neede
defaultd, and because of the costs implications of a permission refusal more permission decisions will be subject to renewal and appeal.
default 
defaultNone of these
default 
defaultknock on 
defaultcosts implications 
defaultare mentioned in the consultation paper or appear to have been
default factored into 
defaultthe Sec
defaultretary of State’s decision to proceed with this
default proposal.
default 
defaultReason 1default5default: Increased burden on public bodiesdefault 
defaultThe 
defaultincrease in self-represented litigants, the increased incentive to secure 
defaultinter partes
default orders, and the increased incentive to proceed to and to con
defaulttest permission decisions will also place additional burdens on public bodies. Once these burdens and the burdens on courts are both factored in these proposals are unlikely to result in any financial savings.
defaultReason 1default6default: Consultation paper provides defaultinaccurate/incomplete information of the number of cases affecteddefaultWe explained why the statistics in the consultation paper appear to be inaccurate and requested accurate statistics in our 17 May 2013 email, along with clarification of the calculation of p

defaultthe 
defaultMOJ’s assessment of impacts. You should refer to 
defaultour
default email and t
defaulto PLP’
defaults
default FoIA request when considering this consultation response. One of our principal concerns is that MOJ provides incorrect information in the consultation paper about the number of claims issued in 2011-12. In doing so, MOJ provides consultees with seriously
default misleading information as to the number of cases that will be affected by these proposals and therefore the likely provider response and impact on legal aid users. 
defaultThere is also no analysis in the consultation paper as to how much money this proposal will
default save. As a result, we cannot comment in a meaningful way on whether the proposal (or any more rational alternatives) is justified in the circumstances.

default‘
defaultDo you agree with the proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases

defaultving ‘borderline’ prospects of success? Please give reasons.
default’
defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
defaultNo, we do not agree that legal aid should be removed from all cases assessed as having ‘borderline’ prospects of success.  Funding for borderline cases is crucial to allow difficult 
defaultareas of law to develop, particularly those affecting large numbers of vulnerable people whose rights are not already protected.
default&#xa0;
defaultDetailed points
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current arrangements only allow a very limited number of borderline cases to go ahead where the case has 
defaultsignificant wider public interest, is of overwhelming importance to the client or relates to a significant human rights breach; each of these concepts have specific definitions and thus funding on borderline cases is already very focussed and strictly cont
defaultrolled.  This system was established to recognise that there are a small number of claims that are so important they should be brought, even if the prospects of success are borderline;
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoreover, this small number of cases enables the law to develop to inc
defaultrease the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable, for example severely-disabled people who wish to 
defaultexercise their “right to die”, those detained abroad by British security services, and so on.  Withdrawing funding from these cases would prevent th
defaulte rights of the most vulnerable being tested – and extended – before the courts;
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are numerous cases in which the High Court and the Court of Appeal have found against a claimant, who then succeeds before the Supreme Court by a majority; by definitio
defaultn these could be classed as “borderline” but succeeded.  Such cases would no longer be funded if this proposal were to go ahead; and
default&#xa0;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe consultation document does not explain how much money this proposal will save.  It refers to the number of cases but d
defaultoes not provide any detail as to the costs incurred by the Legal Aid Fund, or how many succeeded and what benefits accrued to the claimants and others.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnnex K – Equalities impactdefault (consultation questions 34 to 35) in relation to the proposals under Q5 anddefault Q6default&#xa0;
defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Equalities Impact document that appears at Annex K of the consultation paper does not support the claim that the MoJ has had due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity or foster good relations, as 
defaultrequired by s.149 Equality Act 2010.  We therefore do not agree that MoJ has correctly identified the range of impacts, nor their extent, for the reasons set out below.
default&#xa0;
defaultDetailed points
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe inevitable discrimination (described as “disproportionate impact”
default at paragraph 4.4) that will be caused is apparently justified by the need to limit the cost of legal aid and to ensure public confidence in the legal aid system (see para 4.2).  In relation to the proposals concerning payment for permission stage work, bo
defaultrderline cases and the residence test, very little or no information has been provided as to how much money will be saved, nor has any information been provided as to the apparent lack of public confidence in the system, or how these proposals will restore
default confidence.  If the Government seeks to justify this disproportionate impact on the basis that these proposals represent a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, the evidence is missing to support this conclusion.  Thus, the rationale and just
defaultification behind the proposals is flawed and the public sector equality duty is not met;
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt paragraph 4.6 the document states that “for those proposals directly affecting the remuneration of providers, we do not consider that they are likely to have a dir
defaultect impact on clients” and that an adverse effect on service provision is unlikely.  There is no evidence referred to in the consultation paper to support these assertions.  It is self-evident that if providers are not paid, they will not bring cases; this
default will have a direct impact on clients (for example disabled people challenging community care decisions) and it will affect service provision as providers will stop bringing cases and some will go out of business;
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 5.4 of Annex K deals with the 
defaultpaying for permission work in JR cases proposal; this makes no mention of the obvious impact on disabled people if their representatives will not get paid for cases that settle pre-permission.  This section asserts that: “
defaultWhere a provider refuses to take a
default case on a legally aided basis, clients may choose to proceed privately and bear the financial risk of the application themselves
default.”  This is a bizarre suggestion; these are legally-aided clients who by definition have no money; they cannot pay their repres
defaultentatives, nor could they risk an adverse costs order; and
default&#xa0;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 5.5 of Annex K deals with the proposal for removing legal aid for borderline cases and states that this is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of saving money and ensuri
defaultng public confidence.  However, there is no analysis of the costs that will be saved, how this will increase public confidence, nor any consideration of the subject matter of the cases, what the outcome has been or the wider impact of such test case litiga
defaulttion succeeding.  Thus, again, the evidence is missing to support the assertion that this is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim; this breaches s.149 EA 2010 as “due regard” has not been had.
