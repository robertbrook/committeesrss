[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Deighton[bold] Pierce Glynn (LAI 0034)[bold]This document is submitted on behalf of Deighton
[normal] Pierce Glynn solicitors to address the Government’s proposals to transform legal aid
[normal], particularly on the issue of the residence test
[normal]. 
[normal]Deighton Pierce Glynn is a national law firm which is committed to using 
[normal]the law to enforce the rights of the disadvanta
[normal]ged of society, hold the state to account for its actions, challenge discrimination and fight human rights and environmental abuses.  
[normal]Residence test[bold]The government’s
[normal] belief that legal aid should be prioritised for those who have a sufficiently strong conn
[normal]ection to the UK
[normal] is erroneous and misconceived.
[normal] 
[normal]The real issue is that of the jurisdiction or reach of the law impacting upon a person’s life. 
[normal]The fact that a person may not be lawfully resident does not somehow diminish the gravity of the consequences for
[normal] that person if he or she is adversely affected by the actions of the UK State. 
[normal] 
[normal]The conformity of the law for those affected by it within the ambit of its jurisdiction was stated by Lord Scarman in R v SSHD ex.p Khawaja [1982] 1WLR 321 
[normal]              
[normal]67. ……Every pers
[normal]on within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws. There is 
[normal]              
[normal]no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is 
[normal]              
[normal]entitled to its protection….’ 
[normal]Whilst 
[normal]Khawaja’s
[normal] case concerned liberty it was the indivi
[normal]sible concept of those being within the jurisdiction of the English law being entitled to its protection that was in issue.  Further, it is not just the mere existence of the protection of the law which engages the rule of 
[normal]law 
[normal]but effective access to it; l
[normal]egal protection which is not accessible 
[normal]renders such protection meaningless
[normal]. 
[normal]The government is of the view that the exceptional fun
[normal]ding regime adequately provides
[normal] for those excluded 
[normal]by the residence test to apply for legal aid.  This 
[normal]is not correct becaus
[normal]e t
[normal]he bar to qualifying for exceptional funding has been set far too high
[normal] to render any potential access to funding by this route ineffective
[normal]. 
[normal]The exceptional funding guidance
[normal] 
[normal]states that, 
[normal]‘the overarching question to consider is whether the withholding of
[normal] legal aid would make the assertion of the claim practically impossible or lead to an obvious unfairness in proceedings.
[normal]’
[normal] This is a very high threshold.
[normal] The guidance 
[normal]positively discourages the grant of funding
[normal], does not adequately allow for urgent cases an
[normal]d excludes those with private and family life reasons (Article 8 ECHR) for needing to remain in the UK and seeking support. 
[normal]There is also a significant amount of non-funded work which would necessary making this process to be financially unsustainable ove
[normal]r time; this is because the rates of pay for publicly funded work mean that it is unsustainable to do much, if any, non-chargeable work. 
[normal]The effect of the test for exceptional funding is to create a two tier system for legal aid (a non-migrant service and
[normal] a migrant service) with the latter being much more difficult if not impossible to access.  This is obviously unfair where the legal issue requiring resolution is just the same with the adverse consequences even harsher for the migrant applicant. On its fa
[normal]ce such a system is 
[normal]discriminatory which is not jus
[normal]tified in all the circumstances.  T
[normal]here needs to be a heightened sense of fairness when dealing with vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied minors 
[normal]The residence test will 
[normal]require suppliers and the Legal 
[normal]Aid Agency to carefully assess applicants’ immigrations status. This is a time consuming and complicated task. The government has grossly underestimated the practical implication of implementing the residence test.  It applies
[normal] to 
[normal]everyone
[normal] with a civil lega
[normal]l aid case (save possibly those people with 
[normal]cases
[normal] of the kind that are listed under para
[normal]graph
[normal] 125 of Appendix B to Transforming Legal Aid Next steps). Most will pass it, provided they can prove past lawful residence (and there are problems for many) and ar
[normal]e physically present. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he scale of what
[normal] i
[normal]s involved in administering the test is immense. In 2012-13 alone there were:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]a.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]590410 Civil Legal Help funded acts of assistance; 
[normal]b.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]139,083 authorised acts of certificated representation.
[normal]See: 
[normal]http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/corporate-reports/legal-services-commission
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n this one year alone, each of these 729,483 acts of assistance would have 
[normal]needed to be preceded by a residence test administered by their solicitors, before any funding was available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Those that the residence test is proposed to exclude from access to legal aid are often extremely vulnerable and many are unable to leave the UK 
[normal]through no fault of their own. The proposal will leave them without a legal remedy when their fundamental human rights are at stake, undermining the rule of law in the UK, and the “access to a fair open justice system” referred to in the introduction to co
[normal]nsultation. Legal aid ensures access to basic legal entitlements to housing or subsistence. Without legal aid, many will be left street homeless and without sufficient food, including families, people fleeing domestic violence and people with physical or m
[normal]ental disabilities, breaching their fundamental human rights. There will be an increased burden on safety net public authorities such as the police, A and E departments and social services.  
[normal]It is a poor use of resources to transfer the duty of the state 
[normal]to cater for the needs of vulnerable litigants in person, who speak English as a second language, onto the courts. Similarly, the requirement for 
[normal]every
[normal] legal aid applicant to satisfy an immigration and residence test is disproportionate. Eligible applicant
[normal]s may not have the correct documents. Many legal aid suppliers do not have the skills to fairly apply such a test. The increased visibility of a migrant community which is street homeless because it cannot easily access social welfare provision risks damag
[normal]ing race relations. The proposals are open to challenge on discrimination grounds, particularly in relation to EU nationals.
[normal]Detailed points
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposed residence and immigration test does not necessarily identify the claimed objective or those with a 
[normal]strong connection to the UK. For example, a person may have been born in the UK and lived here all their life but not have leave to remain;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The measure proposed will have a disproportionate adverse effect on legal aid applicants with a strong connection t
[normal]o the UK by subjecting them to an unnecessary immigration and residence test. The client group in receipt of legal aid is primarily a vulnerable group. It 
[normal]includes: disabled people, people with mental health needs and learning disabilities, women leaving d
[normal]omestic violence or trafficking, and homeless families. It is inappropriate to subject those in this group, who are otherwise eligible for welfare and support services, to an immigration and residence test. They may be in urgent need of legal services but 
[normal]unable to produce the relevant documentation. As a result, essential legal aid advice and representation may be refused or delayed, causing extreme hardship;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Assessing immigration and residence issues is a specialist skill. The 
[normal]submissions of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA)
[normal] in relation to the c
[normal]omplexity of this are adopted and so not repeated here. An applicant may have lea
[normal]ve to remain even though it is not referred to in a document. Errors will be made, resulting in those who are entitled being excluded; 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As stated above, the issue of lawfulness of residence is complex. It may be the subject-matter of the case, requiring f
[normal]urther investigation in order to assess it. For example, a person may have been refused homelessness assistance, healthcare, community care, asylum support etc.  because they were treated as ineligible because of their immigration status. They need legal a
[normal]id to be able to get advice on whether those decisions were correct and to make appropriate challenges. These challenges often turn out to be successful at the end of the case. Who will decide whether the person is eligible for legal aid at the beginning o
[normal]f the case, when a lot of investigation needs to be carried out into the assessment of the person’s immigration status? The LAA? The ‘non-immigration’ specialist solicitor? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The applicant may not have leave to remain due to delay or error on the part of U
[normal]KBA. Legal aid may be needed to challenge these failures (see case study below);
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Those who are ineligible for legal aid under the new provisions are likely to be the most vulnerable people in society, including families with children. Some of them may be 
[normal]unable to leave the UK through no fault of their own, such as having an outstanding application with the Home Office; pregnancy; ill-health preventing air travel; or a lack of relevant documents;  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]g)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Applying the residence test to a recently arrived EU nati
[normal]onal who is in the UK exercising an EU Treaty such as the right to work or look for work will amount to discrimination under EU law, as between UK and EU nationals; 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]h)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposals exclude asylum seekers from the residence test, as well as those who have m
[normal]ade a fresh asylum claim. However, whether a fresh asylum claim in fact amounts to a fresh asylum claim, under para 353 of the Immigration Rules (the test referred to in the consultation document), is often contentious, and subject to litigation. If a pers
[normal]on is seeking to get legal aid in any area of law outside of asylum/immigration, e.g. housing, community care, family etc., it is unclear whether it will be sufficient for them simply to have submitted a fresh asylum claim to be eligible for legal aid, or 
[normal]whether this would have to be recorded as a fresh claim by the Home Office. If it is the former, will non-immigration solicitors need to make a decision about whether the fresh asylum claim meets the test in para 353, or will the submission of a fresh clai
[normal]m on its own be enough? If it is the latter, this is problematic 
[normal]because in general it can take the Home Office weeks, months and sometimes years to make an initial decision on whether a fresh asylum claim is a fresh asylum claim. Even then, this may be su
[normal]bject to successful litigation if it is wrongly not treated as a fresh asylum claim – with the result that people in urgent need of legal aid, for example to prevent homelessness, are denied access to this because of Home Office delay.
[normal] Further, the curren
[normal]t system operated by the Home Office for submitting fresh asylum claims means that there may be a delay of several weeks, sometimes a month or two, before an appointment is given for a fresh claim to be submitted. If a person is homeless, or refused other 
[normal]rights in the interim, s/he would not have access to legal aid to access rights they may have to services, and for example, would be destitute and homeless as a result of the proposals; 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If there is a dispute between the legal aid provider and the solicit
[normal]or about the eligibility of the client, will the solicitor get paid for challenging this decision if they turn out to be correct? (Currently there is no legal aid available for challenging decisions about funding once a certificate has ended.);
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]j)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The propos
[normal]als will result in considerable additional costs to local authorities. By way of illustration, this would include the extra costs to Social Services where the lack of advice or representation has resulted in families, pregnant women, or disabled people bei
[normal]ng evicted and/or being unable to access housing under s4 or s95 Immigration and Asylum Act 1999;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]k)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposals will result in additional costs to the NHS of migrants in need of A and E care due to street homelessness and lack of subsistence;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]l)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposa
[normal]ls will place increased costs and burdens on the civil court system, in dealing with litigants in person, many of whom may have English as a second language and a limited grasp of the process. This may result if delays for other applicants; and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]m)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A provisio
[normal]n which is this fundamental should be properly debated in Parliament and not introduced by way of delegated legislation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]General point
[normal]s
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Migrants who are here unlawfully are generally excluded from housing, 
[normal]welfare 
[normal]benefits, asylum support, community care
[normal] and healthcare
[normal],
[normal] by virtue of s115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and s54 and Sch 3 to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. On the whole, the people who are not excluded from these support services are unable to return to their country
[normal] for a variety of reasons
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This might be because
[normal] there is a pending immigration claim (non-asylum), 
[normal]they are 
[normal]not medically fit to travel due to ill health or pregnancy or
[normal] they are
[normal] waiting for travel documents to return to their country. So
[normal],
[normal] there are alrea
[normal]dy provisions in place to exclude unlawful migrants from support. The proposed reforms to legal aid will mean that people who are not excluded from the 
[normal]above services will not be able to have access to a solicitor if they are refused services
[normal] to
[normal] which they
[normal] would otherwise be entitled.
[normal] For example, a homeless family with an outstanding article 8 ECHR application, who would be eligible for accommodation from the social services department, would be unable to challenge a decision to refuse them accommodation, 
[normal]even though there was a duty in law to provide this; a person beaten up in police custody would be unable to get legal aid to seek redress through legal aid; a homeless applicant granted refugee status or other leave to remain within the last 12 months wou
[normal]ld not be able to get legal aid to challenge a local authority’s refusal to process his/her homeless application. The examples are endless, and can be applied in all areas of law. People will have rights to services, but will be unable to challenge an unla
[normal]wful refusal of those rights. The result will be that many vulnerable people will be without the support to which they are legally entitled. The state would be free to act with impunity against migrants, including those here lawfully but for less than 12 m
[normal]onths, making decisions it knows to be unlawful, knowing that the migrant has no access to legal aid to challenge these unlawful decisions. This is completely against the rule of law, a system which, so far, the citizens of the UK have been rightly proud o
[normal]f.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a firm specialising in migrant support, we deal with a huge number of cases where migrants, who would be excluded from legal aid should the reforms be implemented, are wrongly refused housing, 
[normal]welfare 
[normal]benefits, asylum support, community care and
[normal] healthcare. Very often we receive referrals of these cases by local and national advice charities who have been unable to secure these rights for the clients themselves. Generally, 
[normal]it is 
[normal]only after we send a letter before claim or issue proceedings 
[normal]that
[normal] t
[normal]he relevant support provided. This demonstrates that a solicitor is needed for this type of work, because clients and advice agencies are unable to achieve 
[normal]these outcomes
[normal] themselves. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case Studies[bold]&#xa0;[bold]W, a Guyanan[bold] man who came to the UK in 1965 is currently ready to leave a west London hospital, where he was admitted from street homelessness due to paranoid schizophrenia and physical disabilities.[bold] We have legal aid to challenge the social services’ decision not to 
[normal]support him; assuming we succeed, he will be able to be discharged from hospital where he is “bed-blocking”. He has not managed to access legal aid advice to regularise his immigration status because of the April 2013 exclusion of immigration advice from s
[normal]cope. 
[normal]Under the new regime he would not be entitled to assistance despite living in the UK for 58 years, resulting in ongoing costs to the NHS and/or a risk that he will be returned to the streets in a psychotic state with his zimmer frame.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]We acted for M[bold], a woman in her 30s with mental health needs who was street homeless.[bold] As a result, she was sleeping on buses and eating irregularly at drop-in centres. Her mother was seriously disabled and supported by social services. UKBA had decided to grant her leave
[normal] to remain 3 years earlier but failed to send her the documents. Without these documents she was unable to work or get social assistance to housing, social services or welfare benefits. We only discovered this decision had been made after by requesting a c
[normal]opy of her Home Office file. We then made formal complaints to UKBA and sent a series of letters which were ignored. Only after we eventually issued judicial review proceedings, both she and her mother were issued with immigration status documents granting
[normal] leave to remain. 
[normal]If we had not assisted her, it is likely she would eventually have been hospitalised.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]D had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and was in immigration detention but not receiving any medical treatment.[bold] He did not have leave to remain 
[normal]in the UK, but attempts to remove him since 2005 had failed, in part due to his mental condition. We were instructed by him but his mental health worsened  to the extent that he lacked mental capacity to give us instructions. The Official Solicitor then in
[normal]structed us on his behalf. The case was complicated and included an appeal to the Court of Appeal. We applied for judicial review. He was eventually released and the court made a finding that his rights under article 3 ECHR had been breached and his detent
[normal]ion was unlawful. 
[normal]Without legal aid we would not have been able to represent in such a high risk complex case and it is likely that D would remain in detention, with worsening mental health, at considerable cost to the tax-payer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]L had PTSD and depressio[bold]n after being tortured by a foreign government.[bold] He was held in detention under threat of removal to Ireland. His wife and school-age children were settled in the UK. He received immigration advice which resulted in him being granted leave to remain and rel
[normal]eased from detention. He was represented in a claim against UK government departments arguing they were complicit in his torture. This resulted in him receiving damages. 
[normal]Without legal aid, L would probably have been removed to Ireland, separated from his c
[normal]hildren and the important issues raised by his case in relation to torture would never have been addressed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]S is the 21 year old step-daughter of an EU national who fled her parents’ home because of physical abuse from her father, and stayed in a refuge[bold].
[normal] She was working part-time on a low wage and studying. Her application as a homeless person was wrongfully refused on the basis that she did not have a lawful right to reside in the UK. An Advice Agency helped her to request a review which was also refused
[normal]. We then assisted her to appeal to the County Court, making complex EU law  arguments until the council agreed to rehouse her. 
[normal]Without our assistance, she could have become street homeless and/or at risk of sexual exploitation to survive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]R is a Polish [bold]national who had very late stage breast cancer.[bold] She had been refused treatment for three months by the hospital, which had resulted in the tumour growing to the size of a football and her needing to have the open wound cleaned and dressed every few hours. 
[normal]Her and her partner had been working in the UK for over 6 years. In any event, she should not have been refused the treatment because the medical staff treating her had said she was unfit to travel due to the high risk of infection, but the hospital was re
[normal]fusing to budge. Only after threatening legal action did the hospital agree that R was lawfully entitled to the treatment, and this was then provided immediately. 
[normal]R might have died if she had not received timely advice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We acted for F in 2 applications f[bold]or judicial review of a decision of the CPS not to prosecute her ex-partner with rape and sexual offences.[bold]  F resides in Ireland with her 2 small children.  Both applications challenged the decisions of the CPS who had failed to protect F as a victim of se
[normal]xual abuse and prosecute her abuser.  The CPS in particular failed to follow their guidance and 
[normal]build a prosecution case and instead sought to identify a series of obstacles to it.  
[normal]The Lord Chief Justice granted our application, highlighting that this was
[normal] exactly the type of case where judicial review should be sought.  The CPS will now have to consider whether to charge F’s ex-partner with rape and other sexual offences.  
[normal]Without 
[normal]legal aid F, a victim of abuse, would not have been able to challenge the un
[normal]lawful decision of CPS or have that decision quashed 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mr R, Mr D and Mr Ra had each been detained in immigration centres for several years.[bold] They had applied to UKBA for a bail address but, in common with many other detainees, they had been waiting for many months for an address to be offered. Without a bail address they were unable to apply to the tribunal for bail. Despite our letters before
[normal] claim UKBA did not provide bail addresses. It was only after we applied for a judicial review that bail addresses were provided which enabled Mr R and Mr D to successfully apply for bail and secure release. At the final hearing of the JR the court ordered
[normal] that the Home Office policy on bail addresses was unlawful in that detainees who were considered “high risk” and therefore not suitable for the usual type of bail accommodation, and who were therefore waiting for bail addresses for very long periods, were
[normal] not being notified that they had been so classified and were being given no opportunity to respond. As a result of the judgement, the Home Office was required to amend the procedure so that it operates fairly. 
[normal]Without legal aid, Mr R, Mr D and Mr Ra would
[normal] have been unable to challenge the unlawful Home Office policy and would have been unable to make an application for bail. Mr R and Mr D, would have been unlawfully detained for even longer than they were. Others in the same position have benefited from th
[normal]e judgement with the improvements in the Home Office policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]M suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and was in immigration detention for 5 years 5 months[bold]. He is from Zimbabwe. Throughout much, if not all, of his detention the Home Office was unable to effe
[normal]ct returns to Zimbabwe and so, there was no lawful basis to detain M. Further, UKBA had not kept to its policy of not detaining those with mental illness save in very exceptional circumstances. M was not released until we started a judicial review and the 
[normal]High Court ordered bail. The Home Office has since agreed to pay significant damages. 
[normal]LA, a single man in his 60s, is from the Caribbean.[bold]&#xa0;[bold] He came to the UK a few years ago to join his partner, but they split up.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal] He is destitute, deaf, mute, illiterate a
[normal]nd does not know sign language.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He has been looked after by a family friend for the last couple of years, who has fed and accommodated him, but she cannot do so any longer because she is a local authority foster carer and therefore cannot have him living 
[normal]there any longer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He agreed to voluntarily return to his country of origin, but before flights could be arranged he fell gravely ill and was hospitalised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He has been diagnosed with inoperable kidney cancer which has spread to the lung, and because of hi
[normal]s immigration status he has been denied life-extending chemotherapy unless he pays a deposit of £50,000.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He is medically unfit to fly, however, so he cannot leave the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The hospital wants to discharge him but he has nowhere to go; his immigration statu
[normal]s means he is not entitled to housing or social security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The local authority social services department refuses to assist.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Without our help to challenge the local authority he cannot be discharged, so he will block a bed, and every day will cost the hos
[normal]pital more than it costs to pay us to secure his safe discharge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Without our help treatment he will become progressively sicker, and will require emergency intensive care within weeks, which cannot be withheld pending payment and which will cost as much i
[normal]f not more than the chemotherapy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Without treatment he is expected to die within months.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Under the new proposals he will not be entitled to legal aid because of the new residence criteria, and will thus cost the taxpayer many times more than it would cos
[normal]t to provide legal aid to address these issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]K was a torture survivor from Iran who had recently been granted refugee status. [bold]He suffered from very severe mental health problems due to his torture experiences. After he was granted refugee status his H
[normal]ome Office accommodation was withdrawn because he was no longer an asylum seeker. 
[normal]He became homeless. He approached the local authority to make a homeless application, but he was turned away, without any decision, and continued to be street homeless. This 
[normal]was completely unlawful, as a local authority must provide accommodation to a homeless applicant pending a written decision, but this happens frequently. Only after his solicitors sent a letter before claim threatening judicial review did the local authori
[normal]ty agree to provide K with accommodation pending a decision on his homeless application. His application was eventually allowed, because it was accepted that he was ‘in priority need’ – a high threshold to pass. K would not have got legal aid under the ref
[normal]orms as he did not have his leave to remain for at least twelve months. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]M was a heavily pregnant woman who was homeless.[bold] Her asylum claim had been refused and she had submitted a fresh claim. This had not yet been recorded by the Home Office, and it ther
[normal]efore appears from the consultation document that she would not be eligible for legal aid until the fresh claim had been recorded as such. She was eligible for accommodation from the Home Office under s4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. However, the
[normal]re had been a substantial delay in the Home Office processing her application for s4 accommodation, even though the Home Office was aware of the delay and with a national charity advocating for her. Only after we sent a letter to the Home Office threatenin
[normal]g court action was she immediately provided with accommodation. Under the reforms she would not have been eligible for legal aid. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P was a single parent who had been in the UK for ten years.[bold] She had an article 8 ECHR application outstanding with the UKBA 
[normal]for over four years. Her and her children were homeless. She approached the local authority for assistance. They told her that if she wanted accommodation for her children they would remove her children and put them into care, but would not support them as
[normal] a family. This happens a lot, in order to make parents stop asking for assistance that they are entitled to under s17 of the Children Act 1989. Only after her solicitors sent a letter before claim to the Social Services Department was accommodation provid
[normal]ed to the client. She was subsequently granted leave to remain in the UK by the Home Office. If the legal aid proposals come in someone in her circumstances would not get legal aid. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C was a refused asylum seeker[bold] who had a child, born before the asylum cl
[normal]aim was refused. This meant that for asylum support purposes she was still eligible for support under s95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 – as she continued to be treated as an asylum seeker. However, the Home Office and the Asylum Support Tribunal 
[normal]wrongly decided that she was no longer entitled to asylum support. Only after her solicitors threatened judicial review did the Home Office reconsider their decision and reinstate her s95 support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q was an Iranian refused asylum seeker.[bold] He was willing to return to Iran but did not have a passport and the embassy in London had closed. Therefore it was not possible for him to return, despite him taking all steps open to him, including signing up with the voluntary returns scheme. In such c
[normal]ircumstances, a refused asylum seeker would be entitled to accommodation under s4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. However, the Home Office and the Asylum Support Tribunal wrongly decided that he was not taking all the steps he could to return to Ir
[normal]an and refused him support, leaving him destitute. Only after his solicitors sent a letter threatening legal action did the Home Office accept that in fact he was taking all the steps he could and provided him with accommodation, ending his destitution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P was a single parent. She did not have leave to remain in the UK under domestic law, and her children were British.[bold] The family were homeless and the local authority refused to provide any accommodation, either from the Housing Department or the Social Ser
[normal]vices Department. At that time, domestic law treated her as not having a right to reside in the UK, although her solicitors argued that the law was being interpreted wrongly. By the end of her case, some 18 months later, the government accepted that the la
[normal]w was not being interpreted correctly and that she did have a right of residence right from the outset when she asked for help with accommodation. This was a tricky case about the immigration status of the client. Because of the uncertainty over her immigr
[normal]ation status she would have been refused legal aid and her and her children would have been homeless, even though it was eventually accepted by all concerned that she was eligible for accommodation from the local authority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]government’s equality impa
[normal]ct assessment (EIA)
[normal] is completely inadequate. It does not  reference the statistics, which the LAA collects for gender, race and disability status of legal aid applicants and consider the impact of the proposals on this group but simply makes a vague compa
[normal]rison between British and 
[normal]non-British
[normal] nationals. This is a test which will also require British nationals to produce evidence of lawful residence etc. and there is no consideration of how the test will impact on protected groups within that category, e.g. 
[normal]if they have a cognitive impairment or are not British by origin. In relation to justification, there is no evidence either as to the impact or as to what the costs-saving is.  Nor is there any evidence or consideration of potential additional costs e.g. t
[normal]o providers/the LAA in conducting the test, or to other public bodies. 
[normal]In relati
[normal]on to mitigation
[normal], we would propose there should be an exemption from the test for protected groups, or where urgent legal aid is needed e.g. to apply for an injunction as part
[normal] of a judicial review to enable a woman fleeing domestic violence and her children to access emergency housing. Exceptional funding is not an adequate form of mitigation since there is no funding to apply for it, and it delays the process. Finally, there i
[normal]s no detail on how ECHR or EU requirement will be met, so the consultation does not allow respondents to assess or consider this issue.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Paying for permission work in judicial review cases[bold]The government asked at Q5 of 
[normal]its
[normal] consultation document ‘do you agr
[normal]ee with the proposal that providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for judicial review, including a request for reconsideration of the application at a hearing, the renewal hearing, or an onward permission appeal to the Court of
[normal] Appeal, if permission is granted by the Court (but that reasonable disbursements are paid in any event)?  Please give reasons.’
[normal]Summary
[normal]No, we do not agree with this proposal.  
[normal]Reason 1: Clients will be unable to secure legally-aided representation even [bold]for strong cases[bold] [bold]The impact assessment acknowledge
[normal]s
[normal] that MOJ has 
[normal]put forward
[normal] this proposal 
[normal](
[normal]and the Secretary of State has announced 
[normal]on the Today programme
[normal] his
[normal] 
[normal]intention to implement it)
[normal] without knowing what the impact will be. MOJ states that the impact 
[normal]will depend on the supplier response. We agree.
[normal] 
[normal]Deighton Pierce Glynn is one of the largest, most successful and highly-regarded solicitors firms conducting judicial review cases for claimants
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]high proportion of the judicial review claims we bring are f
[normal]unded by legal aid. 
[normal]We have costed the impact of this proposal. Our clear conclusion is that it will render our legally-aided judicial review work unviable. In particular, because of the risk that even in strong cases in which successful outcomes are secur
[normal]ed the work we carry out will go unpaid (see reasons 2 to 7 below). Therefore our response will be to cease to represent members of the public seeking to bring judicial review claims who cannot afford to pay us. The availability of CFAs does not ameliorate
[normal] the access to justice impacts of this proposal in any way given the failure to implement Jackson’s LJ’s proposal for qualified one-way costs shifting in judicial review and because in judicial review an inter partes order does not necessarily follow even 
[normal]if the client secures a successful outcome. In light of this, it is clear to us that the proposal will unlawfully restrict access to justice and legally aided representation. It is also appears that the proposal has been prompted by complaints by Ministers
[normal] in other departments about their decision-making being subject to judicial scrutiny. The proposals represent a serious and unjustified attack on the rule of law.
[normal]Reason 2: [bold]R[bold]emoving legal aid for claims which are not issued is not sustainable [bold]Paragraph 3.
[normal]71 of the consultation paper is ambiguous making an informed response difficult
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]MOJ has ignored a
[normal]n
[normal] email sent by this firm on 17 May 2013 seeking clarification. 
[normal]I
[normal]t appears that w
[normal]hat
[normal] is proposed is that if a claim is not issued then it will only be the
[normal] work conducted under the Legal Help scheme or under Investigative Representation funding that will be paid for. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]If so, t
[normal]hat is very problematic because of the need to carry out a
[normal] significant amount of work between the point at which a pre-action protoco
[normal]l response is received or ought to have been supplied (at which point the Legal Help or Investigative Representation funding will cease) and the point at which the claim is issued 
[normal]- 
[normal]work 
[normal]that is 
[normal]funded 
[normal]by 
[normal]Full Representation. 
[normal]A significant amount of work i
[normal]s necessary because
[normal] judicial review work is heavily front-loaded
[normal];
[normal] so
[normal], for example, 
[normal]all the evidence 
[normal]a
[normal] claimant rel
[normal]ies
[normal] upon must be prepared before 
[normal]a 
[normal]claim is issued, along with detailed grounds and an indexed bundle.
[normal] 
[normal]The effect of the MOJ’s proposal would 
[normal]appear to be that all of this work will go unpaid if the claim is never issued
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The effect of this will be very significant not least given that t
[normal]here is no scope for costs to be recovered on an inter partes basis 
[normal]if
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]judicial review claim
[normal] is never issued
[normal]. 
[normal]The most common reason why some or all of this work may be carried out but 
[normal]a
[normal] claim is never issued is that the claim is belatedly conceded
[normal];
[normal] for example
[normal],
[normal] where a need for interim relief and/or a potential delay problem has required the claimant to press o
[normal]n with the preparation of the claim before a protocol response has been supplied, or where an opponent changes the position communicated in a protocol response because new information has come to light or as a result of action by a third party. The other c
[normal]ommon reason is why some or all of this work may be carried out but the claim is never issued
[normal] is
[normal] that when carrying out the post-protocol pre-issue work a previously unidentified weakness in the proposed claim is identified. At present
[normal],
[normal] such claims are lik
[normal]ely to be abandoned; whereas this proposal 
[normal]will create a strong incentive for legal representatives to press on and issue the claim in any event in the hope that permission is granted, given that the abandonment of the claim will result in all the
[normal] post-pro
[normal]tocol pre-issue work
[normal] going unpaid.
[normal]Reason 3: the proposal will affect the amount and quality of the work carried out post-protocol pre-issue[bold]One impact of the uncertainty as to whether legal aid suppliers will be paid for post-protocol pre-issue preparator
[normal]y work is that they will cut corners of this work to limit the risk to which they are exposed to. This will have knock on detrimental effects on clients who will have less well prepared claims and be less likely to succeed as a result. These detrimental ef
[normal]fects will be felt most acutely by categories of clients with personal characteristics which will tend to require greater amounts of preparatory work, for example children, clients with mobility or sensory disabilities, clients with learning disabilities, 
[normal]the mentally ill, and those with limited English. This will also have knock on detrimental effects on courts and public bodies who will be faced with more poorly prepared judicial review claims, claims which require significantly more time and resources to
[normal] deal with. 
[normal]Reason [bold]4[bold]: Claims which are issued but withdrawn pre-permission are not weak cases which have little effect[bold]MOJ proposes
[normal] non-payment 
[normal]not only 
[normal]in cases where permission is 
[normal]refused
[normal], 
[normal]but also
[normal] non-payment in any 
[normal]issued 
[normal]case which 
[normal]is withdrawn befor
[normal]e the court makes a permission decision. Such an approach does not meet the MOJ’s purported objective of reducing weak claims. The main reason why significant numbers of claims are withdrawn post-issue but pre-permission is that they are strong cases which
[normal] have forced concessions from the defendant. There will also be many claims which were strong claims when the claim was issued, but in which there has been a change of circumstances which has meant that the claim is no longer necessary and/or viable. 
[normal]Reas[bold]on [bold]5[bold]: [bold]T[bold]he limited scope for inter partes costs recovery when claims[bold] [bold]are issued b[bold]ut[bold] withdrawn pre-permission[bold] [bold]The reasoning at paragraph 3.76 of the consultation paper ignores the limited scope for inter partes
[normal] costs recovery when judicial review claims are issued but then withdrawn pre-permission. If an opponent concedes by agreeing to provide some but not all of the relief sought in the claim form, or by taking steps to resolve the dispute in some other way, t
[normal]hen the court is unlikely to make an inter partes order. Even if an opponent concedes by providing all the relief sought the court an inter partes order is not guaranteed, for example where the opponent asserts that the concession has resulted not from the
[normal] existence of the claim but for some other reasons, for example action taken by a third party or a change in the law. In Freedom of Information Act response FOI/81225 MOJ acknowledged that it has no idea of the proportion of cases in which the Administrati
[normal]ve Court makes inter partes orders in cases where the court is asked to consider making such an order following the settlement of a judicial review claim.
[normal]Reason [bold]6[bold]: Offers of settlement on basis that there is no order for costs[bold]It is common for public bodi
[normal]es to offer to settle issued claims by offering to provide what the claimant wants but only on condition that there is no order for costs. The best interests of the client will be served by accepting such an offer. However, a funding system which not only 
[normal]requires legal representatives to work for free where claims fail, but also to work for free where claims succeed is unworkable.
[normal]Reason [bold]7[bold]: [bold]P[bold]ermission may be refused even if the claim ha[bold]d[bold] very good merits when issued[bold]The proposal incorrectly assumes that if
[normal] permission is refused then the claim should never have been brought. However, permission is often refused even though the claim had merit when it was issued because the court decides that circumstances have changed so that the claim has become academic (e
[normal].g. as a result of the grant of interim relief) and/or it ceases to be arguable. 
[normal]Reason [bold]8[bold]: incorrect understand[bold]ing [bold]of when the court would refuse costs but nonetheless make an inter partes order[bold] [bold]Paragraph 3.75 misstates the position as to recovery of costs if a claim becomes academic.  
[normal]In particular, i
[normal]t is 
[normal]in
[normal]accurate to say that a costs order is based on whether “arguably the proceedings have brought abou
[normal]t the making of the decision”. 
[normal]The test is 
[normal]considerably mor
[normal]e onerous and complex than this. The proposal has been developed
[normal] 
[normal]on the basis that claimants 
[normal]routinely recover their costs in this situation which is not the case.
[normal]Reason [bold]9[bold]: No justification for refusing to pay for cases reasonably[bold] [bold]brought [bold]and which achieve benefits for claimants [bold]There is a leap of logic and inherent unfairness in th
[normal]e
[normal] proposal. The Government recognises that 
[normal]hundreds 
[normal]of cases are reasonably brought and achieve benefits for claimants (including a large number of cases in whi
[normal]ch permission is refused), but states that fees in those cases should not be paid if permission is not granted as it is “
[normal]not appropriate
[normal]” to retain funding for those cases. This is an unjustifiable restriction on access to justice for those claimants, and 
[normal]no explanation is provided as to why payment is “
[normal]not appropriate
[normal]”.  
[normal]Further, whilst we do not accept the premise underlying this proposal (in essence, that the Legal Aid Agency is incapable of assessing the merits of judicial review cases and has been 
[normal]inappropriately funding significant numbers of weak judicial review claims), if the object is to ensure that suppliers are not paid for claims which should have not been brought then the rational and proportionate response would be
[normal] 
[normal]to refuse to pay for tho
[normal]se claims where
[normal] permission 
[normal]has been 
[normal]refused on the basis that the claim is “totally without merit”.
[normal]Reason [bold]10[bold]:[bold] [bold]Many[bold] public bodies do not set out fully the basis upon which permission is to be resisted until after the claim has been issued[bold] 
[normal]The proposal inc
[normal]orrectly assumes that suppliers can conduct an accurate assessment of the likelihood of permission being granted or refused at the protocol stage. In reality this is often not possible either because the case is so urgent that there is no time to go throug
[normal]h the protocol, or because letters before claim are ignored, or because the basis for resisting permission is not set out fully until after the claim has been issued. Further, if this proposal is implemented one likely impact will be that some defendants w
[normal]ill ignore protocol letters or to provide only a cursory response, given that in those circumstances those in receipt of legal aid will find it very difficult to persuade their representatives to proceed with a claim given that the prospects of permission 
[normal]being refused or of the claim having to be withdrawn will be very difficult to assess.
[normal]Reason [bold]11[bold]:[bold] Comparison with Upper Tribunal immigration and asylum appeals misconceived[bold]: [bold]As to paragraph 3.70, a
[normal] judicial review 
[normal]claim 
[normal]is not 
[normal]materially 
[normal]comparable with 
[normal]a
[normal]n 
[normal]Immigration and As
[normal]ylum Upper Tribunal appeal. In such appeals the amount of work that needs to be carried out at risk is much more limited because the evidence gathering and refinement of the issues in dispute will already have taken place at first insta
[normal]nce. In addition, in an appeal the decision-maker’s position 
[normal]will already have been fully set out; whereas in judicial review most public bodies do not set out fully the basis upon which permission is to be resisted until after the claim has been issued. 
[normal]Reason 1[bold]2[bold]: Proposal wi[bold]ll[bold] discourage settlement pre-issue[bold]At present, m
[normal]any claims are settled pre-issue efficiently and effectively with relatively low costs
[normal] for both parties and with claimants 
[normal]receiving a benefit 
[normal]they could not otherwise access.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his cost-effective means of checking unlawful behaviour by public bodies would disappear if 
[normal]public 
[normal]bodies 
[normal]kno
[normal]w 
[normal]that 
[normal]claimants
[normal]’ representatives will be
[normal] 
[normal]reluctant to
[normal] issue 
[normal]because if the claim settles post-issue but pre-permission, or if permission is refuse
[normal]d, they will not be paid.
[normal]Reason 1[bold]3[bold]: Proposal will create perverse incentive to continue to litigate once claims are issued[bold] [bold]In providing that work will not be paid for unless a positive permission 
[normal]decision is secured
[normal], the rational response of legal aid su
[normal]ppliers will be to pursue all claims to a permission decision and to challenge permission refusals given that in most cases this will be only way to secure payment for the work that has been carried out. 
[normal]Reason 1[bold]4[bold]: Increased burden on courts[bold]The proposal 
[normal]if implemented will significantly increase the burden on the Administrative Court, primarily in three ways. First, the withdrawal of firms such as Deighton Pierce Glynn from the provision of legally aided representation to judicial review claimants will re
[normal]sult in a significant increase of self-represented litigants, many of whom will be bringing claims without merit because they have been unable to secure advice. The additional time and resources needed to determine claims brought by self-represented claima
[normal]nts is well understood by the judiciary if not by the MOJ. Second, at present the court is asked to determine whether an inter partes costs order should be made following the settlement of a claim in only a small proportion of case (215 cases in 2012: see 
[normal]FOI/81225
[normal]). The volume of cases in which the parties seek and challenge such determinations is likely to increase significantly if this proposal is implemented. Third, inevitably more claims will proceed to the point at which a permission decision is neede
[normal]d, and because of the costs implications of a permission refusal more permission decisions will be subject to renewal and appeal.
[normal] 
[normal]None of these
[normal] 
[normal]knock on 
[normal]costs implications 
[normal]are mentioned in the consultation paper or appear to have been
[normal] factored into 
[normal]the Sec
[normal]retary of State’s decision to proceed with this
[normal] proposal.
[normal] 
[normal]Reason 1[bold]5[bold]: Increased burden on public bodies[bold] 
[normal]The 
[normal]increase in self-represented litigants, the increased incentive to secure 
[normal]inter partes
[normal] orders, and the increased incentive to proceed to and to con
[normal]test permission decisions will also place additional burdens on public bodies. Once these burdens and the burdens on courts are both factored in these proposals are unlikely to result in any financial savings.
[normal]Reason 1[bold]6[bold]: Consultation paper provides [bold]inaccurate/incomplete information of the number of cases affected[bold]We explained why the statistics in the consultation paper appear to be inaccurate and requested accurate statistics in our 17 May 2013 email, along with clarification of the calculation of p
[normal]rojected savings. We have also liaised with the Public Law Project
[normal] (PLP)
[normal] and have been waiting for a response 
[normal]to their request 
[normal]of 
[normal]30 April 2013 Freedom of Information Act request to be published. 
[normal]However, n
[normal]either our email nor PLP’s FoIA request has been r
[normal]esponded to. As a result
[normal],
[normal] we have been left with insufficient information to provide a properly informed response about the likely impacts of this proposal and about the accuracy of 
[normal]the 
[normal]MOJ’s assessment of impacts. You should refer to 
[normal]our
[normal] email and t
[normal]o PLP’
[normal]s
[normal] FoIA request when considering this consultation response. One of our principal concerns is that MOJ provides incorrect information in the consultation paper about the number of claims issued in 2011-12. In doing so, MOJ provides consultees with seriously
[normal] misleading information as to the number of cases that will be affected by these proposals and therefore the likely provider response and impact on legal aid users. 
[normal]There is also no analysis in the consultation paper as to how much money this proposal will
[normal] save. As a result, we cannot comment in a meaningful way on whether the proposal (or any more rational alternatives) is justified in the circumstances.
[normal]Reason 1[bold]7[bold]: Effect on most vulnerable will be particular pronounced[bold]The proposal 
[normal]will have a 
[normal]greater
[normal] imp
[normal]act in areas of law 
[normal]in which 
[normal]public bodies routinely fail to meet their statutory duties, but make concessions after issue
[normal] but
[normal] before permission is granted, for example community care
[normal] in which a very high proportion of clients come from protected groups
[normal]. T
[normal]h
[normal]e
[normal] proposal 
[normal]will 
[normal]make th
[normal]e
[normal]se areas of 
[normal]public law no go areas for solicitors and create very significant access to justice problems for clients
[normal].
[normal] Despite this, we note that the consultation paper contains no analysis of impact by area of law, so as to establi
[normal]sh which areas of law and therefore which client groups are likely to be most seriously affected by this proposal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Borderline cases[bold]At 
[normal]Q6
[normal] the question was asked
[normal]. 
[normal]‘
[normal]Do you agree with the proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases
[normal] 
[normal]assessed as ha
[normal]ving ‘borderline’ prospects of success? Please give reasons.
[normal]’
[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]No, we do not agree that legal aid should be removed from all cases assessed as having ‘borderline’ prospects of success.  Funding for borderline cases is crucial to allow difficult 
[normal]areas of law to develop, particularly those affecting large numbers of vulnerable people whose rights are not already protected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Detailed points
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The current arrangements only allow a very limited number of borderline cases to go ahead where the case has 
[normal]significant wider public interest, is of overwhelming importance to the client or relates to a significant human rights breach; each of these concepts have specific definitions and thus funding on borderline cases is already very focussed and strictly cont
[normal]rolled.  This system was established to recognise that there are a small number of claims that are so important they should be brought, even if the prospects of success are borderline;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Moreover, this small number of cases enables the law to develop to inc
[normal]rease the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable, for example severely-disabled people who wish to 
[normal]exercise their “right to die”, those detained abroad by British security services, and so on.  Withdrawing funding from these cases would prevent th
[normal]e rights of the most vulnerable being tested – and extended – before the courts;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are numerous cases in which the High Court and the Court of Appeal have found against a claimant, who then succeeds before the Supreme Court by a majority; by definitio
[normal]n these could be classed as “borderline” but succeeded.  Such cases would no longer be funded if this proposal were to go ahead; and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The consultation document does not explain how much money this proposal will save.  It refers to the number of cases but d
[normal]oes not provide any detail as to the costs incurred by the Legal Aid Fund, or how many succeeded and what benefits accrued to the claimants and others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex K – Equalities impact[bold] (consultation questions 34 to 35) in relation to the proposals under Q5 and[bold] Q6[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Equalities Impact document that appears at Annex K of the consultation paper does not support the claim that the MoJ has had due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity or foster good relations, as 
[normal]required by s.149 Equality Act 2010.  We therefore do not agree that MoJ has correctly identified the range of impacts, nor their extent, for the reasons set out below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Detailed points
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The inevitable discrimination (described as “disproportionate impact”
[normal] at paragraph 4.4) that will be caused is apparently justified by the need to limit the cost of legal aid and to ensure public confidence in the legal aid system (see para 4.2).  In relation to the proposals concerning payment for permission stage work, bo
[normal]rderline cases and the residence test, very little or no information has been provided as to how much money will be saved, nor has any information been provided as to the apparent lack of public confidence in the system, or how these proposals will restore
[normal] confidence.  If the Government seeks to justify this disproportionate impact on the basis that these proposals represent a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, the evidence is missing to support this conclusion.  Thus, the rationale and just
[normal]ification behind the proposals is flawed and the public sector equality duty is not met;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At paragraph 4.6 the document states that “for those proposals directly affecting the remuneration of providers, we do not consider that they are likely to have a dir
[normal]ect impact on clients” and that an adverse effect on service provision is unlikely.  There is no evidence referred to in the consultation paper to support these assertions.  It is self-evident that if providers are not paid, they will not bring cases; this
[normal] will have a direct impact on clients (for example disabled people challenging community care decisions) and it will affect service provision as providers will stop bringing cases and some will go out of business;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Section 5.4 of Annex K deals with the 
[normal]paying for permission work in JR cases proposal; this makes no mention of the obvious impact on disabled people if their representatives will not get paid for cases that settle pre-permission.  This section asserts that: “
[normal]Where a provider refuses to take a
[normal] case on a legally aided basis, clients may choose to proceed privately and bear the financial risk of the application themselves
[normal].”  This is a bizarre suggestion; these are legally-aided clients who by definition have no money; they cannot pay their repres
[normal]entatives, nor could they risk an adverse costs order; and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Section 5.5 of Annex K deals with the proposal for removing legal aid for borderline cases and states that this is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of saving money and ensuri
[normal]ng public confidence.  However, there is no analysis of the costs that will be saved, how this will increase public confidence, nor any consideration of the subject matter of the cases, what the outcome has been or the wider impact of such test case litiga
[normal]tion succeeding.  Thus, again, the evidence is missing to support the assertion that this is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim; this breaches s.149 EA 2010 as “due regard” has not been had.
