[[[Written evidence from NASS]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Background to Briefing Note]]]&#xa0;NASS, the only national umbrella body for special schools outside Local Authority control, is delighted that the Education Committee is undertaking an inquiry into residential children’s homes. NASS is a national membership organisation for Independent and Non-Maintained Special Schools.  We have over 220 members – almost 50% of these are registered as children’s homes. &#xa0;As you may recall, Claire Dorer, Chief Executive of NASS, gave evidence to the Education Committee as part of their inquiry. However, since then the Government has published its response to the consultation on residential care reform and NASS would like to highlight a couple of concerns we have with the proposed reforms ahead of your session with Children’s Minister Edward Timpson MP. NASS would like to put on record that we would have preferred the Government to have waited until the Education Committee’s inquiry was concluded before publishing their response.

[[[New homes in safe areas]]]&#xa0;The Government have confirmed plans to change regulations so that new homes will only open in “safe” areas, run by competent providers and ensuring homes already open in less safe areas evidence that they can keep children safe, or face closure. We would like to put on record that regulations can be valuable in setting “absolutes” which must be followed. However, they are crude instruments in effecting long-lasting cultural change. Change in the residential child care system will not occur through regulation alone and specifically not regulation which largely focuses on the responsibilities of homes themselves&#xa0;We would like to stress that residential child care is a complex system where factors beyond what goes on in the homes have a significant impact on the sector. For example, because of the high cost of property, new homes will be more likely to locate in relatively cheaper areas and some areas, especially in London, will struggle to attract new providers. Risk assessing an area offers something in some circumstances but covers one dimension in a wider issue. Currently no children's home can feel safe secure and cared for because of the many pressures, especially those concerning finance and regulation, that are being applied to them. &#xa0;We would question the practicalities of this proposal and specifically how Local Authorities will determine that placements are in “safe” areas? We would also like to raise the issue that if a previously safe area is identified as now being potentially unsafe, what is reasonable action to take? A very small home might feasibly consider relocation. However, a 120 place school, additionally registered as a children’s home, with a 100 year plus history, land, buildings and upwards of 300 staff could not move. Whilst it could be potentially useful to better understand your area, it is not likely that it is within an individual home’s ability to be able to mitigate against all identified risks. It is unclear whether this would be considered an acceptable position or if the home would be considered as negligent.

[[[Out of area placements]]]&#xa0;Under proposals by the Government only senior council officials in charge of children’s services will be able to place children out of area and only when they judge it to be the right decision for a child to be moved away from their home area.&#xa0;Though this proposal has good intentions, we fear that it will add another layer of bureaucracy which could mitigate against young people receiving their entitlements.  Local Authorities need to have robust regimes for the identification, assessment, planning, delivery, monitoring and evaluation and to be able to justify them in Ofsted Inspections.  This measure will do nothing to attend to the development of strategic commission that should deliver the right placement at the right time for the right child.  We are already encountering unintended consequences from thinking that prioritises local placement. We need local, regional and national to be firmly delivering safety, choice and specialism. Out of area placements may be well justified. The pressure on Local Authorities to place within their own boundaries can act counter to meeting the needs of a young person.
