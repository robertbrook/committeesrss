[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary of our responses to the Select Committee’s Questions]]]&#xa0;We hope that the submission above provides sufficiently clear responses to the main questions posed in the Select Committee’s Call for Evidence, but for avoidance of doubt we respond briefly to them below.      &#xa0;

[[[What would be the best institutional arrangements for determining the format and style of the debates? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]As we suggest above, we consider the existing arrangements for determining the form and style of the debates are appropriate and fit for purpose.  &#xa0;

[[[More broadly, how can we ensure that the public interest is the primary concern in determining any administrative matters on topics such as: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Who should take part?  And on what basis? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]This should be a matter for the broadcasters to determine, having regard to the requirements of due impartiality and fairness imposed by their respective regulatory Codes and Editorial Standards.   &#xa0;

[[[How many debates should there be? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]This should be a matter for the broadcasters to determine, with appropriate  consultation with the participants.  But the starting point should be the 2010 debates, as a template of what proved to be a successful series of debates.    &#xa0;

[[[When and where should each of the debates be held, not least taking into account the potential need for different debates at the UK-wide level and at the level of the nations? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]This is a matter for the relevant broadcasters (including the Channel 3 broadcasters for Scotland and Northern Ireland as regards the nation level debates) and the relevant participants to determine.&#xa0;

[[[What should their format be? ]]]&#xa0;This is a matter for the broadcasters to determine, with appropriate consultation with the participants.  But the starting point should be the 2010 debates, as a template of what proved to be a successful series of debates.  Revisions to the format should be for the broadcasters and participants to agree, subject to the requirements of fairness and due impartiality.&#xa0;

[[[In what ways does the interaction between existing broadcast regulation, case law, and the potential for judicial review set the parameters for decisions relating to each of these topics? ]]]&#xa0;See paragraphs above.  &#xa0;

[[[What is the appropriate level of openness and transparency in which these questions should be addressed? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]See paragraphs above

[[[. ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Are such matters best left to the broadcasters and political parties to determine? ]]]Yes. &#xa0;

[[[If so, how can it be guaranteed that the public interest plays a decisive role in their negotiations? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]See paragraphs above. &#xa0;

[[[Would such a body ie a debates commission represent the best way of ensuring the public interest is paramount in such matters? ]]]&#xa0;No. &#xa0;

[[[What would be the arguments for the establishment of such a body? ]]]&#xa0;None are evident to us. &#xa0;

[[[What would be the arguments against the establishment of such a body?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]See paragraphs above

[[[. ]]]&#xa0;

[[[How should a new independent body be established? ]]]&#xa0;See above as to why we are not in favour of such a body.  &#xa0;

[[[How could it ensure that the relevant broadcasters and political parties would participate and to do so according to its rules and guidance?]]]&#xa0;We do not consider it is appropriate for any body to seek to enforce the participation of political parties in television programming.  It is a matter for them.    &#xa0;

[[[What principles should guide the body responsible for this system in determining its view on some of the thorny questions it would face e.g. which political parties should participate? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is a matter for the broadcasters to decide which political parties should be invited to participate, both in the debate itself, and in any related programming.  Any party that felt itself unreasonably excluded can complain to the relevant regulator, and thereafter to the courts.       &#xa0;

[[[What relationship should the new body have, if any, with the Electoral Commission? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We see no rationale for involvement in this process by the Electoral Commission. &#xa0;

[[[On any one of these questions, what lessons can the UK learn from other democracies with an established tradition of election debates eg. Australia, Canada, Sweden, Norway, USA etc?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Given the very different traditions of broadcast regulation of these other territories, we take the view that there are relatively limited lessons to be drawn.     &#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
