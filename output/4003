defaultWitness:
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault, Director of Markets, Financial Conduct Authority, gave evidence.
defaultChair:default Good morning and thank you for agreeing to answer our questions today.
default 
defaultWe know who you are but, just for voice transcription purposes, if you could, just introduce yourself.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Of course, Chairman.
default 
defaultGood morning
default, m
defaulty name is David Lawton
default and 
defaultI am the Director of Markets at the Financial Conduct Authority.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thanks very much.
default 
defaultA couple of fairly general questions to open 
defaultwith.
default 
defaultC
defaultan you explain to the Committee the difference between headquartering and listing?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: A company that is headquartered in the 
defaultUK
default typically would be formed under the UK Companies Act.
default 
defaultThat is a piece of legislation that deals with 
defaulta
default company’s constitution and how it operates.
default L
defaultisting is a generic term; we might get on to talking about some of the 
defaultnuances of what it means a bit later
default, but e
defaultssentially it is 
defaultabout
default access to capital markets.
default 
defaultPeople typically talk about “a UK
default&#x2011;
defaultlisted
default company” as being a company that has access to capital markets via being traded on a 
defaultUK
default exchange.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How significant would you say the LSE is compared with other listing platforms?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It is by far the dominant 
defaultUK
default listed platform.
default 
defaultThere are four exchanges that, under the FCA’s rules, are able to operate a listed market, and the LSE accounts for the vast majority of listed securities that are traded.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What makes it so dominant, do you think?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It is partly a question of history
default: h
defaultistorically, it was the only 
defaultUK
default market for trading securities and therefore has benefited from that legacy of history.
default 
defaultSecondly, the nature of markets is that liquidity begets liquidity
default—
defaultthey are network
default&#x2011;
defaulttype
default arrangements
default—and i
defaultssuers and investors are attracted to marketplaces where there is market depth.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What does a company have to do to be listed here in 
defaultLondon
default, on the FTSE and the AIM?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Th
defaultis
default might be a moment just to describe a little bit more carefully what “listed” means.
default 
defaultStrictly speaking, the Official List is a list of securities that meet certain criteria set by us.
default 
defaultSeparately, exchanges offer marketplaces for the trading of securities.
default 
defaultAs we have talked about already, the LSE offers the largest market for the trading of listed securities.
default 
defaultAIM is a junior market operated by the LSE and, in fact, is for unlisted securities, so securities that are traded on AIM are not on the Official List. 
default In order to be listed, an issuer would have to take a number of steps.
default 
defaultThe first is, typically, it would have to appoint some advisers to work with it to prepare it to go through the process.
default 
defaultIf an issuer wanted to be on the premium segment of the Official List—I can talk a bit more about what that means in due course—it would also have to appoint a sponsor, typically an investment bank, to co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinate the process. It would have to produce a prospectus, which sets out details about the company, its business plan, its revenue expectations and so on, in order to provide investors with all the information that they need to make an informed assessment about the pricing of the security, and then it would need to apply to us for admission to the List and satisfy the admission criteria.
default 
defaultIn parallel, it would also need to apply to an exchange to be admitted to trading.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just going back to your comments about AIM, if it is not listed—forgive my layman’s ignorance on this—how can its shares be traded?
default How would
default would-be investors know how to trade with them or know that they are there to be traded?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Exchanges offer different types of market.
default 
defaultThere are the listed markets that we have talked about, which obviously have strong symbiosis with the Official List that we run but, under European legislation exchanges are also able to operate junior markets in unlisted but still transferrable securities.
default 
defaultIt is the nature of the securities that makes them 
defaulttradeable
default, but they are not on our Official List.
defaultChair:default I still do not understand from what you have said how somebody knows that they can trade that company’s stock.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: AIM has its own rules that govern the admission of securities to that market, and there are rules for issuers as well as for the trading.
default 
defaultThe structure of those rules actually more broadly mirrors the structure of the listing regime, but the details are set by the London Stock Exchange.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Good morning, Mr Lawton.
default 
defaultI would like to ask you a couple of factual questions regarding the listing of ENRC.
default 
defaultI am not going to ask you about the investigation currently under way, because obviously that would be improper, but it would be helpful for this Committee to have a number of factual questions answered.
default 
defaultCould you confirm who was the sponsor for ENRC when they were listed?
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I am afraid I do not have that information to hand, but it will have had a sponsor.
default 
defaultI can certainly let the Committee know.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default You can confirm that.
default 
defaultThank you very much.
default 
defaultCan you confirm whether it is your intention at the FCA to review the process of how this company was listed, given the nature of the allegations that are currently before it?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: We have had an extensive dialogue with investors and other market participants over the last couple of years looking at the lessons that we can learn from the experiences of a number of companies admitted to the List.
default 
defaultWe have published a package of policy proposals to change the regime to strengthen in particular the protections offered to minority shareholders, including: requiring companies that have a controlling shareholder to have a separate vote of the minority shareholders for the independent directors; requiring such companies to enter into a shareholder agreement with the major shareholders, with sanctions if it is not properly kept; and changing the rules for delisting a company.
default 
defaultI would say that we have already reviewed that process and proposed a package, which we put out for consultation three or four weeks ago, to strengthen the regime in those respects.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default On the issue of delisting, can you tell the Committee today why ENRC was allowed to delist, given it is under a Serious Fraud Office investigation at the moment?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The shareholders voted for a delisting
default.
default There is no connection between the ability of the SFO to pursue its enquiries and whether or not a company is on the list.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default You have no powers currently to in any way stop that company going through that process during an investigation.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The shareholders have voted to accept the deal that is on the table, which included delisting, and the SFO investigation is separate from that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Could you, just for the purposes of today, confirm if your proposals on delisting, which you have just referred to, would change that situation in any way?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: 
defaultTo be clear, t
defaulthe current requirement is that 75% of the shareholders vote in favour of a proposal to delist.
default 
defaultOur proposal is that the minority shareholders, as a class, also 
defaulthave to vote in favour.
default 
defaultAs it happens, with the vote in respect of ENRC, the minority shareholders as a class did vote in favour of a delisting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default The proposals would not affect this particular situation occurring.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It would give the minority shareholders as a class a separate say.
default 
defaultAs it happened in relation to this particular vote, the minority shareholders as a class did vote in favour of the delisting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I wish to follow on 
defaulton
default the purchase of ENRC and its listing.
default 
defaultENRC listed in December 2007 and immediately went into the FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100.
default 
defaultJust three months earlier, auditors Herbert Smith compiled a report on the company detailing what appears to have been systematic fraud.
default 
defaultDid you see that report?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I am afraid I cannot confirm—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ134 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I would like you to confirm it, Mr Lawton.
default 
defaultYou will write to us and confirm it or otherwise.
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Of course.
default 
defaultWhat I meant, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultBinley, is I am not aware whether we did or not, but I will certainly confirm.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ135 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You are not aware of it—an issue of that importance?
default 
defaultSomebody comes in, goes straight into the FTSE on your say
default-
defaultso, and you were not aware that, three months before, a serious report was written questioning their operating systems in terms of fraudulent behaviour.
default 
defaultYou were not aware of that?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: In order to become a premium listed company, companies have to comply with our admission criteria, which include confirmation from the sponsor that a company meets our rules and, on a forward
default&#x2011;
defaultlooking basis, is capable of meeting the rules.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ136 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You are saying, Mr Lawton, that if a respected auditor had made a report three months before this company was listed, you would take no notice of that report.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: No, I am not saying that.
default 
defaultIt is an important feature of our regime that companies that are listed are not doing so in a way that enables the 
defaultUK
default financial system to be used for a purpose connected to financial crime.
default 
defaultIt is one of our statutory objectives to make sure that that does not happen.
default 
defaultAll that type of information needs to be assessed, both by the FCA and by the sponsor, to make sure that a company applying for admission to the Official List, particularly a premium listed company, meets those criteria.
default 
defaultWhat I am just saying specifically in relation to your question, and I certainly will of course confirm for the Committee, is that I am afraid I am not aware of the Herbert Smith report personally.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You are the protector of the probity of our Stock Exchange, are you not?
default 
defaultThat is your role.
default 
defaultYou protect investors from companies that would use our structures to defraud people.
default 
defaultRight?
default 
defaultThat is your prime role.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Absolutely
default, it is certainly—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Thank you; that is okay.
default 
defaultYet you missed this important report and allowed this to go ahead without question, did you not?
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I will come back to the Committee about whether or not we—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I believe you did, so let us proceed on this basis.
default 
defaultIf that is the case, would you be desperately sorry about that?
default 
defaultWould you apologise for it?
default 
defaultWould you think that you had not done your job?
default 
defaultWould you even consider resigning in view of the fact that these people got through your net?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: At this point in relation to the SFO questions, that is still a matter that is under investigation at this stage.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Letting them on to the List is not a matter that is still under investigation.
default 
defaultYou took a step to agree to their listing, did you not?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It was certainly the case—
defaultMr Binley:default You took that step.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Knowing what you know now, do you not have one scintilla of concern for people who might have invested in this company to their detriment?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It is certainly the case—
defaultMr Binley:default It is a very simple question
default.
default It is either yes or no.
default 
defaultChair:default Can you just let him answer?
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It is certainly the case that it is important investors have confidence in the integrity of the marketplace.
default 
defaultIt is also the case that there is nothing in the FCA regime that ensures that investors never see the value of their investments fall.
default Ultimately, investors have to make—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I did not say that.
default 
defaultThat is not what I said.
default 
defaultI said “protect investors from wrongdoing”, and it appears that we are seeing considerable wrongdoing and you did not do your job, did you, Mr Lawton?
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: In relation to the SFO investigation, we will have to wait and see how that concludes.
default 
defaultIn relation to the admission to the List, in relation to your direct question, it certainly was the case that the FCA, confirmed by attestation from sponsors, felt that this company met the admission criteria.
defaultChair:default We are going to talk about the issue of sponsors in one moment.
default 
defaultCan I bring in Ann 
defaultMcKechin
default on broader issues?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Just on one final point: when you confirm to us the name of the sponsor, can you provide us, given that this company is now delisted, with a copy of the report that the sponsors provided to you in relation to that company?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: If that is something that I can do, I will certainly satisfy the Committee on that.
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default I think it will be very important to the Committee to examine that report.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I just need to make sure that there are no confidentiality concerns about that but, subject to that, yes, of course.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ144 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Thank you, Mr Lawton.
default 
defaultThat is very helpful.
default 
defaultCan I just go on to more general questions?
default 
defaultYou mentioned in your written evidence that mineral companies have slightly modified admission criteria
default—i
defaultn fact, considerably less than for companies that are not in this sector.
default 
defaultCould you run through why there are different premium criteria for these companies?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes indeed.
default 
defaultIt is largely due to the technical nature of the industry.
default 
defaultIt is certainly not the case that the different criteria imply a lesser standard.
default 
defaultFor the premium listed company, a normal company would need to have what is called a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear track record, in other words be able to demonstrate three years of ongoing business
default,
default properly audited.
default 
defaultIn relation to mineral companies, the thing that investors particularly focus on is an independent expert’s report on the reserves and mineral assets that they have access to, so that takes the place of the three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear track record.
default 
defaultThe other criterion that applies to a normal company is that you have to have control of the business.
default 
defaultIn relation to the mineral sector, a typical business practice might be to have co
default&#x2011;
defaultinvestments
default or production
default&#x2011;
defaultsharing
default arrangements.
default 
defaultTherefore, for that type of company, we do not insist that you have control of your business, but we simply insist that you have a range of such investments.
default 
defaultThose two differences really just reflect the technical nature of the minerals sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ145 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Is the report from the sponsor any different for a mineral company from what it would be for a non
default&#x2011;
defaultmineral
default company?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ146 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default If you are entering into co
default&#x2011;
defaultpartnership with other partners as alliances, surely that might necessitate further investigation and a more thorough investigation to ensure that the company’s activities are such that they are not going to bring the listing into disrepute.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: There are two important steps in relation to this admission process.
default 
defaultThe first is that the prospectus that we talked about earlier clearly has to disclose all the relevant information about the company and its investment prospects, including the details of any production
default&#x2011;
defaultsharing
default arrangements and so on.
default 
defaultRegarding the sponsor’s due diligence, when I said that the sponsor’s report is the same, the attestations that they make and the questions they answer are the same but, of course, in relation to a particular company’s circumstances, the amount of due diligence and the areas that need to be probed in order to be able to reach those attestations may be different.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ147 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default The sponsor is presumably paid a fee to carry out the due diligence and essentially vouch for a company.
default 
defaultHow do you tackle the inevitable conflict of interest if the investment company is also in effect an agent for the company concerned?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Sponsors really have two sets of responsibilities.
default 
defaultUnder our regime, they are supervised by us and authorised by us to perform the sponsor activity, and we do quite a lot of supervision of the sponsor activity in relation to those firms.
default 
defaultWhere we feel that the sponsor is not acting in accordance with what we want, then we have the ability to take action including discipline.
default 
defaultThe second responsibility is the one that you have just mentioned, which is facing off to the issuer.
default 
defaultSponsors have that dual responsibility.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Has any company faced discipline?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Have any companies been barred from being sponsors?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The new Financial Services and Markets Act, which came into effect in April of this year, has strengthened our ability to both restrict the range of areas where a sponsor could offer services, if we felt that was necessary, but also to suspend a sponsor’s activity and ultimately take them off the list.
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Which you had not had previously.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Which we did not have previously; that is right.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Have you considered the argument for insisting that sponsors be independent from the applicant companies themselves, particularly if much of their activity is actually 
defaultoutwith
default the 
defaultUK
default, so it is not within a jurisdiction 
defaultin
default which it would be easy for you to find out all the relevant evidence?
default 
defaultThis is a concern about mineral companies where a lot of their activity is not within the 
defaultUK
default jurisdiction.
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Having a sponsor based in the 
defaultUK
default actually is of real benefit in that circumstance because, on a day-to-day basis, most of our dialogue in relation to an issuer actually in fact is with the sponsor.
default 
defaultHaving a sponsor firm that has a close relationship with the issuer that it is representing is actually helpful for us in terms of ensuring that the issuer complies with the regime.
default 
defaultRegarding the financing aspect, which you have talked about, a sponsor does need to be paid somehow, and having the issuer pay for it would be no different from having the issuer pay for the audit.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Can I just ask what legal liability the sponsor has for the veracity of the listing particulars and the details that they publish?
default 
defaultAre they legally liable for telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: They are certainly liable to us under our regimes.
default 
defaultIn other words, as I was mentioning a few moments ago, if sponsor confirmations turn out to have been inaccurate or produced in a sloppy way, that would bring them under the purview of our discipline.
default 
defaultI must admit I do not know whether they are able to be pursued through the courts by a third party.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ152 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default There is also the question not only of accuracy but of inclusivity— including all the facts rather than just stating some which are true.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes
default.
default The main document that issuers use to come to market is the prospectus.
default 
defaultThe directors of the company take responsibility for the prospectus and they are liable for its contents.
default 
defaultIf there is something that is misleading in a prospectus, then third parties do have the ability to take the directors to court for redress in that respect.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Mr Lawton, there was an intriguing remark in your written evidence.
default 
defaultYou said, “Our review of an application for listing focuses on ensuring the applicant meets the admission criteria and is therefore eligible for listing.
default 
defaultWe do not consider whether it is suitable for listing.”
default 
defaultI think most people would find that rather surprising, so why not?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Those two terms are perhaps terms of art in the listing space.
default 
defaultWhat I am trying to say there is that the criteria for admission to the List are objective and objectively verifiable.
default 
defaultWhat we are not doing is making any comment on a company’s business model.
default 
defaultFor example, if an issuer came to us saying, “We’re a widget
default&#x2011;
defaultmaker
default,” we make no comments on whether widget
default&#x2011;
defaultmaking
default is a good business to be in, nor are we making any comment, as we were saying in response to Mr Binley, about whether this is an investment that will make money for investors.
default 
defaultThe focus of our regime is to ensure that issuers make accurate disclosures about themselves in order to enable investors to take a view about whether they want to consider it as an investable proposition.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default At present, no one actually makes that decision about whether they are suitable for listing in the sense that you have interpreted it.
default 
defaultYou make that decision about eligibility and that is it; once you have done it, they are on the List.
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default What checks are you making against what criteria?
default 
defaultYou talked about objective criteria but, in terms of additional information that may be available about a company or allegations that have been made about a company and its practices, which may not strictly fall within a financial prospectus, what other investigations would you normally make?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The objective criteria are the ones we have touched on a little bit already
default, so f
defaultor a premium listed company, a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear track record, 12 months’ working capital and so on, and appointing a sponsor.
default 
defaultMore broadly, at the point of admission—again this comes back to what we were talking about with Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultBinley—we would want to investigate whether a company’s listing, particularly in relation to financial crime, would serve the purpose of 
defaultus
defaulting the 
defaultUK
default financial system for financial crime.
default 
defaultThat is in our statutory objectives and that does entail us doing some broader analysis of the company.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Presumably, as you said, you are in close contact with company sponsors.
default 
defaultIf someone made an allegation about a dodgy deal a company may have done a few years ago, for example
default,
default presumably you would be in contact with the sponsor about whether or not that allegation could be satisfactorily answered, if it was in the public domain.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: That is typically the sort of detailed conversation we would get into.
default 
defaultIn the context of the structure of our regime, sponsors have a critical role in selecting and promoting, or sponsoring—that is where the word comes from—companies for admission to 
defaultthe List.
default 
defaultIt is clearly an important part of their job and their reputation going forward that they bring companies to the List that they feel comfortable satisfy the criteria.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Just one very quick final question: you mentioned that your new rules allow you to suspend and discipline sponsors of companies have only come into force with effect from this April.
default 
defaultDoes this affect sponsor reports that were submitted prior to that date?
default 
defaultDoes it apply retrospectively or does it only apply to new listings from April?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It would only apply to sponsor activities since April, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could you just make clear if there have been any examples where you have said that an applicant company does meet all the criteria from a financial point of view and then the listing authorities turn them down?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: We do have that power in practice.
defaultChair:default No, I am asking if it has happened.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It has happened but, in practice, what tends to happen is that applicants withdraw before we make a final determination.
default 
defaultWhen they take a view that we are likely to turn that application down, typically they withdraw their application.
defaultChair:default I am talking about you accepting their application or saying that it meets the appropriate criteria, but the 
defaultUK
default listing authority then deciding to turn it down.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: In that circumstance, we would say it had not met the criteria, so actually the two questions are the same question.
default 
defaultGoing back to what we talked about, if people are particularly interested, for example, in this concern about financial crime, a statutory objective of ours i
defaults
default to protect and enhance the integrity of the 
defaultUK
default financial system.
default 
defaultThe legislation defines that in part as taking into account the use of the financial system to further financial crime, so that becomes part of our overall assessment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I understand that it is normal for a company being listed to have over 25% of its shares available for the open market.
default 
defaultNow, in some cases, including ENRC, they have been listed without having that requirement.
default 
defaultCan you explain why an exception was made for companies like this?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The basic rule is that there need to be sufficient shares in public hands for there to be a liquid secondary market, so that the trading of the shares subsequently works on a satisfactory basis.
default 
defaultThe European listing legislation sets 25% as the basic indicator of sufficient liquidity in the secondary market, but it does give us the ability to have a lower threshold where we are satisfied that there are sufficient shares in public hands for there to be sufficient liquidity.
default 
defaultIn a small number of cases with very large companies, we have assessed that that liquidity criterion would be satisfied with free floats of somewhat less than 25%.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The logic of what you have just said would seem to imply that, if a company is of a certain size, there are likely to be enough shares on the free market not to apply that 25% criterion.
default 
defaultIs that a rough and ready rule?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes, but it only happens relatively rarely.
default 
defaultAnother aspect to think about is that, for very large companies coming to market for the first time, there can often be a 
defaultcapacity question.
default 
defaultThe market can only absorb a certain amount of new capital raising at any one point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I am confused, Mr Lawton, and I need your help, because your stated aim is to protect the shareholders from companies that use “corrupt or unethical methods”.
default 
defaultThat is so, is it not?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It is certainly the case that a key part of our objective to protect and enhance the market integrity of the 
defaultUK
default financial system has to take into account its use for financial crime.
defaultMr Binley:default One of the stated aims of the FCA is, and I will 
defaultsay
default it again, to protect shareholders from companies that use “corrupt and unethical methods”.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: There is a distinction between financial crime—we have been talking about some aspects of that—and broader questions about how companies act and behave.
default 
defaultFor example, we are essentially a capital markets regulator in performing this function.
default 
defaultWe are not a broader regulator of companies.
default 
defaultCompanies’ interaction with, say, competition law, tax law or employment rules lies outside the capital markets regime.
default 
defaultThey are quite properly matters for other authorities.
default 
defaultIf by “unethical”, you meant issues in relation to those sorts of things—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I am using your words, not my words.
default 
defaultI wonder what your words mean when you say that the shareholders need to be protected, and it is your aim, from companies that use “corrupt or unethical methods”.
default 
defaultThe
defaults
defaulte are your words, not my words.
default 
defaultMay I go on to give you some further words?
default 
defaultYou also say in your submission to this body, “We are not the agency best placed to address concerns which ultimately amount to, for example, suspected fraud or corruption.”
default 
defaultIn the case of ENRC, they were right under your nose.
default 
defaultAn auditor had produced the report.
default 
defaultI just wonder at what level you see your role as protecting shareholders from, and I repeat again, “corrupt or unethical methods”.
default 
defaultWhat do you do to protect the shareholder from those corrupt or unethical methods?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The authority that is charged with pursuing allegations of fraud or corruption in the 
defaultUK
default is the Serious Fraud Office.
default 
defaultIt is not the FCA.
default 
defaultClearly, if we had found or were to find, in the course of our work, information that suggested something that the SFO would need to investigate, we would hand it over to the SFO.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Let me get this straight.
default 
defaultIt is not really your aim to protect shareholders from companies that use corrupt or unethical methods but, if occasionally something drifts across your desk, you might or might not take action.
default 
defaultIs that a fair summing
default&#x2011;
defaultup of where you see your position?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: No.
default 
defaultI would see our position as being to protect and enhance the integrity of the 
defaultUK
default’s financial system.
default 
defaultThat means taking steps to ensure that it is not used to further purposes that are related to financial crime.
default 
defaultIn relation to shareholder protection, our key goal is to ensure that companies disclose the appropriate information about their activities to ensure that investors have the information that they need to form a view about the prospects for that company and, secondly, in our broader oversight of financial market trading, to make sure that the trading of those companies’ securities happens in a fair and orderly way.
defaultMr Binley: defaultJust one final one.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Brian, I need to come in with another one in the context of this.
default 
defaultI think you have had a fair whack.
default Mr Lawton, h
defaultow can you respond to Professor Franks of the 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultBusiness
default 
defaultSchool
default, who is reported as saying that the 
defaultUK
default is “too liberal about welcoming companies from countries with less transparency” and that you have “too much faith that companies would be transformed through a 
defaultLondon
default listing”?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I would say two things in response to the Professor’s comments.
default 
defaultThe first is that the 
defaultUK
default regime makes no distinction, in terms of its rules, between companies depending on where they come from.
default 
defaultIn other words, we apply a similar regime to all.
default 
defaultThe premium listing regime has significant standards over and above the European minimum.
default 
defaultWe are already setting standards over and above other European marketplaces.
default 
defaultSecondly, I would say, and it is plain in relation to the package that we have consulted on in terms of strengthening minority shareholder rights, that there are some areas where the regime does need to be strengthened, taking account of the experience of the last three or four years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you agree from those comments that you should be tightening up the free float rules?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The free float is a red herring when it comes to these concerns about shareholder protections, and we have been debating this quite extensively with investors.
default 
defaultMinority shareholders would be minority shareholders with a free float of 25%, 30% or 40%.
default 
defaultIt is about the protections that they enjoy, whatever the free float, in those circumstances where the controlling shareholder particularly might be taking actions that might be to their disadvantage.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default Mr Lawton, in your submission you went into some detail about the size of the extractive sector in terms of the companies that are listed in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultAcross the board, more and more companies appear to be listing here
default.
default Why do you think that is, from the perspective of the listing authority?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Actually, the number of listed companies has been on a slight decline over the last 10
default&#xa0;
defaultyears or so, but I think the nature of markets, particularly capital markets, is such that people seek out deep and broad capital markets.
default 
defaultIn particular, companies coming to market are attracted to locations that not only have capital but also have a range of advisory and analytical services to assist them to come to market.
default 
defaultThat has been built up in the 
defaultUK
default over a long period of time.
default 
defaultWe are clearly not the only financial centre with those sorts of strengths, but they do tend to build on one another over time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default You talk also in your submission about a “commodities super
default&#x2011;
defaultcycle
default”.
default 
defaultCan you explain what that concept is, please?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: That just means, if you look over the last 10 years or so, there has been a big upswing in the prices of commodities, so oil, metals and so on, partly related to the growth of emerging markets like 
defaultChina
default.
default 
defaultThat means that companies in the extractive sector have grown in value.
default 
defaultAs part of that, some of them have wanted to come and tap public capital markets.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ168 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default Obviously many extractive companies are very large and very complex in their structure.
default 
defaultCan you explain a little bit more about how a company can be listed in more than one country at the same time?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Typically, a company will list in its home market but, if it wants to broaden the base of investors that have an opportunity to invest in it and perhaps seek a larger pool of capital, it might seek to list in another location.
default 
defaultThat is a trend that is less prevalent these days, because it is now a bit easier for investors to invest in markets elsewhere than their home market.
default 
defaultThe number of companies with multiple listings is shrinking, but there is no regulatory barrier to that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ169 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default If a company is listed in several jurisdictions, 
defaultby
default whose rules do they have to abide?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: They would have to satisfy the capital markets rules in each jurisdiction in which they access capital markets, so all of them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ170 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default If the rules differ or go off in different directions, would they abide differently in different countries?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Yes.
default 
defaultTypically, the rules would not be conflicting; they would be in layers.
default 
defaultA company, as a matter of practice, would satisfy the capital markets rules of the most stringent jurisdiction.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ171 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default Quickly, because I know you have already touched on this, could you just outline what the difference is between a primary and a secondary listing, please?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Secondary listing was the term that we used to use when companies wanted a second listing, i.e. non
default&#x2011;
defaultUK companies.
default 
defaultWe changed the regime about five years or so ago and opened up that category to 
defaultUK
default companies and renamed it standard listing.
default 
defaultA standard listing is one that embodies the European legislative criteria in relation to prospectuses, disclosures and so on.
default 
defaultA premium listing adds some additional requirements on top of that.
default 
defaultFor the issuer, there is a need to have a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear track record, to be able to say that you have enough working capital to survive at least 12
default&#xa0;
defaultmonths of activity, and you also have to appoint a sponsor.
default 
defaultOn an ongoing basis, a premium
default&#x2011;
defaultlisted
default issuer also has to offer shareholders additional rights to have votes over important transactions such as major acquisitions or transactions with related parties.
defaultChair:default Can I bring in Brian Binley now?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ172 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Again, Mr Chairman
default.
default You must be getting really fed up with me, Mr Lawton.
default 
defaultIs it fair to say that the role of the regulator carries with it greater promise than the regulator is able to fulfil?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: In relation to capital markets, it is important to recognise that there are a number of other actors on the stage.
default 
defaultWe have talked about company law; we have not talked about but I will mention the Financial Reporting Council, which are the owners of the 
defaultUK
default’s corporate governance code.
default 
defaultWe also have a Takeover Panel, which deals with takeovers.
default 
defaultThe FCA is a capital markets regulator, but it is not the only capital markets regulator.
default 
defaultIn that sense, sometimes people talk to us about issues that actually are more 
defaultin
default the purview of these other actors.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ173 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I thought it might be helpful for you to get that on the record.
default Let us
default proceed
default. 
defaultCan I ask how much it costs to list a company on the FTSE or AIM?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I will come back to what I said earlier.
default 
defaultAIM is an unlisted market.
default 
defaultFTSE is an index, so actually “FTSE
default&#x2011;
defaultlisted
default company” is not a term that exists.
default 
defaultIn order to be a company on the Official List, we would charge a fee.
default 
defaultThe maximum fee we would charge for the largest and most complex listings is £50,000.
default 
defaultMost transactions are less than that.
default 
defaultThe bulk of an issuer’s cost
defaults
default 
defaultin 
defaultcoming to market 
defaultis 
defaultreally around preparing the prospectus and marketing itself and its securities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ174 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Would you be surprised or were you surprised to learn that a company had said that “complying with the conditions for its 
defaultLondon
default listing exceeded £200
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion”?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The process of preparing the documents is an expensive process.
default 
defaultThere is a lot of material that a company has to disclose to the marketplace in order to have access to the market.
default 
defaultAs we talked about earlier, the directors take responsibility for a prospectus, so, if you were a director, you would of course want to make sure that it was prepared with the appropriate diligence, and that does require assistance from a range of advisers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ175 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Is there anything that you can do to lessen that?
default 
defaultI am forever wanting to lessen costs on business, because I think that the bureaucratic cost on business is unproductive.
default 
defaultIs there any way you can lessen that cost, with your other colleagues who are regulators too?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: From a regulatory point of view, the thing to focus on is what it is you are requiring companies to prepare and disclose.
default 
defaultThe things that are required to be prepared and disclosed have been built up through policy development and legislation over many years.
default 
defaultMost of them are now hard
default&#x2011;
defaultwired into European legislation.
default 
defaultEuropean legislation does typically provide streamlined requirements for smaller and medium
default&#x2011;
defaultsized
default enterprises.
default 
defaultThat is always something that is a debate in policy
default-
defaultmaking circles.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ176 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You said that “Reducing the burden of legislation without careful consideration will not necessarily make a financial centre more attractive”.
default 
defaultThat seems to me to be saying two things at the same time.
default 
defaultWhat did you actually mean by that?
default 
defaultGive us an example of what you meant.
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Let us go back to the listings regime.
default 
defaultWe have talked about the fact that, on the Official List, there 
defaulta
defaultre two categories.
default 
defaultThere is a standard category, which is aligned to the basic European legislation and, therefore, is very similar to what you would find applies in other European jurisdictions; but we have taken, in consultation with an agreement with the market participants over a period of time, the decision to have a premium category over and above the standard category, which imposes additional requirements.
default 
defaultThat would be an example of where the marketplace itself—issuers, investors and advisers—have said, “Here is a market segment for which we want to have additional regulatory criteria, because we think that would be of benefit.”
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Can we finish with Robin Walker on corporate governance?
defaultQ177 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I wanted to come on to the EITI and the 
defaultUK
default joining up to that, specifically the comment that creating a “publicly available register of the beneficial owners of the corporate entity” is required under the EITI.
default 
defaultWhat do you feel are the advantages of a register of beneficial owners and what might be the costs or disadvantages?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: It is not something the FCA has given a huge amount of thought to.
default 
defaultObviously, for 
defaultUK
default companies already, under the Companies Act, there is a requirement to have a shareholders’ register available.
default 
defaultUnder the capital markets regime, we have what is known as a major shareholders’ disclosure requirement, so every time somebody acquires more than 3% of a company, they have to disclose that to the marketplace.
default 
defaultThere 
defaultare
default already significant elements that require disclosure
default 
defaultunder the 
defaultUK
default regime.
default 
defaultI imagine that what is being perhaps got at in your comment is whether there are other owners behind the owners who disclose.
default 
defaultFrom a capital markets perspective, historically, what we have focused on is who has control and making sure that the marketplace understands how much of a company somebody owns, so as to enable it to be ready for potential takeover bids and so on, so valuation questions.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ178 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Given the number of intermediaries that exist and the different ways of owning shares, is it actually not very difficult to establish what real stakes people have behind the scenes?
default 
defaultIs there anything that a regulator can do to increase that transparency?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: We and the Takeover Panel already have concert party arrangements.
default 
defaultIf two seemingly unrelated shareholders in fact are acting in tandem, that already engages some of our rules.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ179 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Professor Kay recommended in his review that “the Government should explore the most cost
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective means for individual investors to hold shares directly on an electronic register”.
default 
defaultIs that something that is being looked at and would that help to meet the requirements of the EITI for a register of beneficial ownership?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: That debate is probably more driven by individual private shareholders, the use of nominee accounts, the ability to have access to corporate events and so on.
default 
defaultI do not think, on the basis of what you have described there, that is central to the EITI concerns.
default 
defaultThe EITI is, as I understand it, going to be adopted in 
defaultEurope
default through a combination of changes to the accounting regulations and the transparency directive.
default 
defaultIt will become something that European companies and companies that access European capital markets will have to adhere to from their side—obviously there is a country side, but from the company side—in due course.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ180 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Obviously, the 
defaultUK
default has signed up to EITI separately from that European process, and so that is something that we ought to be looking maybe to lead the way on.
default 
defaultIn terms of those directives, obviously they are going to require changes in reporting and particularly breaking down turnover by country and information that was not necessarily previously required to be disclosed.
default 
defaultWhat steps do you take as the regulator to ensure companies are aware of their responsibilities?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: When that legislation takes effect, we will be working with the Government to embed it in the 
defaultUK
default rules.
default 
defaultTypically, European legislation is implemented through a combination of changes to law and complementary changes to the FCA rules.
default 
defaultWe will have a 
defaultconsultation process, which will be the prime means of alerting companies and others to these obligations.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ181 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Do you think that could have a beneficial effect for some of the NGOs that have been campaigning for this type of information to be published—people like Publish What You Pay—in terms of the tax that companies pay in different jurisdictions?
default 
defaultIt actually meets some of their requirements.
default 
defaultI think they recommended the 
defaultUK
default should work with “other countries [to] to take speedy and effective action to curtail profit shifting and the use of tax secrecy jurisdictions”.
default 
defaultDo you think that new reporting approach can make a real difference there?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Possibly, but that is not really for me to comment on because, as we talked about earlier, tax matters are outside our remit.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ182 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Finally, I just want to pick up on a written submission.
default 
defaultWe have written submissions from a large number of organisations, as I am sure you are aware, but the one from Christian Aid had a heading “Greater transparency and accountability: 
defaultUK
default a global leader”.
default 
defaultIs that something that you think is important, given the prevalence of extractive industries listing in the 
defaultUK
default—that we should aspire to be a leader in transparency?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: From an FCA perspective, going back to what we were talking about earlier on about what our objectives drive us towards, it is important that capital markets are transparent and that investors and issuers have confidence in them.
default 
defaultTransparency about a broader range of companies’ activities really lies outside the FCA’s remit.
default 
defaultIt may be that the Christian Aid submission might have been talking about some of those other aspects.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ183 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would you not agree that the title of your organisation, the Financial Conduct Authority, if you like gives a legitimate reason for outsiders to expect you to have jurisdiction over areas that you disclaim any right to have jurisdiction on, things like transparency of taxes and issues like that?
default 
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Really, the things that we have jurisdiction over do not particularly flow from the name; they flow from the legislation under which we operate.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ184 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That could be right; it could be that the name is wrong and perhaps you do not really do what is on the tin.
default 
defaultArising from the comments that you have made today, it would seem that there is either a case for changing the name to make it more definitive in the rights and responsibilities you have or perhaps an extension of those rights and responsibilities to match up with the aspirations of the name.
default 
defaultWould you agree that is reasonable?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: I am not responsible for setting the name.
defaultChair:default I quite appreciate that, but I would welcome your opinion.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: The important point I would want to leave the Committee with is that we are a capital markets regulator.
default 
defaultWe are not a 
defaultcompanies
default regulator.
default 
defaultThere are a number of things that are of concern to you about company behaviour, which have some bearing on our capital markets regulatory objectives, and we have talked particularly about financial crime.
default 
defaultThere are a number of other things that have no bearing on it directly, and it is important that the Committee is clear that we are not a 
defaultcompanies
default regulator.
defaultChair:default I think I know the answer to the next question, but I am still going to ask Paul
default&#xa0;
defaultBlomfield to ask it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ185 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I think you have almost answered it in your comment a moment ago, but I wanted to follow up on Robin Walker’s concerns about some of the issues that have been raised with us by NGOs.
default 
defaultThe World Development Movement, for example, has argued strongly to us that “The UK Government must regulate 
defaultUK
default financial institutions to drastically reduce their financing of fossil fuel projects around the world”.
default 
defaultHave you given any consideration to those concerns?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: From a listings point of view, you mean?
default 
defaultNo.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ186 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I am guessing your answer to the follow
default&#x2011;
defaultup to that.
default 
defaultThey would argue that the 
defaultUK
default is missing out on the chance to build a thriving 
defaultrenewables
default sector, as has been achieved by other countries, through regulatory intervention.
default 
defaultDo you not think you have any role there?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Could you be a bit more specific about what type of regulatory intervention you have in mind?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ187 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default The World Development Movement has argued that a regulatory intervention that discourages financial institutions from financing fossil fuel developments and looks towards the renewable sector has worked elsewhere.
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: That really is a broader question about a combination of energy policy and development.
default 
defaultUsing either capital markets regulation or indeed regulation of financial services firms to achieve those aims, driven from the initiative of the FCA, would be outside our statutory remit.
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I thought you would probably say that, but I thought I would explore it anyway.
defaultChair:default So did I.
default 
defaultThat actually concludes our questioning.
default 
defaultCan I thank you very much for your answers to what was, I think it is fair to say, some fairly robust questioning?
default 
defaultI will say what I say to a lot of panellists: often, we realise on reading the transcript that there are further questions that we would like to ask, and we will write to you and would be grateful for a reply, if we feel that that is necessary.
default 
defaultEqually, if, on reflection, you feel that you would like to add to any answer that you have given today, we would welcome those comments.
default 
defaultThank you very much.
default 
defaultMr Binley:default Can I just say you did promise to come back to me on the issue I raised?
defaultDavid Lawtondefault: Indeed, there were two things on which I promised to come back.
default 
defaultThank you.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault, Head of UK and EU Government Affairs, Rio Tinto plc,
default Charles defaultWatenphuldefault, Director of Corporate Affairs, 
defaultGlencore
default Xstrata, and
default Ed Danielsdefault, Chairman of Shell UK Limited, Shell International Limited, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Good morning and thank you for agreeing to answer our questions.
default 
defaultI apologise for being slightly late starting, but obviously we needed to explore some things with the previous witness in some detail.
default 
defaultI do warn that we may have to go over our scheduled time here, if we feel there are issues that need further exploration.
default 
defaultCould I just ask you to introduce yourselves first for voice transcription purposes, starting with you, Charles?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Sure.
default 
defaultGood morning.
default 
defaultCharles 
defaultWatenphul
default, Director of Corporate Affairs at 
defaultGlencore
default.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Good morning.
default 
defaultMy name is Ed Daniels.
default 
defaultI am the Chairman of Shell 
defaultUK
default.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Good morning.
default 
defaultMy name is Tara Hopkins, Chief Adviser for External Affairs at Rio Tinto.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ188 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you.
default 
defaultWe have a lot of questions.
default 
defaultSome will be person
default&#x2011;
defaultspecific
default, but 
defaultthat does not preclude anybody else, if they have a comment, from adding it
default; 
defaultequally
default,
default do not feel that you all have to answer every question if they are general questions and you do not feel that there is really anything that you can add to or subtract from what another speaker has said.
default 
defaultMy first question is to you, Charles.
default 
defaultYou wrote to us and said, “The extractive sector is not merely a collection of mines and oil fields.
default 
defaultIt is instead a complex global industry that connects resources with customers through a network of transport, supply and logistics.”
default 
defaultThe industry may be global, but would you say it is mobile
default?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Absolutely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ189 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How do you justify saying that?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Part of what we do at 
defaultGlencore
default is ensure that the commodities that are needed at the places that need them most get there.
default 
defaultIt involves the extraction of the commodity itself, but also the transportation to the customers that ultimately turn them into the products that you and I know on a daily basis, be it a car or a bicycle.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ190 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You summarised, and again I am quoting, “Mining’s contribution to the global economy is becoming more significant.”
default 
defaultHow would you recommend that the 
defaultUK
default best position itself to benefit from this?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: You have to look at the expertise in place in the 
defaultUK
default at the moment.
default 
defaultThe extractives industry as a whole in the UK, in terms of actual operations, has been declining
default,
default as we know, but the expertise from the ancillary services that have been born from that, be it advisory capacity, are at least to our benefit at 
defaultGlencore
default on the exploration and production side.
default 
defaultWe utilise a great number of companies based in 
defaultAberdeen
default in 
defaultScotland
default that advise us on those activities that we have in exploration and production.
default 
defaultContinuing to build 
defaultthe skill set to ensure that not only the 
defaultUK
default can benefit but also countries abroad that have resources that the wider world needs to continue to develop will be key.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ191 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Given the fact that we have fewer extractive industries
default,
default or perhaps not the capacity and the range of extractive industries that historically this country had, do you see any, shall we say, deficiencies in terms of skills or professional capacity?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: From a 
defaultGlencore
default perspective, no.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I would perhaps build a little bit on Charles
default’ reply
default.
default 
defaultThere is a vibrant science and technology base here in the 
defaultUK
default,
default 
defaultwith
default some of the best universities in the world doing research, both in mineral extraction and in the oil and gas sector, so we rely very heavily here not only for the research and development components within universities, but also 
defaultfor 
defaultattracting skills and talent.
default 
defaultCertainly, in the oil and gas sector, in the energy sector, we do see a shortfall in skills.
default 
defaultThere is a challenge right the way through the education system, starting even at junior schools 
defaultin
default encouraging children to study science, all the way through to universities, when engineers appear at the end of their training and decide to become bankers or consultants, rather than practising their trade.
default 
defaultWe have a challenge there as well.
defaultChair:default 
defaultTara
default, would you agree with that?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Yes, absolutely.
default 
defaultFrom a Rio Tinto perspective, there is a huge amount of excellence in the skills base here in the 
defaultUK
default for our particular industry, for mining.
default 
defaultWe try to draw on that as much as we possibly can.
default 
defaultWe have partnerships with universities here, and we have had them for years and years—Camborne School of Mines, 
defaultImperial
default 
defaultCollege
default and 
defaultNottingham
default 
defaultUniversity
default.
default 
defaultWe do try to invest in that skills base, because we do recognise that there is a centre of excellence here in the 
defaultUK
default that you do not get in other places.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ192 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Okay, so we seem to suit 
defaultGlencore
default but not the others.
default 
defaultDo you see the industry growing?
default 
defaultI am now talking about the extractive industries in general growing or contracting.
default 
defaultI think probably a one
default&#x2011;
defaultword
default answer or a very short answer would do on this.
default 
defaultI will start with you on this, 
defaultTara
default.
default 
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We see it growing.
default 
defaultWe see a huge amount of opportunity in our industry going forward.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Globally
default,
default growing.
default&#xa0;defaultQ193 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Globally
default,
default growing
default,
default but not here; is that the implication of what you are saying?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: In energy
default,
default more stable here than growing.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Globally
default,
default growing, but also ensuring that the 
defaultUK
default’s
default skill set has can grow with it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ194 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We 
defaultmet
default last week with companies that extract, and we had a fairly clear message there that the 
defaultUK
default lacked an extractive
defaults
default strategy.
default 
defaultWould you agree with that and, if you do agree, how do you think it affects you?
default 
defaultI will start with you, Tara.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: In terms of a 
defaultUK
default strategy, given Rio Tinto only has one quite small operation here in 
defaultScotland
default, it does not impact us.
default 
defaultI would say, however, that the more global look at the extractive industry from a 
defaultUK
default perspective would be very much welcomed by a company like Rio Tinto.
default 
defaultA lot of other countries that we are working in have got a mineral strategy, which does help us to have a clear vision of what a government is trying to achieve through its energy and mineral extractors—across the entire board.
default 
defaultWe would welcome that.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I have one problem with the premise of the question.
default 
defaultI am not convinced that a single extractives strategy, lumping together mineral extraction and oil and gas, is necessarily the right direction.
default 
defaultThere are some quite big differences between the sectors.
default 
defaultThe recent Wood review here in the 
defaultUK
default on the 
defaultUK
default continental shelf is a good
default,
default positive step forward to have a framework.
default 
defaultWhat is absolutely fundamental for us is long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm stable regulation, long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm stable transparency around tax regimes, because the kind of investments that we all make, frankly, are very long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm investments, going 10, 20, 30 or 40 years.
default 
defaultFluctuating regulations and fluctuating tax regimes cause us enormous problems 
defaulti
defaultn making decisions on investments.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: To follow on from Tara’s point, our footprint in the 
defaultUK
default is limited to a relatively small zinc/lead smelter, called Britannia, down in 
defaultKent
default.
default 
defaultChair:default Sorry, can you speak up?
default 
defaultSome of us are getting old and hard of hearing.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: My apologies.
default 
defaultOur operations in the 
defaultUK
default are limited to one operation, Britannia, down in 
defaultKent
default, which is a zinc/lead smelter but, again, the expertise that has come out and the skill set that we have utilised, even before we went public, that is based here in the 
defaultUK
default is second to none.
default 
defaultThrough some of the operations that we have globally, we have been able to export that skill set abroad.
default 
defaultAgain, it is about supporting that going forward.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ195 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I want to bring in Robin in a second—he has a supplementary—but before I do so, 
defaultI have 
defaulta couple of 
defaultsupplementar
defaulties
default.
default 
defaultFirst of all, could you say if you operate in any country where there is such a strategy?
default 
defaultI think some of you mentioned one in passing.
default 
defaultSecondly, if so, how does that affect the way that you operate?
default 
defaultLastly, do you think there is just too much weight being put on the significance of that?
default 
defaultI will start with you, Charles.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: It is an interesting point you raise, Mr Chairman.
default 
defaultFrom a 
defaultGlencore
default perspective, and even more widely from an extractive point of view, 
defaulta
defaultll of us operate according to the rules and regulations in the countries where we operate, first and foremost, but that is supported by a more global approach that we have through our code of conduct and values.
default Leading 
defaulton from what Mr Daniels said
default, w
defaulte are of the view that regulation for the sake of it is not welcome.
default 
defaultWe put in our submission that it is something that ultimately we should continue to consult on.
default 
defaultIf there is a clear objective case, a proven case, for putting it through, then that is something we should look at.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ196 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I was going to say you have defined it in terms of regulation.
default 
defaultA strategy would have a much broader approach.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Absolutely.
default 
defaultThere are a number of countries that do have strategies.
default 
defaultOne example that could help support that in a number of areas would be the EITI, which the 
defaultUK
default has recently signed up to.
default 
defaultThat should be applauded.
default 
defaultAll of us here are supporters of EITI, 
defaultGlencore
default included.
defaultChair:default We will be going into that in a moment.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I am not completely convinced that governments are the best creators of strategy overall.
default 
defaultIt is important to recognise that the free market has done an awful lot of things well.
default 
defaultClearly there is a compact between government/regulators, civil society and corporations that we need to get right.
default 
defaultThat triangle needs to work efficiently and effectively.
default 
defaultThere is a minimum amount of regulation that is absolutely necessary to get things right, but I completely agree with Charles; I do not think we need to heap on regulation and assume that governments will always have the right answer strategically on energy policy.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: If I may just talk about mineral strategy specifically, because we do work in a number of countries that have a specific mineral strategy, we do find it helpful.
default 
defaultIt does give clarity to what that country and what that government is trying to achieve, where it wants to source its raw materials, what it wants to do with its raw materials, where it wants to export its raw material.
default 
defaultThose types of guidelines are helpful.
default 
defaultBuilding on the points around additional regulation, of course most companies would like to see clear regulation and not over
default&#x2011;
defaultburdensome
default regulation.
default 
defaultHowever, a clear set of guidelines is always helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ197 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Just a very brief declaration of interest: apart from what I have already declared, I should point out that I worked with Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultWatenphul
default in a previous career at Finsbury.
default 
defaultI wanted to follow on from these questions about government strategy with one area where there is a government strategy in the 
defaultUK
default, particularly for the mining sector
default:
default exports.
default 
defaultMr 
defaultWatenphul
default mentioned exports.
default 
defaultThere is a specific UKTI strategy paper, and I had a constituency business, Joy Mining Machinery, in 
defaultWestminster
default yesterday.
default 
defaultI was slightly disappointed to find out that they did not know about that UKTI paper.
default 
defaultI will just ask the question to the two mining companies represented here: are you aware of that UKTI strategy and have you engaged with UKTI, in terms of their potential support for 
defaultUK
default businesses?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We are aware of it and we were very much involved with UKTI—this is the large book, yes?
default 
defaultWe were very much involved.
default 
defaultIn fact, most of the photographs are Rio Tinto photographs in the book.
default 
defaultWe were really happy to be part of that process.
default 
defaultWhat it helps us with is looking at the 
defaultUK
default from the procurement and supply chain perspective.
default 
defaultWhat is the benefit to the 
defaultUK
default in terms of supporting international companies that are based out of 
defaultLondon
default?
default 
defaultThat is where we really felt there was a value.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I am aware of it, like 
defaultTara
default has just said.
default 
defaultThe points that she has just made in terms of how it can help support 
defaultUK
default industry overseas with specific relation to the extractive industry are clear.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ198 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default Mr Daniels, you mentioned the compact between government regulators, the community and the corporations.
default 
defaultCan all three panellists give us an example of where that has worked well, but also where it has gone wrong for you, why, and the lessons around that?
default 
defaultWe will start with you, Mr Daniels.
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: There is an example in mind of where it can go wrong.
default 
defaultFor example on the transparency initiative, we certainly felt that our voice was not particularly well heard around some very specific challenges that we have.
default 
defaultThe practicality is we are absolutely supportive of publishing our revenues and taxation in countries around the world, and it is available on our website if you wish to see it.
default 
defaultThe reality is that we operate in lots of different countries, in two of which I know for certain it is against the law of that country for us to publish the tax 
defaultreceipts in that particular nation.
default 
defaultI struggle to put individuals in our company in the invidious position of having to break the law here or break the law in the country that they are operating in.
default 
defaultThere are some nuances where a better dialogue between regulator and company could have avoided that particular pitfall in regulation.
default              
defaultHaving said that, in contrast to that, if I look at the Wood review of the development of the UK Continental Shelf, that has been a great example of where the regulator and government have engaged with industry, but also engaged with broader civil society, to understand how we can best extract the resources that we have left in the North Sea to the economic benefit of this nation.
default 
defaultThose are two examples that I can think of.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: I will use the same country for the two examples.
default 
defaultIn Australia, where Rio Tinto ha
defaultve
default the vast majority of our operations, particularly our iron ore operations, the compact between gove
defaultrnment, NGOs, indigenous people and
default the communities in which we operate—it is a resource
default&#x2011;
defaultrich
default nation and has been extracting for a long time—means there is an incredibly strong relationship between all of those groups.
default 
defaultThat has been really successful for the country in the economic development of the country.
default 
defaultEqually, where things have gone wrong in the past and are now being righted are around looking at where the industry maybe did not communicate well enough about its broad economic contribution, and the government of the day then was looking at additional super
default&#x2011;
defaultprofits
default tax on some of the industry.
default 
defaultThat was where there was a failure of communication between two parts of that compact.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ199 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default You did not like being taxed more.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We like being taxed.
default 
defaultWe pay our tax.
default 
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default But not more.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Not a super
default&#x2011;
defaultprofits
default tax, no.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ200 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default I did not understand where it has gone wrong.
default 
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Where we had the issue was that we have been paying a lot of tax, in 
defaultAustralia
default particularly.
default 
defaultLast year we paid over 7
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion in tax in 
defaultAustralia
default.
default 
defaultWhere we had gone wrong, from both sides of the compact, was that we had not been communicating well enough where we were paying our taxes, where the taxes were going and those types of things.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: For any company that is making an investment, a very long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm investment—decisions you make to invest in the Brent field in the UK North Sea are 
defaultof 
default40 years duration—you have to make assumptions on capital costs up front, the running expenditures, etc., and the taxation regime that you are in.
default 
defaultIf you are changing the rules of the game partway through, that leads to a complete lack of confidence in the industry and a collapse of investment.
default 
defaultIf you look at the record in the 
defaultUK
default, when the tax rate was done in the North Sea in 2011, you could directly follow the reduction in investment in the 
defaultNorth Sea
default.
default 
defaultIt is a dangerous game to play in such a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm industry such as ours.
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default That is a fair point to make.
default 
defaultCharles, do you want to come in?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Mr 
defaultZahawi
default, I would just add to that that the extractors do invest for the long term.
default 
defaultThese are multiple decades in certain cases.
default 
defaultWe have a huge global footprint 
defaultinvested in many countries around the world.
default 
defaultThe challenges come depending on the jurisdiction, the infrastructure that is there and a whole host of other factors.
default 
defaultOne of the great challenges we 
defaultfaced
default of late was recently we had a mine nationalised in 
defaultBolivia
default.
default 
defaultThat in itself is something that we as extractors need to be mindful of.
default 
defaultWe have invested a considerable sum of money and, again, it is a different form of changing the rules of the game but, in itself, that is a big game changer for us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ201 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default Where has it gone right?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I suppose a good example of where it has gone right, as I see it, is our investments in 
defaultAfrica
default.
default 
defaultWe have invested billions on the ground there, whether it be in 
defaultSouth Africa
default, the DRC, 
defaultZambia
default and elsewhere.
default 
defaultYou can see the development that comes from not only your operations but also the communities that surround those operations: the taxes that are being paid; the investments that are being made on the ground.
default 
defaultIt is a very clear difference that you can see, having gone through a six
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth journey.
defaultNadhim defaultZahawidefault:default If we asked those communities, those stakeholders in that compact, they would agree with you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ202 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We will be coming on to community impact in a moment; could we just leave it at that?
default 
defaultIn summary, I am a little bit surprised, because what I am getting back does not really reflect or is not consistent with some of the comments earlier.
default 
defaultI asked about a 
defaultUK
default strategy.
default 
defaultNow, my experience of all governments is that they are very good at creating strategies; what they are not very good at is implementing them.
default 
defaultYou have mentioned one or two issues that I would have thought would have been avoidable with a clear
default&#x2011;
defaultcut government strategy.
default 
defaultEd Daniels, you mentioned the taxation in the 
defaultNorth Sea
default.
default 
defaultHad the Government had a clear
default&#x2011;
defaultcut extractive industries strategy, that might well have been avoided.
default 
defaultHowever, given the fact that obviously taxation priorities, skills and investment priorities, planning law and investment in industry all impact hugely on your capacity to deliver, do you not think there is a case for a coherent Government position on this, because then the regulation might actually reflect the Government’s strategic priority?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I agree with you.
default 
defaultWhat is wrestling in my mind is that the word “strategy” is such a broad term that it can mean everything from a very high
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel framework, which I think is absolutely necessary, all the way down to some quite detailed tactics.
default 
defaultMy concern is we need to keep it at the high
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel framework, which I think is where the Wood review is headed and we are supportive of.
default 
defaultI am concerned that, if we get down into micromanagement, we end up with a misallocation of resources and capital, and time and effort.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ203 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would that summarise your position, the other two speakers?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: As I said at the beginning, we would welcome that, and we do welcome a very clear
default&#x2011;
defaultcut strategy around minerals and mineral extracts in the countries where we operate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ204 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default 
defaultY
defaultou all have a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange but, as you stated to us already, you have varying levels of production here in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default.
default 
defaultDo you consider yourselves to be a British company?
default 
defaultMr 
defaultWatenphul
default, would you like to go first?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Thank you very much.
default 
defaultIt is an interesting question.
default 
defaultWe are a Swiss company.
default 
defaultWe were founded in 
defaultSwitzerland
default almost 40 years ago.
default 
defaultWe are, of the three companies on the panel, the most recent to have listed, only two and a half years ago.
default 
defaultBy way of background, why was it that we chose 
defaultLondon
default?
default 
defaultIt is an important point that I would like to get across to the Committee and Mr Chairman.
default 
defaultFundamentally, when we came to decide to do an IPO, we could have listed anywhere in the world.
default 
defaultWe chose the 
defaultLondon
default market for three key reasons.
default 
defaultFirst of all, 
defaultLondon
default is home to the global natural diversified resource companies.
default 
defaultWe came here because this is where our peer group is listed.
default 
defaultI look at Tara and major extractors such as Anglo American, BHP
default&#xa0;
defaultBilliton, etc.
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default It is critical mass of companies.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Absolutely.
default 
defaultThe second point is 
defaultLondon
default has, arguably, an investor base that understands the companies that are listed from the extractors better than anyone else.
default 
defaultIt has a huge pool of capital that is available to companies such as ours that list.
default 
defaultUltimately, it is down to the investors to see if they want to invest.
default 
defaultThe third point is a premium listing in 
defaultLondon
default, especially on the FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100, which we are all part of, provides 
defaultLondon
default investors with the benefit of, from our perspective, the first
default&#x2011;
defaultrate regulation and corporate governance that can be found here today.
default 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Thank you.
default 
defaultYou have actually answered my second question as well—what the factors were in making that decision.
default 
defaultMr Daniels.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I think I have a pretty similar answer.
default 
defaultMarcus Samuel started his shell
default&#x2011;
defaultimporting
default business in 1897 in the East End of London so, in that regard, we have a long historic relationship here.
default 
defaultIn the early 1900s, we conjoined with a Dutch company to make us Anglo
default&#x2011;
defaultDutch
default and then, subsequent to that, we have also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, so we have three listings around the world.
default 
defaultWhen you interview people around the world, actually Shell is a brand that plays quite well locally.
default 
defaultIf you interview people in 
defaultAmerica
default, they think it is an American company and so on.
default 
defaultAlthough we have very strong and deep roots here—it is our primary listing here in 
defaultLondon
default—we are a global player, as you would expect.
default 
defaultThere is, in our view, an ecosystem of support companies around us here.
default 
defaultThere is the depth and breadth of the capital markets.
default 
defaultThe people who really understand the extractors from an analyst perspective are here.
default 
defaultI would make one point, though.
default 
defaultIt is a strong and stable regulatory regime but, of course, we have to be careful that it remains a competitive regulatory regime.
default 
defaultIf it goes completely out of kilter, such that the regulations here cause us untold difficulties to operate and other regimes allow us to operate more freely around the world, in the developed world, of course that puts quite a challenge upon us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ205 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Could I just ask you a supplementary, Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDaniels?
default 
defaultYou have pointed out that you are actually listed in three different countries.
default 
defaultCould you explain precisely how that works in terms of regulation, access to capital and share prices?
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I would declare that I am not an expert in this field, but we want to get, as your previous witness mentioned, the ability to have the depth of the capital markets in those main 
defaultmarkets, in 
defaultLondon
default and in the 
defaultUS
default mainly.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultAmsterdam
default listing is largely for reasons of history.
default 
defaultExactly how that works in terms of the movements of the share price is obviously they all work off the same primary data—the business performance of the amalgamated accounts of the Royal Dutch Shell Group.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: From a Rio Tinto perspective, we have been headquartered and based out of 
defaultLondon
default for the last 140 years.
default 
defaultWe consider ourselves to be a British–Australian international mining company.
default 
defaultIn fact, the name Rio Tinto tells it all, because the original investors in the company were British investors who invested in a mine in 
defaultSpain
default called Rio Tinto.
default 
defaultThat has always been at the heart of Rio Tinto.
default 
defaultWe merged with CRA in 
defaultAustralia
default in 1995 and became a British–Australian mining company.
default 
defaultI am quite happy to talk about the benefits of that, if you would like me to.
default 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default You would reflect the comments of the other two members of the panel
default?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Pretty much so, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ206 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I was interested, Mr Daniels, in your comment that we must be careful
default—t
defaulthese are not your exact words, but I hope I summarise it correctly; if I do not, you will correct me
default—
defaultnot to become more over
default&#x2011;
defaultregulated
default in relation to other markets.
default 
defaultI notice that Charles’s company has just become listed in 
defaultJohannesburg
default.
default 
defaultI
default&#xa0;
defaultjust wonder how much you think about the import of regulation as opposed to the size and number of regulatory structures.
default 
defaultVery often, what is a bit of a nuisance to you is often to your workers a protection.
default 
defaultI just wonder whether you take all of those factors into account.
default 
defaultI assume you do.
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I think we take our responsibility of being the largest company in 
defaultEurope
default and the largest company in the FTSE extremely seriously.
default 
defaultPeople watch us, what we do and our policies and practices.
default 
defaultWe have a statement of general business principles about our ethics and our approach to business that transcends legislation and oftentimes would be more stringent than the regulations would apply.
default 
defaultWe take that extremely seriously.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ207 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I am grateful for that.
default 
defaultThank you; that clarifies it for me.
default 
defaultI now want to come on to Mr 
defaultWatenphul
default.
default 
defaultWith regard to the listing in 
defaultJohannesburg
default—
defaultI think we are going to have the privilege of going to 
defaultSouth Africa
default to look at these matters
default—
defaultI understand that that listing is a recent one.
default 
defaultWould you tell me why you did it and would you explain by whose rules you actually operate, because there is a bit of schizophrenia in relation to this, is there not?
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Absolutely, Mr Binley.
default J
defaultust for the record
default,
default if you are going to 
defaultJohannesburg
default, I would like to extend to the Committee an invitation to visit any of our operations in 
defaultSouth Africa
default.
default 
defaultMr Binley:default Can I say I hope I have not messed up the Chairman’s press release?
defaultChair:default Again, can you speak up?
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I was just saying, Mr Chairman, that I would be happy to extend an invitation to the Committee, if you are going to South Africa, to Johannesburg, to visit any of our operations in South Africa whilst you are there.
defaultChair:default That has been noted.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We took the decision to list in 
defaultJohannesburg
default.
default 
defaultIt was a thorough process we went through, Mr Binley.
default 
defaultThere were two key reasons why we decided to list on the JSE.
default 
defaultFirst of all, our footprint in 
defaultAfrica
default as a continent, as a whole, is growing.
default 
defaultAfrica
default is a very important part of the world for 
defaultGlencore
default.
default 
defaultSecondly, we have sizeable operations in 
defaultSouth Africa
default itself, and the listing was seen as a good way of deepening and strengthening relationships with that part of the world.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ208 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Then I will get back to my question: by whose rules do you operate?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We operate by the rules that govern companies that are listed on the JSE but also, just to follow on from Mr Daniels’ point, it comes back to something I raised earlier, which is that we also have our code of conduct and values, which we also have to abide by from a global perspective.
default 
defaultIn a nutshell, that would be it.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ209 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Are there any contradictions between those two listings that might impact adversely upon this country?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: No, I do not believe so.
default 
defaultWe have to operate by the rules governing a FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100 listed company, as we would do a JSE
default&#x2011;
defaultlisted
default secondary company.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ210 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I am grateful for that.
default 
defaultCan I ask you how much it cost to list in 
defaultJohannesburg
default, in both advisers and in terms of fees?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I am afraid I do not have those figures to hand.
default 
defaultThe cost was not something we looked at.
default 
defaultAgain, it comes to what was right for the company.
default 
defaultIt was right for us to deepen our relations with 
defaultSouth Africa
default through the operations that we have there, and 
defaultAfrica
default is a growing continent for us.
default 
defaultMr Binley:default I am perfectly happy with that response.
default 
defaultYou made that earlier.
defaultChair:default It would be helpful if you could just provide us with the details.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ211 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I was about to say that.
default 
defaultIf you were in here earlier, you would have heard this question of fees arising.
default 
defaultWe just want to make some comparisons and your experience would be very helpful.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Our fees are actually disclosed in the JSE circular, which is publicly available, so I would be happy to send that to Mr 
defaultStam
default, if he is the right person to send it to.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ212 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default That is very kind.
default 
defaultI understand you only listed on the London Stock Exchange on 24
default&#xa0;
defaultMay 2011.
default 
defaultWhat challenges did you have to overcome in order to list here in the 
defaultUK
default?
default 
defaultHelp us, because we want to make it more effective to list.
default 
defaultWhat challenges did you overcome?
default 
defaultWhat made you angry?
default 
defaultWhere did you say, “Bloody people, I wish they’d straighten this out”?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: It was not a question of what made us angry.
default 
defaultFirst and foremost, we were proud to be listing on the London Stock Exchange, to become a member of the FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100 and to actually get fast
default&#x2011;
defaulttrack
default entry into the FTSE 100.
default 
defaultWhen a company such as ours and the scale that we are decides to list somewhere, you have to look at the rules and regulations.
default W
defaulte could have listed anywhere; we chose the 
defaultLondon
default market for the reasons that 
defaultI have outlined to Ms
default&#xa0;
defaultMcKechin
default.
default 
defaultIt is not really for me to say what made us angry.
default 
defaultWe are just proud to be here.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ213 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default The whole thing went through perfectly happily, you were not concerned about any point whatsoever and you were delighted with the way our regulations met the needs of your company
default?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Any IPO of a company of our size is arguably the most public forum a corporate can take, when it comes to lists.
default 
defaultYou have to produce prospectuses; you have to have all the data verified.
default 
defaultIf you are a major company that has huge operations globally, that takes a lot of work, so there is work involved, but ultimately it comes back to we are proud to be here.
defaultMr Binley:default We are delighted to have you.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Thank you very much.
defaultMr Binley:default Can I just complete my questions?
default 
defaultAgain, I apologise for coming back to you.
default 
defaultNo, I have misread my question.
default 
defaultSo we can have that relationship, how much did it cost to list in the 
defaultUK
default in terms of both advisers and fees?
default 
defaultChair:default I think we have done that.
default 
defaultRobin Walker, you wanted to come in.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ214 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I just wanted to come in.
default 
defaultWe spoke about the fact that 
defaultGlencore
default listed in May 2011, I think you said.
default 
defaultIn June 2011, the 
defaultDaily Mail 
defaultreported that the EIB had frozen 
defaultGlencore
default loans, on the basis of concerns raised by various NGOs.
default 
defaultCan you explain what was the follow
default&#x2011;
defaulton from that and was there any read
default&#x2011;
defaultacross
default to your 
defaultLondon
default listing and by the 
defaultUK
default regulator and the 
defaultUK
default market to that action taken by the EIB?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Can you just clarify what you mean by “follow
default&#x2011;
defaulton”?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ215 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Were 
defaultUK
default listing regulators concerned about the fact that the EIB was seen to have taken action in that case against the company?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: As far as I am aware, no, but that is a matter that we are in the process of coming to a conclusion on with the EIB.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ216 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default You cannot say much about it.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: No, not really.
default 
defaultWe have made our position publicly clear on a number of occasions.
default 
defaultWe are working through it with the EIB and we hope to come to a conclusion soon.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ217 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default That was a couple of years ago.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: That is correct.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ218 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default That is something you are still working through.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ219 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just to clarify, before we move on, when you listed, did you have any problems in convincing the FCA, given the fact that I think it is fair to say there had been adverse publicity about 
defaultGlencore
default?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Ultimately, we are on the FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100.
defaultChair:default That was not my question.
default 
defaultThat is self
default&#x2011;
defaultevident.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: The discussions that we had with parties such as the FCA are between the company and the FCA.
default 
defaultYou have to go through a whole due diligence process when you list.
default 
defaultYou have to basically show warts and all as a corporate.
default 
defaultYou have to publish prospectuses.
default 
defaultYou have to go through the necessary regulatory procedures and to provide the information that people require.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ220 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We know all of that.
default 
defaultI am not sure if you were here for the previous session.
default 
defaultOne of the lines of questioning was, in effect, whether the FCA had adequate powers to do that or motivation to do it.
default 
defaultThe question I am asking you is: did they probe you on any other issues?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: They did a thorough review of our business, but nothing specific.
defaultChair:default 
defaultA
default thorough review, but nothing specific.
default 
defaultThat is a bit of an oxymoron.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Sorry.
default 
defaultA thorough review of the prospectus, so, yes, we were put under the spotlight.
defaultChair:default You were put under the spotlight but cleared, effectively.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We are here today.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ221 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Did you feel that getting listed gave you, if you like, the stamp of respectability?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Again, it comes back to the three points, Mr Chairman.
default 
defaultIt is not about the stamp of respectability; it is why we chose to list on the 
defaultLondon
default market.
default 
defaultThe expertise that can be found here, the knowledge base with regard to the extractives industry, the huge pool of capital—arguably 
defaultLondon
default is the financial centre.
default 
defaultAlso, there is the corporate governance that investors can take heart from.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ222 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Surely if corporate governance was an issue, you would have accepted that listing, in effect, was an indication that your levels of corporate governance are adequate.
default 
defaultIn effect, you interpret it like that.
default 
defaultIn other words, it was a stamp of respectability.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: From the 
defaultUK
default market and from investors who decided to invest in us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ223 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I just wonder: you said that you were asked some questions that you needed to answer, which were perhaps important questions from the perspective of listing.
default 
defaultWe have already heard from the FCA that, in fact, their processes are not as credible as many of us would like to see them.
default 
defaultI see the gentleman behind you keeps prompting you, which is slightly 
defaultdisconcerting when I am asking a question.
default 
defaultThank you, sir; I am grateful.
default 
defaultCan I ask what other bodies other than the FCA were involved in the process of looking into your track record?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: The bodies, the advisers, that we had to use were listed in our prospectus.
default 
defaultFor example, Deloitte is our auditor.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ224 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Any other official bodies of any kind whatsoever?
default 
defaultYour own auditors obviously, who are going to be nice to you.
default 
defaultI have been in business for a long time and I have rarely seen an auditor that was not nice to the company that paid them, quite frankly.
default 
defaultSo, there are your own auditors; any other body?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: As far as I am aware, no. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ225 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default We have already intimated that we are concerned about companies that get a FTSE listing that have not been properly checked out or have not been properly looked into.
default 
defaultI want to know which bodies looked into your company to ensure that you were a fit and proper company to be listed and gain the cloak of respectability that we have already mentioned.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: As I just said, Mr Binley, we were going a thorough review by the FCA at the time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ226 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default We have heard that the FCA does not give thorough reviews.
default 
defaultThat is the point I am making.
default 
defaultWhat other bodies did?
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I can only revert back to the process that we went through in the listing back in 2011.
defaultMr Binley:default No other bodies other than the FCA, in terms of your credibility.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: As far as I am aware, no.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ227 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn defaultMcKechindefault:default Could you just confirm to us who was 
defaultyour
default sponsor company when you were listed?
default 
defaultYou require a company to sponsor you for listing.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We had 
defaultCiti
default and Morgan Stanley.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ228 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default This is a question primarily, in the first instance, to Shell, but then I will broaden it out.
default 
defaultIn your written submission, you quoted that 83% of your spending in the 
defaultUK
default went to local companies last year.
default 
defaultCould you maybe go into that in a bit more detail and tell us what kind of spending you are referring to, where that goes, and what kinds of companies and organisations would benefit as a result of that?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: We obviously have extensive operations in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultWe have 6,500 employees and probably three or four times that in terms of contractors who work for us.
default 
defaultI will give you some practical examples.
default 
defaultIf you take our 
defaultNorth Sea
default operations, a lot of our maintenance activities would be contracted out.
default 
defaultA lot of the services in and around repairs, etc., would be contracted out.
default 
defaultFor example, I visited our Gannet oil rig a month or so ago.
default 
defaultWe had a massive floating hotel alongside it where 300 workers are shot
default&#x2011;
defaultblasting
default, painting and repairing the Gannet oil platform, as an example on the upstream side.
default 
defaultOn our downstream side, for example, there is our extensive retail network; we have 20% market share, with 1,100 sites in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultMany of our retail sites would be owned by small businesses that franchise our brand, for example to sell gasoline and other of our products.
default 
defaultThere are other examples as well.
default 
defaultFor example, we use specialist engineering consultancies to do designs of activity that would be built overseas.
default 
defaultFor example, some of the design work for our installations in 
defaultIraq
default was done in 
defaultWest London
default.
default 
defaultIf I think of our Pearl GTL facility in 
defaultQatar
default, a huge amount of design activity would be done here in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultFor a lot of the activity that we perform in the 
defaultUK
default, we try to get local content.
default 
defaultIn addition to that, for our overseas operations, we bring work here to the 
defaultUK
default, because of the depth and breadth of the technical expertise here.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ229 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default You have touched on one of the points that I was going to ask about, which is to what extent it is the small companies or to what extent it is the big players that you always use.
default 
defaultYou have mentioned specialist engineering.
default 
defaultHow large would you have to be to work with you and what is the geographical spread like?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: The majority of spend, I suspect—although I would have to get you detailed answers—would be in Scotland, because the majority of our big operations are in the North Sea.
default 
defaultI do not know the exact answer, but my suspicion is we tend to be with larger companies rather than smaller ones, simply for the scale of activity that we have.
default 
defaultThere would be relatively few smaller companies that are able to do that.
default 
defaultI would, however, say that we do spend and worry about enterprise and invest in enterprise in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultFor example, last Thursday night I hosted the final of our 
defaultLiveWIRE
default competition.
default 
defaultWe have been running this for 30 years.
default 
defaultWe ask for young people aged between 18 and 30 to come forward with business ideas in a sort of competition.
default 
defaultThey win £10,000 funding for that, so we do take small business seriously.
default 
defaultIt is just that there are not that many small businesses that we can use practically in our operations.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ230 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default Is that something that you are aware of and that you have tried to do something about, so that smaller players get an opportunity, or is that something that you do not think is practical?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: We are very much aware of making sure that we do our utmost to be a responsible player here in the 
defaultUK
default, which includes of course doing business with small companies.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ231 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default In terms of your 
defaultUK
default operations and your presence, to what extent is it 
defaultUK
default nationals that you employ or to what extent do you bring people in from outside?
default 
defaultI suppose one of the issues that we are interested in is our skills base and whether you are actually able to take on people.
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: We have, as I said, about 6,500 employees here in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultIn Shell we very much aim, in every country in which we operate, to cover the entire workforce with local people.
default 
defaultThat does not always happen, and there would be several people here in the 
defaultUK
default who 
defaultar
defaulte foreign nationals working because of a particular skill gap or a particular shortage.
default 
defaultIn addition to that, we have quite an active expatriation programme.
default 
defaultFor example, right now today there are 2,000 British nationals who work for Shell who are working overseas for us in various projects or various activities.
default 
defaultWe like bringing foreign nationals here to train them and give them the experience of working in one of our larger operations.
default 
defaultYou will find a 
defaultsignificant diversity of employees in 
defaultAberdeen
default, for example, and in our headquarters in 
defaultLondon
default, who are picking up experiences and will then take that back to their host countries.
default 
defaultI would say one thing: we are concerned about the whole debate around visas and immigration, because it is critical for our business.
default 
defaultIt is critical for the development of skills for this country and the development of skills for other countries around the world that we can have free flow of employees and bring students in as well, and young graduates who are British but also from other nationalities, to help maintain this vibrant environment that we aim to have.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ232 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default You will be aware the Committee has taken up issues to do with student visas.
default 
defaultAre there particular countries that you have problems with, if you are trying to bring in staff from particular parts of the world, or is it a general problem that you have?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I am not going to pick on particular countries here and now.
default 
defaultI will have to write to you on that, because I think it would be wrong of me to conjecture on that point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ233 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default That would be fine.
default 
defaultIf any of you feel that would be a useful issue to raise, we would be delighted to hear from you.
default 
defaultA more general question to all of you: Robert Fenton from the Mining Association of the 
defaultUK
default told us “foreign investment has kept the industry alive” and that, without foreign
default&#x2011;
defaultowned
default companies investing here, there would be no extractive industry in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultDo you agree with that?
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I certainly do not agree with that.
default 
defaultWe produce 12% of 
defaultUK
default oil and gas.
default 
defaultWe process about 30% of 
defaultUK
default oil.
default 
defaultWe are a very significant player, with 30 rigs, 30 offshore installations, in addition to that.
default 
defaultWe are a very significant player here.
default 
defaultIf I count the other British
default&#x2011;
defaultlisted
default companies in the 
defaultNorth Sea
default, there is quite a significant proportion, and of course we have our global operations.
default 
defaultIn oil and gas specifically, I would refute that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ234 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default What do you think he was referring to?
default 
defaultDo you think he was trying to get at something in particular?
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: My suspicion is—no, I am not going to conjecture on what he thought he was saying.
default 
defaultI will leave him to clarify that.
defaultKaty Clark:default You would not like to speculate.
default 
defaultHave any of the other witnesses got anything to say on that particular point about foreign investment?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We only have one, as I said, small operation in Lochaber up in 
defaultScotland
default, an aluminium smelter and a hydro facility to power it.
default 
defaultWe do not have vast operations here, so we do not have a good vision of what is going on with the rest of the broader industry.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I would agree with Ms Hopkins.
default 
defaultWe, again, only have one operation here in the 
defaultUK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ235 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default Witnesses that we have taken evidence from have also described the high importance they put both on the upstream and the downstream supply chains, specifically here in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultCould you elaborate on your engagement with 
defaultUK
default companies and how your business impacts on the 
defaultUK
default?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: I am very happy to do that.
default 
defaultBuilding on Mr Daniels’
default point
default, we do use British SMEs in our supply chain, in our international operations.
default 
defaultExamples of that would be in 
defaultMongolia
default, where Rio Tinto has a copper project.
default 
defaultIt is an absolutely extraordinary copper project.
default 
defaultIt just started to export a few months ago.
default 
defaultThe waste facility down in the south 
defaultGobi
default 
defaultDesert
default, where we have the project, was manufactured by a company in 
defaultSheffield
default that is an SME.
default 
defaultWhat we have heard from the mine manager down there is not only was it very well put in, but also the support services that that company has given to us are second to none.
default 
defaultThere are lots of those examples replicated across our international operations.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ236 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default I will not ask you to put a specific percentage, but would you be able to give us a rough indication of what kind of proportion it might be of SMEs that are British?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We have not done that calculation.
default 
defaultWhat I would say in terms of Rio
default&#xa0;
defaultTinto’s economic contribution to the 
defaultUK
default is we do look at SMEs and larger businesses.
default I
defaultn the 
defaultUK
default last year 
defaultwe spent
default somewhere around £730
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion spent 
defaulti
defaultn the 
defaultUK
default supply chain, but we do not cut the data in that way.
default 
defaultWe could do if it is helpful for the Committee.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ237 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Ms
default&#xa0;
defaultHopkins, you offered us some encouraging words in your written submission that the 
defaultUK
default will continue to be a centre for the mining and metals industry.
default 
defaultWhat are the positive factors that you see contributing to that and what are the risks on the negative side?
default 
defaultI think Mr Daniels mentioned earlier over
default&#x2011;
defaultregulation
default might be one of them, but are there any other risks that you see to the 
defaultUK
default’s position at the centre of the industry?
default 
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We definitely view the UK—London
default,
default but more broadly the UK—as a centre of excellence, both in terms of London as a place to list, and there have been lots of conversations about that earlier on, but also more broadly in the skill sets
default,
default not just in the mining industry per se, but
default in
default an understanding of our industry.
default 
defaultBanking and financial services here in 
defaultLondon
default have a very deep understanding of our industry, because of the legacy and the heritage behind it.
default 
defaultSimilarly, analysts here have a world
default&#x2011;
defaultclass understanding of our industry and, therefore, shareholders have a huge amount of knowledge at their fingertips when they are investing in companies like Rio Tinto
default;
default 
defaultand 
defaultthe legal professional services
default, as well
default.
default 
defaultAgain, we have cut some of that data, so you can see the type of contribution that we make and what we buy in from 
defaultLondon
default.
default 
default              
defaultMore broadly, in terms of procurement and supply chain, I gave the example of 
defaultMongolia
default but we have got that across the board.
default 
defaultRegarding large companies, I think we mentioned in our submission
default that
default Cummins up in the 
defaultMidlands
default produce a huge amount of the engines for Komatsu trucks.
default 
defaultYou have all seen those huge trucks with wheels the size of the building here.
default 
defaultThey are Japanese trucks and their engines are coming from the 
defaultMidlands
default.
default 
defaultAll of the international mining companies are using, I am sure, Komatsu trucks.
default 
defaultMr Walker:default As a Midlands MP, it is particularly pleasing to hear you say that.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: That is great.
default 
defaultFinally, where we do see the potential for further investment is around education and is around ensuring that, where there is a centre of excellence in academia around our area, 
defaulti
defaultt is nurtured and fostered.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ238 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Can I just ask one very specific point on that?
default 
defaultRio
default&#xa0;
defaultTinto is a company with businesses all over the Commonwealth, particularly 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultSouthern Africa
default.
default 
defaultBHP is in a similar situation.
default 
defaultHave those two companies looked at the opportunity for Commonwealth scholarships in terms of the mining and metals sector?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: We do a number of scholarships and we are very involved in the 
defaultChevening
default scholarship programme from the Foreign Office.
default 
defaultWe invest in scholars up in 
defaultDundee
default 
defaultUniversity
default, who are looking very specifically at minerals policy and minerals law.
default 
defaultYes, we do try to draw on the experience and the academic base from across the Commonwealth, from where Rio Tinto has its operations.
default 
defaultWe invest in universities in 
defaultAustralia
default; we invest in universities in the 
defaultUS
default, in 
defaultCanada
default and also here in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultWhat we try to do is look at where the niche expertise is.
default 
defaultWhere that needs to be invested in, that is what we want to do.
defaultMr Walker:default Do any of the other companies want to comment on that area?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I have mentioned before already the depth of skills and R and D, and that is certainly something we need to maintain and continue to see as an important area.
default 
defaultSkills we have touched on.
default 
defaultThere are a couple of things I would just mention.
default 
defaultThe support from Her Majesty’s Government, not only for the approach that happens here in the 
defaultUK
default but support on foreign trade, is a helpful relationship for us.
default 
defaultWe seek and are pleased with the level of support that we get from government when we are doing work overseas or bidding for work overseas.
default 
defaultAlso, the 
defaultUK
default is pretty vibrant in terms of think-tanks, whether in policy or political matters, just in terms of shaping regulations.
default 
defaultThere is quite a vibrant atmosphere that we try to tap into to understand the latest thinking.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I was just going to expand on what Ms
default&#xa0;
defaultHopkins and Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultDaniels said.
default 
defaultAgain, it comes back to the skill set that can be found here, with the knowledge base of extractives, both in the 
defaultUK
default but also taken out and utilised more globally, that is second to none.
default 
defaultIf I were to focus specifically in terms of education, which is obviously key in bringing through the next generation of extractive professionals, BRM, our operation in 
defaultKent
default,
default has several apprenticeships, some of whom have actually gone and spent 12 weeks’ paid vacation work doing placements in places like 
defaultAustralia
default.
default 
defaultIt is providing not only the classroom experience, but then taking these apprentices out and putting them in the operations themselves to see them day to day.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ239 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike defaultCrockartdefault:default In the interests of transparency, I will declare that my wife provides consultancy support for Rio Tinto Alcan’s interests in 
defaultScotland
default.
default 
defaultI am sure Ms
default&#xa0;
defaultHopkins has got a very good briefing on me.
default 
defaultI am a little confused by the way that, as companies, you seem to flip from one side to the other, saying, “The worst thing possible would be over
default&#x2011;
defaultburdensome
default regulation,” and yet at the same time talk about the strong corporate governance being the gold standard of listings and the benefits that that brings.
default 
defaultOn the one side, Mr Daniels, you talked earlier on about taxation reporting being a potential problem because of the way in which you are being forced to do something that might be illegal in one country or another.
default 
defaultEqually, in Rio
default&#xa0;
defaultTinto’s evidence submission, you talk about the extra mile that you go and the recognition that PwC has given you in what you do in your tax reporting.
default 
defaultWhich is it?
default 
defaultIs it over
default&#x2011;
defaultburdensome
default or is it actually a benefit to you?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: My point would be that it is about level playing fields.
default 
defaultIf you have a dramatically different regulatory regime in, say, the 
defaultUnited States
default from where we are here, and we are a very significant operator in the European continent but also in the 
defaultAmericas
default, it just causes a lot of problems.
default 
defaultOf course we need to be regulated.
default 
defaultOf course it is important; as I mentioned before, the compact between government regulators, companies and civil society is critical.
default 
defaultIf 
defaultyou get a dislocation between different parts of the world, then it becomes troublesome for us.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ240 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike defaultCrockartdefault:default Before I ask the other two to come in, how do you get a gold standard and a level playing field?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Over time, the 
defaultUK
default has developed a very strong regulatory regime, such that all of us on this panel sought and have been listed here.
default 
defaultIf you look, it has historically tracked very closely with the regulatory regime going on in the 
defaultUS
default.
default 
defaultFor example, if you take Dodd–Frank, the implementation of that 
defaultAct 
defaultand the transparency components of Dodd–Frank, it is very similar to the transparency initiative and the transparency directive that have come in here.
default 
defaultMy plea would be that, as has happened in the past, regulators keep a watchful eye on any significant dislocations.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Mr 
defaultCrockart
default, the point I would raise is that high standards of corporate governance do not necessarily affect the competitiveness of a particular location, but it is again being mindful of putting regulation in for regulation’s sake, where the cost burden is that much greater and ultimately ensuring that locations such as this—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ241 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike defaultCrockartdefault:default You have given evidence that you chose to list in 
defaultLondon
default because of the gold standard in regulations and the benefit that that would bring to your company.
default 
defaultYou cannot then complain about the extra cost that that regulation brings.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I am not complaining about it.
default 
defaultI am merely just highlighting that regulation for regulation’s sake is something that people need to take into account, be it governments here or elsewhere, when looking to impose it.
default 
defaultThat is all.
default 
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: I very much take the point of Mr Daniels about a level playing field.
default 
defaultParticularly in our industry, it is really important that minimum standards are being recognised and implemented across the industry, but there is equally a place for companies to choose to take a leadership position on certain issues, because over time that brings everyone up.
default 
defaultThat is the role of ICMM, which I know spoke to the Committee last week.
default 
defaultThere is a group of mining and metals companies that are members of the International Council on Mining and Metals.
default 
defaultTheir role is to look at where we should be taking a leadership position.
default 
defaultRio Tinto has chosen to do that around transparency but, equally on the level playing field, having lots of different initiatives or regulation around transparency is not helpful and is not going to meet the endgame, which is anti
default&#x2011;
defaultcorruption
default.
default 
defaultWhere it is possible, we would like to see clarity in that regulation, whether it is US, 
defaultUK
default, EU or across the board.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Perhaps I would add one further point.
default 
defaultThe popular conception can be that Shell’s biggest competitor is BP, for example.
default 
defaultThe reality is we are competing with of course BP, Exxon, Chevron and other international oil companies of that ilk, but we are also competing with 
defaultPetrobras
default in 
defaultBrazil
default, which is a state entity, and with 
defaultPetroChina
default in 
defaultChina
default, which is clearly a state entity.
default 
defaultWe see real advantages of having a gold standard of regulation and being able to declare ourselves a well regulated company with the highest possible principles and ethical approach, but let us not pretend that it is not quite a challenging competitive environment.
default 
defaultIn order to stay ahead, we have to have, in my view, a level playing field of regulation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ242 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default We heard last week from Mining on Top, which represents a number of the smaller companies in the industry.
default 
defaultThey said that the Government needs to keep an open mind when listening to extractive companies.
default 
defaultThat sort of implies that perhaps it has not had or it has not been listening.
default 
defaultDo you feel, from your perspective as representatives of some of the biggest companies out there, that the Government is listening?
default 
defaultIs it hearing the views of the industry?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Sorry, I seem to be always jumping in.
default 
defaultI think I have referred already to the example of the Wood review in the 
defaultNorth Sea
default, in terms of taking a back
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultbasics
default approach.
default 
defaultThat is good and we would highly support that.
default 
defaultThe support that we get in terms of some of our activities overseas and in terms of trade feels great.
default 
defaultThe tax thing in the North Sea 2011 was not so great.
default 
defaultBy and large, we are positive, but an encouragement for long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm stable policy and long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm stable taxation would be my plea.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Again, it comes back to our footprint from an operational perspective, which is very small, but one example of perhaps the UK Government listening is it recent signing
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default to the membership of EITI, which specifically focuses on the extractive industry.
default 
defaultMr Walker:default That is where you feel it was listening.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: It is an example of where Government has been shown not to throw its weight behind, I would say, but support this initiative, which is specifically focussed on the extractives.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ243 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default That is an interesting case in point, because the 
defaultUK
default launched the EITI some years ago, almost a decade ago, and signed up relatively recently.
default 
defaultIn the gap in between, were your companies encouraging the UK Government to actually sign up to it?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: We were a founder signatory.
default 
defaultWe are on the board of EITI, and we have always seen it as something that is important for our industry and have advocated it ever since its formation.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Same
default—
defaultRio Tinto was one of the earliest supporters of EITI and, while we do not have that many operations here in the 
defaultUK
default, we very much support and were supportive of the road to the 
defaultUK
default, the 
defaultUS
default, 
defaultAustralia
default and other lots of other countries deciding to implement EITI.
default 
defaultIf I may, on the role of the UK Government in terms of listening to British
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default international mining companies, we do feel like we get the right level of support, and I do think that what the Government is thinking is in terms of what international mining companies can do in terms of opening up that supply chain for British companies, SMEs and larger companies.
default 
defaultIn the last few years, there has really been a focus on that, which we have found to be hugely helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ244 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default This is for Charles, please.
default 
defaultYou wrote that at 
defaultGlencore
default you “have an open
default&#x2011;
defaultdoor policy towards outside stakeholders who have a legitimate interest”.
default 
defaultI wondered if you could explain in greater detail what that actually means in practice, please.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: As an extractive industry, along with other industries, we welcome engagement from stakeholders in general.
default 
defaultGlencore
default especially welcomes the scrutiny that that can bring, but I would caveat that by saying that the engagement should be one of a 
defaultconstructive nature ultimately.
default 
defaultIt should be seen to enact change for the positive on the ground, from an operational perspective, but also, given the impact that we have from a community perspective as an industry, if there is constructive dialogue to be had with outside stakeholders to improve that as well, that should be welcomed.
default 
defaultA very good example would be down in 
defaultSouth Africa
default.
default 
defaultWe have been working for a number of years with an NGO there called Reaction.
default 
defaultThey are helping advise us on the mitigation of HIV/AIDS in 
defaultSouth Africa
default and, in the last few years, eight clinics have been built.
default 
defaultThose eight clinics can help service around a million people.
default 
defaultThat is a substantial impact that can be made on the ground.
default 
defaultAgain, it comes back to constructive engagement.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ245 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default You have spoken about how you engage with NGOs.
default 
defaultAre the
defaultre
default ways that you actually engage with local issues and local communities?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Absolutely.
default 
defaultThat is a fundamental part of what we do.
defaultCaroline defaultDinenagedefault:default Give me an example of how you would engage.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We have community liaison officers at all our major operations in countries where we operate.
default 
defaultIt is ensuring that the policies that are set out at the board and centrally in 
defaultSwitzerland
default are put and enacted across the group globally.
default 
defaultEnsuring that you have good communications with your community and relationships is vital.
default 
defaultIt is part of your licence to operate from a social perspective, as well as an operational perspective.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ246 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Mr 
defaultWatenphul
default, I wonder if I could follow up on Caroline’s point and your answer.
default 
defaultIn 
defaultGlencore’s
default written submission, you said, “Extractive companies have a distinct opportunity to render assistance to communities and governments in poorer countries.”
default 
defaultYou went on to say, “At 
defaultGlencore
default we constantly strive to find new ways to improve how we manage our health, safety and environmental practices [to the] well
default&#x2011;
defaultbeing of the communities in which we operate.”
default 
defaultCan I talk to you about 
defaultMufulira
default, a town in the Zambian copper belt, with which you will be familiar?
default 
defaultI am sure you would point me to the investment you have made in schools, hospitals and HIV programmes there, but you will also probably be familiar with a report in the 
defaultDaily Mail 
defaulta couple of years ago, which talked about the other face of 
defaultGlencore
default mining that investors never see.
default 
defaultI quote from them: “A vast factory that spews choking clouds of sulphurous gas over a town the size of 
defaultOxford
default.
default 
defaultToxic rain has withered plant life, the air tastes of rotten eggs, and locals report chronic breathing difficulties.”
default 
defaultThe 
defaultMail 
defaultwent on to comment that “the notion of such an industrial carbuncle being tolerated in the 
defaultUK
default for five minutes, let alone years, would be scandalous”.
default 
defaultThat is a consequence of the Mopani Copper Mines, your company there.
default 
defaultWhat is your reaction to that in terms of the environmental and social mission that you describe?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: It is a very important point you raise and, actually, we as a company, in April last year, were asked to take part in another evidence session that the DFID Select Committee hosted.
default 
defaultOur Chairman from Mopani and our global head of tax both came to the Committee, and they also took the Members from that Committee down to Mopani to see for themselves the operation.
default 
defaultIt is important to note Mopani is an operation that was built in 1937.
default 
defaultGlencore
default acquired control of Mopani in 2000 during the privatisation process, and it was absolutely clear, when 
defaultwe took over the operation of the asset, that the emission of SO
default2
default into the atmosphere was something that had to be fixed incredibly quickly.
default 
defaultWe would have liked to have done it sooner but, unfortunately, we were not able to do the necessary work that we had to do, because we had to keep running the plant at full operation.
default 
defaultWhat we have done since then is we have basically been demolishing a house and rebuilding it with the people still living in it.
default 
defaultI understand that the 
defaultDaily Mail 
defaultis aware of this, as are our other key stakeholders.
default 
defaultActually, by the first quarter of next year, the SO
default2
default capture will be 97%, which will be a world
default&#x2011;
defaultclass standard, and that is 15 months ahead of schedule.
default 
defaultAbsolutely at the time, yes, the SO
default2
default emissions
default 
defaultwere a major issue—and still are until next quarter, Q1 2014—
defaultb
defaultut we are going in and we are investing in dealing with these legacy issues and fixing them on the ground.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ247 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I just come in on that point?
default 
defaultIf my memory serves me right, the timescale for this, was it 2002 that you took—?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: 2000.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ248 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I understand that at the moment you are in effect undertaking a big leap in emissions reductions that will be completed by the end of this year, if my memory serves me right.
default 
defaultHitherto, it was something like 45%, but is now going up to 97%.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: It is a little more than that, Mr Chairman.
defaultChair:default Could you give me the exact figures?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: The original deadline was to increase SO
default2
default emissions capture from 50%, from more than 50%, to 97%.
default 
defaultThat is a world
default&#x2011;
defaultclass standard.
default 
defaultThe deadline for doing that was the end of this year, 2013.
default 
defaultUnfortunately, that deadline has now been pushed back to Q1 next year for reasons out of our control, but we are confident of meeting that new deadline.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ249 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Why has it taken you so long to do the first 45%, when you can do the second in a relatively short period of time?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: You do not just do it all in one go.
default 
defaultYou have to phase the implementation of the SO
default2
default emissions capture.
default 
defaultIt comes back to a point I raised earlier: could we have shut that plant and done it quicker?
default 
defaultYes, we could have done.
default 
defaultWhat would that have meant?
default 
defaultThat would have meant that around 17,000 people would have been out of work.
default 
defaultRoughly one in eight people are reliant on a worker at our operations in 
defaultZambia
default.
default 
defaultBroadening that out, almost 200,000 people depend on the operation.
default 
defaultWe had to keep it going.
default 
defaultWe agreed with the Government the timeframe.
default 
defaultThat was put in place, and we are confident we will meet the new Q1 capture.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ250 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could you have shut it down and paid employees whilst you dealt with the problems?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Again, it comes back to dealing with the facts at hand and trying to fix a legacy issue.
default 
defaultIt is as simple as that, and that is what we are going to be doing.
default 
defaultChair:default You have not really answered my question.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I would not want to speculate on what we could or could not have done, but what is clear is that we are fixing a legacy issue that has been blighting 
defaultZambia
default since 
default1937.
default 
defaultOperations like that and foreign investment are what can be done; that is for the good of the ground.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ251 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What is the life expectancy of employees in that plant?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: The life expectancy of employees at that plant?
default 
defaultI am afraid I do not have that information to hand.
defaultChair:default Could you provide it?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: For sure.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ252 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Thank you, Chairman.
default 
defaultThose were some useful supplementary points.
default 
defaultIt is not impressive to have taken 13 years to have resolved that problem, but let me move on to a general question to each of you.
default 
defaultThe International Council on Mining 
defaultand Metals 
defaulttold us that, in terms of the benefits that mining affords to national economies, “The top four segments of contribution accrue to national governments.
default 
defaultOnly the smallest contribution, employment, can be said to directly benefit local communities.”
default 
defaultDo you agree with that?
default Do you think it is a fair comment?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: From a Rio Tinto perspective, modern
default&#x2011;
defaultday mining companies do not have huge numbers of employees working at them.
default 
defaultA lot of mining companies try to be as effective as possible, in terms of ensuring that we are using technology.
default 
defaultWe have a Mine of the Future plan in 
defaultAustralia
default, where you have automated trucks and things like that.
default 
defaultSometimes there is a misconception that we are huge employers at mine sites, and that is not necessarily the case.
default 
defaultThat is probably what the ICMM is saying there.
default 
defaultThe number of employees at mine sites is quite small.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ253 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default The point they were making is that you all have within your mission a concern to support the communities whose lives are significantly changed by the fact that you are operating there but, actually, the point that the 
defaultICMM 
defaultwas making is that the major benefits of your involvement within a country are at the national level, not within those communities.
default 
defaultIn a sense, your answer to my question actually endorses that, in the sense that you are only employing small numbers of people in some cases
default—
defaultclearly not in Mopani.
default 
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: There is the employee point.
default 
defaultAgain, just from a Rio Tinto perspective, we do spend a lot of time, money, investment, resources and people on local communities.
default 
defaultUsually about $290
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion per year is spent on community programmes.
default 
defaultThe taxes that we pay and the royalties that we pay go to the national government, and they have a tax policy in place, as a sovereign government, to choose what they want to do with those taxes.
default 
defaultWe do not have the right to tell them what to do with their taxes, but companies do contribute to the local communities on a community
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultcommunity
default basis as well.
default 
defaultWe are working in extremely diverse places, and so we have to make it fit for purpose.
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: The scale of numbers in the energy industry just makes it very difficult to compare what you are comparing.
default 
defaultIn the 
defaultUK
default last year, we collected £11
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion on behalf of the taxpayer and gave it to HMG from various taxes that we are subjected to.
default 
defaultWe paid £500
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion of corporation tax in the 
defaultUK
default and we paid probably another £500
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion of taxes via our employees, if you see me, through employment.
default 
defaultThe scale of that enterprise makes it quite difficult to compare that with our social investment, social community and 
defaultgrowth programmes.
default 
defaultWhat I would say is we are supporting skills development and enterprise development on a pretty significant scale.
default 
defaultIf you compare it to the global energy industry, you will always come up relatively short, as your numbers suggest.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I would follow on from what Ms Hopkins has just said.
default 
defaultLast year, we spent over 
default$
default200
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion investing in sustainability initiatives across the group as a whole.
default 
defaultWhat can be found is that, ultimately, where there is a difference between extractive industries working and operating in developed countries, such as 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultCanada
default, versus developed communities.
default 
defaultThe footprint and the importance that can be attached to the other ancillary services—the investment in developing countries in things like education, healthcare, hospitals and building of vital infrastructure—is obviously magnified in those countries.
default 
defaultWe spent something like $700
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion last year on procurement from local contractors and suppliers in the DRC.
default 
defaultThat was from over 200 different suppliers and contractors.
default 
defaultThat in itself helps magnify the investment that the extractors make on the ground in developing countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ254 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I am always worried about people like Mr Mugabe.
default 
defaultIs any of your investment filtered off in a way that you would not really want to see?
default 
defaultDo you fear that, on the ground, there is a degree of payback that does not figure in your books?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Mr Binley, to put it succinctly, we invest and we pay our taxes that we are required to in the countries, in accordance with the rules and regulations governed locally, but also from a top level, from our code of conduct.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ255 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default You can give us a guarantee that no other money is filched away in any other way to people like Mr Mugabe and some of his cohort.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Mr Binley, as I have just said—
defaultMr Binley:default I want you to give me an undertaking.
default 
defaultIs that fair to say?
default 
defaultYou are an honourable company.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Absolutely.
default 
defaultWhat I can say is that we abide absolutely in line with our code of conduct and our principles, as being a member of the FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100 companies, abiding by the laws and rules and regulations of the countries where we operate, be it here in the UK or elsewhere.
default 
defaultIt is as simple as that.
default 
defaultMr Binley:default As far as you are aware, there is no backhand money changing hands.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: That is exactly the point I have just made in terms of how we abide as a corporate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ256 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I am conscious of time, but I do want to pursue the issue a little bit further, because this issue of the enormous profits you secure from operating in developing countries in particular, in relation to the benefits that are brought to those countries, is of significant public interest.
default 
defaultThere has been a description that many of the countries in which you are operating suffer a resource curse, in relation to the imbalance between the riches that they have and the benefits that people living there receive.
default 
defaultDo you think that is a myth?
default 
defaultWhat would you be doing as companies to address that issue?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: There are challenges with relatively underdeveloped countries that have a bounty of natural resources.
default 
defaultI think a couple of things.
default 
defaultOne, transparency is really important, so EITI, and making sure it is very transparent to all how tax revenues are levied and paid in particular jurisdictions is an important component.
default 
defaultThe second component is about capability building in those countries.
default 
defaultTo invest a resource bounty wisely and to have the infrastructure to be able to do that is not trivial.
default 
defaultIt takes time, effort and people in order to be able to understand how to receive and how best to invest that money, whether it is in education and skills or in a national wealth fund.
default 
defaultIt is about both 
defaultcorporates
default but also government helping other governments with building that capability to handle the resource wealth that they have accrued.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: I would back up all of those points about EITI, the need for transparency and the need for citizens to be able to hold their governments to account, in terms of where taxes have been received.
default 
defaultAlso, we have a broader contribution to make that is not always well communicated.
default 
defaultI use the example of the 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultGuinea
default, where Rio
default&#xa0;
defaultTinto has an iron ore project called 
defaultSimandou
default.
default 
defaultAgain, we know that there will not be vast numbers of people being employed at the mine site.
default 
defaultWhat we are trying to do is look at the southern economic growth corridor, so basically looking at the infrastructure that we will be building and how that infrastructure can be used for the greater population.
default 
defaultIt is those types of innovative ways of thinking.
default 
defaultYou do not want a country to be completely dependent on one company or one resource.
default 
defaultWe want to be operating in diversified economies.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ257 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I wonder if, just as a final question, Chair—I am conscious of time—that given all the good work that you describe your companies doing, how you explain—and I am quoting from the submission that we got from Christian Aid—that “nine out of the twelve African countries ranking lowest on the Human Development Index are mineral rich” and are therefore the countries in which you are operating.
default 
defaultIs that not something that you as companies should be embarrassed by?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: We are invited by host governments to develop their natural resources.
default 
defaultThey invite us in.
default 
defaultWe uphold our standards and our general business principles.
default 
defaultObviously, because we are listed here, we will hold 
defaultto 
defaultthe standards that apply here.
default 
defaultWe hold 
defaultto 
defaultthe standards that apply in the 
defaultUS
default and in the 
defaultNetherlands
default.
default 
defaultThe reality is, if we are giving taxation revenues, or sometimes governments will be joint venture partners, and therefore if those are earning those revenues, while we can encourage and influence governments through our role as being major companies in those countries, it is very difficult for us alone to go and inject ourselves and tell governments what to do with their money.
default 
defaultThat is a combination of civil society in that particular nation, and whether they are democratic or not I suspect has a part to play in this, but it is also a government
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultgovernment
default conversation about that capability building that I discussed earlier.
default 
defaultIt is about how you put in a good regulatory framework, how you ensure the rule of law and minimisation of corruption, and all of those components that lead to the effective use of wealth, rather than the non
default&#x2011;
defaulteffective
default use, as you seem to have referred to in the Christian Aid report.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: A point to add to that: our belief is that the countries where we operate, the developing countries, many of which are in 
defaultAfrica
default, ultimately need more foreign investment, not less.
default 
defaultUltimately, it can often be the case that it is the extractives industry that is first on the ground.
default 
defaultIt is helping put in place the infrastructure and it is helping set the pathway, to a certain extent, for greater investment to come in over a period of time, whilst 
defaultalso ensuring that the country benefits from its natural endowments and that we work with the local communities to ensure that, ultimately, there is a sustainable platform going forward.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ258 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default We are talking about countries in which many of the extractive industries have been operating for some considerable time without that sort of economic progress.
default 
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I agree, but it comes down to a number of factors.
default 
defaultUltimately, foreign investment in these countries over time, attracting greater scrutiny but also investment from other sectors, is a good thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ259 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Given
default that
default such a significant proportion of your profits comes from operating in these countries and you profess a very strong social mission, do you not think you could be doing more?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We are already doing a significant amount on the ground, be it in 
defaultSouth Africa
default, 
defaultZambia
default, a whole host of different countries in 
defaultAfrica
default.
default 
defaultIf the Committee takes up the opportunity to come and visit our operations in 
defaultSouth Africa
default, I would be happy to highlight some of those.
default 
defaultPlease rest assured that the investment we are making as an extractive in the countries where we operate is significant, not only for the benefit of local communities, but hopefully more broadly for the country itself.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: The other point there is just around the multi
default&#x2011;
defaultdecade
default nature of our industry.
default 
defaultWe cannot speak on behalf of the entire industry since time immemorial and what has been done, but rather companies like Rio Tinto need to have a social licence to operate.
default 
defaultWe need our local communities to want us to be there, ultimately.
default 
defaultYou are a guest in that country.
default 
defaultAs I said before, we thrive in a diversified economy.
default 
defaultWe do not want to be working in a country where everyone is solely dependent on our business, and so we do try, as much as we possibly can, to foster local content or skills and capability, and capacity building in government to better understand our industry.
default 
defaultWe are all working towards that aim.
default 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Thank you.
default 
defaultI could explore this much further, but I am conscious of time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ260 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just a very quick one to Charles: the European Investment Bank froze loans because of concerns about your company and its track record.
default 
defaultDid you find that a problem?
default 
defaultHave they unfrozen them as a result of the 
defaultpolicies
default that you have asserted here?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We are currently in the process of working with the EIB to ensure we come to a beneficial conclusion for both parties.
defaultChair:default I just want to go on now to William on EITI issues, before we finish.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ261 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default Thank you, Chair.
default 
defaultIf I can first pose this question to Mr 
defaultWatenphul
default, in your written evidence you rightly point to the other regulatory requirements that exist elsewhere in the world as well as EITI.
default 
defaultYou talk about the Dodd–Frank Act and the EU accounting directive that is due to come into force as well.
default 
defaultAs has come out in the evidence, there are different regulatory standards in other parts of the world, so what do you say are the key 
defaulttransparency and accountability issues that affect your sector and this country and require further legislative activity from this Parliament?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I would, Mr Bain, point to the fact that again it comes back to the fact that our footprint is quite small in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultIt is our main listing, but what ultimately the UK has done in terms of helping support the transparency process is to sign up to becoming a member of the EITI.
default 
defaultThat can only be a good thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ262 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default You will be aware of the strong public pressure towards greater transparency.
default 
defaultThere have been some very prominent campaigns run this year, calling for country
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultcountry
default, company
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultcompany
default reporting.
default 
defaultWhat would your view on mandatory reporting country by country be?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Our view would be that, with the EU transparency directive that is going to be coming into place, that is something we as an industry will face anyway.
default 
defaultIt is something that we are already working towards as a company, and greater transparency for the end benefit, in terms of helping those countries take full account of the natural endowments they have, which is what the EITI is doing, should be a good thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ263 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default If that commitment extended to 
defaultAfrica
default, what changes would that mean for your business as one which operates in that continent?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: I do not think it would mean any change, because it is not just about operating from local standards; it is ensuring that we as a corporate have a platform of standards that abridge all the jurisdictions where we operate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ264 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default Just to inform the Committee, what are the principal differences between what you have to do to satisfy the regulatory requirements of EITI and those other systems where there is a different set of regulations in place—that are not signed up to EITI?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: We take the approach that we operate in the same manner in those countries that are not signed up to EITI as we do elsewhere.
default 
defaultIt should not be a question of a set of rules for each different country where you operate.
default 
defaultWe, as responsible 
defaultcorporates
default, need to ensure that there is a system and policy put in place that is embedded throughout the organisation to ensure that they are the same principles that you act by regardless of where you operate.
defaultMr Bain:default Mr Daniels, Ms Hopkins, any further comments to add to that specific point about the difference between the EITI regulations and those countries that do not take part in it?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I am not sure I am completely familiar with all of the regulations, so I
default&#xa0;
defaultwould probably struggle to make much more comment than Mr 
defaultWatenphul
default, but I would just re
default&#x2011;
defaultemphasise that we are a founder signatory of EITI ourselves; we are very supportive of the UK being a signatory of EITI.
default 
defaultWe are supportive of country
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultcountry
default reporting, provided it is legal—my caveat from earlier.
default 
defaultMy concern is of course, and there have been pressures around this, that once you get country
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultcountry
default reporting in the bag, all of a sudden we go to the next level of granularity and say, “Okay, great; now let’s do project
default&#x2011;
defaultby
default&#x2011;
defaultproject
default reporting.”
default 
defaultI have a number of concerns with that: one, commercial confidentiality.
default 
defaultThere is a concern about just the mountain of data and who is going to trawl through all of this material.
default 
defaultAlso, the reality is the 
defaultreason we are doing this is to help developing nations and nations around the world be responsible custodians of the bounty that comes to them from natural resources.
default 
defaultFurther granularity I do not think really helps.
default 
defaultIt is about putting more effort into capability building with host governments, rather than getting ever more granular with the data that we provide.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: I can reiterate our support for EITI over and over again.
default 
defaultTransparency for Rio Tinto, and we say it in our 
defaultTaxes Paid
default report, which we have been doing for three years now, makes business sense.
default 
defaultThat is what gives us the confidence and gives our shareholders confidence in us, but also the communities in which we are operating or countries in which we wish to be a guest.
default 
defaultThat is what gives us that licence to operate.
default 
defaultThere is the point around the EU accountancy directive rules, which will come into force in 2015, and there is Dodd–Frank in the 
defaultUS
default.
default 
defaultEITI is aimed at governments and the other legislation is aimed at companies.
default 
defaultIt goes back to the point earlier on, which is that, in its current form, we think that all of these various initiatives and regulations will add to transparency, but if there are additional layers on top of that, it does start to get very complicated in terms of the type of reporting requirements that are on us.
default 
defaultHowever, generally, we are all very supportive of the principles.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ265 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default It is an interesting point, because it puts the three of you at odds with the Mining Association of the 
defaultUK
default, which is not an enormous fan of EITI.
default 
defaultAre there any changes that any of the three of you would recommend to the regulation of the industry at all in this country?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: In terms of oil and gas, I think I have made all the points I would wish to make around stability of regulation, stability of taxation and making sure the legality issue around taxation reporting in different countries is sorted.
default 
defaultMaintaining a focused, clear energy strategy for the country is important.
default 
defaultGiven where the challenge of energy is going in the coming decades, it is not simply an extrapolation of the last 50 years.
default 
defaultThe energy system of the 
defaultUK
default is going to have to change quite significantly in the next 50 years, so a good thought
default&#x2011;
defaultthrough
default strategy and a stable regime is really important for that to be effective over time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ266 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default Can you give us an indication of the regulatory cost in this country of complying with the different rules on listing and other financial requirements, anyone?
defaultEd Danielsdefault: I am sorry.
default 
defaultWe can write to you.
default 
defaultThat is quite a broad question, I have to say, if I may.
defaultMr Bain:default Relative to that in other countries where you are listed or in which you operate.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Principally about listing?
defaultMr Bain:default Yes.
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: That is difficult for us, given how long ago we listed.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: It is certainly easier for us, given the cost associated with the respective listings is contained in our publicly available prospectuses and documents.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: In terms of the cost of compliance with the UK’s very high corporate governance regime, all of the companies within ICMM and international mining companies that are based here would believe that that cost of compliance is worth it, because it gives us access to a pool of investors and it gives our shareholders confidence in our companies.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ267 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default There are obviously other factors at play in your decision to list in this country rather than other countries.
default 
defaultYou have talked about education and some of the other factors.
default 
defaultCan I address this just to Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultWatenphul
default?
default 
defaultIn your written evidence, you said, “If the 
defaultUK
default wishes to remain an attractive location for extractive companies, it should seek to maintain a regulatory regime that not only imposes high standards but does so with the minimum cost to companies and the public purse.”
default 
defaultIs it your contention that the current system satisfies that requirement in terms of minimum cost, or is that a warning that any change to the current regulatory regime might potentially cause your company to think about listing elsewhere?
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Again, we are very proud to be listed on the FTSE
default&#xa0;
default100.
default 
defaultIt 
defaultprovides the extractive industry in general with a huge amount of expertise that can then be exported overseas.
default 
defaultYou have read verbatim from our submission.
default 
defaultTo be honest, Mr Bain, there is not much more to add to that.
default 
defaultIt is clear that the 
defaultUK
default has a real opportunity to continue to maintain its position as, arguably, the pre
default&#x2011;
defaulteminent place in the world for the extractives industry, in terms of expertise and to list.
default 
defaultThat should remain the case.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Thank you.
default 
defaultThat concludes our current list of questions.
default 
defaultCan I emphasise that obviously there were a number of issues that you could not give a detailed response to?
default 
defaultThese will be noted, and we would appreciate you coming back with further evidence on them.
defaultQ268 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default Chairman, one thing: Ms Hopkins mentioned a paper on Rio Tinto’s economic contribution to the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultIf you have not already sent that to the Committee, it would be very useful for us to see that.
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Happy to do so, yes.
default 
defaultMr Walker:default If the other businesses have anything similar, we would certainly be very grateful to see them.
default 
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Yes, we can send ours.
defaultChair:default In addition, it is very likely that we will want to write to you with further questions arising from evidence that we have had submitted to us.
default 
defaultWe would expect a response from you.
default 
defaultIf we do not feel that is adequate, we will be calling you again.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ269 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default We have had some quite detailed submissions made in relation to social and environmental concerns, in relation particularly to mining operations that operate in a number of countries in which you operate.
default 
defaultYou obviously operate in some very mineral
default&#x2011;
defaultrich
default countries and some very wealthy countries, but where many of the people live in grinding poverty.
default 
defaultCan we have an undertaking from you that, when we write to you about these issues—because we want to get the proper sources of the allegations that are being made—you will investigate and give detailed responses?
defaultTara Hopkinsdefault: Absolutely.
defaultEd Danielsdefault: Yes.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: Yes.
defaultChair:default I would emphasise that, if we are not satisfied with the responses, then we will invite you again to address that.
defaultCharles defaultWatenphuldefault: That is understood.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default On that note, can I thank you again for your contribution?
default 
defaultWe look forward to further correspondence with you.
default 
defaultThank you very much.
