[[[Support for Single register of Electrical Contractors]]]

[[[Submission Summary :]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Personal Details]]]My name is Harold Roger Lovegrove.  I am an Incorporated Electrical Engineer, Fellow of the Institution of Engineering Technology.  I have been in the electrical installation industry all of my working life: apprentice, electrician, contracts engineer, manager, managing director.   Consultant for 25 years  specialising in Inspection and Testing Electrical Installations, investigating electrical installation problems and providing electrical installation condition reports.  Also I provide expert witness services and reports.   &#xa0;

[[[Reasons for support]]]I strongly support the need of a single electrical safety register as launched by the ECA and the ESC for electrical contractors operating in the domestic and commercial / industrial electrical installation market place for the following reasons:&#xa0;The register will be of great benefit to consumers, clients and specifiers as a single reference point to  source a competent electrical contractor.&#xa0;I have found many installations that are sub-standard and many with dangerous conditions.&#xa0;Invariably the cause has been incompetence of the installer: poor workmanship; a lack of technical knowledge; non-compliance with Wiring Regulations, BS 7671.&#xa0;

[[[Building Regulations Part P]]]Previous governments set up Part P of the Building regulations with the intention of improving the safety of electrical installations in dwellings.  Part P made it a legal requirement for electrical installation work in dwellings to comply with the BS7671: Requirements for Electrical Installations - The IET Wiring Regulations.  Most competent electrical contractors understand these regulations and the Part P requirement to be registered with a ‘competence persons scheme provider’. Hence in the main Part P was welcomed by electrical contractors.&#xa0;The requirements of Part P were originally fairly restrictive for non-electrical persons and DIY installers to undertake electrical installation work.  In my view Part P has been very effective. It has improved competence in the industry and made DIYer’s more aware of the dangers electricity can create in their homes.  The downside that Building Control Departments have been unable to adequately police the system.&#xa0;The 2011 revision to Part P has watered down the technical requirements of Part P, also it now permits electrical installation work to be carried out by unqualified persons providing the work is checked and certified by a competent third party.  This part of the revision is not yet in operation as there are no third party competent person schemes yet in operation. Until there is, home safety standards are likely   to drop back to pre-2005 standards and the door is open again for Rogue traders and DYEers&#xa0;

[[[Competent Persons Scheme Operators.]]]At the onset of Part P there were six or seven scheme operators. Some of which have been in place for many years enabling contractors to register voluntarily.  Some schemes typically NICEIC are well known in the construction industry also to Local Authorities and Housing Associations etc.&#xa0;Because there are so many different scheme operators each having their own rules and criteria, standards and qualifying requirements are wide and varied.  Some of the operators provide training courses to their own standards and specifications. There is no common denominator. Also there needs to be a common approach to training not only to contractors but the trainers who train them. &#xa0;Most scheme operators are monitored by UKAS but this does not necessarily mean that there is a common standard or common procedures in place.&#xa0;Competition between scheme operators means that standards vary.  I understand that some operators may only carry out a ‘desk top’ assessment of an applicant whereas others will insist on always visiting the contractor’s premises, to examine the businesses procedures, documentation and equipment, prior to inspecting some of the contractor’s on-site installation work.&#xa0;Discipline is another issue.  It is not uncommon for a contractor who has been removed from a register for bad work or other serious non-conformity to become registered with another scheme operator almost immediately without any reference being made to the original operator’s reasons for removal.&#xa0;I have seen a contractor advertising registration with two scheme operators. When questioned I was informed that he was given registration by the second operator in order to promote their scheme.   &#xa0;

[[[ it can be seen that the present situation with a number of scheme operators having various standards is most unsatisfactory from not only a safety perspective but ]]]

[[[also for public perception of the effectiveness of the Part P legislation.  I therefore ]]]
