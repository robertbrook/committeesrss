"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) (CYS 057)\n&#xa0;\nCIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,000 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT membe\nrs plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems and infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.\n&#xa0;\nCIHT welcomes the opportunity to\n submit evidence to the Committee’s call for evidence on \nCycling Safety\n. CIHT responses are based on inputs from members of our \nRoad Safety and Urban Design\n panel\ns\n.\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;CIHT aim\ns\n to encourage more people to cycle safely and more regu\nlarly for \ntheir everyday travel, as part of a\n wider promotion of sustainable transport and development.\n&#xa0;\nCIHT members are involved in road safety and traffic management, and the scale of recent cyclist death\ns\n and injury in London\n, as with all casualties and deaths a\ncross users of the highway network,\n has been both shocking and \ngives\n cause for concern.\n&#xa0;\n These incidents appear to raise common problems of conflict at busy intersections and of inherent hazards between certain vehicle types, especially between cyclists an\nd buses or heavy goods vehicles.\n&#xa0;\nCycling has substantial health benefits for physical and mental wellbeing, as well as having a \nmuch lower\n \nenvironmental impact than motor transport, and CIHT continues to urge all highway authorities to maintain these bene\nfits while delivering infrastructure and other actions to \nreduce\n cyclist injury\n. Although there \nhas been a decline in the level of risk to cycling over the longer term, there have been more recent increases in the rate of killed and serious injuries\n, which\n is at odds with other transport modes\n.\n&#xa0;In part due to these concerns, although there has been an increase in l\nevels of both cycle use and investment in cycling\n, take up\n across the UK \nremains\n variable and considerably lower than is achieved in many other western European nations.  \n&#xa0;1.0              Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?&#xa0;\n1.1              \nThe first point to make is that ‘safety’ is always relative – there is no absolutely safe mode of \ntransport.  Cycling in the UK, expressed in terms of casualties per mile cycled, is safer than other countries such as the US, but less\n safe \nthan \ncountries such as \nthe Netherlands and Denmark.\n  The aim must be to ma\nke cycling \nin the UK \nas safe as in the \nbest\n countries.\n  However, it should be recognised that the risk of a cycling fatality in the UK, per mile travelled, is about half what it was 20 years ago\n. M\nany people believe cycling to be more hazardous than walking, yet deaths per mile travelled by cyc\nlist have been lower that for pedestrians for every year since 1994\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.2              \nUnfortunately \nthe risk per mile of being killed or seriously injured in when cycling has increased\n more recently\n, and this is worrying, particularly since the risks for other mode\ns of travel have continued to decline.  The reasons for this are not fully clear, but many of the fatalities that have occurred have involved cyclists and HGVs\n, particularly when the HGV is turning left at a junction.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3              \nThe health benefits of cycling a\nlso need to be taken into account – people die from illnesses brought on by inactivity as well as through road traffic accidents.  Cycling has been \nshown to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancers, which together kill over a hu\nndred times the number of people who die \non the roads.\n&#xa0;\n1.4              \nUrban areas are complex and present a characteristic combination of hazards that \nresult in, per\n \nmile cycled\n, \na higher number of collisions involving a cyclist than in \nrural areas.  Cyclists are \nmore likely to encounter congestion and compete with motorists\n, particularly at junctions where most collisions take place.  Due to the higher traffic speeds involved though, collisions in rural ar\neas tend to be more severe – when they do occur the cyclist\n has a greater chance of being killed or seriously injured.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.0              What Central and local Government could do to improve cycling safety?&#xa0;\n2.1              \nSuccessive Governments have demonstrated a commitment to promoting cycling by \ndedicated \nfunding, issuing policy not\nes and publishing guidance.  \nUnfortunately t\nhe outcome has been mixed, with some provision being disjointed or of limited use to \nmore confident \ncyclists.  However\n the recent increases in the levels of cycling in some places, particularly in London and the \ncentres of the larger cities, as well as the ‘Cycling Demonstration Towns’, indicates that\n promoting cycling is succeeding.  Success in terms of safety \nmust now follow and will \ncome from joint working \nbetween central and local government\n, the Institutions \nand cycling organisations\n, \nidentifying the challenges\n and developing \nand implementing \nbetter solutions\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2              \nIn order to make this happen, s\nenior political and executive commitment at both national and local level \nmust \nbe\n achieved\n to \nsupport \na \npackage of m\neasures to increase both cycle \nuse\n \nand cycle\n safety\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3              \nCIHT believes that \na return to the setting and delivery of casualty reduction targets\n has a key part to play in this\n.  There is solid evidence that they are successful in reducing road deaths and in\njury, \nand \nthe CIHT believes the abandonment of targets in the current Roa\nd Safety Framework should be reconsidered\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4              \nLocal authorities and police forces have always had a key role in the implementation and achievement of casualty reduction in Great Bri\ntain over the last two decades. We endorse the view that decisions about local roads are best taken at the local level. Our concern, however, is that an emphasis on decentralisation with no commitment from central government to monitor progress may lead to\n inconsistency around the country with some authorities continuing to focus on road safety and others concentrating on different local priorities\n, disbanding the professional safety teams that were part of many authorities\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.5              \nAs the DfT\n itself has admitted in the Strategic Framework, performance in casualty reduction around the country is varied. Decentralisation is likely to exacerbate that position. It is vital to monitor independently performance across local authorities and the diffe\nrent administrations and to share good practice across the profession. The Strategic Framework fails to do this.\n&#xa0;\n2.6              \nRoad Safety A\nudit is an acknowledged technique that reduces risks of individual schemes and also allows highway authorities and their \ndesigners to learn from past experiences.\n  \nGovernment should work with stakeholders to promote\n the development of a mechanism for \nincreasing \nthe knowledge of road safety practitioners \non cycling matters, which will then be shared \nwith \nhighway designers. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.0              Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?&#xa0;\n3.1              \nWe know that many people who wish to take up cycling are deterred by the fact that on most roads in the UK they will have to share space with traffic.\n&#xa0;\n Achieving some separ\nation from motor vehicles is therefore important if we are to match the levels that are seen in other countries.\n&#xa0;\n3.2              \nIt is certainly feasible for new roads to be designed and developed to incorporate segregation, and there is a need for highway standards \n(such as the Highways Agency’s Design Manual) to be updated with this in mind.\n&#xa0;\n It will be more difficult on much of the existing highway network, but there are many sections of road where there is space that can be reallocated to cycling.\n&#xa0;\n This could be d\none by a slight reduction in the width of traffic lanes, removing areas of hatching and so on.\n&#xa0;\n Only in exceptional circumstances should space be taken from pedestrians, but sometimes there are very wide footpaths that are only lightly used. \n&#xa0;\n3.3              \nNew tech\nniques such as ‘light segregation’ (dividing off cycle lanes with bollards, planters or ‘armadillos’) offer promising ways of giving cyclists a good degree of actual and perceived safety at relatively low cost and need to be rolled out much more widely. \n&#xa0;\n3.4              \nWhere segregation is not possible then cycling must be made more safe and pleasant through reducing traffic speeds and flows.\n&#xa0;\n CIHT welcomes the recent guidance by Government which makes it easier for local authorities to introduce 20mph limits and zon\nes, and wishes to see them introduced more widely in urban areas.\n&#xa0;\n3.5              \nAt junctions, where most collisions occur, a choice needs to\n be \nmade between segregating and integrating cyclists.  \nThere are fewer conflict points when cyclists are integrated with tra\nffic, but this will only be attractive to cyclists (particularly novice ones) at lightly trafficked locations.\n \nAt busy and complex junctions segregation will often be needed, but it must be done carefully so that cyclists do not lose out in terms of priori\nty or delay, or they will simply remain on the road.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6              \nDrivers must also \nclearly recognise when cyclists are returned to the traffic flow that they are to be treated as any other vehicle, and given the space and respect they need.  There is a role for Government here in educating drivers how to engage with cyclists, as has been\n done in other countries such as Ireland. \n&#xa0;\n4.0               Other ideas for improving cycling safety&#xa0;\n4.1              \nThe Welsh Government has recently enacted the Active Travel Act, which will require all Welsh authorities to develop a strategy for developing safe and attractiv\ne cycling and walking routes, with a 15 year horizon.  The Act also requires authorities to plan for walking and cycling when designing and improving highways, a significant step.  This has the potential to bring cycling into the mainstream and CIHT would \nwelcome its introduction in other parts of the UK.\n&#xa0;\n4.2              \nCentral \nGovernment needs to take more of a lead in the trialling, development and rolling out of innovative (to the UK) solutions which improve the convenience and safety of routes used by cyclists.  Many techniques that are used in other countries – such as low l\nevel \ncycle-specific \nsignals, combined cycle and pedes\ntrian zebras and two-stage turns at junctions\n – are impossible or difficult to achieve within current UK legislation and practice.  \n&#xa0;\n4.3              \nGovernment is working with Transport for London on the trialling \nof some new ideas at TRL, but CIHT calls on the DfT to go further and faster, taking a much more proactive role\n, \nand \ndeveloping a culture of continuous improvement. \n \n&#xa0;\n4.4              \nAchieving better outcomes \nshould be based around a \nproven evidence base and \nsound principles of likely net benefit.  Road safety professionals have skills central to \nthese \nissues and \nthe development of better \npolicies in highway design and management\n.\n \nPromoting the collation of an evidence base for road safety professionals to ref\nerence\n will help them in this role\n.\n \nIn all areas, road safety skills must be integrated to maximise \nthe benefits for cyclists and other road users \nwithout \nan \nadverse safety impact.  Properly managed, many schemes can deliver reductions in cost, environment\nal and casualty levels.\n&#xa0;\n4.5              \nBecause of the historic low levels of investment and political support, there is a real \nskills gap amongst highway professionals.  There should be support for\n the development of skilled and motivated delivery teams\n centrally or\n regionally\n, able to engage with colleagues \nwithin \nlocal authorit\nies\n and\n external organisations\n. Government should also work with the Institutions and other stakeholders to develop and roll out training for highway professionals \nso that they are better inf\normed on how to design for cycling.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nRoad casualties Great Britain 2011\n"
