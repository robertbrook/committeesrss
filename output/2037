default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGeneral:default We support the overall thrust of the Bill to be deregulatory but do not have the knowledge and experience to comment on the best way to achieve deregulation within the Parliamentary process. However we support the consensus approach used by the Stakeholder Working Group (SWG), which underpins part of the Bill.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe note that other bodies are trying to make use of the Bill to 
defaultadd regulationdefault and implore the Committee to not allow this to happen.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst additional regulation may not be in itself a breach of human rights we think that additional regulation by opportunist additions at the last minute into this Bill would not be properly consulted on and examined by the governments own advisers and would be contrary to the rights of our members.

defaultPublic Highways and Rights of Way:  defaultOur members are not to any great extent affected, positively or negatively by the current proposals in sections 12-18 of the Bill and the associated Schedules. However, we support the work and recommendations of the Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) on which we were represented LARA. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals from the SWG were arrived at by a consensus approach. In fact it was an agreement within the SWG that only proposals agreed by all parties would be put forward and that they were intended to be a package of measures and not to be cherry picked.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe welcome this consensus approach and believe there is more to be achieved by continuing the work of the SWG.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe note that certain members of the SWG are submitting evidence that breaks ranks with 
defaultthe  SWG
default principles of consensus which we deplore and 
defaultare at best disingenuous. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe SWG was set up to find alternatives to the Discovering Lost Ways Project. We think the current proposals are a step in the right direction and as such are supported but there is more to do. Implementing the existing proposals as set out in the Bill will confirm the consensus approach and enable to SWG to continue its work.

defaultGLASS have been active in assisting local authorities recording public rights and are aware of the excessive burden for the Definitive Map Modification Order (DMMO) process introduced in the 1981 Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 
defaultand believe the SWG has the ability to seek further deregulation of this process. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are also concerned that some groups/organisations are promoting a proposal that that all unsealed public roads and byways open to all traffic are administratively downgraded to restricted byway status.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that there is no evidential case made for any of these proposals, and that they will introduce an additional layer of regulation and burden, and that any change in this area of law and practice should first go through a proper process of public consultation.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCountryside access organisation is an emotive topic and impacts on Land Owners, Local Authorities, and Rights of Way (ROW) user organisations.  Scotland has 
defaulteffectivly
default deregulated it ROW structure and Wales is consulting on similar proposals at this time.  Any restriction to access that is considered should be properly consulted on and examined by the governments own advisers in this area before making recommendations for change.

defaultThis submission is from The Green Lane Association Ltd which is the only national representative organisation for four wheel drive recreational motorists who use our now limited network of Byways Open to All Traffic, Unsealed Public Roads and other legal public 
defaulthigways
default around the UK.  We have a base line of over 700 members and a further 
default47,432 
default associates

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2006 we have attempted to continue recording Lost Ways but have encountered difficulties in pursuing the public’s rights.  The most arduous of these is the work required to justify DMMO claims at Public Inquiries (PI’s).  Objections to the DMMO process require the Planning Inspectorate (PIN’s) to become involved and many days of their time can be spent determining the facts of the case for correcting the Definitive Map and Statement (DMS). We

defaultThe Cost of Maintenance and Repair of Byways.default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe standard of ‘good repair’ for BOATs and unsealed roads, and the cost of repair, is an issue that has been debated for many years. It is our experience (and that of horse-riders as regards bridleways, and walkers as regards footpaths) that highway authorities often put a price on maintenance and repair far in excess of what it costs in the ‘real world’. Where volunteers get 
defaultinvolved,
default or local small contractors, perfectly good jobs are done at a small fraction of authority estimates. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGLASS provides finance and volunteers to The 
defaultTreadlightly
default Trust which is a UK charity set up to educate and inform stakeholders in public all 
defaultpurpose  rights
default of way.  
defaultTreadlightly
default has been able to repair many ROW for the cost of materials alone and with its association of trained Ambassadors and volunteer workforce has been able to show some significant improvements on 
defaultunsurfaced
default routes around the UK.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultTreadlightly
default Trust has commissioned costing information from such bodies as the Forestry 
defaultCommision
default Wales.  Their maintenance and repair cost for the forestry tracks used by their heavy equipment and it is a fraction of the costs of Highway Authorities road maintenance cost.  This is in part due to the nature of the work done and the specification standards adopted by forestry officials.   
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGLASS requests your Committee to note that other bodies are proposing the downgrading of vehicular ways to Restricted Byways on the basis of excessive costs to repair. Their figures are greatly exaggerated. Most Highway Authorities have spent little or nothing on their byways in the last 50 years yet they remain usable by all parties. Ongoing maintenance cost is not in itself a reason for closure.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe ask you to also note that Restricted Byways would still require maintenance as they are full width roads with their major users being agriculture and property access. Your Governments own investigation found that recreational use of byways is only about one third of the total so removing it would make little difference to cost of repair.
defaultWe would be please to provide further more detailed evidence should you 
defaultcommittee require it.
