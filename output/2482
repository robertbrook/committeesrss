defaultFreedom from Torture default&#xa0;
defaultFreedom from Torture, formerly known as the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, is a UK-ba
defaultsed human rights organisation and one of the world’s largest torture treatment centres.  
defaultSince our foundation more than 25 years ago, more than 50,000 people 
defaulthave been referred to us 
defaultand we currently have centres in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham and Glasgow.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe organisation exists to enable survivors of torture and organised violence to engage in a healing process to assert their own human dignity and worth.  
defaultOur concer
defaultn for the health and wellbeing of torture survivors and their families is directed towards providing 
defaultmedical, psychiatric and psychological consultation, assessment and treatment, short and long term rehabilitation through social care, casework and counsel
defaultling, psychotherapy, physiotherapy, complementary therapies, group and family work, as well as practical assistance with accommodation and welfare agencies.  Our holistic approach recognises the wellbeing of the whole person and that absence of access to j
defaultustice to secure protection and welfare and housing impacts adversely on torture survivors and can inhibit the efficacy of therapy.
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedom from Torture also accepts instructions for the preparation of forensic medico-legal reports documenting torture in 
defaultaccordance with the international standard set out in the Istanbul Protocol and the organisation prepares 
defaultbetween 
default300-600 medico-legal reports per year.  It is also our mission to educate decision-makers and the public about torture and its consequences, w
defaulthile our advocacy work strives to ensure that the UK and other states honour their international obligations with regard to torture.

defaultTorture survivors are among the most vulnerable of asylum seekers
default.
default 
defaultMany 
defaultsuffer 
defaultfrom the consequences of torture for years 
defaultafter its infliction
default and struggle to rehabilitate as they progress through the asylum system
default here in the UK
default.

default,
default 
defaultleading to a

defaulture 
defaultto apply relevant law and policy
default,
default is a pervasive problem
default. 
defaultThere is also a culture of disbelief within the Home Office which compounds the difficulty that many torture survivors experience in disclosing torture to g
defaultovernment officials and leads to incorrect assessments of credibility and mishandling of medico-legal evidence of torture injuries. 
defaultTh
defaulte
defaults
defaulte problems
default lead to flawed decision
default-
defaultmaking by the Home Office
default which protracts the asylum process and exacerbates mental health difficulties associated with torture
default that survivors struggle to cope with
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAgainst this backdrop, access to high quality, specialist legal advice is essential to ensure protection is grant
defaulted as quickly as possible to torture survivors 
defaultwho require it
default and that their other rights are also protected
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAccess to justice is an important element of the right to rehabilitation, guaranteed to torture survivors by Article 14 of the UN Convention Aga
defaultinst Torture. In its recent General Comment on this article of the 
defaulttreaty
default, the Committee Against Torture emphasised that ‘
defaultthe provision of means for as full rehabilitation as possible for anyone who has suffered harm as a result of a violation of the Conve
defaultntion should be holistic and include medical and psychological care as well as 
defaultlegal
default and social services
default’
default (emphasis added).
default The Committee also affirmed that
default States parties to this treaty must ensure that access to justice is available to all torture victims including ‘asylum-seekers, refugees or others under international protection’. The UK has been a party to this treaty since 8 December 1988.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe regret
default that the government did not await the outcome of this inquiry by the Joint Committee on Human Rights before finalising and publishing its response to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation 
defaultconducted 
defaultearlier this year.
default 
defaultThe proposals will affect many vulne
defaultrable groups, including torture survivors, and it is imperative that careful scrutiny of their human rights impact is undertaken before any reforms are finalised and implemented.
default&#xa0;
defaultResidence Testdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of a test requiring one year of lawful resi
defaultdence before becoming eligible for
default civil
default legal aid is likely to be found unlawful
default in 
defaulta number of respects
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe residence test would have a deleterious impact on survivors of torture recognised as ref
defaultugees or granted subsidiary protection:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe residence test would 
defaultimpede access to justice for 
defaultsurvivors of torture who

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultPaying for permission work in judicial revidefaultew casesdefault&#xa0;
defaultFreedom from Torture is concerned
default at the proposal
default 
default(as modified) 
defaultthat
default there should be discretion given to the Legal Aid Agency to pay pr
defaultoviders
default 
defaultfor work done prior to permission being granted for judicial review 
default(the original provision
default was that no
default fees would be paid unless permission w
defaultas
default granted). T
defaulthe effect of this proposal 
defaultis likely
default to reduce the availability of 
defaultspecialist 
defaultlegal advice and representation 
defaultpertaining 
defaultto judicial review across many areas of decision-making by public authorities a
defaultffecting survivors of torture. 
defaultWe welcome the in
defaultdication
default in Annex B
default that there will be further consultation on this in a separate paper as the criteria for exercising such discretion and how often it would be applied will 
defaultaffect
default whether or not lawyers are 
defaultprepared to take instructions on such cases. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt will be clear from 
defaultexam
defaultples given above that judicial review provides torture survivors with an important legal safeguard against poor quality decision-making by the Home Office, local authorities (especial
defaultly in relation to social services and housing departments) and a range of other public authorities. Typical examples of flawed decisions by public authorities concerning our clients include failure to consider fresh representations as a fresh asylum claim,
default delays in deciding asylum claims (in some cases for three years or more), 
defaultrefusal of permission to appeal to the 
defaultAsylum and Immigration Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, failure to properly assess eligibility for entitlements including community care support
default, and failure to comply with policy concessions relating to torture survivors (for example with respect to the frequency of reporting
default for those seeking asylum
default).
defaultOur clients are 
defaultalready 
defaultexperiencing difficulty in finding specialist 
defaultlegal representation for j
defaultudicial
default 
defaultreview actions following the 
defaultprevious 
defaultcuts to legal aid in April of this year. 
defaultFreedom from Torture is concerned that placing applications for judicial review ‘at risk’ will
default further
default restrict legal practitioners’ capacity
default in this area
default,
default 
defaultthereby
default reduc
defaulting the availability 
defaultto our vulnerable clients 
defaultof legal advice and representation 
defaultrelating to judicial review matters
default.  
default&#xa0;default‘defaultBorderlinedefault’default casesdefault&#xa0;defaultFreedom from Torture is disappointed that the Government intends to remove legal aid for
default,
default in particular
default,
default housing, welfare and asylum cases with only a 
default‘
defaultborderline
default’
default prospect of success.
default&#xa0;
defaultMerits in asylum cases are difficult to assess as country situations often change more quickly than case law or country specific information and policies giving guidance on 
defaultthe factual human rights situation in specific countries or in respect of specific groups.  The accounts of individual applicants escaping torture and persecution may provide evidence that has not yet come to light and challenges existing knowledge and cas
defaulte law with regards to situations of torture.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe asylum and human rights protection cases of survivors of torture a
defaultre
default 
defaultfrequently highly complex.  Evidence in the case may develop over time.  Survivors of torture may be traumatised by their experience and 
defaultneed time and the development of a relationship of trust in order to be able to give a full account of their experiences of torture.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFreedom from Torture is concerned that the civil legal aid funding system incentivises legal practitioners, especially t
defaulthose who are less experienced, to avoid taking on complex cases, with the risk that survivors of torture are unable to challenge decisions refusing protection and placing them at risk of removal to situations where they face torture and other forms of pers
defaultecution.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current funding regime allows legal aid to be provided in cases considered to be 
default‘
defaultborderline
default’
default if the life, liberty and phy
defaultsical safety of an individual are
default affected, if they are at risk of homelessness or if the case would involve a breach of
default human rights protected 
defaultby the European Convention on Human Rights. Freedom from Torture considers that these safeguards are an essential means of ensuring that deserving cases including those involving torture survivors, often involving risk to life and p
defaulthysical safety, are brought before the courts.

defaultAs described above, the medico-legal reports commissioned from Freedom from Torture

defaultservice 
defaultwhich
default has to be subsidised from charitable funds
default. This 
defaultcontributes to a
default limit
defaultation 
defaulton the number of
default reports 
defaultwe 
defaultcan provide
default and the speed with which we can produce them

defaultA
defaultny further erosion of fees payable by the Legal Aid Agency 
defaultfor expert reports of this sorts 
defaultis likely to 
defaultimpact detrimentally on the accessibility of our service (
defaultand the services of other providers
default of medico-legal reports relating to torture
default) to 
defaulttorture survivors. 
default&#xa0;defaultIn many cases torture survivors need expert interpreters to help elicit 
defaultproperly the details of 
defaultthe abuse they have suffered and any diminution in rate
defaults payable 
defaultis likely to drive specialist interpreters from this market which would in turn compromise the ability of 
defaulttorture survivors
default to communicate clearly what has happened to them
default. The vocabulary
default and understanding of clinical issues
default, 
defaultas well as the 
defaultemotional 
defaultdemands of this work, make specialist interpreting provision for this vulnerable group especially important
default.
