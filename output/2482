[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedom from Torture [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedom from Torture, formerly known as the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, is a UK-ba
[normal]sed human rights organisation and one of the world’s largest torture treatment centres.  
[normal]Since our foundation more than 25 years ago, more than 50,000 people 
[normal]have been referred to us 
[normal]and we currently have centres in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham and Glasgow.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The organisation exists to enable survivors of torture and organised violence to engage in a healing process to assert their own human dignity and worth.  
[normal]Our concer
[normal]n for the health and wellbeing of torture survivors and their families is directed towards providing 
[normal]medical, psychiatric and psychological consultation, assessment and treatment, short and long term rehabilitation through social care, casework and counsel
[normal]ling, psychotherapy, physiotherapy, complementary therapies, group and family work, as well as practical assistance with accommodation and welfare agencies.  Our holistic approach recognises the wellbeing of the whole person and that absence of access to j
[normal]ustice to secure protection and welfare and housing impacts adversely on torture survivors and can inhibit the efficacy of therapy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedom from Torture also accepts instructions for the preparation of forensic medico-legal reports documenting torture in 
[normal]accordance with the international standard set out in the Istanbul Protocol and the organisation prepares 
[normal]between 
[normal]300-600 medico-legal reports per year.  It is also our mission to educate decision-makers and the public about torture and its consequences, w
[normal]hile our advocacy work strives to ensure that the UK and other states honour their international obligations with regard to torture.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Torture survivors [bold]and [bold]the[bold] UK[bold] asylum system[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Torture survivors are among the most vulnerable of asylum seekers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Many 
[normal]suffer 
[normal]from the consequences of torture for years 
[normal]after its infliction
[normal] and struggle to rehabilitate as they progress through the asylum system
[normal] here in the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]Failure by 
[normal]the Home 
[normal]Office 
[normal]to 
[normal]identify
[normal] survivors of torture 
[normal]during the screening 
[normal]and substantive 
[normal]interview 
[normal]process
[normal]es
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]leading to a 
[normal]fail
[normal]ure 
[normal]to apply relevant law and policy
[normal],
[normal] is a pervasive problem
[normal]. 
[normal]There is also a culture of disbelief within the Home Office which compounds the difficulty that many torture survivors experience in disclosing torture to g
[normal]overnment officials and leads to incorrect assessments of credibility and mishandling of medico-legal evidence of torture injuries. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal]s
[normal]e problems
[normal] lead to flawed decision
[normal]-
[normal]making by the Home Office
[normal] which protracts the asylum process and exacerbates mental health difficulties associated with torture
[normal] that survivors struggle to cope with
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Against this backdrop, access to high quality, specialist legal advice is essential to ensure protection is grant
[normal]ed as quickly as possible to torture survivors 
[normal]who require it
[normal] and that their other rights are also protected
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Access to justice is an important element of the right to rehabilitation, guaranteed to torture survivors by Article 14 of the UN Convention Aga
[normal]inst Torture. In its recent General Comment on this article of the 
[normal]treaty
[normal], the Committee Against Torture emphasised that ‘
[normal]the provision of means for as full rehabilitation as possible for anyone who has suffered harm as a result of a violation of the Conve
[normal]ntion should be holistic and include medical and psychological care as well as 
[normal]legal
[normal] and social services
[normal]’
[normal] (emphasis added).
[normal] The Committee also affirmed that
[normal] States parties to this treaty must ensure that access to justice is available to all torture victims including ‘asylum-seekers, refugees or others under international protection’. The UK has been a party to this treaty since 8 December 1988.  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We regret
[normal] that the government did not await the outcome of this inquiry by the Joint Committee on Human Rights before finalising and publishing its response to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation 
[normal]conducted 
[normal]earlier this year.
[normal] 
[normal]The proposals will affect many vulne
[normal]rable groups, including torture survivors, and it is imperative that careful scrutiny of their human rights impact is undertaken before any reforms are finalised and implemented.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Residence Test[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The introduction of a test requiring one year of lawful resi
[normal]dence before becoming eligible for
[normal] civil
[normal] legal aid is likely to be found unlawful
[normal] in 
[normal]a number of respects
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The residence test would have a deleterious impact on survivors of torture recognised as ref
[normal]ugees or granted subsidiary protection:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The residence test would 
[normal]impede access to justice for 
[normal]survivors of torture who
[normal] have 
[normal]been refused 
[normal]asylum and have not 
[normal]yet 
[normal]submitted a fresh 
[normal]asylum 
[normal]claim
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The residence test would have a 
[normal]detrimental 
[normal]impact on survivors of torture at the end of the asylum process
[normal] 
[normal]who 
[normal]are appeal rights exhausted
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] residence test would also be unworkable:
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Paying for permission work in judicial revi[bold]ew cases[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedom from Torture is concerned
[normal] at the proposal
[normal] 
[normal](as modified) 
[normal]that
[normal] there should be discretion given to the Legal Aid Agency to pay pr
[normal]oviders
[normal] 
[normal]for work done prior to permission being granted for judicial review 
[normal](the original provision
[normal] was that no
[normal] fees would be paid unless permission w
[normal]as
[normal] granted). T
[normal]he effect of this proposal 
[normal]is likely
[normal] to reduce the availability of 
[normal]specialist 
[normal]legal advice and representation 
[normal]pertaining 
[normal]to judicial review across many areas of decision-making by public authorities a
[normal]ffecting survivors of torture. 
[normal]We welcome the in
[normal]dication
[normal] in Annex B
[normal] that there will be further consultation on this in a separate paper as the criteria for exercising such discretion and how often it would be applied will 
[normal]affect
[normal] whether or not lawyers are 
[normal]prepared to take instructions on such cases. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It will be clear from 
[normal]exam
[normal]ples given above that judicial review provides torture survivors with an important legal safeguard against poor quality decision-making by the Home Office, local authorities (especial
[normal]ly in relation to social services and housing departments) and a range of other public authorities. Typical examples of flawed decisions by public authorities concerning our clients include failure to consider fresh representations as a fresh asylum claim,
[normal] delays in deciding asylum claims (in some cases for three years or more), 
[normal]refusal of permission to appeal to the 
[normal]Asylum and Immigration Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, failure to properly assess eligibility for entitlements including community care support
[normal], and failure to comply with policy concessions relating to torture survivors (for example with respect to the frequency of reporting
[normal] for those seeking asylum
[normal]).
[normal]Our clients are 
[normal]already 
[normal]experiencing difficulty in finding specialist 
[normal]legal representation for j
[normal]udicial
[normal] 
[normal]review actions following the 
[normal]previous 
[normal]cuts to legal aid in April of this year. 
[normal]Freedom from Torture is concerned that placing applications for judicial review ‘at risk’ will
[normal] further
[normal] restrict legal practitioners’ capacity
[normal] in this area
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]thereby
[normal] reduc
[normal]ing the availability 
[normal]to our vulnerable clients 
[normal]of legal advice and representation 
[normal]relating to judicial review matters
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘[bold]Borderline[bold]’[bold] cases[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Freedom from Torture is disappointed that the Government intends to remove legal aid for
[normal],
[normal] in particular
[normal],
[normal] housing, welfare and asylum cases with only a 
[normal]‘
[normal]borderline
[normal]’
[normal] prospect of success.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Merits in asylum cases are difficult to assess as country situations often change more quickly than case law or country specific information and policies giving guidance on 
[normal]the factual human rights situation in specific countries or in respect of specific groups.  The accounts of individual applicants escaping torture and persecution may provide evidence that has not yet come to light and challenges existing knowledge and cas
[normal]e law with regards to situations of torture.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The asylum and human rights protection cases of survivors of torture a
[normal]re
[normal] 
[normal]frequently highly complex.  Evidence in the case may develop over time.  Survivors of torture may be traumatised by their experience and 
[normal]need time and the development of a relationship of trust in order to be able to give a full account of their experiences of torture.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Freedom from Torture is concerned that the civil legal aid funding system incentivises legal practitioners, especially t
[normal]hose who are less experienced, to avoid taking on complex cases, with the risk that survivors of torture are unable to challenge decisions refusing protection and placing them at risk of removal to situations where they face torture and other forms of pers
[normal]ecution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current funding regime allows legal aid to be provided in cases considered to be 
[normal]‘
[normal]borderline
[normal]’
[normal] if the life, liberty and phy
[normal]sical safety of an individual are
[normal] affected, if they are at risk of homelessness or if the case would involve a breach of
[normal] human rights protected 
[normal]by the European Convention on Human Rights. Freedom from Torture considers that these safeguards are an essential means of ensuring that deserving cases including those involving torture survivors, often involving risk to life and p
[normal]hysical safety, are brought before the courts.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Experts’ fees[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As described above, the medico-legal reports commissioned from Freedom from Torture
[normal]’s 
[normal]M
[normal]edico 
[normal]L
[normal]egal 
[normal]R
[normal]eport 
[normal]S
[normal]ervice
[normal], are often crucial in the proper determination of an asylum claim from a torture survivor. The current fee levels allowed are insufficient to meet the full costs of this 
[normal]service 
[normal]which
[normal] has to be subsidised from charitable funds
[normal]. This 
[normal]contributes to a
[normal] limit
[normal]ation 
[normal]on the number of
[normal] reports 
[normal]we 
[normal]can provide
[normal] and the speed with which we can produce them
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal]ny further erosion of fees payable by the Legal Aid Agency 
[normal]for expert reports of this sorts 
[normal]is likely to 
[normal]impact detrimentally on the accessibility of our service (
[normal]and the services of other providers
[normal] of medico-legal reports relating to torture
[normal]) to 
[normal]torture survivors. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In many cases torture survivors need expert interpreters to help elicit 
[normal]properly the details of 
[normal]the abuse they have suffered and any diminution in rate
[normal]s payable 
[normal]is likely to drive specialist interpreters from this market which would in turn compromise the ability of 
[normal]torture survivors
[normal] to communicate clearly what has happened to them
[normal]. The vocabulary
[normal] and understanding of clinical issues
[normal], 
[normal]as well as the 
[normal]emotional 
[normal]demands of this work, make specialist interpreting provision for this vulnerable group especially important
[normal].
