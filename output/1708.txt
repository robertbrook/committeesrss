[[[ (WSC058)]]]&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Declaration of interests&#xa0;I am a Consultant Clinical Scientist in Microbiology at North Bristol NHS Trust.&#xa0;My career path is: BSC in Microbiology from University of Bristol 1977, PhD in Medical Microbiology University of London 1981, Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists (by examination) in 1987, Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists in 1997.&#xa0;My role as a Consultant Clinical Scientist is very similar to that of my medically trained colleagues in providing clinical advice on the diagnosis, treatment and management of patients in Primary and Secondary care and liaison between the Microbiology laboratory and clinicians.  There was no training programme at the time of my training so I have recently been closely involved with the Royal College of Pathologists and with colleagues have developed a Higher Specialist Training curriculum and programme to enable more scientists to achieve this especially as medically trained microbiologists training and roles become more clinically ‘hands-on’.&#xa0;I believe that the Clinical Scientist role is an excellent career path for women in Microbiology and it is very important that training posts are financially supported by the Department of Health.&#xa0;I think the skills acquired by women in this training such as high level expert knowledge of clinical microbiology, clinical liaison with all grades of staff and also including patients and carers, and health service management would transfer very well to other employment sectors so retention of highly trained and skilled women in academic or health service careers is paramount. To do this I believe more support is needed at all levels by employers and at Government level to provide continuing management training and allowing continuing career-long knowledge and skills acquisition in non training senior and Consultant level roles to ensure women can compete with men for the highest level roles. &#xa0;It may be there is currently a lack of knowledge in Science graduates and PhD students of the reality of a career in the health service and it would be helpful for Government to encourage and provide support for links with the Health Service and Universities to  provide internships or run-through training to encourage retention of women graduates or PhD students in STEM careers.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
