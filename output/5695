defaultFor example, a Government elected in 2015 might opt in 2015 for a Spending

default 2018-19

defaultThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently suggested an above-inflation rise in the minimum wage (
defaultParker et al, 2014
default).
default 
defaultAnswers to this question are necessarily speculative because the fixed-term is new and this is the first coalition since 19
default45
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe divergent electoral interests of the Coalition parties suggests that little 
defaultplanning 
defaultwill be done publicly, though the Treasury is likely to be doing its own preparations. An ‘End of Parliament Fiscal Report’ on the New Zealand model would 
defaultbe a valuable innovation, though political parties expecting to gain an overall majority might lack enthusiasm. Such a document would improve understanding of the fiscal problems likely to confront an incoming government. 
defaultA practical question is whether the preparation of this document would be the responsibility of the Treasury or the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), or divided between them. In New Zealand, where there is no OBR or Fiscal Council, the Treasury prepares the document which is published in the name of the Minister of Finance
default (English, 2011
default; Parliamentary Counsel Office, 2005
default)
default.
defaultIf there were currently a majority Government, my hunch is that the 2013 Spending Revie
defaultw would have 
defaultcovered more years than 2015-16.
default Again, providing that there were a majority Government, a 2015 Spending Review would then cover the four years to the 2020 election.  It is possible that the Treasury wanted the 2010 Spending Review to cover four years, though 
defaultit is 
defaultunderstandable that, in the novel circumstances of a coalition, three years was the maximum thought achievable.
default 
defaultAccordingly, the answer to the direct question is that there is scope for the year coverage to be linked to the Parliamentary term. Whether this would happen depends on political calculations: a majority Government would feel obliged to go into an election with costed forward plans (a huge institutional advantage over opposition
default parties
default) whereas a minority coalition 
defaultparty 
defaultand the O
defaultpposition would be wary of being locked into numbers after the election.

default The frequency of Spending Reviews and the number of years covered are separate questions. A Spending Review every two years has had three years of plans, with the third year of one becoming the first year of the next. There must be a Spending Review in 2015 because the existing plans stop at 2015-16.

defaultWhatever the merits of particular values for the minimum wage, it should be recognised that this is an example of using law and regulation instead of tax and spending.
default 
defaultLienert (2013) examined how constraints on legislators are essential in order to counter ‘deficit bias’. The specification of what legislators cannot do (eg increase total spending or reduce total taxes) 
defaultand can do 
defaultraises important issues
default of institutional design
default. Nevertheless, their scrutiny role is fundamental to the legitimacy of the budgetary process
default in a democracy
default.
default    
default There will be circumstances in which tax expenditures and coerced private expenditures are the most effective policy instrument. The concern here is that they will be over-used and used inappropriately, either because they are not monitored or are difficult to 
defaultmeasure
default.
default A specific issue is that the United Kingdom has aligned itself to private sector IFRS, with 
defaultinterpretations and 
defaultadaptations to meet specific public sector circumstances. Paradoxically, though the United Kingdom does not directly follow International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs), the research study commissioned by Eurostat 
defaultshowed that the
default United Kingdom
default has
default the highest rate of IPSAS compliance among the 
defaultthen EU27
default (Ernst &amp; Young, 2012)
default. This reflects the fact that IPSASs are themselves derived from IFRS. An open question is the extent to which the proposed EPSASs will derive from
default IPSAS or start from a different point. Unless the situation is carefully monitored, the United Kingdom could find itself non-compliant with EPSASs, or have to adopt accounting practices it believes inferior to its present practices, or engage in complicated reconciliations. 
default Possible other names would be ‘Budget Committee’ or ‘Finance Committee’ but I prefer the explicit ‘Spending and Tax Committee’, a name that would clearly communicate its role.
default Its remit should include 
defaultsurrogates
default for public expenditure such as
default off-
defaultbudget expenditures, 
defaulttax expenditures
default, 
defaultcoerced private expenditures, and unrecorded future liabilities 
default(Heald, 2012
