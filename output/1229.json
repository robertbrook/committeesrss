"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from West Dorset District Council (TIC004)&#xa0;\nReferring directly to your suggested bullet points:\n\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?\nAt the moment, very poorly! Local Authorities and local councillors have much information on the locality and need of people requiring extra care packages, but this information is not used (or is not made available) to transport providers. Health and Social Care providers, the Voluntary sector, School transport providers, Church and other local community organisations should be asked to pool their information.\n\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?\nAgain, liaison between different agencies would be enormously helpful. \n\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?\nAffordability.\n \nMore publicity as to when buses are available is vital as is co-ordinated thinking as to when people with additional needs are in need. It is recognised that it is uneconomic to provide empty buses but ‘use it or lose it’ initiatives can be helpful if they are continually repeated – though I recognise diminishing returns here!\n\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?\nDirect contact with those identified by the various care-providing agencies and voluntary groups should help identify need and enable individuals to get together so that they can all be transported together.\n\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?\nDepends how isolated – and how needy! Taxi provided by the LTA, as happens with schoolchildren, could be a way forward.\n\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?\nAsk local groups to get together to ‘save their local service’\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
