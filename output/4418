[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Global Campaign for Education (GCE) UK[bold] s[bold]ubmission to [bold]IDSC inquiry on [bold]Disability [bold]and[bold] Development[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome DFID’s recent commitments on disability[bold], which are an important 
[normal]statement
[normal] to developing country partners and other donors. 
[normal]The UK is [bold]the leading donor for[bold] education[bold], so 
[normal]its
[normal] commitments could help to 
[normal]galvanise international action[bold] to include disabled children and young people in education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disabled people are among the 
[normal]most marginalised[bold] from education but also from other services, and f
[normal]ace 
[normal]daily
[normal] discrimination.
[normal] 
[normal]DFID [bold]should [bold]therefore [bold]develop[bold] a high level, cross-cutting strategy on [bold]disability, [bold]championed at a [bold]senior[bold] level and sensibly phased[bold] towards the equitable inclusion of disabled people in all UK aid programmes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, change will only happen with 
[normal]rigorous [bold]accountability[bold]. DFID should move towards making the 
[normal]inclusion of disabled people[bold] 
[normal]a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding[bold], w
[normal]ith all education programmes a 
[normal]priority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A[bold] d[bold]isability-inclusive approach [bold]will not become reality [bold]without [bold]full implementation[bold] by DFID’s Country Offices [bold]and in-country partners[bold]. Top-
[normal]level strategy must be complemented by 
[normal]embedding [bold]disability[bold]-inclusion[bold] into core processes[bold], with strong 
[normal]accountability mechanisms[bold] to ensure delivery a
[normal]t 
[normal]country level[bold], training and support for [bold]all [bold]country advisers,[bold] and 
[normal]disaggregation[bold] of all programmes by disability
[normal] alongside gender
[normal], age
[normal] and other 
[normal]relevant 
[normal]factors
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should 
[normal]‘mainstream[bold]’ disability into [bold]its[bold] education programmes[bold], with an emphasis throu[bold]ghout on inclusive education that benefits all children, especially the most marginalised[bold]. 
[normal]A[bold]ll teacher-training supported by DFID [bold]should[bold] incorporate inclusive teaching methodology[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]This should be supported by the necessary resources, specific timeframes 
[normal]for implementation, and clear accountability. A
[normal]ll programmes 
[normal]should be 
[normal]disaggregated[bold] to show h
[normal]ow they reach disabled children, 
[normal]young people and 
[normal]teachers
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In line with a 
[normal]‘twin track’ approach[bold], DFID should put in place 
[normal]additional resources and support to re[bold]ach disabled people[bold]. 
[normal]DFID should develop a 
[normal]‘
[normal]Disabled Children’s [bold]Education Challenge Fund’[bold] using the learning from the Girls’ Education Challenge Fund, and 
[normal]invest[bold] in research[bold] to strengthen the evidence base on 
[normal]disability
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disability must be a core priority[bold] for post-2015 as part of a wider focus on equity[bold]. The UK 
[normal]should
[normal] continue to champion the ‘
[normal]leave no one behind’[bold] principle, the 
[normal]disaggregation[bold] of all targets by disability, and the principle
[normal] that disabled people have to be included in order for target
[normal]s to b
[normal]e considered achieved
[normal]. 
[normal]A goal of 
[normal]quality education for all, prioritising the most marginalised[bold], is urgent
[normal]ly needed
[normal] 
[normal]to address
[normal] the crisis in educational equity and quality
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The UK should 
[normal]lead
[normal] a ‘
[normal]Global Partnership on Disability Data[bold]’ to improve t
[normal]he data and
[normal] 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]on disability
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Global Campaign for Education is an international education campaign, with over 80 national coalitions across all continents. GCE UK is the UK branch of this campaign: we are a coalition of 30 international 
[normal]development NGOs and education unions
[normal]. GCE UK maintains a strong link with 
[normal]parliament, working closely with the 
[normal]APPG
[normal] on Global Education for All, and through the ‘Sen
[normal]d My Friend to School’ campaign
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disabili[bold]ty must be recognised as a core development issue[bold]. 
[normal]80% of disabled people live in developing countries and the UN calls them “
[normal]the world’s largest minority[bold]”
[normal].  It is clear that the MDGs, and post-2015 goals, will not be achieved without the inclusion of dis
[normal]abled people. Ensuring that disabled people are included 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] aid programmes is an obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The MDG of achieving universal primary education by 2015 is “[bold]not on track[bold]”[bold], with 57 millio
[normal]n children of primary age still out of school and progress all but stalled. 
[normal]250 million children are in school but failing to learn
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Global Campaign for Education argues
[normal] that in most countries, 
[normal]disabled children are more likely to be out of school tha[bold]n any other group of children[bold]. 
[normal]In Nepal, 
[normal]an estimated 
[normal]85% of all children out of sc
[normal]hool are disabled. In Ethiopia
[normal], fewer than 3% of disabled children have access to primary education
[normal]. 
[normal]A study by Plan International of its 1.4 million sponsored children recently 
[normal]concluded that the likelihood that a 
[normal]disabled 
[normal]child did not attend school was often more than ten times greater than a child without a disability
[normal]. 
[normal]Disabled children are 
[normal]also 
[normal]less
[normal] likely to remain in school and
[normal] move
[normal] up to the next year group
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many statistics quoted ab
[normal]out disability are contestable 
[normal]because 
[normal]of 
[normal]the invisibility of disabled people from national statistics in developing countries[bold]. The data gap has a major impact on ed
[normal]ucation, where 
[normal]even basic data on disabled children in and out of school is frequently absent[bold].
[normal] Planning for the inclusion of disabled children is 
[normal]also 
[normal]challenging without information about the type of impairment children have (whether long term physical, 
[normal]m
[normal]ental, intellectual or sensory impairment
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disability is highly interrelated to other aspects of inequality[bold]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he exclusion of certain populations including 
[normal]disabled 
[normal]people but also girls and women, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, and those
[normal] living in remote rural areas or informal settlements has hindered progress towards the MDGs. 
[normal]D[bold]i[bold]fferent dimensions of exclusion overlap[bold], 
[normal]e.g.
[normal] 
[normal]adolescent 
[normal]ethnic minority 
[normal]girls
[normal] living with disabilities experience triple exclusion. 
[normal]O
[normal]f all the excluding factors, 
[normal]disability has the strongest correlation with poor educational outcomes[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome DFID’s recent commitments[bold], particularly 
[normal]that all schools built with direct DFID support will be accessible, an
[normal]d the commitment to work with partners to improve data and evidence on disability
[normal]. These 
[normal]announcements
[normal] are 
[normal]an important [bold]statement[bold] to othe[bold]r donors and developing countries [bold]that the UK is serious about 
[normal]including
[normal] 
[normal]disabled people
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] its aid programmes. 
[normal]GCE UK
[normal] ha
[normal]s worked hard to support DFID 
[normal]to strengthen its focus on disabled children’s education, and we 
[normal]urge [bold]it[bold] to build on this progress [bold]to become a world [bold]leader on disability, in particular[bold] 
[normal]by committing [bold]that[bold] all [bold]teacher-training[bold] supported by DFID will incorpo[bold]rate[bold] inclusive teaching methodology[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While there is 
[normal]strong momentum, and 
[normal]DFID has 
[normal]examples of good practice
[normal], it has 
[normal]no formal framework for the systematic inclusion of disabled people[bold] throughout its programmes, and 
[normal]no formal checks[bold] are in place to ensure that disabled p
[normal]eople benefit from UK Aid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID has
[normal] previously recognised the importance of a 
[normal]“twin-track” approach to disability[bold] which sees the active “mainstreaming” or inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of the
[normal]ir develop
[normal]ment work (eg.
[normal] ensuring education programmes support disabled 
[normal]children
[normal]), coupled with additional inputs and resources which recognise the marginalisation of disabled people and 
[normal]provides them with
[normal] target
[normal]ed support.
[normal] 
[normal]This approach should now be thoroughly emb[bold]edded in DFID’s work[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID has previously[bold] taken steps to integrate disability within its education programme[bold]. GCE UK welcomed DFID’s production in 2010 of a ‘
[normal]Guidance Note on Education for Children with Disabilities[bold]’
[normal], and later worked with DFID to produc
[normal]e a summary ‘one-pager’ 
[normal]which was sent by DFID to all Country Offices
[normal]. However, a 
[normal]2012 
[normal]GCE UK survey of six countries
[normal] suggested that 
[normal]only half [bold]of these Country Offices were aware of [bold]the ‘one-pager’[bold], and only one was implementing it[bold]. 
[normal]In its report ‘
[normal]Equity 
[normal]and Inclusion for All in Education
[normal]’
[normal], 
[normal]GCE UK 
[normal]analysed 14 DFID Country Operational Plans and found 
[normal]just two mentions of disability[bold]. The report 
[normal]raised concern that
[normal], although there were examples of good practice,
[normal] there was 
[normal]little evidence of DFID engaging in [bold]strategic planning to ensure that [bold]all[bold] education initiatives prioritised marginalised groups – such as disabled children - in a comprehensive way[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]could draw many lessons from its success in mainstreaming gender[bold] and prioritising girls and women, and co
[normal]uld apply these to disability. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]B
[normal]arriers to education for 
[normal]disabled people 
[normal]are the result of 
[normal]complex factors involving social, economic and political systems, and the way in which schools engage with 
[normal]di
[normal]sabled 
[normal]children, 
[normal]their families
[normal] and teachers
[normal]. Responding to these barriers requires strategic cross-sector planning. 
[normal]DFID[bold] should[bold] [bold]therefore develop[bold] a high level, cross-cutting strategy on [bold]disability[bold], and implement this in a [bold]sensible [bold]phased [bold]approach at all [bold]levels of its work[bold]. This strategy could draw lessons from 
[normal]DFID’s Strategic Vision for Girls and Women
[normal], and the disability strategy of
[normal] Australia’s development agency
[normal]. The strategy should be 
[normal]championed at a [bold]senior[bold] level[bold], clearly emphasising its importance 
[normal]internally and to partners
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, 
[normal]a paper strategy will not lead to sustainable change without[bold] 
[normal]rigorous[bold] accountability[bold]. 
[normal]DFID should move towards making the inclusion of disabled people a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding[bold], with 
[normal]education
[normal] programmes a
[normal] priority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GCE UK’s analysis highlights that
[normal] the 
[normal]devolved nature of DFID’s operations creates challenges for consistent implementation[bold]. 
[normal]S
[normal]trategy must be complemented by 
[normal]embedding [bold]disability responsiveness[bold] into core processes[bold], with strong 
[normal]acco[bold]untability mechanisms to ensure delivery at the country level[bold], 
[normal]training and support for country advisers,[bold] and 
[normal]disaggregation of all programmes by disability[bold]. The inclusion of disabled people should be 
[normal]a requirement of all DFID Business Cases and Country Op[bold]erational Plans[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A network of 
[normal]trained[bold] 
[normal]leads/focal points in all DFID Country Offices [bold]should report back regularly to a central senior 
[normal]‘[bold]Disability[bold] Champion’[bold] on planning, implementation and evaluation of inclusive programmes. These leads could also 
[normal]be
[normal] 
[normal]contact points for consultation[bold] with external groups of (and groups representing) disabled people. 
[normal]However lessons should be learned from 
[normal]the
[normal] experience
[normal] of gender mainstreaming. DFID
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]previously 
[normal]highlighted 
[normal]that gender focal points often proved disappoi
[normal]nting due to a 
[normal]"...lack of clarity about their roles and responsibilities [and] lack of management support
[normal]"
[normal]. 
[normal]Another risk is that 
[normal]staff may assume that since the focal point is ‘doing disability’ no-one else has to do anything. 
[normal]Focal points therefore need[bold] to be given sufficient resources, time and authority[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GCE UK welcomes DFID’s existing support for 
[normal]Disabled People’s Organisations[bold]. DPOs
[normal] play 
[normal]an important role,
[normal] 
[normal]empower
[normal]ing
[normal] disabled people to participate in decisions that affect them, and 
[normal]changing
[normal] attitudes towards disability
[normal] in society at large. 
[normal]DFID [bold]should [bold]continue to strengthen its support for DPOs, using a range of approaches that deliver effective [bold]participation [bold]in-[bold]country[bold]. 
[normal]DFID should also 
[normal]place a clear requirement on its Country Offices to in[bold]volve [bold]DPOs[bold] in programme development, implementation and evaluation[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]GCE UK is strongly supportive of 
[normal]DFID’s leading position as the largest bilateral donor to basic education[bold]. We urge DFID to use t
[normal]his position to 
[normal]further prioritise [bold]disability[bold]-inclusion[bold] [bold]in[bold] education[bold], which would 
[normal]galvanise other donors[bold] and see a step-change in support 
[normal]to disabled children, 
[normal]young people
[normal] and teachers
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]U
[normal]nequal access to education is 
[normal]often 
[normal]exacerbated by the prevalence o
[normal]f a medical deficit model of disability, which perpetuates the notion that disabled children must adapt in order to ‘integrate’ into mainstream schooling, or be educated in a separate ‘special’ education system
[normal]. At the same time, the nature of 
[normal]children’s 
[normal]impairments is often poorly understood, resulting in inappropriate service provision. 
[normal]GCE UK argues 
[normal]that 
[normal]carefully planned and implemented [bold]inclusive education [bold]strategies[bold],[bold] utilising 
[normal]the expertise 
[normal]of
[normal] staff in rehabilitation services and special education schools
[normal], 
[normal]that support the 
[normal]inclusion of disabled children in mainstream schools[bold] are appropriate in the large maj
[normal]ority of cases. Such strategies 
[normal]enhance the 
[normal]quality of teaching and learning for [bold]all chil[bold]dren[bold], not just disabled children[bold]. DFID should 
[normal]embed[bold] inclusive education as a leading principle of its education programmes[bold], thereby strengthening the focus on disabled children 
[normal]and 
[normal]simultaneously
[normal] strengthening education systems and 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality of learning 
[normal]for all children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While 
[normal]DFID’s commitment on accessible school construction
[normal] is welcome, it is important to note that directly-funded school construction forms only a small part of DFID’s work. Similar commitments
[normal] 
[normal]should be made[bold] in areas [bold]which constitute a[bold] greater part of DFID’s spending and portfolio[bold], [bold]ensuring that provisions are made for accessible 
[normal]school infrastructure, transport and learning materials[bold].
[normal] DFID is a stro
[normal]ng leader i
[normal]n supporting 
[normal]teacher training[bold], which is fundamental to meeting MDG 2 and 
[normal]improving the quality of education
[normal]. In order to be inclusive of disabled children, teachers need to learn about and practise inclusive education during pre-service and in-service training
[normal]. 
[normal]DFID [bold]should integrate inclusive education throughout the teacher-[bold]training it supports[bold], and seek to also train specialised teaching assistants to support children with complex needs within a mainstream environment[bold]. 
[normal]DFID should 
[normal]promote[bold] the recruitment of disabled teachers[bold] including the reasonable adjustments needed in sch
[normal]ools for this
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]should 
[normal]play
[normal] an influencing
[normal] role in 
[normal]its 
[normal]dialogue[bold]s[bold] with [bold]developing country[bold] g[bold]overnments [bold]to encourage [bold]disability-inclusion in [bold]the education system and governance[bold]. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne systemic barrier is the problem of 
[normal]divided ministerial responsibility[bold], 
[normal]where education for disabled children is the responsibility of a different ministry than that responsible for the education of non-disabled children
[normal]. This division usually reflects the view that the disabled need welfare rather than equity
[normal] in educational 
[normal]opportunity and 
[normal]often leads to segregated responses to disability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The marginalisation of those with disabilities is often compounded by other 
[normal]inequalities
[normal]. For instance, girls with disabilities are less likely to get an education, vocational training or
[normal] employment than boys with disabilities or girls without disabilities
[normal]. 
[normal]DFID should build on its strong work to reach marginalised girls – such as the Girls Education Challenge Fund[bold] –[bold] by[bold] ensur[bold]ing[bold] that such mechanisms support disabled girls[bold]. 
[normal]T
[normal]here are good
[normal] examples of GEC projects 
[normal]that 
[normal]aim
[normal] to do this
[normal], and we urge DFID 
[normal]to 
[normal]make this systematic
[normal] by 
[normal]establishing[bold] support for disabled girls [bold]as [bold]a requirement of all GEC projects[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In line with the “twin-track” approach, DFID should put in place 
[normal]additional resources[bold] to support disabled children and young people[bold]’s education[bold]. DFID
[normal] should
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID’s guidance 
[normal]highlights
[normal] that “
[normal]educating children with disabilities is a good investment[bold]”
[normal].
[normal] Prioritising disability 
[normal]within DFID’s work should not be 
[normal]thought of
[normal] in terms of an additional cost burden. O
[normal]n the contrary, 
[normal]the costs of not investing in support to disabled people are much greater to the countries where DFID is seeking to deliver development progress[bold]. By one estimate, 
[normal]USD 135–192 
[normal]billion is lost from the GDP of low-income countries per annum as
[normal] a result of disabled people’s exclusion from the labour market
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]E
[normal]ducating disabled children reduces welf
[normal]are costs and future dependence, and 
[normal]increases children’s own potential productivity and wealth creation in turn help
[normal]ing
[normal] to alleviate poverty
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n ma
[normal]ny cases, 
[normal]where disabled people and their needs are considered early in the planning of projects, additional costs are minimal[bold]. Directly relevant to DFID’s 
[normal]commitment on 
[normal]school construction, UNICEF note that 
[normal]the costs of integrating accessibility into new 
[normal]buildings can be negligible (less than 1% of the total cost) compared to the higher cost of making adaptations to completed buildings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should invest in projects to improve disability statistics [bold]to better measure[bold] progress[bold] for disabled people[bold]. For instance, working closely with the 
[normal]UN 
[normal]Washington Group on Disabilit
[normal]y Statistics and with UNICEF, and
[normal] providing financial 
[normal]and technical assistance
[normal] to national statistical agencies.
[normal] It is also important to invest in partici
[normal]patory qualitative research looking at the impact of 
[normal]the 
[normal]i
[normal]nclusive 
[normal]p
[normal]rojects being rolled out, such as looking at “Quality of Life” measures, in order to establish best practice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should lead in working with other 
[normal]education 
[normal]partners to improve support
[normal] for disabled children. This includes other 
[normal]education 
[normal]donors such as 
[normal]AusAid[bold], and multil
[normal]aterals 
[normal]like the 
[normal]Global Partnership for Education (GPE), UNESCO and the World Bank[bold]. 
[normal]DFID
[normal] 
[normal]is represented on the Board of
[normal] the GPE, whose 
[normal]new strategic plan includes a 
[normal]stra
[normal]tegic focus on ‘
[normal]Reaching Every Child
[normal]’
[normal], with inclusive education a priority within its 
[normal]implementation plan
[normal]. 
[normal]The GPE is the only multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into school for a quality education[bold], and with the GPE’s replenishment t
[normal]aking place in 2014 the UK has an important opportunity to 
[normal]strengthen
[normal] GPE’s focus on disabled children.

[normal]The Prime Minister and DFID
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] already shown 
[normal]important
[normal] leade
[normal]rship on the need for post-2015 
[normal]g
[normal]oals to 
[normal]include disabled people
[normal]. GCE UK welcomed the 
[normal]UN 
[normal]High Level Panel’s
[normal] (HLP)
[normal] recommendations as they relate to disability, 
[normal]including
[normal] the "
[normal]no one left behind[bold]" transformative shift; the emphasis on the need for 
[normal]disaggregation of indicators by disability[bold] for meas
[normal]uring progress; and the commitment that "
[normal]no target should be considered met unless met for all social groups, including people with disabilities[bold]"
[normal]. 
[normal]We urge DFID to champion these elements as the negotiations continue[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]E
[normal]nsuring disabled children and other [bold]marginalised groups are both in school and learning is a critical challenge for post-2015[bold]. The 
[normal]HLP’s illustrative goal
[normal] “
[normal]Provide q
[normal]uality education and lifelong learning
[normal]” rightly emphasises that there is an education crisis with millions denied their right 
[normal]to education.
[normal] 
[normal]We[bold] 
[normal]urge DFID[bold] to fight for an education goal and targets [bold]for universal, [bold]free, quality early childhood, primary and secondary education[bold] [bold]that [bold]tackle[bold]s[bold] inequalities and guarantee[bold]s[bold] education rights for all[bold]. Progress [bold]in access to [bold]education[bold], completi[bold]on and learning outcomes [bold]should be [bold]disaggregated by disability alongside gender, wealth, age, location and other [bold]relevant [bold]factors.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n order to better measure progress there needs to be a “data revolution” and nowhere is that more true than 
[normal]with
[normal] disability. 
[normal]GCE UK urges [bold]DFID[bold] to play a leading role in a multi-stakeholder[bold] [bold]‘
[normal]Global Partnership on Disability Data[bold]’
[normal] to improve the visibility [bold]and focus on[bold] disabled people[bold].
