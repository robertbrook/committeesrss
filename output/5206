defaultI have worked for 30 years as a veterinary practitioner in companion animal practice. I have special interest in “exotic” pets and see occasional primates as pets of my clients. I also
default see several cases of inappropriate primate pet care, brought to my attention via the investigations of local RSPCA Inspectors. I have been involved, as an expert witness in several cases involving the inappropriate care of primates.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have a deep interest
default in the management and care of exotic animals as pets and carry out local authority inspections for pet shop facilities for 4 local councils. I am often asked to comment on the appropriate management of primates.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is my opinion that all species of primat
defaulte are unsuitable for pet management. Even the current unregulated small species of primate, the tamarind and marmoset monkeys have a miserable existence in private hands. I have yet to see a private facility that can cater for the specialist needs of these
default animals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn all my years of dealing with pet primates I cannot recall a fit and healthy individual.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my opinion the simplest m
defaulteans of controlling the pet trade in small species primates would be to include them under the Dangerous Wild Animal legislation. They would then join their larger cousins. Reasonable arguments for inclusion would be their known high zoonotic risk for infe
defaultctious disease. This would allow inspection to ensure adequate protection for the animals, owners and visitors were in place. There is also an environmental protection to ensure that escape in warmer parts of the UK did not lead to environmental colonisati
defaulton. Use of the DWA could be quick and utilizes existing legislative powers.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the longer term, the European and UK interest in developing evidence based positive lists for the various species 
defaultto be traded as pets will offer a means of controlling primates
default as pets. There is no available evidence to show that primates make suitable pets.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe simple solution to this serious welfare problem lies in the DWA.
