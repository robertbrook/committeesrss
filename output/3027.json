"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nSince 1973, Campaign for Better Transport has been helping to create transport policies and programmes that give people better lives and support the environment. Our \nvision is a country where communities have affordable transport that improves quality of l\nife and protects the environment. Achieving our vision requires substantial changes to UK transport policy\n which w\ne aim to achieve \nby \nproviding well-researched, practical solutions that gain support from \nboth \ndecision-makers and the public.\nThe Government published \nAction for Roads\n in July 2013, following up the spending plans ini\ntially announced in the Spending Round in June and outlined in \nInvesting in Britain's Future\n.\n&#xa0;\nA) Policies we welcomeThese include a renewed emphasis on maintenance, the ability \nof\n the Highways Agency to fund projects outside the strategic road network, specific policies on cycling and walking, and a range of initiatives to reduce the environmental and landscape impact of new and existing roads. \n&#xa0;\nB) An unwelcome (and irrational) return to 'predict and provide'We are very concerned with several of the assumptions \nbehind the policies in\n \nAction for Roads\n:\n1. The UK's strategic road network\n (SRN)\n is inadequate\n2. Traffic growth and new roads to accommodate it are essential for economic\n growth\n3. Forecasts predict traffic will grow rapidly\n4. A large road-building programme will reduce congestion in the long term\n&#xa0;\nWe will tackle the third assumption in answer to the \nC\nommittee's third question, below.\n&#xa0;\nThe first assumption \nhas been\n stated\n repeatedly in recent documents and speeches: \n&#xa0;\nHowever\n, this statistic \nturns out to be\n based on the replie\ns\n of \na sample of \ncompany executives\n \nto a single survey question\n in the World Economic Forum’s\n \nannual Executive Opinion Survey\n.\n In 2012, the sample size for thi\ns survey from the UK was just 93.\n  \nIn contrast, t\nhe\n much more rigorous and extensive\n Eddington \nTransport Study of\n 2006 found that the UK was very well connected in transport terms, with good \nnetworks linking\n major towns and cities and many alternative rou\ntes provi\nding a high level of resilience.\n&#xa0;\nAction for Roads\n provide\ns\n \nno\n evidence for the second assumption above. \nThe whole of Section 1 on 'Roads and the economy' only includes two references to external analyses (the other references are to basic \nstatistics for chart data) and these are both relatively limited surveys of businesses (the WEF and an EEF document based on a survey of manufacturing companies\n). The Government should be challenged on the why it has used such small and narrow range of so\nurces as a key supporting plank for a major new policy and spending programme.\n&#xa0;\nIn terms of policies to support economic growth, the Eddington Study also contradicts the assertion that large new road infrastructure will deliver growth\n, saying: \"Today, in m\nature economies like the UK, with well-established networks and where connectivity between economic centres is already in place, the evidence suggests that there is considerably less scope for transport improvements to deliver the periods of rapid growth s\neen historically.\" \n&#xa0;\nEddington \nalso \nrecognis\ned that congestion is primarily an urban problem and championed smaller, low-cost interventions based on evidence of the benefits of \"smarter choices\" programmes and the cycling demonstration towns. Since then, \nthe \nevidence\n base\n \nfor this approach \nhas grown\n rapidly\n, with the Local Sustainable Transport Fund supporting nearly 100 packages of projects and initial (as yet unpublished) assessments showing\n very high benefit-cost ratios.\n&#xa0;\nM\nany UK cities, such as Notting\nham, Cambridge and London, have shown that economic and population growth can be achieved without corresponding traffic increases\n and, across\n the country, traffic and economic growth have been decoupling since the 1990s\n.\n&#xa0;\nOther recent evidence comes from t\nhe USA where research into stimulus spending has shown that a 'fix it first' strategy is more effective than \nbig new \nroad-\nbuilding\n projects\n at creating jobs\n.\n,\n \n,\n \n&#xa0;\nEven on its own terms, the fourth assumption\n \n– that a return to major road building will r\neduce congestion in the long term – fails to stand up. The new 2013 traffic forecasts and the maps shown in \nAction for Roads\n \npredict\n higher than ever\n traffic\n in the future, with a\n 43 per cent rise in traffic on all roads and a\n \n46\n per cent increase\n \non the S\nRN \nby 2040. It is clear that no amount of road-building could possibly kee\np up with this predicted level of demand and that – if the forecasts are believed \n–\n polic\nies \naimed at \nreducing\n demand are the only rational response.\n&#xa0;\nThere is no acknowledgement \nin \nthese\n new policy documents of the principle of induced traffic or that \nthe new \npolicies, ostensibly designed to tackle growing traffic, will in fact be responsible for making the problem worse. These are not controversial sta\ntements to make. T\nhese principl\nes have been \nfirmly \nestablished since the first SACTRA report was published in 1994\n and it is much more controversial that the Government appears to have forgotten them. \n&#xa0;\nC) Environmental impactThe planned expansion of the SRN would have a huge impact o\nn the environment, with new land required for bypasses and widening projects. Particularly worrying is the proposal for a new 'expressway' standard – effectively a policy for the long-term dualling o\nf most of the network. With \nCampaign to Protect Rural Eng\nland, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust and RSPB, we \nrecently warned\n \nof\n the potential impact o\nf this on National Parks, \nAONBs and the World Heritage Site at Stonehenge\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe have \nalso warned\n about the \nimpact \nof two major\n current Highways Agency proposal \non\n air pollution\n. Our submission\ns to \nthe A556 Knutsford to Bowden Improvement \nexamination and the \nA14 route consultation \nshow \nthese projects are likely to raise pollution above EU legal limits.\n,\n \n  \nTh\nis\n issu\ne \nha\ns\n been giv\nen greater urgency by\n the UK Supreme Court rul\ning\n in May 2013 that the Government \nis\n failing in its legal duty to protect people from the effects of dangerously high air pollution.\n \n&#xa0;\nD) Effects on local roadsWhile acknowledging that locally managed roads\n make up nin\nety-eight per cent of the\n network, \nAction for \nRoads\n fails to\n \nrecognise\n that a policy \nwhich increases\n traffic on the SRN would have a huge knock-on effect on local roads, increasing congestion in towns, cities and rural areas around the SRN. \nIn \nmany cases, the expansion of the SRN close to urban areas would be in direct contradiction with local policies intende\nd to reduce the need to travel \nand reduce road\n traffic\n. \nWe welcome the new ability of the Highways Agency to invest outside the \nSRN\n. However, the strategies outlined in \nAction for Roads\n and the wo\nrk that has taken place so far on \nthe new \nRoute Based Strategies do not\n demonstrate that the Government i\ns \nworking towards\n be\ntter integration between modes \nor\n collaboration with other \ndepartments.\n&#xa0;\nA) Link with rail?We strongly support closer links between strategic road and rail investment programmes. However, despite the\n switch to longer term funding \nfor \nthe Highways Agency, and the similarity of the funding period covered by Action for Roads and the cur\nrent HLOS period,\n there is no evidence \nfor \nproposals \nbeing\n put together i\nn conjunction with Network Rail or using information from them\n. \nOur \ncampaigners ha\nve \ntaken\n part in the \nrecent\n Route Based Strategy workshops (covering 18 routes \nacross the\n SRN). \nT\nhe\nse \nseek to establish the 'problems and opportunities' faced by each route \nbut\n the maps provided only\n include \nroads\n and don't even \nfeature \ncurrent rail \nlines\n,\n let alone planned improvements.\n&#xa0;\nB) Link with buses?The focus in\n recent budgets \nhas been\n for revenue spending to be cut while capital spending is increased. This means that, except for a small number of capital schemes\n, buses have suffered cuts \ndue to lower local authority budgets and a reduction in the Bus Service Operators Grant. \nAction for Roads\n acknowledges in bullet points on the benefits of roads that they \nare \"\nvital for those travelling by bus\n or bicycle\n\"\n and mentions that some pinch-point\n schemes will improve bus priority at junctions. However, there is no section covering measures to support public transport on the SRN,\n despite the\n potential for express coaches (\nfor example\n)\n, to reduce congestion.\n&#xa0;\nC) Link with active travel and smarter choices?P\nolicies on smarter travel, travel planning and demand management are completely absent from \nAction for Roads\n and there is only a brief mention of the \nLSTF \n(in the section on walking and cycling).  \nWhil\nst\n we welcome \nthe \nnew cycling feasibility stud\nies\n, there is a huge missed opportunity for active travel and s\nmarter choices programmes to \nrelieve pressure on the SRN, particularly \non\n \ncongested \nstretches\n around cities\n.\n&#xa0;D) Link with planning policies?A new circular on how the Highways Agency engages \nwith the planning system was published in 2013.\n \nWe\n welcom\ned \nsome aspects, such as \nthe Highways Agency \nhaving\n a\n role in both the plan-making and decision-makin\ng stages of the planning process\n. However, we\n also\n \nurged that the programme requiring travel plan\ns for developments near the SRN should be reinstated. \n&#xa0;\nE) Cross-departmental objectivesW\ne and others have made the case for greater collaboration between departments\n, for example\n with the Department of Health on\n active travel\n, \nDECC\n on climate change emis\nsions, Defra on complying with legal requirements on air pollution or \nDWP \non\n access\n to\n work and training. \n&#xa0;\nA\nn\n example of \na possible\n \ncollaboration \nis\n the\n Active Travel Fund\n proposed by a \nrange\n of \ngroups in the run up to the Spending Round\n.\n \nThis \nfun\nd could \ncombine a share of the t\nransport budget with contributions from public health\n funds\n.\nWe have \nchallenged\n the reliability of the Government's traffic forecasts for many years, and have been disappointed with recent responses to these challenges. DfT maintains \nthat its forecasts are fit for purpose,\n despite evidence that \nthe\ny\n have \noverestimated\n deman\nd since the end of the 1980s. \n&#xa0;\nA) Why traffic forecasts matterThe problem with over-estimating traff\nic growth lies not only in how forecasts\n are used to support policies of 'predict and provide' (in fact they could equally support\n urgent\n \npolicies of traffic reduction) \nbut also in how they \nunderlie\n economic case\ns for\n schemes and\n \nlend systematic\n support\n to\n \nprojects\n that add road capacity. \n&#xa0;The WebTAG method of \nassessment\n – in particular the \nway \ncost-benefit ratio\ns are calculated\n – rel\nies \nhe\navily \non \nforecasts of\n traffic\n growth\n. Time savings \noften\n \nconstitute\n \neighty to ninety per cent\n of the calculated benefits of a scheme (the controversial Bexhill-Hastings Link Road is a typical example at \n84\n%\n) \nand \nthe\nse\n time 'savings' are \ncalculated against\n \nwhat is predicted to be the case with no \nscheme in place.\n It is \nmainly \nbecause\n strong long-term traffic growth \nis\n predicted that \ntime savings\n \ntend to dominate BCRs\n.\n&#xa0;\nB) Recent changes in traffic trendsTraffic \nin\n Great Britain has \ndiverged\n from historical trends in \nthe past two decades\n.\n \nThere \nhas been\n a flattening of growth \nsince \nthe 1990s\n;\n a \nplateau/peak in the mid-2000s followed by \na decline\n;\n \nthen \na flattening off of this decline since around 2010.  \nDfT traffic statistics for 2012 show th\nat the\n total\n amount of traffic is now below \nthat\n \nof \n2003\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe most recent National Travel Survey \n(NTS)\n illustrates how driving patterns are changing on a per-person basis\n. \nKey results\n include:\n,\nThese trends all call into question the wisdom \nof building new roads now. C\nongestion and traffic are below wha\nt they have been at their peak, with several years of growth needed just to bring them up to levels that have previously been experienced. Far better to take advantage of the 'breathing space' provided by the recent trends \nto support sustainable transport \nalternatives.\n&#xa0;\nC) Problem with the accuracy of recent forecastsDfT f\no\nrecasts \nhave \nover-estimated traffic growth since the 1980s, particularly when \nit comes to \nlong-term trends. \nFig 3.1: Performance of DfT traffic forecasts since 1989&#xa0;\nThe chart in Fig\n 3.1 shows a comparison of traffic in England with forecasts from 1989 to 2011.\n \n \nDfT\n \ncontends that the accuracy of its forecasts is better than implied by the chart above by including earlier fo\nrecasts in its own reports and describing forecasts since the\n early 1970s as \"generally under-forecasted\"\n,\n \nFig 3.2: DfT forecasts vs outturn chartIn Fig 3.2 over-forecasting in recent years \nis obscured by the longer \ntime\nscale and \nlarge point markers, but it can be seen that the closest fit to the long term tre\nnd up to 2005 is the 1973 \nforecast and that \nthe even lower gradient of the post-oil crisis 1975 'under' forecast is about to become the most accurate in the long term. \nA continuing plateau \nor decline in line with theories of 'peak car' would see the outtur\nn line meet the 1980 and 1984 'under-forecasts' by around 2020, but none of the DfT's current scenarios produce figures even close to these possibilities.\n&#xa0;\nA\nnother crucial\n issue is that \n– whether accurate or not – \nthese\n \nforecasts are unsustainable:\n if road\n travel were really to grow as forecasts predict (a 43% increase in road traffic by 2040), climate change targets will be impossible to meet an\nd, however much we expand roads, \ncongestion will get worse.\n&#xa0;\nD) Problems with the underlying National Transport Model (NTM)The main problems with the methodology behind forecasts and the underlying NTM are the limited number of 'key drivers' and a number of out-of-date assumptions.\n&#xa0;\nRoad Transport Forecasts 2013\n outlines the\nse three key drivers and their assumed effects on traffic\n:\n&#xa0;\nAs the NTM is a closed model, it is not possible to interrogate its detailed workings. However we believe that the National Trip End Model (NTEM) does co\nnsider factors such as population density, new developments and demographics in working out local variations in demand for travel by car, but that ultimately these are 'constrained' or adjusted to fit in with the macro picture determined by these three fac\ntors. \n&#xa0;\nBy using so few factors in estimating macro-level changes in demand, the forecasts ignore\n how open to question future behaviour is and leave aside a range of important nation\nwide changes in \ntechnology\n, demographics\n and \nland-use\n. These failings are \nacknowledged in the chapter 'Uncertainty and modelling' in the forecast documents, but\n they\n are currently not used to alter the model:  \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges in technology and connectivity that affect behaviour – especially relevant to the steady reduction in trip rat\nes seen since 1997\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges in culture between generations – younger people are currently assumed as they age to adopt the driving patterns \nof\n people in today's older age groups. It is much more likely that \npeople\n raised since the 1990s will have different \ndriving habits\n to those growing\n up in the 1970s or 1950s. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChanges in town planning – for example the 'town centre first' planning policies that are attributed to a proportion of the reduction in driving seen in the 'On the Move' report (see next section).\n&#xa0;\nOut of date assumptionsThe following assumptions \nare \nalso \nout of date. \nThere are plans to update these in the near future, but this is not represented in the 2013 forecasts\n upon which\n the policies in\n \nAction for Roads \nre\nly.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTrip rates – the 2013 Road Transport Forecasts document admits that trip rate data\n is based on NTS results from 1988-96 and that they are assumed to be constant over time for each type of person (split according to age, car ownership and employment)\n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPopulation distribution – the NTEM uses \nONS\n population projections from 2010.\n These are in turn based on \ndata\n from the 2001 census. The next set of detailed data on population, \nfrom\n the 2011 Census, is likely to show a higher level of overall population growth but a ve\nry different distribution, focused mainly on larger cities that have lower cultural and practical levels of car use and be\ntter public transport\n.\n&#xa0;\nE) Policy changes neededDfT \nshould \nhold a root and branch review of the processes of appraisal and forecastin\ng. This would have three aspects, including\n – importantly \n–\n the\n \nopening up of the new NTM\n:\n&#xa0;1. Full review of appraisal and the NTM2. A new simpler, publicly owned NTM, built to match the results of the review and available on an open licence for \ninterested parties to interrogate and experiment with (for exampl\ne by altering the underlying ass\numptions)\n3. The wider use of scenarios in appraisal, not just in the production of the forecasts. Th\ne range of scenarios\n should include a comparison of the be\nnefits of schemes with the current situation, not just with a range of predicted 'do minimum' futures. \n&#xa0;\nWe\n have \nrequested\n the opening up of\n DfT model\ns to match practices in\n the Treasury \nfor\n \nsome \neconomic model\ns\n. However, we have been told that issue\ns of c\nomplexity –\n the merging and linking of \nmany\n different data models –\n and\n the inclusion of \nproprietary software prevents this with the \nNTM\n. \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome this question – WebTAG gives priority to maximising even small time savings but surveys show people and businesses most want reliability. \nWe believe that technological innovation can\n help provide this and \nreliev\ne\n a number of cur\nrent problems on the SRN. These include: \n&#xa0;A) Congestion around urban areasOn congested sections of the SRN, current\n \n(\nand \nmore \nadvanced\n) \nITS \naspects of the Managed Motorway (and new 'Smart Roads') schemes \ncan do much to\n manag\ne \ncongestion\n, reliability\n \nand driver information \nvia \nvariable \nspeed limits and improved warning and information signs. \n&#xa0;\nB) SafetyLower or variabl\ne speed limits, enforced by average speed cameras, may also be suitable for improving the safety record of \nbust parts of the SRB as well as \nmany rural single carriageway A roads, on and off the SRN. \n&#xa0;\nC) Community severance, social and environmental impacts of existing roadsThe Highways Agency is working to improve its environmental record, and there are \nsome \nwelcome references to \nthis \nin \nAction for R\no\na\nds\n. We also welcome the start of a cycling project pipeline. This is\n currently\n, however, a slightly piecemeal process and could be much better integrated with other initiatives \nincluding the pinch-\npoint programme, maintenance and major projects. \n&#xa0;\nThere is also enormous scope \n(\nwith \nadditional\n funding being provided to the Agency\n)\n fo\nr a much more extensive 'retrofitting' programme to tackle\n \nthe environmental and social problems caused by the network in a much more concerted way. \nHowever,\n \nevidence of the first \nPerformance Specification\n for the Highways Agency for 2013-15 is not encoura\nging.\n \nO\nnly two requirements (on noise and air quality) \ncover\n effect\ns\n \non the environment\n and wider community, with no measures \nfor the\n social effects of new roads\n. \nCarbon measures are limited to cuts in the operational carbon footprint of the Agency not th\ne network's wider contribution to the national carbon budget. \n              \nO\nur 2012\n report \nProblems with private roads\n \nlooked at the issue of attracting private finance into road building and management,\n \n \n \nconsidering the \nrange of models then being discussed by the Government. This concluded, for each model:\n&#xa0;\nOn toll roads, the Government has also experienced real difficulties. The two potential projects so far moo\nted to be funded through tolls \n– the M4 Relief Road in Wales and the A14 in Cambridgeshire – \nhave\n \nproved deeply controversial.\n,\n \n \n \nFinding private investors fo\nr anything less costly than PFI-\nstyle schemes will depend on finding or developing a revenue str\neam from drivers\n, \nbut\n all the models described above have also proved very unpopular\n with the public\n.\n \nOur response to \nAlan \nCook\n's\n review of the Highways Agency, \nA fresh start for the strategic road network\n,\n welcomed its emphasis on better managing the network rather than major expansion. \nHowe\nver, we had serious doubts about taking primary responsibility for the SRN away from the Secretary of State for Transport. \n&#xa0;\nAnother concern was the proposed remit for the DfT as a 'champion of road users'. The response of the\n then\n Secretary of State to th\nis proposal was relatively robust, saying:\n\"\nWe accept this recommendation though with some qualifications.\n \nIt is clearly important for the Government to represent the interests of road users as, in the absence of a commercial relationship between drivers \nand the network operator, customers rely on the Government to feed back their concerns and represent their interests. However, in order to reach balanced and well informed decisions, the Government also needs to take full account of all stakeholders in the\n roads, including the wider community that this network serves.\"\n&#xa0;\nHowever,\n it appears\n these qualifications have not emerged intact from the\n processes that led to\n \nAction for Roads\n. \n&#xa0;\nFinally, we question whether\n all\n the aims for the \nnew roads strategy given in the Secretary of State's response to Cook are \nin fact\n being delivered.\n \nThese\n aims\n \nincluded demand management, but there is no sign of policies for managing demand in \nAction for Roads\n.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Executive Summary, Action for Roads, Department for Transport, July 2013 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/action-for-roads-a-network-for-the-21st-century\n Speech, Stephen Hammond\n,\n 15 Jul 2013 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-governmen\nts-plan-for-the-uks-road-network\n Investing in Britain's Future, Treasury, June 2013 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investing-in-britains-future\n Section 1.3 of the Global Competitiveness Report 2012/13, World Economic Forum, May 2012 \nhttp://\nwww3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2012-13.pdf\n Eddington Transport Study Volume 1, Department for Transport, 2006 \nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090104005813/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/transportstrategy/eddingtons\ntudy/\n EEF Transport for Growth, April 2013 \nhttp://www.eef.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/43C9E81E-D27B-454C-97FB-05493949E368/22348/TransportforGrowth2.pdf\n ibid\n T\nhe Best Stimulus for the Money: Briefing Papers on the Economics of Transportation Spending.\n \nNelson\n AC et al, April 2009 http://stimulus.smartgrowthamerica.org/484\n Transportation Funding and Job Creation.
