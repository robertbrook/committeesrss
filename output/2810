[normal] [bold](2011
[normal])
[normal] report took a multidisciplinary approach to examine the unsustainable consumption of 
[normal]global 
[normal]natural resources and the ‘hungry billion’ in the global food system. The report 
[normal]is being used by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
[normal]in support of 
[normal]action to open up global markets, to manage volatility of food prices, to combat and to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change, protecting the world’s resources and biodiversity, and to incorporate sustainable practices in agri
[normal]culture production, 
[normal]for example, in preparation for Rio +20 and in negotiating the Common Agricultural Policy Reform
[normal]. 
[normal]The Foresight 
[normal]project’s conclusions on the need for sustainable intensification of agriculture in the UK pr
[normal]ovided a comprehensive evidence-

[normal] approach to public health and obesity, 
[normal]‘
[normal]Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A call to action on obesity in England
[normal]’
[normal] where the Government set national ambitions to achieve a sustained downward trend in the level of excess weight in children by 2020, and a downward trend in the level of excess weight averaged across all adults by 2020. The strategy drew on, among other sources, the models in the Foresight report which projected rates of obesity in 2050 if trends continued 
[normal]unchecked
[normal] and more recent analysis (2011) which
[normal] modelled obesity rates in 2030; and

[normal]Industrial Strategy
[normal]’
[normal] is a long term partnership with business, which applies across the whole of Government and gives business the confidence to invest. The partnership between Government and Industry includes the formation of Sector Councils that are co-chaired by Ministers and Industry leaders. Each sector has recently published a strategy document that develops a shared vision for the future of 
[normal]the industry and an action plan to get there. Each Sector Council analysed its sector

[normal]Active Travel
[normal]’
[normal] work, led by the Department of Transport 
[normal]working closely with the 
[normal]Department of Health, has been developed through regular engagement with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Ministry of Justice, the Department for Education, and the Department for Communities and Local Government; in particular to ensure an ongoing dialogue about all aspects of cycling and wider active travel policy. These discussions have been informed by horizon scanning to consider the technological and economic factors (such as increasing use of electrical vehicles and peak oil) that are likely to shape urban str
[normal]eetscapes over the coming years;

[normal]‘
[normal]Evidence Investment Strategy
[normal]’
[normal] [bold]is currently being developed and has used an analysis of horizon scanning sources along with input from policy makers, evidence specialists and independent experts to identify key strategic challenges for the department. This will ensure

[normal]The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s 
[normal]‘
[normal]Carbon Plan
[normal]’
[normal] is a cross-government assessment which sets out how the UK will achieve decarbonisation within the framework of its energy policy.
[normal] The plan contains a range of possible future scenarios for the UK, based on analysis of the technical and economic potential of different abatement options. The department’s UK Energy Projects underpin the plan, setting out how we expect energy supply and demand
[normal] to evolve between now and 2030; and

[normal]The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is engaging actively with O
[normal]fcom
[normal], industry and academics to develop a digital communications infrastructure strategy
[normal] [bold]from 2015 to 2025. In parallel, and contributing to the infrastructure strategy, the department is developing the

[normal] to set out how we can achieve best value from use of the radio spectrum to 2025 and beyond.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Policy Making[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Department of Health
[normal] has an evidence-based programme of policies and actions on public health underpinned by an analysis of trends over 20 years. This draws on evidence 
[normal]both at the domestic level and as part of international collaborations, such as with the World Health Organization
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] programme, supported by horizon scanning, includes national ambitions to reduce smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol, with corresponding metrics included in the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Public Health Outcomes Framework
[normal]’
[normal] to track progress.
[normal] In relation to alcohol, for example, the Department of Health has funded the University of Sheffield’s School of Health and Related Research to model the effect of public health interventions. A version of this model has also been endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The reports produced by the Pensions Commission made the recommendation for all employees to be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension. The Department for Work and Pensions began the implementation of Automatic Enrolment in 2012
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department for Education make use of horizons scanning to help understand demographic, economic and social trends and their implications for the education system. Understanding the external environment affects how many early education school and post-16 places are required, how many teachers are needed and where to build schools. The department has developed models to anticipate and understand future trends. As well as being used for funding purposes, pupil projections help the department to determine teacher numbers and future teacher training needs

[normal]The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s 
[normal]‘
[normal]Future of Heating

[normal] plan takes forecasts of likely future heat demand in the UK and considers the different technologies that could meet this demand, and how specific barriers to deployment could be addressed
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to carrying out strategic horizon scanning, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s futures capacity includes policy-level bespoke scanning. For example, the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Green Food Project
[normal]’
[normal] used horizon scanning to explore the steps necessary for the UK to achieve a successful green food scenario. The department’s noise team used pre-existing environmental scenarios to identify and evaluate the impact of future drivers of c
[normal]hange on the noise environment; and

[normal]‘
[normal]Research Changes Lives - MRC Strategic Plan 2009-2014
[normal]’
[normal] and set the context for the Assisted Living Innovation Platform being run by Technology Strategy Board. The findings of the report also influenced the Department for Health’s 2011 mental health strategy

[normal]a.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department for Transport uses modelling of population projections with detailed evidence on trips made by different household types for various journey purposes, plus transport costs and efficiency proj
[normal]ections to forecast road demand;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Home Office actively uses horizon scanning to provide advice to law enforcement agencies. For example, it has recently set up a Crime Reduction Hub 
[normal]which will build links with academics, industry and others to analyse crime trends.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department for Education use
[normal]s
[normal] modelling to produce projections on pupil numbers, future teacher training needs based on economic conditions and to determine spec
[normal]ific funding requirements;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Ministry of Justice has carried out horizon scanning activities to identify the key drivers of civil and family justice workload and used this information to create models to estimate future demand for Ministry of Justice services; and
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department of Health
[normal] [bold]uses modelling of future scenarios 
[normal]in a number of areas, including using modelling to identify
[normal] the major risk factors for non-communicable diseases. For example, modelling underpins the Government’s national ambitions to achieve sustained downward trends in overweight and obesity in England. This draws on modelling such as the work by the Government Office for Science (2007) proj
[normal]ecting rates of obesity in 2050
[normal] and more recent analysis (2011) m
[normal]odelling obesity rates in 2030.
[normal] Another example is the NHS Health Checks programme (commissioned by Local Authorities) which is based on extensive modelling work undertaken by the department in 2008/9. This modelling has shown that the programme has the potential to detect at least 20,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease earlier, allowing individuals to better manage and improve quality of life. It could also prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes a year. Ongoing horizon scanning for this programme will be taken forward by an expert group set up by Public Health England to advise on scientific developments, research and evaluation needs.
