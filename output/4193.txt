[[[, University of Westminster]]]

[[[ [FBB0078]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I am submitting these comments as an independent academic and commentator on communications policy at the University of Westminster. I have been involved in research and policy analysis on media issues for over 30 years, specialising in broadcasting, regulation and journalism. I have acted as specialist adviser to the House of Lords select committee on Communications for four inquiries over the last six years, twice gave oral evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, and have written several books and numerous book chapters and articles on media policy issues. My book on the BBC and its future, published in 1994, is still relevant to today’s debates. My latest book discusses, in particular, the BBC’s vital role as a benchmark for quality, trust and impartiality in broadcast journalism. This submission follows the order of questions posed by the committee in its call for evidence. &#xa0;
