defaultFiscal devolution should be built

default&#xa0;default1.default              defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester
default warmly welcomes the CLG Select Committee Inquiry into fiscal devolution to cities and city regions. 
defaultThe inquiry is timely, following on from the 
defaultrecommendations of
default the Silk Commission
default and 
defaultLondon Finance Commission,
default and responding
default to the 
defaultlaunch of the City Centred Campaign for fiscal devolution 
defaultas 
defaultadvocated by 
defaultthe 
defaultCore Cities Group, 
defaultGreater London Authority
default and London Councils. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWe have argued 
defaultfor many years 
defaultthat democratically elected local leaders need to have control over the levers and resources which impact 
defaulton their ability to deliver economic growth and to improve the quality of life for local residents. It is essential that financial capa
defaultcity is aligned with functional economic areas so that growth and 
defaultpublic service 
defaultreform strategies 
defaultcan be
default integrated to support competitiveness and labour market productivity. 
defaultThe current system
default in this country
default, which is one of the most centralised in the 
defaultworld, limits local control over funding and means that cities are able to influence only around 5% of the taxes that are raised within them
default. This is 
defaultfar less than international competitors
default and
default constrain
defaults the ability of cities to deliver on growth and refo
defaultrm. 
defaultThe situation for major cities in 
defaultEngland
default is also out of step with moves to increase fiscal devolution to the devolved administrations. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultWhilst there have been a number of steps towards further devolution, in particular through City Deals
default and the 
defaultforthcoming Growth Deals
default, we 
defaultview these as only the beginning of an ongoing process of decentralisation from Whitehall. The City Deals process has underlined the importance of differential devolution, whereby packages of powers and resources can be devolve
defaultd to local authorities based on the ability of those places to contribute to national priorities, as well as the capacity to demonstrate effective structures for local leadership, decision-making and accountability. One size does not fit all and devolution
default of powers and resources may be through different packages and to different timescales. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultThe recently published Core Cities Growth Prospectus
default outlines the international evidence for decentralisation including fiscal devolution. The evidence shows tha
defaultt 
defaultcities with more local control over funding and policy achieve better economic results
default and are better placed to outperform the national economy
default. 
defaultThis work
default is supported by 
defaultProfessor Michael Parkinson’s
default 
defaultinternational 
defaultres
defaultearch
default,
default 
defaultwhich 
defaultillustrates
default that decentralising powers and resources 
defaultcoupled with
default spreading investment and encouraging high performance 
defaulti
defaultn a range of cities produce
defaults benefits on a national scale. 
default&#xa0;default2.default              defaultThe case for changedefault default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester
default has
default established the 
defaultfirst statutory Combined Authority (GMCA) in the country, demonstrating the strength of local leadership and governance arrangements, and building on 25 years of joint working through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA). 
defaultA key 
defaultadvantage of the Combined Authority model is the joint governance arrangements which it provides for transport, economic development and regeneration, which allow for strategic prioritisation of the levers of growth across the functional economic area.
default 
defaultThe
default GMCA works closely with the Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), 
defaultand together
default the GMCA and LEP provide a unique platform for governance and 
defaultaccountability across the city region
default for future devolution of powers and funding. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester’s econom
defaultic performance has been strong over recent decades, even during the recession – generating £48billion GVA per annum (around 4%
default of the national economy), and whilst
default the national picture remains uncertain, th
defaulte number of jobs in 
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester is
default predicte
defaultd to grow by more than 7% over the next decade. However, while the economy has grown, our skills base and productivity have not kept pace and we have not been able to reduce dependency or close the gap between the tax that is generated here and the cost of
default public services. 
defaultOur productivity gap is in part due to lower skills levels and lower levels of economic activity than the South East and if we are to fulfil our growth potential we must address that gap. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultDespite the reductions in funding to publi
defaultc 
defaultservices, total public sector 
defaultspend in Greater Manchester increased from £21billion to £22billion between 2008/9 and 2011/12. Reductions in spend by local authorities, the police and fire services and others have been offset by increases in spending on wel
defaultfare and health and social care. The cost of providing p
defaultublic sector services is becoming
default increasingly unsustainable, with a greater proportion spent on the costs of dependency and less on opportuni
defaultties to increase growth and red
defaultuce the demand for those se
defaultrvices. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultWe know from our analysis and experience that with the right tools we can create jobs and growth
default,
default but 
defaultthat 
defaultgrowth alone 
defaultwill not fundamentally change places or reduce the costs of dependency that fall to public services. We need to create 
defaultlevers to drive both growth and reform
default,
default which are
default 
defaultrooted in real 
defaultplaces with the capability and capacity to use them. 
defaultThis includes a
default local skills agenda
default, which
default will enable us to align the 
defaultskills of our residents with jobs both now and in the future, 
defaultthere
defaultby enabling
default more people to find sustainable work, productivity to rise and businesses to grow. 
defaultAn example of our innovative place based approach is the 
defaultGreater Manchester Work Programme Leavers scheme
default. This will provide integrated and intensive support to 
defaulthelp people 
defaultclaiming Employment Support Allowance who have not found sustained work through the Work Programme
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultWe are 
defaulttherefore 
defaultseeking to create a platform for fiscal self-reliance tha
defaultt
default empowers local authorities to undertake their place shaping ro
defaultle to create high quality places that attract and retain more productive people and businesses. 
defaultOur approach to achieving this, based around the twin themes of growth and reform, is set out in the recently revised Greater 
defaultManchester Strategy ‘Stronger Toge
defaultther’
default and the Greater Manchester Growth and Reform Plan
default submitted to government as part of the Growth Deal Process.

defaultFiscal d
defaultevolution should be built around a new settlement between central and local government based

defaulth incentivises local investment -
default rewarding economic growth and reducing dependency. 
defaultThe aims of such devolution are to ensure that 
defaultplaces 
defaultcan 
defaultdevelop greater self-sufficiency with the tools to promote growth and 
defaultreduce 
defaultdependency to 
defaultbecome 
defaultpotentially 
defaultself-sustaining

defaultgrowth and meeting

defaultthat lie

default.
default 
defaultThe
default 
defaultdevolution of substantial fiscal powers should be 
defaultcontingent on the ability of 
defaultplaces 
defaultto demonstrate 
defaultthe robustness of the functional economic market area concerned and 
defaulteffective structures for local leadership, decision-making and accountability for t
defaulthat area. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
default              
defaultIn Greater 
defaultManchester
default we have sought to harness central and local funds in new ways to support our growth priorities for many years. We have developed an Investment Fund that has allowed us to coordinate funds to deliver growth priorities across the city region with an emphasi
defaults on recyclable investment. We have also worked with government to develop the innovat
defaultive 
defaultEarnback
default Model which allows
default us to capture a proportion of the growth generated as a result of our local investment in transport infrastructure for reinvestment. 
defaultThis 
defaultis based on a formula
default linked to changes in 
defaultrateable values over time at the Greater Manchester level, which provides a revenue stream over 30 years
default, provided that
default additional GVA is created relative to the agreed baseline. 
defaultThis therefore provides an additio
defaultnal incentive for Greater Manchester to prioritise local government spending to maximise 
defaulteconomic
default growth. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultWe want to build on these approaches to drive long term growth through using new financial models that support early investment
default f
defaultor projects whe
defaultre 
defaultcentral and local government priorities converge 
defaultand for which 
defaultmore traditional funding models 
defaultdo not work as well
default. 
defaultThis will 
defaultrequire
default central and local 
defaultgovernment 
defaultto 
defaultwork together to develop the optimum funding mechanisms to promote growth at the level 
defaultof place. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default4
default              
defaultThis must be accompanied by national 
defaultmodelling and forecasts for public sector spending 
defaultwhich 
defaultincentivise or account for 
defaultgrowth in places.
default The current system mitigates against innovation by treating local growth as a zero sum game – with growth in one locality being assumed to be at the expense of growth in another. 
default&#xa0;
default4.default              defaultFiscal measuresdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultFiscal devolution must play a significant role in 
defaultany realignment of the relationship between local authorities and central government. The current model rewards central government for behaviour and decisions made by local authorities, providing little incentive to communities.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultLocal authorities do r
defaultaise council tax locally, but the bandings are set nationally and central Government maintains significant control over the level of any council tax increases. Whilst the principle of council tax referendums provides direct accountability, the variable nat
defaulture of the referendum threshold set by central Government makes long term decision making for local authorities problematic.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultCouncil tax is only one property tax, and there is a strong case for others to be devolved to local authorities, such as stamp
default duty. Alongside retained business rates, local authorities would be incentivised to encourage economic activity such as house-buying in their area if they retained some or all of the stamp duty due on a property sale, and the funds could then be used to p
defaultrovide local services.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultThere is also a need for a wider debate on local taxation, and 
defaultin particular whether
default local authorities could be give
defaultn discretion to introduce other forms of taxation, for example a hotel room levy. Given the role local authoriti
defaultes play in promoting their areas and encouraging both tourism and inward investment, a hotel room levy would provide a source of funding for such services derived from their success.
default&#xa0;
default5.default              defaultPublic service reform default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultAs outlined above, i
defaultncentivising and rewa
defaultrding growth must be accompanied by more control over the other public sector resources which are spent in local areas. 
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester
default has been on a journey of reforming public services which has involved piloting integrated working in the most deprive
defaultd neighbourhoods of the city region, pioneering work on Troubled Families and the national whole place Community Budget Pilot. 
defaultOur Community Budget Pilot has addressed 
defaulthow to transform the way we deliver services in order to reduce dependency and demand, a
defaultnd to increase productivity through work and skills. Our final submission to government included a number of new delivery and investment models which cross traditional public sector boundaries and have the ability to achieve improved outcomes through earli
defaulter 
defaultintervention and prevention. 
defaultThis is part of a wider programme of Public Service Reform in Greater Manchester working on the reduction of demand and dependency – focusing on Early Years, Troubled Families, Transforming Justice, Health and Social Care an
defaultd Work and Low Skills. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultA priority for us is to take the results of the 
defaultCommunity Budgets P
defaultilot forward as the basis of a potential new settlement between national and local government that supports, incentivises and responds to public sector reform. 
defaultA new way of capturing the benefits of growth must also not solely be related to business rates as a proxy of growth, but should also be related to new investment models which are designed to deliver savings by reducing dependency. This can only be deliver
defaulted on an individual place basis.
default&#xa0;
default6.default              defaultPlace based settlementsdefault&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester
default strongly supports the proposal within the 2013 Autumn Statement for government to work towards local public services having the same long term indicative budgets as depart
defaultments
default 
defaultand supporting local areas to deliver services differently if the
defaulty can show it will save money. 
defaultGreater certainty of future budgets would provide local partners with the impetus to invest now in public service reform that will deliver future savings.
default They will be able to decommission services no longer required in the knowledge that their investment will be recouped and recycled.  
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultThis is strongly linked to the Greater Manchester Pub
defaultl
defaultic Service Reform approach, whereby we 
defaultare asking for the 
defaultfreedom to reinvest the return on capital projects, and on the increased tax income as businesses begin to do better as a result, we are also focused on the need to keep the savings made in places from reduced dependency for long enough for those changes t
defaulto people and places to become irreversible.
default              
default7.default              defaultJoint accountabilitydefault&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultFiscal devolution is not just about whether powers should be devolved or remain at the centre. There are a range of policies and funding streams which need to reflect national and l
defaultocal priorities and where models of accountability could be explored in more detail. A solution may lie in creating a link between the channels of accountability already established by central government to manage its relationship with arms-length bodies, 
defaultand the arrangements for local accountability in place in local government.  
default&#xa0;
default8.default              defaultLocal government finance reformdefault&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
defaultAlthough the focus of the 
defaultinquiry relates to fiscal form it is also important to consider the wider 
defaultcontext for local government fi
defaultnance.
default 
defaultDespite some changes to the local government finance system, local authorities are still heavily reliant on central government funding to fund services. The part-localisation of business rates was an attempt to remedy this, but the outcome from the proces
defaults was deeply disappointing as the incentive effect was heavily diluted, and overall funding levels remain determined by central government.
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultWhilst understanding and recognising the need for
default the
default Treasury to maintain control over public finances, there 
defaultalso needs to be recognition within the funding system of the strong financial stewardship of local government, accompanied with a more trusting relationship between central and local. 
defaultPrudential borrowing is a strong example of this, as it provides a fram
defaultework within which local authorities can borrow what they need for capital purposes, and which provides some reassurance to Treasury regarding the affordability of such borrowing.
default&#xa0;
default8.3
default              
defaultThe main sources of local funding are now both subject to direct 
defaultg
defaultovern
defaultment subsidy through the Council Tax Freeze Grants and the reduction in busin
defaultess rates following the Autumn S
defaulttatement. Experience from the past shows that once local taxation loses its local rationale, 
defaultthere is a 
defaultdanger that it loses credibility
default,
default and gover
defaultnment is faced with a fut
defaulture dilemma about whether to co
defaultntinue with its subsidy or find another solution.
default&#xa0;
default8.4
default              
defaultAny reform of the wider local government finance system
default 
defaultmust, at its core, retain the principle of equalisation, to ensure that there is an unde
defaultrlying fairness within the system. A key element of this must be a reassessment of council tax, and in particular the bandings used. House prices have grown at significantly different rates across the country since the bands were originally set, and this h
defaultas created an unequal system. Council tax bands must be 
defaultrevalued
default, in a similar way to business rates assessments, to ensure that the tax being charged on a property is fair wherever in the country it is.
