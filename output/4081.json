"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Phil Watts (BRC 66)&#xa0;\nBuilding Regulations certification of electrical \ninstallation and repairs in dwellings\n&#xa0;\nI am writing in response to your invitation for submissions from interested parties on the \nabove.\n&#xa0;\nI have been in electri\ncal contracting, including \ndomestic wo\nrk, for the la\nst \n3\n5 years, \nand have for the last three years run a Training Centre, training apprentices, career-change students and qualified electricians looking to further their knowledge\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nI \nalso \nassess NVQ’s\n and a\nm a\n Technical Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology\n. \n&#xa0;\nIt is my belief that;\n&#xa0;\nPerson scheme and the requirements regarding domestic electrical work\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe public are generally still not aware, or are confused and even misled about the Competent Person scheme and the requirements regarding domestic electrical work.&#xa0;\nI have over recent years often been asked by friends, relatives etc my opinion of electrical work that they have had\n completed\n by electricians or builders, kitchen fitters and similar trades. Unfortunately, in most cases, they have not heard of or been informed about the Competent Person Scheme. Some have been under the impression that they ‘have to use an NICEIC firm’ \nbut the e\nm\nphasis is usually on the fact that they must be \nNICEIC and Part P Qualified\n \n and not that there are requirements to be met under the Building Regulations.\n&#xa0;\nI believe this is mainly due to the ‘thrust’ of the marketing and advertising which is usually all about which body the electrician should belong to, NICEIC, ECA, NAPIT, rather than the requirements of the Building Regs, and the responsibilities of the per\nson ordering the work as well as the person carrying out the work. \n&#xa0;Those carrying out work are still often untrained and even working dangerouslyIt is still the case that there is insufficient control over who can operate as an electrician. Doctors have \n    to be properly trained and registered, as do nurses, teachers, and a host of other professions. This is just as it should be, these people have our lives, or our children’s welfare in their hands. Yet anyone can enter a persons house or place of work, \nalter their electrical installation, leave it dangerous or even lethal, and even get paid for doing it! They need no qualifications and no training, just a rough idea of how to make it work, and no idea of how to make it safe. The recent changes to the Bui\nlding Regs, which mean that a third party can sign off someone else’s work make it even easier for unqualified persons to operate. Furthermore, the accreditation bodies do not prevent this.\n&#xa0;\nI have had students recently who were completing their Level 3 Cit\ny &amp; Guilds 2330 qualification, \n \nwho enquired with the NICEIC about joining as Domestic Installers. When they asked about qualifications, they were told that they were already overqualified as all they needed was the 17\nth\n Edition qualification (2382-12). Th\nis rush to get people qualified or registered is really just about taking their money.\n&#xa0;\nThere is ‘plastered’ all over the internet opportunities for people to ‘train as an electrician in five weeks’. \n \nCourses that include the 17\nth\n Edition, Inspection &amp; Test\ning, Building Regs, as WELL as teaching the basic electrical priciples and practices – in FIVE WEEKS! \n&#xa0;\nSorry but this just cannot be done to a satisfactory standard. Consider also, why do we have the term ‘domestic installer’ rather than electrician? Are w\ne saying that levels of competency can be lower for those working in domestic environments than for those carrying out commercial and industrial work.   So, I take it, that it is OK to kill or injure people in their own homes, or cause fires etc, as long a\ns it doesn’t happen to them at work? \n&#xa0;\nThree weeks ago I visited a distressed friend, who had commissioned a ‘builder’ to carry out renovations  and install a new kitchen at her house. She was concerned about the electrical work. When I looked at it    I fo\nund that all the sockets in the kitchen, which were hanging down off the wall were ‘live’. They had been left in this condition for two weeks, waiting for the ‘electrician’ to return.\n She has two children in the house. The lighting circuit contained seven \njoints, at just one switch-drop, which the builder was going to just plaster into the wall. There was a taped up joint behind the washing machine, where a cable had been extended. One of the sockets had a circuit protective conductor just hanging loose, he\nnce there was no ‘earth’ on the socket. All the metal boxes behind the sockets had been installed without grommets to protect the cable. Live cables were hanging down from the ceiling where a wall had been partially demolished. A toilet and a sink had been\n installed in the cupboard where the fuseboard was fixed. The sink was literally two inches away from the fuseboard. \n&#xa0;\nWhile I was there the builder turned up, so I challenged him about the work. It transpired that he does all his own electrical work. I men\ntioned the Building Regs. and the requirements of Part P and he was none the wiser. He was not an electrician, was not a competent person, had not notified Building Control, and had no idea of inspection and testing. \nThis is not an unusual case, I have com\ne across this type of situation far too often. \n&#xa0;\nDue to the dangerous state of the system, I returned the following day and made everything safe, but how many other substandard installations are going unnoticed?\n&#xa0;\nThe other issue here is that due to recent changes, most of this work would NOT be notifiable, he had not installed any new circuits, just wrecked the existing ones! \n&#xa0;\nMost non-\nnotifiable\n work does not get tested or certified, despite the existence of the M\ninor Works Certificate, as the vast majority of those carrying out these works are unqualified and are not experienced in inspection and testing. By removing the category of ‘non-notifiable minor work’, the confusion over what is and is not notifiable will\n be removed. \nOnly qualified electricians will be able to work on electrical systems, and all work will get inspected, tested and certified properly, and be effectively documented for future information.\n&#xa0;\nThe review mechanism is skewed.The practice of \n‘yearly reviews’ and visits\n is insufficient in my view. I cannot help but feel it is more for the  benefit of the accreditation bodies as it gives them additional income, rather than an effective review of the operation of the installation firm etc. Most f\nirms that I know select jobs that they can ‘show’ to the inspecting engineer, and I have even known people to show someone else’s work, just produce the paperwork to evidence it as their own. \n&#xa0;There is widespread confusion about what is required, Part P, qualifications etc.&#xa0;&#xa0;\nHow many times do we see ‘Part P qualified’ or ‘Part P approved’ written into marketing literature and on the side of vans, yet those of us that are properly i\nnformed know that the successful completion of a Part P course DOES NOT make someone a competent enterprise\n, or\n a qualified electrician!\n \nUnfortunately, the g\neneral public do not know this.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\nThe numbe\nr of ‘Part P’ courses\n that have no real value is also a\n problem. For example, when Part P was introduced, I ‘filled in’ for a \nsick colleague\n, and \ndelivered several lessons of\n a Part P course at \na local F.E. College\n. During a discussion with the class, it was apparent that they believed they were gaining a qual\nification which enabled them to \n‘\nself \ncertify\n’ their own work. I had to inform them that only the approving bodies could \naward\n them\n ‘competent enterprise status’\n, and that the course, that they had paid £600 fo\nr, was informative only so\n they would also have to pay to be assessed by one of the approving bodies. Needless to say, they were not best pleased at the news, but thanked me for clearing things up for them.\n&#xa0;\nThis type of confusion is still rife within the industry, and clear, non-b\niased information  is required to ensure that everyone knows exactly what is required. \nRemember also that there is \na constant influx of new apprentices and other trainees into the industry, they all deserve to receive the correct information right from the\n beginning of their training.\n&#xa0;\nSo how do we define a qualified electrician, and at what stage do we look at someone and say, yes, you are qualified, I would trust you to undertake my electrical work?\n \n&#xa0;\nThe EAWR 1989 and BS7671:2011 both state that persons un\ndertaking electrical work should be competent enough to avoid danger. Neither uses the term ‘qualified’. So what do we mean by the term? Taking two definitions from different sources, the term qualified is defined as;\n&#xa0;\na/. \nmeeting the proper standards and r\nequirements and training for an office or position or task;\nb/. quality or skill needed for a particular activity, \n&#xa0;\nThe Wiring Regulations (BS7671:2011) defines a competent person as someone who;\n&#xa0;\nPossesses sufficient technical knowledge, relevant \npractical skills and experience for the nature of the electrical work undertaken and is able at all times to prevent danger and, where appropriate, injury to him/herself and others.\n&#xa0;\nThe National Occupational Standards detail the knowledge and skills requir\nements for persons involved in electrical  installation work, so why do we allow people who have clearly not attained these standards to carry out electrical work? \n&#xa0;\nAs someone involved both in installation and in training, I have a pretty clear idea of th\ne standard of tradesperson I would all\now to work in my house. They must know how to plan and design the installation before they start, and have taken into account the safety of myself and my family. They must possess the knowledge and understanding of ele\nctrical systems, to enable them to deal with any issues arising from the alteration of my installation. They must know how to inspect and test the installed installation correctly and safely\n, and be able to provide me with the proper documentation. They mu\nst be aware of how the installation process may affect the structure and characteristics of my home, (sound travel, fire safety, ventilation etc). They must work diligently and prevent any damage to mine or my neighbours home or the environment, and provid\ne me with a guarantee of their workmanship and materials. So what do I ask them for when they come to tender for the work?\n&#xa0;\nDo I ask to see their qualifications, and if so, which ones, and \ndo qualifications on their own prove competence? \nHow much experience\n do they have, or are they fresh out of college? Membership to any of the ‘approving bodies’ does not impress me either, as I have experienced many times situations where ‘members’ do not have a full understanding of what they are attempting to install.\n&#xa0;\nHaving studied the National Occupational Standards, I am amazed that they seem to be ‘ignored’ so blatantly by some of the ‘agencies’ that should be helping to maintain the \nstandards. These NOS’s are already written, and provi\nde good criteria of\n what we sh\nould be looking for in an electrician. I would suggest that if more attention was paid to keeping to these standards, and incorporating them in any future developments in the training, assessment and qualification of electricians, the home would be a safer\n place.\n&#xa0;\nSo is there any existing system that sets a sensible benchmark for electrical qualifications, experience and knowledge, as well as checking health and safety awareness? Well, yes there is. Currently the J.I.B. operate a system that recognises qual\nifications, job experience and knowledge\n,\n and grades applicants accordingly. In conjunction with the E.C.A. they administer the E.C.S. card system.(Electrotechnical Certification Scheme). \n&#xa0;\nBriefly, the ECS card is the ‘electrical equivalent’ of the CSCS ca\nrd \nthat is \noperated on most construction sites, where possession of a card is required for all personnel to gain access to work on site.\n \nThe CSCS card is awarded following successful completion of a Health &amp; safety test. The ECS card, which should be a req\nuirement for all persons carrying out electrical installation, requires two things;\n&#xa0;\nThe successful completion of a health &amp; safety exam (a different one to the CSCS card recognising   the additional hazards of electricity).\n&#xa0;\nApplication and award of a JIB g\nrade based on qualifications, experience and knowledge.\n&#xa0;\nOn successful achievement an applicant is provided with the ECS card which details their grading as  assessed by JIB and their details, which can then be shown to potential customers. This provides th\ne customer with proof of identification and \ngives them a guide as to the competency of the person tendering for the work. The cost of the JIB application, grading and exam\n \nis £78 in total, which is in my opinion very good value for a system which checks an\nd assesses your qualifications and experience, your health and safety knowledge and awareness and provides an identification card for you to show \nto \ncustomers. \n&#xa0;\nI understand that the JIB set wage rates that are currently above some of the cheaper ‘outsi\nde’ labour rates, and hence \nsome \nfirms are looking to move away from them, in order to utilise this cheaper labour and cut costs. In the current economic climate obviously \nfirms are looking at all possibilities when it comes to cutting their costs to remai\nn competitive. However, we must ensure that this does not also involve cutting the skills and knowledge levels of the workforce. Surely it is worth paying a little more for competent, skilled operatives, after all we would not accept imported cable just be\ncause it is cheaper, \nunless it was up to standard. The JIB/ECA \nadministered \nECS card scheme is the one scheme that \nis currently\n capable of grading all operatives with at least some level of accuracy. \nWe might not always be happy with the grade they set, BUT at least they have standards, and if someone wants to progress up through the levels they can, with training and experience. \nI suggest this system is adopted because I do not believe in re-inventing\n the wheel, (although that is another option) b\nut I am \nalso \nsuggesting that we go one step further, and develop the scheme i\nnto a license to practice, \nas exists in many other countries.\n&#xa0;\nElectricians, electrical contractors, electrical installers and electrical engineers should be licensed.The average person would not know how to assess the competence of anyone trading as an electrician, just like \nwith \na Doctor or a Dentist, they would rely on ‘the authorities’\n to identify and assess those plying th\neir trade accordingly. I do not have a clue about medical issues, so when I visit the Doctor I am totally reliant upon \nher judgement. She could prescribe\n \nweed killer as a tonic, and I would never know, well, not until I was having my stomach pumped anyway!\n The trouble is that, with electrical work, even incompetent persons can get \nlights and sockets to work, but are they safe?\n&#xa0;\nThe development of a ‘license’ is a must for this industry. We can play around with ‘competent person’ and ‘competent enterpr\nise’ sc\nhemes forever\n, but it will not prevent unqualified, unskilled or incompetent persons from having a go at ‘installing some electrics’.\n&#xa0;\nA license \nof ‘electrician’ grade \nshould be a requirement for buying electrical installation equipment (cables, \ncontainment, distribution boards, circuit breakers, socket outlets, switches etc), just like having a fire-arms license, and let’s face it, electricity can be just as deadly as a gun in the wrong hands.\n&#xa0;\nOnly licensed operatives should be allowed on any site, \nmost of the large\n contractors alread\ny operate this way so it will\n be a case of widening the current system and making it a requirement on ALL sites. The current ‘competent person/enterprise’ scheme ne\neds adjusting, so that ONLY licensed operatives can apply, and that all staff working for ‘an enterprise’ should be registered and licensed.\n The criteria \n for membership to the approving bodies (NICEIC, ECA, NAPIT etc) should be standardised if they are to\n continue ‘approving’, \nso that there is a minimum standard across the board, \nand the grade awarded on the individual license should be taken into account.\n Either that or separate the membership process from the ‘approv\nal\n’ process, and standardise the ‘appr\nov\nal\n’ process! \nThe term ‘domestic installer’  should be dropped, either you are an electrician, or you are not!\n&#xa0;\nClarity of all requirements for all grading should be made available to the industry and the public, so everyone knows where they stand, and can\n choose accordingly. Then, when I next knock on somebody’s  door\n, I can show them my license \ndisplaying my grade, and they will know\n who I am and whether I can do their job.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
