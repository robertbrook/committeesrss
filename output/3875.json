The constraints imposed on government through judicial review are in part procedural and in part substantive.\n The range of these principles varies, but normally includes ideas such as: legality, procedural propriety, participation, fundamental rights, openness, rationality, relevancy, propriety of purpose, reasonableness, equality, legitimate expectations, legal \ncertainty and proportionality.\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Public Sector Equality Duty:&#xa0;\nFinal observations:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 November 2013\n \nR (Medical Justice) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2010] \nEWHC 1925 (Admin)\n \nR (Medical Justice) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2011] EWCA \nCiv\n 1710\n [2010] EWHC 1925 (Admin) \nop cit\n, paragraphs 43 \net \nseq\n \n[2010] EWHC 1925 (Admin)\n op cit\n, paragraphs 151 \net \nseq\n The Secretary of State’s appeal was brought against the judgment in \nR (HA(Nigeria)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2012] EWHC 979 (Admin)\n \nThe\n appeal i\ns brought against the judgment in \nR (Das) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[\n2013] EWHC 682 (Admin)\n \nThere may be some rare cases where a person is wrongfully detained despite his or her having leave to enter or remain, or not being subject to immigration control – e.g. \nR (\nMuuse\n) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2010]\n EWCA \nCiv\n 453 – but generally a detainee will not have leave and hence cannot be \nlawfully\n resident.\n Ministry of Justice, \nTransforming legal aid: Next steps\n, Annex B, Response to consultation, page 87, paragraphs 125 &amp; 12\n6\n e.g. Ministry of Justice, \nJudicial Review – Proposals for further reform\n, Cm 8703, paragraphs 1 &amp; 8\n e.g. Ministry of Justice, \nProposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales\n, Consultation CP12/10, Cm 7967, November 2010, paragraph 4.83; Ministry of Justice, \nReform of L\negal Aid in England and Wales: the Government Response\n, Cm 8072, June 2011, page 13, paragraph 15 &amp; Annex A, page 100, paragraph 73\n The letter is available at: \nhttp://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/uploads/other/06_06_2013_10_09_51_Panel%20letter%20to%20AG%20May%202013%20-%20final%204%20June%202013.pdf\n \n \nAppendix 5 to the Select Committee on the Constitution, 6\nth\n Repor\nt of Session 2006-07, \nRelationship between the executive, the judiciary and Parliament\n, HL Paper 151, July 2007\n"
