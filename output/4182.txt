[[[&#xa0;]]]1. I received a PhD in Theoretical Physics in 1982. I  am married, with two grown up children. &#xa0;2. I wish to address some of the scientific issues raised in the Terms of Reference, and to point out some lines of relevant high quality research inadequately assessed by the report. &#xa0;3. My comments are submitted in a personal capacity.&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summar]]]

[[[y]]]&#xa0;4. The report does not provide a balanced  assessment of the scientific literature on natural variability. &#xa0;5. The report only partially addresses the reliability of climate models.&#xa0;6. The report does not sufficiently explain the reasons for the hiatus in global temperature.&#xa0;

[[[To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?]]]&#xa0;7. AR5 does not adequately reflect research into longer term natural variability i.e. variability over decadal and longer time scales. The same criticism applies to AR4. &#xa0;8. This criticism can be verified by searching the body of either report for references to [1-9] or to related papers by the same authors. See also {10.7, FAQ 10.1}.&#xa0;

[[[Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?]]]&#xa0;9. The report acknowledges that some climate models simulate too much warming in response to increases in greenhouse-gas concentration {Box TS.3(c), Box TS.4}. This results in a higher estimation of climate sensitivity {Box TS.4} than those based on observation, for example [10-11].&#xa0;10. Most models overestimate the warming observed in the tropical troposphere {Box TS.4}.&#xa0;11. The global temperature record since the start of the 20th century falls into a series of distinct periods. An early warming during 1910–1940 was followed by a mid-century pause when there was little or no trend; a period of recent warming started in the mid-1970s and finally there is the hiatus in the current century. The magnitudes of the two warming periods are similar, about 0.5 degrees C in each case {Figure 2.20, 10.3.1.1.1}.&#xa0;12. Most models simulate too much warming during the hiatus when CO2 levels have been high {Box TS.3}, and too little warming during the early warming period when CO2 levels were low {10.3.1.1.3}.  &#xa0;13. The report's attribution argument is based on comparison between simulations and observation {Box 10.1, FAQ 10.1}. Such a comparison is less convincing when the patterns of decadal variability observed in the instrumental record are not well simulated, see also [12]. A dynamical explanation for the differences is not provided.&#xa0;14. The question of divergence between model simulated long term variability and variability found in reconstructions [13] is not adequately addressed by the report, see for example {9.5.3.1, Figure 9.33c}. &#xa0;15. In model simulations, temperatures tend to track external forcing over decadal and longer time scales, see for example {10.7.1.3}. However, in reconstructions this is not generally the case [14], and this finding is not discussed by the report.&#xa0;

[[[Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?]]]&#xa0;16. The report suggests that the hiatus "is attributable in roughly equal measure to a cooling contribution from internal variability and a reduced trend in external forcing" {Box TS.3(c)}. &#xa0;17. [10] states that internal variability is predominantly responsible not only for the hiatus, but also for the early warming and subsequent pause during the first 70 years of the 20th century i.e. all decadal variability from the start of the 20th century except the recent warming period.&#xa0;18. Neither the report nor [10] offers a dynamical explanation for the internal variability responsible (in part) for the hiatus. &#xa0;19. The stadium wave is a dynamical mechanism proposed by the line of research described in [3] and [15], which explains the hiatus as well as all 20th century decadal variability . &#xa0;20. The stadium wave is observed in nature but is not simulated by current climate models [15]. Their analysis suggests that the hiatus may continue into the 2030s. &#xa0;
