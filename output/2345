defaultI am writing to ask that Parliament considers including two clauses in the Deregulation Bill:
default&#xa0;
default1. All unsealed Byways Open to Traffic (BOATS), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be reclassified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
default2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy wife and I have been keen walkers for many years and have been dismayed by the horrendous damage done by recreational vehicles (4x4s and motorbikes) in recent years to many green lanes.  As the ruts become impassable even by these vehicles, they leave the green lanes and cause even more damage to surrounding land.  The vehicles adversely affect wildlife and the noise they make is very intrusive for walkers looking for solace from the countryside.
default&#xa0;
defaultI expressly support the formal submissions made by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA), by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG) and by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA).
