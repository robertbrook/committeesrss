[[[Executive summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1. National Trust is a major landowner in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with 255,000 hectares (ha) of countryside, 700 kilometres of coastline and 400 gardens in our care for the benefit of the nation.&#xa0;2. Approximately half of this land is of high nature value, accessible and   enjoyed by millions of people. Together with tenanted farmland, it makes a significant contribution to local and regional economies. &#xa0;3. We recognise the harm caused by Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) - be they plant diseases in gardens and woodlands, plants in water bodies or predatory mammals on seabird islands. &#xa0;4. We recognise the value of both effective quarantine measures, and rapid reaction to control and eradicate INNS including plant diseases.  Our staff can spend up to half of their time controlling invasive species, at a cost of up to £12000 per ha depending on the situation.  &#xa0;5. The draft EU Directive proposal to list 50 INNS is not sufficiently sensitive to existing risk from species and those native species that are poised to cause harm in areas of the EU where they are not native. More emphasis should be based on risk-based assessments that identify species of most concern and provide the basis for risk-based trading.&#xa0;6. The Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategyfor Great Britain (GB INNS Framework), in promoting sound management of INNS, could help define what success looks like, promote more effective engagement with NGOs, and forge more citizen science and state agency based partnerships.&#xa0;7. The Scottish INNS legislation looks promising, as do initiatives in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to tackle INNS on an island –wide basis. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1.1.  The National Trust welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry on Invasive Species.&#xa0;1.2. The National Trust is Europe’s largest conservation charity with over 4 million members and an annual turnover of more than £430 million. We currently manage over 250,000 ha of countryside, several hundred historic houses, gardens and parks and more than 700 km of coastline across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nearly 50 % of the water in England and Wales runs through National Trust land.&#xa0;1.3 The National Trust exists to look after special places for ever, for everyone. We do this in a way which connects the benefits of nature with people, welcoming around 100 million visits to the outdoors, coast and countryside locations managed by the National Trust. We invest over £130m into conservation projects each year, and some of this funding comes from corporate partners. &#xa0;1.4. Management of invasive species is a major investment in resource for the Trust. Typically our countryside and gardens staff spend up to half of their time reducing the impacts of invasive species and plant diseases, most of which are non-native.&#xa0;1.5 We welcome the Committee’s interest in the degree to which the UK should align with EU initiatives, look to legislation in Scotland as a guide, and help shape the GB INNS Framework of the future. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Overview]]]&#xa0;2.1 Invasive Non Native Species (INNS) are a major threat to the UK’s native wildlife and its economy. They also have adverse societal impacts which include the profound sense of loss of iconic and beautiful native species such as the red squirrel (which can contract and die from disease spread by the non-native grey squirrel). &#xa0;2.2 Programmes to tackle INNS in which we are especially active, often in partnership with other organisations and with the help of hundreds of volunteers, include: (1)  Control of Hottentot fig from coastal slopes in Cornwall (to win back flower rich grassland and restore feeding places for the recently re-established chough, the county’s emblemic bird) (2) Control of Rhododendron in north Wales and north Devon to restore oak woodland, and its native bird and lichen species, and on Brownsea and Lundy Islands, to restore habitat for the red squirrel and Lundy cabbage respectively.  (3) Eradication of rats from Lundy Island to save species such as the Manx shearwater from extinction there. (4) Control of grey squirrels in and around refuge areas for red squirrels in the north of England and on Anglesey. (5) Control of non-native aquatic (e.g. New Zealand pygmy weed) and bankside plants (such as Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam) in and around our thousands of ponds and other water bodies (6) Plant health and biosecurity in our heritage gardens. We have a rigour programme of deploying biosecurity to minimise the risk of plant diseases damaging high value plants and destroying the beauty of our nationally important gardens.&#xa0;2.3 Rigorous prioritisation based on risk assessment is critical. Early intervention and the resources needed for this are equally critical, especially where non-native invasive species have been tracked and found to be established in satellite areas. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Our concerns]]]&#xa0;3.1 The future of the Defra GB INNS Programme Board&#xa0;The GB INNS Programme Board represents an important commitment by the UK to reduce the damaging influence of non-native species, and it should be maintained. But it needs more resource to engage with people to be vigilant, to exert stricter quarantine measures, control and eradicate some species at an appropriate scale, define success and report on success or failure. The Board also needs to prioritise high risk species – these are the small suite of non-native invasive species that have the highest capacity to transform native habitats and ecosystems.  In some cases the Board needs to stimulate research where there are significant knowledge gaps. The two examples below illustrate the need to act now on (1) a high risk species not yet established in the UK; and (2) on one which is established but spreading and whose ecological impact is not well understood.&#xa0;(1) Water hyacinth, native to South America, is a major pest of water bodies, making them unnavigable and reducing their biodiversity. This species does not breed in the UK yet, but could do so in a series of warmer weather years. We need a formal watching brief backed by a rapid response mechanism to ensure that water hyacinth does not become established in the UK&#xa0;(2) Chinese water deer, established in the east of England, has recently invaded Orford Ness, a 15 km long shingle spit off the Suffolk coast that is internationally important for its wildlife and historical heritage. We do not know the impact of Chinese water deer on either the natural or cultural or historical features on Orford Ness but remain concerned about this knowledge gap.&#xa0;3.2 Objective setting and realistic costings for control/eradication of INNS&#xa0;In the management of INNS success is reported in a variety of ways. It is insufficient for success to be gauged by how much of a INNS has been removed. A better measure is if native species and habitats can be shown to have been restored, or ecosystem functioning improved as a result of the management. We should not be afraid to recognise failure but need to make sure effective communication is in place to report on what does not work.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.3 Increasing the use of innovative methods to detect early stages of establishment of INNS. &#xa0;Government and others should make more use of innovative methods to detect the early stage of INNS establishment where these are practicable For example, hair tubes for mammals and collections of faeces from which DNA can be extracted to identify species and also individuals; e (environmental) DNA – which can be used to track presence of non-native invasive amphibians such as bullfrogs in ponds for example; camera traps. Much of the data collection can be done by volunteers but would need coordinating with state agencies and analysing by scientists.&#xa0;3.4 The minimum requirements for successful management of INNS&#xa0;The National Trust sees the minimum requirements for successful management of INNS as:&#xa0;3.4.1 Realistic and appropriate prioritisation based on risk assessment for native wildlife, people and the economy. This could lead to risk-based trading of species such as INNS of aquatic plants3.4.2 Consultation with local people leading to rapid decision making leading to rapid action3.4.3 Action at the appropriate scale (e.g. for bankside INNS plants such as Japanese knotweed,  whole water catchments rather than just one part of the catchment where the species is known and conspicuous)3.4.4 Criteria for success agreed early in the project, and success/failure reported on at milestones and at the end of the project.&#xa0;3.5 Delivery mechanisms &#xa0;We see a major role for Local Nature Partnerships as delivery bodies to coordinate, communicate and stimulate state agency, local authority and volunteer partnerships to tackle INNS. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.6 Legislation&#xa0;We advocate better use of powers in the Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981 Schedule 9 and equivalent in Northern Ireland to raise awareness of the risks of unrestricted movement of certain species by human agency, and also learning from INNS legislation in Scotland.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.7 Knowledge gaps&#xa0;We advocate more research on ecological processes and pathogens transfer between INNS and native species (non-native and native crayfish species;  grey/red squirrel - NT supporting the latter)&#xa0;

[[[3.8 ]]]

[[[The Committee might want to consider the following]]]&#xa0;3.8.1. Is the EU draft Directive on Invasive Non – Native Species (INNS) fit for purpose? &#xa0;Is the EU draft Directive’s selection of 50 species deemed to cause most harm sufficiently sensitive – or would a risk-based selection, using climate change scenarios and/or horizon scanning be better at preventing spread and establishment?&#xa0;Will the EU Directive be sufficiently sensitive to the need to prevent the spread of potentially invasive species from EU Member states where they are either native or long established to those where not yet established but where they could cause harm.&#xa0;3.8.2.  How do we prioritise (we cannot manage all INNS everywhere)? &#xa0;We should focus on strengthening existing legislation. The Scottish model looks promising. Ecological priorities should be based on global responsibilities, for example the removal of rats from seabird islands. Societal and economic benefits from managing INNS may however need to be based on different priorities, for instance keeping new plant diseases out of publicly accessible heritage gardens, and clearing away Himalayan balsam to allow access to river banks by anglers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.8.3. How do we measure and report on success and failure? What does success look like?&#xa0;Management needs to be lead by carefully constructed ‘smart’ objectives. INNS can be regarded as successfully managed when they have been prevented from invading the UK through effective legislation and/or quarantine. &#xa0;In some cases invading or established INNS may have been controlled successfully but the expected positive impacts such as evident restoration of native species and/or habitats or wider societal or economic benefit may not have been measured. The failure of management of INNS is rarely reported. This may be because objectives were poorly defined at the outset.&#xa0;A strengthened GB INNS Framework Strategy could help to address this problem, especially if it is more inclusive of NGOs in decision making and includes on appropriate application of the precautionary principle.&#xa0;3.8.4. Should there be a UK/all Ireland approach to management of INNS?&#xa0;INNSs do not respect international boundaries, especially when there is no sea barrier or obvious border control. It makes sense to support the strengthening of al UK/ all Ireland strategy to tackle INNS. &#xa0;Again a strengthened GB INNS Framework Strategy has a supporting role here, as it does in promoting functional working links between Departments at state borders.&#xa0;27 January 2014&#xa0;
