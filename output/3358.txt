[[[Written evidence from Scope (PEX 0022)]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1 Scope exists to make this country a better place for disabled people and their families. We do this by running a range of services, raising awareness of the issues that disabled people face and influencing change across society.&#xa0;We provide support, advice and information for more than a quarter of a million disabled people and their family members every year.&#xa0;1.2 Scope welcomes the opportunity to submit written evidence to the Committee’s Inquiry and would be happy to provide oral evidence if requested. Our submission focuses on the questions relating to public expenditure on social care.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1 Social care is the support that enables disabled people to live independently and with dignity. It supports them to do essential day to day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating as well as living independent lives in their community.&#xa0;2.2 Working aged disabled people make up one third of social care users - in 2012/13, there were 434,775 working-aged disabled people in the social care system - out of a total of 1,332,995. However, demographic changes mean the numbers of working-aged disabled people needing care are projected to rise by 9.2% from 2010 to 2020. &#xa0;

[[[The impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savings]]]&#xa0;3.1 Scope welcomed the Government’s commitment to investing an extra £1bn in social care in the 2010 Spending Review which was an important recognition of the increasing pressures on the social care system.&#xa0;3.2 However as funding for social care is not ring-fenced, this investment must be seen in the context of a 33% cut in local councils’ budgets by 2014/15 and the chronic long term underfunding of the social care system.&#xa0;3.3. Over the past three years, £2.68 billion has been cut from adult social care - 20 per cent of net spending.   With the increasing numbers of disabled adults who need care and support, we are concerned that the Government’s investment will not ensure the sustainable funding of the social care system.&#xa0;3.4 As a result of these pressures, alongside an ageing population, many local authorities have been raising the threshold at which disabled people become eligible for support. However this trend began even before 2010. In 2005, 50% of local authorities set their eligibility criteria at ‘Moderate’ needs but by 2012, 84% had set their eligibility criteria at the higher ‘substantial’ needs, meaning that since 2007/8 the number of people using care has gradually fallen by at least 347,000 (see table below). As a result, just 14% of those with ‘moderate’ FACS needs are receiving care, while at least 800,000 people with care needs are not receiving any support at all.  &#xa0;Change in number of social care recipients

The LGA has estimated that spending on social care will surpass 45% of council budgets by 2019/20, meaning that councils will have to cut social care further or drastically reduce budgets for other services. &#xa0;3.6 Research by Scope and four other leading disability charities in “The Other Care Crisis” report has found that this chronic underfunding of social care has had a significant impact on disabled people’s lives:&#xa0;&#xa0;3.7 But recent economic modelling by Deloitte, contained in the Ending the Care Crisis report, has shown that investment in social care can lead to significant financial savings for the NHS, central Government and Local Authorities. &#xa0;For example, a £1.2 billion investment in care for people with ‘moderate’ level needs would result in:&#xa0;A £570 million saving to the NHS and local government:&#xa0;A £700 million saving to Central Government:&#xa0;3.8 As evidenced above, there are clear long term economic benefits to local authorities, the NHS and the Treasury of investing in care for people with lower level needs. We therefore recommend the Government sets the new ‘national eligibility threshold’, as set out in the regulations accompanying the Care Bill, at a level equivalent to ‘Moderate’ under the current FACs system.

[[[The impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budget]]]4.1 We wholly welcome the creation of a £3.8bn Integration Transformation Fund (including a £2bn transfer from the NHS budget) to ensure better integration between health and social care announced in the Spending Review in June this year, particularly that it will be spent through Health and Wellbeing Boards. &#xa0;4.2 We also welcome the conditions that are attached to the funding which will ensure a joint approach to assessments and care planning will be taken, as well as there being a professional who will be accountable where funding is used for integrated packages of care.&#xa0;4.3 However, given the extent of the long-term underinvestment in social care, we have strong concerns that this transfer of funding will be inadequate to meet the growing needs of working-aged disabled people and additional investment is needed.&#xa0;4.4 Moreover, the Integration Transformation Fund is predominantly to support people being discharged from hospital- the majority of whom are likely to older people and therefore the vast majority of younger working age disabled people may not benefit. &#xa0;4.5 By focussing on delayed transfers of care, emergency admissions and readmissions into hospital, and out of hours/weekend packages, it is also likely that the ITF will reduce existing problems rather than unmet need. Therefore it is likely that investment in more preventative, community- based services will continue to be neglected.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; Community Care Statistics 2012/13, Health and Social Care Information Centre,  Fernandez J-L et al (2012) Implications of setting eligibility criteria for adult social care services in England at the moderate needs level, PSSRU www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg.../dg_191696.pdf ADASS annual survey results, http://www.adass.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=914&amp;Itemid=489 Figure 3, page 8: Care in Crisis, Age UK (2012) Community Care Statistics 2012/13, Health and Social Care Information Centre, Figure 3, page 8: Care in Crisis, Age UK (2012) Forder and Fernandez (2012), Analysing the costs and benefits of social care funding arrangements in England: 2nd Edition: PSSRU Discussion Paper 2644/2 http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10171/3624637/NEWS-TEMPLATE http://www.scope.org.uk/sites/default/files/The_Other_Care_Crisis.pdf http://www.scope.org.uk/sites/default/files/Ending_the_other_care_crisis.pdf
