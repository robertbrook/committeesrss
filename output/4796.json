"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon [CST0049]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nCrime Statistics&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter of 6\nth\n December 2013. \n&#xa0;\nMy Police and Crime Plan, which is available on the OPCC website (www-wiltshire.pcc.gov.uk) speaks of priorities, objectives and key initiatives.  I have been consistently reluctant to set targets given the inherent problems they entail.  The target for th\ne number of offenders brought to justice is a prime example.  In order to \nchase\n the target police officers effectively abandoned their discretion in relation to low-level offences.  A generation of younger people was disproportionally criminalised and the \ncriminal justice system creaked under the weight of inappropriate cases.  Similarly, a rigid target to answer non-emergency calls within 30 seconds led inevitably \nto \nover stretched call takers dumping calls on inappropriate extensions where the wrong perso\nn answered or no-one answered the calls at all.\n&#xa0;\nThere does however have to be some method by which I can judge, and the public at election time can judge, whether we are going in the right direction.  I have therefore set what I term thresholds.  These ar\ne the levels across a range of indicators whe\nre\n \nI\n would expect performance to sit.  They are intended to encourage management and \nthe workforce alike to concentrate on\n the right areas and to \ndo \nso diligently.  Both I, and the performance team that advises \nme, are alert to the possibility of counter\n-\nproductive performance monitoring.  Along with the Chief Constable, I believe that we are achieving the right balance.\n&#xa0;\nAs regards the integrity of recorded crime figures, I and my staff have full access to the c\nrime registrar.  We watch crime trends carefully and \nalways consider the possibility\n that a recording practice has varied if we see significant change.  \nI am setting up an independent panel of volunteers to dip sample cases where a re\nsolution outside the c\nriminal justice system has been recorded. It may be possible to extend this to a more general check and test of recording policy. However this can only be an additional safeguard and public reassurance\n. We do, in my view, need a robust inspection framework\n. A portion of my budget is spent on audit and inspection, as you will be aware. Whilst I would not be willing to pay more, I believe the auditing of crime \nrecording practice\n should be a core function of HMIC\n. Their resources should be directed far more cl\nosely on this area, unglamorous though it may be. In years past I recall regular national audits for crime recording. Problems that are surfacing in different parts of the country may have been avoided had this regime not been discontinued.\n&#xa0;\nI hope this is\n of use to you and your members\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
