defaultWritten evidence submitted by  The Salvation Armydefault&#xa0;defaultThe Salvation Army is a Christian Church and charity, which seeks to serve a wide range of clients from a holistic perspective. Through our homelessness and community services, as well as our work with unemployed people, we have a unique breadefaultddefaultth and depth of experience working with individuals and families with a variety of housing issues. This experience suggests that the cumulative effects of the recent reforms to housing cost support are significant for many and very significant for some. Particularly we are concerned that the effects on those at risk of homelessness, as well as those trying to rebuild their lives after a spell of homelessness, have not received sufficient consideration. The lack of clarity surrounding the support that will be available to more vulnerable individuals and families under Universal Credit adds to our concern in this area. We would like to see the Government provide much clearer guidance on how it plans to support those affected by these changes and how this support will be funded. In addition we would like to see the focus shift from interventions after the fact to a stronger emphasis on the prevention of financial hardship, indebtedness, and homelessness.defaultAbout The Salvation Armydefault&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultImplications of the changes for vulnerable groups in general and people with a history of homelessness in particulardefault&#xa0;
default6. 
default 
defaultWhile we appreciate the rationale behind some of the changes to housing cost support, we feel that th
defaulte cumulative effects of the Local Housing Allowance reforms, the 
defaulth
defaultousehold benefit cap, the social sector size criteria and the localisation of council tax support
default, together with the shortage of social housing in many areas, create real threats to the hous
defaulting security of 
defaultvulnerable
default individuals and families. We have seen an anecdotal rise in people coming to us for help with housing issues in our Community Services. We are also seeing the first signs that welfare reforms are playing a contribution role in ca
defaultusing families and individuals to lose their tenancy.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7. 
default 
defaultIn this context we would like to urge the Government to provide clear guidance on the status of those who lose their home as a direct or indirect result of the social sector size crit
defaulteria, the h
defaultou
defaultsehold benefit cap or an inability to 
defaultcope with
default 
defaultone monthly payment including housing cost
default. Particularly will these individuals and household be considered intentionally homeless with the resulting imp
defaultlications 
defaultin terms of 
defaulttheir entitlements
default?
default8. 
default 
defaultWith a specific reference to people with a history of homelessness, we are concerned that the recent reforms will greatly limit the move-on options of our residents. 
defaultMany of our residents come to us with a range of barriers and behaviours that make it diff
defaulticult for them to successfully maintain a tenancy. While we work hard to help them overcome these issues during their time with us, we feel than many would greatly benefit from the security offered by social housing when they are ready to take their first 
defaultstep back into the regular housing system. Already we are finding that many of our residents are not offered social housing 
defaultoption 
defaultwithin a reasonable timeframe
default, forcing them to choose less secure private tenancy options instead
default. We fear that the recent re
defaultforms will worsen this situation.
default&#xa0;
default9. 
default 
defaultWhilst homeless people have previously been a priority group for social housing, the localisation agenda means that eligibility decisions in social housing allocations and service provision are now the remit of local 
defaultgovernment
default. At best this will create a
default postcode lottery
default. At worse it 
defaultcan lead
default to a ‘race to the bottom’, particularly in large cities like London where local authorities 
defaultperhaps rightfully 
defaultfear that 
defaultoffering 
defaulta more favourable regime 
defaultthan others 
defaultmay attract
default people from neighbouring boroughs. As a result, 
defaultlocal authorities 
defaultthat 
defaultdo decide to maintain priority need for people with a history of homelessness
default have an incentive to insist on a strong and verifiable local connection. Many of o
defaultur residents may 
defaulteither 
defaultnot have that connection or 
defaultstruggle to provide proof of 
defaultit
default, particularly 
defaultif they have been sleeping rough.
default&#xa0;
default10. 
default 
defaultThe same problem of lack of documentation can lead to unintended conseq
defaultuences under the reformed Local Housing A
defaultllowance
default.
default 
defaultThe change to Local 
defaultHousing Allowance last year means that most single people under 35 are only eligible for shared accommodation. Whilst those with a history of homelessness are eligible for 
defaultan 
defaultexemption, they are required to provide evidence of hostel stays. However
default,
default as hom
defaulteless people are transient they often carry no paperwork and cannot prove this. In addition, 
defaultwe have anecdotal evidence that 
defaultsome 
defaultLocal Authorities are advising hostels not to provide proof of stay if the resident is in arrears at the time when they leave 
defaultthe service.
default&#xa0;
default11. 
default 
defaultFinally the social sector size criteria in our view do not take into consideration the needs of people with a history of homelessness to a sufficient extent. Of those residents that move on to non-supported accommodation after their stay
default with us, a large share move in with family and friends. If the social sector size criteria have the intended effect, friends and family living in social housing may no longer be able to accommodate former homeless people. Simultaneously down-sizing in res
defaultponse to the new criteria would increase competition for the one-bedroom flats our residents would be entitled to
default, 
defaultbased on their history of homelessness, further decreasing the number of secure move on options available to them
default.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default 
default In order to overcome
default these issues,
default the Salvation Army would like to see 
defaultcontinued priority allocation and 
defaultless stringent rules on local connection for 
defaultpeople with a history of homelessness
default.
default In addition we would like to urge the Government to seriously consider the unintended effects of the social sector size criteria on people with a history of homelessness and other vulnerable young adults and households.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultTreatment of housing cost within defaultUniversal Creditdefault&#xa0;default13.
default 
default 
defaultBoth in community settings and our government-contracted work with unemployed and homeless people we find that many lack the budgeting skills and access to financial products needed to manage their money successfully. For some switch
defaulting from a weekly to a fortnightly payment of benefits is already proving difficult, even if housing costs go directly to the landlord. As a result we worry that, without the proper support, the switch to one monthly payment per household including housing
default costs will drive many individuals and families on low income (further) into debt and dependency.
default&#xa0;
default14. 
default 
defaultThe Salvation Army welcomes 
defaultthe Government’s intention to make 
defaultbudgeting support and 
defaultalternative payment arrangements available to those who need it, bu
defaultt would like to see much clearer guidance on how this system will work in practice. Particularly we would like to receive reassurances that those who fear they will not be able to cope will be offered the appropriate support before they fall into debt. Rep
defaultaying even 
defaultrelatively modest
default debts can be crippling for
default those on low income, particularly if they do not have access to the more affordable forms of credit and need to rely on payday loans or loan sharks. As a result we would like to see a system that is f
defaultocussed on prevention rather than just intervening when a set 
defaultarrears
default threshold has been reached.
default In addition we are concerned about the lack of clarity on how the proposed Local Support Services Frameworks will be organised and funded in practice.
default&#xa0;
default15. Wi
defaultth particular reference to homelessness services, we welcome the decision to continue to pay the housing costs of those in supported exempt accommodation directly to the landlord. 
defaultExempt accommodation status is crucial to residents and homelessness service
default providers alike, as we already have to absorb significant arrears in service payments under the present system. 
defaultHowever, we are concerned about the 
defaultability of our residents to manage one monthly payment 
defaultincluding housing costs 
defaultonce they move on to other 
defaultaccommodation. Again more clarity about the alternative payment arrangements and support that will be available to those with a history of homelessness would be useful here.
default&#xa0;
default16. Overall we support the philosophy behind Universal Credit, but would like to 
defaultsee a clearer acknowledgement that not all will be ready to take on the responsibility of managing a monthly household budget including housing costs from the start. Many will need extensive support in the early days and some may require longer term arrang
defaultements to help them cope.
