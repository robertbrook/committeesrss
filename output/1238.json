"Written evidence from Jean Keyworth (TIC 006)&#xa0;\nI live in a small village called \nHabrough\n in north east \nL\nincs\n.\n \nW\ne have a very limited bus and train service, some days our bus goes through to our nearest town Grimsby but there is no return service so commuters have to return on the next available train or\n walk 2-3 miles from Immingham.\nThis can be very expensive as there are no concessions or not a lot off any train fares.\nOur \ndoctors\n surgery is 3 miles from our village and can cost £5-00 pounds there and back, a lot of money if you\n’re\n on a basic pension or limited means.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n"
