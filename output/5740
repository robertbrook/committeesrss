default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultBriefing Note: defaultSurrey Sussex Collaboration - What we have achieveddefault&#xa0;
defaultOverview
default&#xa0;
defaultSurrey and Sussex Police forces have been working together bi-laterally to collaborate in a number of
default 
defaultoperational and support services since 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo date, a number of Joint Services have gone live 
defaultincluding the Major Crime Team, 
defaultTactical Firearms Unit
default 
defaultand Forensic Investigations (which were initially established under a ‘Joint Command’ Model) and Joint
default 
defaultProcurement Service, Joint Insurance Service and Joint Transport Service under a ‘Lead Force’ Model.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ambition of collaborating in these areas was to deliver better pol
defaulticing services to 
defaultthe public through
default 
defaultincreasing resilience and inter-operability, improving performance, as well as delivering financial savings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe following sections include further details of
default what we did and an overview of 
defaultsome of the benefits
default 
defaultrealised.
default&#xa0;
defaultJoint Command
default&#xa0;
defaultIn June 2011 the Joint Command was established.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe original business case for the collaboration of Major Crime, Firearms and Scientific Support (now
default 
defaultForensic Investigations) under a Joint Command model, identified savings of £3.46m over 4 years and
default 
defaultacross both forces in the agreed ratio of 55:45 (Sussex
default 
default:
default 
defaultSurrey).
defaultThese savings were not only achieved earlier than originally anticipated but also exceeded the target
default 
defaultamount.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther benefits identified in the business case focused around improved performance, interoperability and
default 
defaultresilience.
default&#xa0;
defaultInteroperability from an ICT perspective has been a
defaultchieved with the implementation 
defaultof the ‘Citrix Access
default 
defaultGateway’, allowing both Forces to log onto their respective networks along with a number of joint systems
default 
defaultincluding SOCRATES - a Forensic database, Chronicle for recording Firearms Operations and HOLMES for
default 
defaultrecording of major crimes.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther benefits are cited in the business areas below:
default&#xa0;
defaultTactical Firearms Unit
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Tactical Firearms Unit (TFU) provides a 24/7 armed response capability across Sussex and Surrey. In
default 
defaultaddition to the Armed Response Vehicles for attending spontaneous incidents, the unit is integrated with the
default 
defaultFirearms Training and Protection Unit to ensure that between them there is also capability for pre planned
defaultoperations such as protection for royalty and VIPs.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince collaborating, a large amount of work has been completed in order for TFU to achieve a Joint Training
default 
defaultLicence from the College of Policing including standardisation of equipment, aligned processes and a Joint
default 
defaultIT system to record all operations. As a result, at the start of the financial year 2013/2014, TFU was awarded
default 
defaultan interim Licence following Inspection. Verbal feedback was positive around standards of written
default 
defaultsubmission and training. Furthermore, the College of Policing was so impressed with the high standard of
default 
defaultdesign and management of the training that the Surrey-Sussex model is to be used as the national
default 
defaultbenchmark for the safe and effective delivery of firearms training. Work remains ongoing to meet the
default 
defaultrequirements to secure a full licence.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the benefits realised by collaboration on tactical firearms include:
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultPrior to collaboration it was not possible to have a Sussex and Surrey ARV working together and be
default 
defaultconfident that they would carry out a tactic in the same way. This led to significant risk if they were drawn
default 
defaulttogether for a spontaneous incident. As they now train together it is possible to utilise the two nearest
default 
defaultvehicles for an intervention irrespective of which force they originate from.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThe blending of the two forces’ tactics has resulted in the TFU having the most effective and appropriate
default 
defaulttactics ever used. Vehicle stops are now, in the opinion of officers involved in this arena for up to 15
default 
defaultyears, more ‘fit for purpose’ than at any time previously in either force.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultJoint training has been very successful for the sharing of ideas and building relationships outside of a
default 
defaultsingle force. Officers from different forces now regularly train together.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThere has been a reduction in the overall number of people that need specialist skills therefore reducing
default 
defaultoverall training requirements lowering training cost and reducing abstractions.
default&#xa0;
defaultMajor Crime Team
default&#xa0;
defaultThe collaboration of the Major Crime Teams in Surrey and Sussex saw amongst others changes, the move
default 
defaultto a single shift pattern and a single version of HOLMES system with joint access for the recording of major
default 
defaultcrimes, the alignment of processes and the ability to flex resources across both force areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a result, the Major Crime Team (MCT) now operates as one across two Major Incident Rooms (MIRs)
default 
defaultlocated in Woking and Brighton. Both teams work together in a borderless manner, leading and supporting
default 
defaultinvestigations across both Force areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe MCT is primarily responsible for investigating homicide within Surrey and Sussex. However, the remit of
default 
defaultthe team extends to cover other incidents as detailed below:
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultAll Homicides
default- 
defaultStranger Rapes and Rape series
default- 
defaultDeath following Police contact (in support of the IPCC/Force Professional Standards Departments)
default- 
defaultCorporate Manslaughter
default- 
defaultKidnap and crimes in action
default- 
defaultAny other incident agreed by Chief Officers (e.g. high-profile, politically sensitive etc)
default- 
defaultChild Death incidents
default&#xa0;
defaultThe resilience of the team was tested throughout 2012-2013 with periods of outstanding demand. This is
default 
defaultwhere collaboration and the ability to utilise resources across both forces has proved invaluable. It is
default 
defaulttestament that a review of the collaborative arrangements in December 2012 found implementation to have
default 
defaultbeen successful with high service and confidence levels. As a result, MCT was signed off as a completed
default 
defaultcollaboration project in early 2013 and is now considered business as usual.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBenefits:
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultIt is established practice to deploy officers and staff at all levels from one area to the other in times of
default 
defaulthigh demand. There are numerous examples of Operations in which the South Team assisted the
default 
defaultNorth or vice versa. As mentioned above, there was a period of outstanding demand during a long
default 
defaultrunning operation requiring significant resources. The ability to flex resources meant that MCT could
default 
defaultcontinue to offer a professional and sustained service during this period and maintain the 
defaultcapacity to
default 
defaultdeal with day to day demand which would not have been possible prior to collaboration.
default- 
defaultThe increase in resilience means divisional detectives are now rarely required to bolster MCT
default 
defaultallowing them to focus on divisional priorities.
default- 
defaultThe ability to provide support to a Basic Command Unit (division) when previously it would have to
default 
defaulthave been declined. For example Surrey based MCT staff have assisted West Sussex on an
default 
defaultattempted murder case when Sussex MCT staff were fully committed and vice versa Sussex MCT
default 
defaultstaff have assisted Surrey Investigation strand on a rape investigation when Surrey MCT were fully
default 
defaultcommitted.
default&#xa0;
defaultForensic Investigations
default&#xa0;
defaultForensic Investigation services across Surrey and Sussex underwent a complete restructure both in regards
default 
defaultto staffing structures and how the service is provided.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of the restructuring a number of new combined units were created including:
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThe Forensic Identification Services Unit (FISU) which went live in November 2012 based in Sussex.
default 
defaultThe unit has been at the forefront of developing cutting edge technology to digitally transmit
default 
defaultfingerprint marks from SOCO bases and the Forensic Recovery Unit in real time, enabling
default 
defaultidentifications to be regularly achieved within hours. These 'faster' forensic results help support
default 
defaultinvestigators in detecting crimes in a timelier manner, enabling them to arrest offenders before they
default 
defaultcan reoffend.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThe Forensic Recovery Unit which went live in April 2013 following significant re-development of the
default 
defaultexisting laboratories based at Surrey Headquarters. It is here where staff carry out the scientific
default 
defaultexamination and screening of exhibits recovered from crime scenes; utilising chemical treatments,
default 
defaultpowders, DNA screening techniques, light sources and imaging to develop, enhance and capture
default 
defaultfingerprints and other forensic trace evidence. The unit also attends crime scenes upon request to
default 
defaultprovide specialist advice and guidance to officers to assist the investigation in the use of
default 
defaultforensic/chemical treatments to develop and enhance forensic evidence at the scene.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThe Forensic Hub which went live in June 2013 also based at Surrey Headquarters. The Forensic
default 
defaultHub deals with all forensic submission advice, administration and reporting of results across Surrey
default 
defaultand Sussex and sees a more efficient triage approach to requests for Forensic Investigation
default 
defaultservices.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultForensic Imaging Unit which went live as a colla
defaultborated unit in September 2013. 
defaultThe service which
default 
defaultis delivered from Surrey Headquarters is responsible for handling photographic matters including but
default 
defaultnot limited to the production of photographic exhibits, print service, image enhancing, photo
default 
defaultprocessing and uploading and downloading of images.
default&#xa0;
defaultBenefits
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultISO 17025 Accreditation achieved - All police forces are required under an EU mandate to be
default 
defaultaccredited in forensic DNA screening and forensic enhancement processes and accommodation by
default 
defaultNovember 2013 and April 2015 respectively. 
defaultFailure to comply would have meant that no in-house
default 
defaultactivities could have be carried out resulting in increased and additional spend to external service
default 
defaultsuppliers. In support of the hard work and dedication shown by staff throughout the collaboration and
default 
defaultchange process, in July 2013 the team had a successful assessment by UKAS leading to
default 
defaultaccreditation being awarded in October 2013.
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThe service offered is now fit for purpose, meeting the ever changing needs of the two forces. An
default 
defaultexample of success can be seen in the following quote taken from an email which was received in
default 
defaultrelation to an armed robbery in Surrey in 2012, which was linked to a number of other offences and
default 
defaultfor which a usable mark was found on a demand note:
default&#xa0;
default‘Until we had the fingerprint 
defaultident
default this was going nowhere. The images had been circulated all over
default 
defaultthe place, locally, nationally you name it. We were going to get the CCTV shown on 
defaultCrimewatch
default as a
default 
defaultlast resort but thanks to the fingerprint hit we didn’t need to do that. It was thanks to your good work
default 
defaultand those of the investigating team that this man got a lengthy prison sentence (8.5 years) and 7
default 
defaultbank robberies have been cleared up’
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultLead Force - Support Services
default&#xa0;
defaultIn line with the implementation of business areas under a Joint Command, Surrey and Sussex also agreed
default 
defaultsome additional collaboration opportunities in Support Services as per below:
default&#xa0;
defaultJoint Insurance and Risk
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Joint Insurance Service was the first collaboration between Surrey and Sussex that used a ‘Lead Force’
default 
defaultmodel. This service went live on 1st June 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultLed by Sussex Police, the joint service has the responsibility for the insurance programmes of Surrey and
default 
defaultSussex and provides advice and guidance on all insurance-related matters.
default&#xa0;
defaultJoint Procurement Service
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Joint Procurement Service, led by Surrey Police, went live on 1st September 2012 operating from a
default 
defaultmain site based in Guildford, with a satellite office based in Lewes, East Sussex.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe service consists of two streams - future sour
defaultcing and tendering and contract 
defaultmanagement. Future
default 
defaultsourcing concentrates on tendering high value, high risk contracts, ensuring that the best commercial and
default 
defaultcontractual terms are attained. Tendering and contract focuses on contract management, proactively
default 
defaultdelivering value throughout the term of all contracts held by the two forces. These contracts will include
default 
defaultthose established on a national, regional or force-specific basis.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main financial benefits of the project are not the savings associated with the re-organisation of the
default 
defaultprocurement function - they are the savings that will be realised from the proactive management of the
default 
defaultforces´ contracts. The two forces annually 
defaultspend around £100m on goods, works and services, and there is
default 
defaultconsiderable potential for savings to be made from this expenditure through combining the requirements of
default 
defaultboth forces to benefit from economies of scale and also consolidating the number of suppliers used.
default&#xa0;
defaultA Joint Procurement Service also changed the way that procurement is undertaken across the forces. As a
default 
defaultresult they now use a consultative model, delivering a professional advisory service to the forces offering a
default 
defaultnumber of benefits including earlier interaction and provision of commercial support and market knowledge
default 
defaultrather than just a technical processing function that manages the paperwork.
default&#xa0;
defaultJoint Transport Service
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Joint Transport service went live on 1st October 2013 led by Sussex Police and deals with the provision
default 
defaultand support of Surrey and Sussex fleet. This includes all matters concerned with:
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultfleet costs
default- 
defaultthe evaluation, acquisition and disposal of vehicles
default- 
defaultmaintenance and repair
default- 
defaultlicensing and insurance
default- 
defaulthire contracts
default- 
defaultfuel management including bunkers and pumps
default- 
defaultfleet statistics
default&#xa0;
defaultThe benefits realised by collaborating in these areas are focused a
defaultround improved 
defaultefficiencies, effectiveness
default 
defaultand delivery along with a reduction in pay and costs as a result of streamlining the services. Each unit offers
default 
defaulta professional and consistent service which utilises best practice with expertise shared across the forces
default 
defaultoffering greater resilience and interoperability.
default&#xa0;
defaultSurrey and Sussex are currently building upon these 
defaultexisting collaborations as part 
defaultof a vision to create a
default 
default‘unified organisation’. Whilst as indicated above a number of benefits have been realised, important lessons
default 
defaulthave also been learnt along the way which will help to shape and develop the future services.
