[[[PASC progress against Liaison Committee recommendations]]]

[[[Recommendation]]]

[[[Action already taken by PASC]]]

[[[Further action?]]]

[[[RAG rating]]]The size of departmental committees should not normally be more than 11.Current membership: 11Nothing necessary.

[[[Green]]]Encourage committees to make use of the support of the Scrutiny Unit and to discuss with the National Audit Office how its programme of work might help support the work of the committee.Recent programme of NAO secondees from NAO for programme of work on statistics and for procurement inquiry.  Regular liaison at staff level with NAO about PASC future programme.Support routinely sought from Scrutiny Unit, eg for annual financial scrutiny of the Cabinet Office and for scrutiny of main estimates. Legal advice on general matters (charity law, for example) sought from the Scrutiny Unit legal specialists when necessary.Continue as currently.

[[[Green]]]As a model of ‘best practice’, we recommend that committees:a) have a candid discussion amongst themselves about how they see their purpose, and what they wish to achieve over the length of the Parliament;Committee will be holding an away day on 3 December.Could be discussed by Committee at its away day.

[[[Green]]]b) identify what are the most important functions of their department’s responsibilities and design a programme of scrutiny to assess whether the department’s objectives have been fulfilled;Not done formally.Could be discussed by Committee at its away day.

[[[Green]]]c) clearly record their conclusions and remind themselves of them when considering proposals for inquiry and programme planning;Conclusions clearly recorded in bold in reports; clerks and inquiry managers ensure previous conclusions are considered. In notes for discussion on future inquiries, staff will make sure previous relevant committee conclusions are clearly identified.To continue to look back at previous conclusions when drawing up future programme and conducting inquiries.

[[[Amber]]]d) review this at least annually, with an “away day” or at least a longer, less formal discussion than is possible at a regular deliberative meeting;Committee has agreed to an away day.Hold away day.

[[[Green]]]e) canvass opinion among the key players in their subject area about their performance.At their meeting on 16 October the Committee agreed to seek feedback from witnesses and journalists to inform their away day on 3 December.&#xa0;

[[[Amber]]]We commend to other committees the practice of publishing strategic objectives, and of consulting their department and other stakeholders on them.Objectives published for each inquiry, but overall objectives for PASC’s work not published.&#xa0;Committee to develop strategic objectives at away day.

[[[Amber]]]We recommend that, before they launch an inquiry, committees agree a comprehensive minute setting out what they hope to achieve, and the likelihood of success.Objectives agreed and published for each inquiry. Committee to discuss the merits of having a more comprehensive minute.

[[[Amber]]]We recommend that in future inquiries, as a matter of routine, committees include consideration of the financial aspects and implications of the policies being examined.PASC already does this, and has identified more that it will do in future.Continue to do so, seeking specialist financial input if necessary from Scrutiny Unit.

[[[Green]]]We encourage committees to hold evidence sessions at least annually with ministers and departmental accounting officers, and include within these sessions consideration of how departments evaluate and take decisions on spending, and how they assess the effectiveness of the spending they undertake.PASC already does this. Staff use the advice of the Scrutiny Unit when preparing for these sessions.Continue as currently.

[[[Green]]]We encourage committees to review departments’ Mid-Year Reports when published, using them to identify relevant issues and questions relating to finance and performanceThis will be the first year that the Cabinet Office has published a Mid-Year Report.To keep under review.

[[[Green]]]We recommend that committees experiment with different approaches, such as appointing a rapporteur to lead on a particular inquiry, or choosing “lead questioners” for an evidence session.This happens informally, based on the level of interest of individual members. Committee considered its questioning techniques at training session on effective questioning on 20 June 2013.Committee to discuss if they wish to have formally-agreed rapporteurs or lead questioners.

[[[Amber]]]We recommend that committees make every effort to broaden their range of witnesses, and to take into account the principles of diversity and inclusion in planning their inquiries and committee programme.Committee staff are conscious of diversity issues when drawing up witness plans. Staff recently audited proportion of male / female PASC witnesses: only one in six witnesses were female (17%). Staff will continue to monitor and search for viable alternative witnesses where possible.

[[[Amber]]]Committees should bear in mind the option of commissioning research when planning their long-term strategies, and, if necessary, the House authorities should increase the money available for this purpose.Commissioning research is considered. For example, PASC commissioned polling from YouGov in connection with its work on public engagement in policy making and on national strategy.Continue as currently.

[[[Green]]]We encourage committees to keep their reports short and accessible, and to avoid too many recommendations.Most recent reports  as follows(“recs” includes conclusions as well as recommendations):Truth to Power: 179 paras, 50 recsMigration statistics: 76 paras, 16 recsProcurement: 122 paras, 24 recsEngaging the Public in National Strategy: 8 paras, 3 recs.The Role of the Charity Commission and public benefit: 165 paras,13  recs.Public Engagement in Policy-Making: 64 paras; 12 recs.Communicating Statistics: 44 paras; 10 recs.Public Trust in Government Statistics: 73 paras; 12 recs.Members to be conscious of this issue when discussing draft reports.

[[[Amber]]]A clear indication of which recommendations are most important will help the committee achieve impact and make follow-up easier. We recommend that the usual template for committee reports be changed to distinguish clearly the recommendations targeted at the Government. We suggest that conclusions should be in bold, with recommendations in bold italics, and that it should be clearly stated to whom the recommendation is addressed.PASC reports do format conclusions in bold and recommendations in bold italics with the target of the recommendation clearly stated.PASC reports do not stipulate which recommendations are the most important to PASC.Committee to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of identifying in Committee reports which recommendations are the most important.

[[[Amber]]]We recommend that each committee should appoint a member of staff, or an adviser, or an outside body, who will monitor follow-up to recommendations in respect of each report. The committee should report to the House at least once in each parliamentary Session upon how many of its recommendations the Government has acted, and what follow-up is proposed on outstanding recommendations.Staff keep track on an informal basis.Staff to bring follow up issues to the Committee’s attention.

[[[Amber]]]We recommend that the introductory briefings offered to new committee members be given more formality, and include a meeting with the chair or another experienced committee member.These briefings are now being offered and work has commenced in this area.Continue as currently.

[[[Green]]]We recommend that committees consider the benefits of using professional trainers to help them refresh and develop their questioning skills.Training session held with John Sturrock QC on 20 June 2013 on questioning skills; staff currently investigating whether budget available for a follow-up session. Done.

[[[Green]]]We recommend that chairs discuss with their committee how they see their role, and seek their endorsement for it.Currently not done.Committee to discuss; perhaps at away day?

[[[Amber]]]12 November 2013&#xa0;
