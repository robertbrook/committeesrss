[normal]Written evidence submitted by The Grantham Institute for Climate Change (IPC0032)[bold]The following response has been prepared by Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, CBE FRS, Dr Simon Buckle CMG FIinstP
[normal] and Dr Flora MacTavish, all from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.
[normal]The IPCC assessed 
[normal]several thousand
[normal] peer reviewed scientific papers
[normal], comprising a high proportion 
[normal]of the relevant literature
[normal].
[normal] The work was carried out by 
[normal]more than 200
[normal] highly qualified authors.
[normal] 
[normal]The IPCC review process was open 
[normal]and 
[normal]a
[normal]ny qualified person had the opportunity to comment on the report
[normal]. T
[normal]he IPCC 
[normal]took all 
[normal]comments into account
[normal], 
[normal]documenting how
[normal] each comment was handled. 
[normal]T
[normal]he c
[normal]onclusions 
[normal]of the report 
[normal]build on those of previous assessments
[normal], and the level of certainty has increased in the fundamentals
[normal]. We know that greenhouse gas levels are rising, 
[normal]overwhelmingly due to anthropogenic emissions
[normal]. As
[normal] a result the climate system is warming 
[normal]due to enhanced radiative forcing, a process that is well understood. The
[normal] ocean is acidifying
[normal] due to 
[normal]carbon dioxide (
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal])
[normal] uptake, another process that is well understood
[normal]. As a direct result of warmer temperatures, 
[normal]sea levels are rising
[normal] due to thermal expansion
[normal] of water
[normal] and ice loss
[normal]. These processes will continue as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. 
[normal]As well as the direct effects mentioned above, 
[normal]there are 
[normal]more complex feedback mechanisms
[normal] in the climate syst
[normal]em
[normal]. Feedbacks can be positive (i.e. enhance warming) or negative (reduce warming). There is robust evidence that 
[normal]positive feedbacks
[normal] dominate, meaning that
[normal] future warming can be expected to be 
[normal]greater than
[normal] that given by 
[normal]greenhouse gases 
[normal]alone.
[normal] As greenhouse
[normal] gas levels continue to rise, we will see 
[normal]warmer temperatures and more sea level rise.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here is
[normal] 
[normal]l
[normal]ess robustness in
[normal] the
[normal] details of regional climate change and 
[normal]shorter term 
[normal]changes
[normal], i.e.
[normal] on decadal time-scales.
[normal]The c
[normal]onsensus
[normal] nature of IPCC means that the r
[normal]eport tends to be conservative. 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]its
[normal] sea level projections 
[normal]are based
[normal] on the lower numbers given by bottom-up calculations
[normal] and 
[normal]while l
[normal]arger values cannot be excluded, 
[normal]the IPCC explicitly says that 
[normal]current scientific understanding is insufficient
[normal] 
[normal]for evaluating their probability
[normal]. Also as t
[normal]he model results available
[normal] do not yet include estimates of the uncertain greenhouse gas emissions from melting permafrost, the projections of future warming do not include this enhancement of warming.
[normal]In addition
[normal] to the above, w
[normal]e understand that in responding to 
[normal]government requests 
[normal]during a very short period of discussion, some minor errors
[normal] were made
[normal] 
[normal]in the 
[normal]SPM
[normal], published
[normal] on 27 September 2013.  These have now been corrected.  An explanation and our assessment of t
[normal]he significance of these changes can be found at 
[normal]http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/blog/climate-at-imperial/2013/11/13/updates-to-the-ip
[normal]cc-wg1-summary-for-policy-makers/
[normal] . 
[normal]The
[normal] InterAcademy Council (IAC)
[normal] 
[normal]undertook a review of the processes and procedures of the IPCC. It found 
[normal]in its 2010 report
[normal]  
[normal]that the IPCC process had been successful overall but that the IPCC needed to continue to adapt. It made a
[normal] series of recommendations
[normal] w
[normal]hich,
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]f ado
[normal]pted in their entirety, would fundamentally reform IPCC’s management structure while enhancing its ability to conduct an authoritative assessment.
[normal]  
[normal]The IPCC finalised its decisions in response to the IAC review in May 2011 and the IAC issued a statement sa
[normal]ying that it was “pleased that so many of our report’s 
[normal]recommendations were adopted” and that it hoped its report “will continue to inform management of the IPCC”
[normal]. 
[normal]As recommended by the IAC, the AR5 WG1 team have used a qualitative “level of understanding
[normal]” scale in the SPM and TS as well as quantified measures of uncertainty and statements of fact.  
[normal] 
[normal]Further improvements could be made by ensuring
[normal] that confidence ranges are comparable across different Assessment Reports.  The ranges in AR5 did not always al
[normal]low for simple comparison with the conclusions of AR4 in all cases, e.g. the ranges for the Transient Climate response. 
[normal]Much depends on which conclusions are meant here.  Our understanding o
[normal]f the greenhouse effect is well founded on fundamental physical principles.  The
[normal] global 
[normal]response of the climate system to this forcing is clear in terms of 
[normal]its 
[normal]direction
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he pace and scale
[normal] of this change
[normal] in part depends on future greenhouse gas emissions 
[normal]as well as the reaction of
[normal],
[normal] and interaction
[normal]s
[normal] between
[normal],
[normal] the different parts of the climate system
[normal]. Climate feedbacks
[normal] can act to amplify or moderate the effect greenhouse gas
[normal] forcing
[normal].  The assessed likely range of both the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity and 
[normal]the Transient Climate Response reflects some narrowing down of the uncertainties due to these feedbacks
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or example, an ECS greater than 6°C for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide is now considered very unlikely
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]– a much strong statement than the equivalent in AR4. However, further significant narrowing of these metrics for climate change is likely to b
[normal]e very hard to achieve.  
[normal]Knowledge about key climate feedback mechanisms, such as the effect of clouds, has improved but remains incomplete. Nevertheless there is no evidence of a mechanism that would significantly reduce the intensity of the projected cl
[normal]imate change by 2100.  We have less confidence in projected near-term changes which are likely to remain heavily influenced by internal variability as well as change.  
[normal]In part, this is because the o
[normal]bservation systems needed for monitoring changes in the de
[normal]ep ocean have only become available over the past decade or so. Nor do they yet provide complete coverage throughout the depth and extent of the ocean, which due to its huge thermal inertia is the dominant influence on the pace of climate change.  
[normal]The AR5 WG1 report has reviewed and assessed a 
[normal]very large
[normal] number of scientific papers
[normal]. There was
[normal] an open review system
[normal] and all comments were taken into account
[normal].  We judge that
[normal] the report
[normal] is representative of the range of views among climate scientists, though there are likely to be 
[normal]individual scientists 
[normal]who would reach different judgements on aspects of the report. 
[normal]Arguably, the conclusions of the AR5 WG1 report are conservative in terms
[normal] of several potential mechanisms that could give rise to more significant changes 
[normal]than current models
[normal] project.
[normal] 
[normal]Future 
[normal]release of methane from melting permafrost was 
[normal]not considered
[normal],
[normal] and estimates of sea level rise were 
[normal]perhaps
[normal] conservative. 
[normal]The models thems
[normal]elves have been developed in the context of the current climate system; they may be inadequate guides to potentially non-linear changes in the climate should we continue to force the system to the extent that seems likely without strong mitigation action. 
[normal] All this argues for more, rather than less, caution in terms of the potential severity and impacts of future climate change. 
[normal]Our understanding of
[normal] the greenhouse effect is extremely well founded on fundamental physical principles.  The response of the climate system to this human forcing is also very clear from many observations of different aspects of the climate system.  There 
[normal]is in our view 
[normal]no re
[normal]al question that the climate is changing, and that a significant part of these chan
[normal]ges is due to human greenhouse 
[normal]gas 
[normal]emissions
[normal].  The clear conclusion is that humans are conducting a dangerous experiment with the Earth’s climate. 
[normal]Of course, it is hard to say that anything is 
[normal]ever 
[normal]completely “settled” in science
[normal]. However,
[normal] there is 
[normal]now 
[normal]very firm evidence 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]greenhouse gas levels are increasing
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]radiative forcing is increasing;
[normal] 
[normal]atmospheric, oceanic and surface air 
[normal]temperature
[normal]s
[normal] are
[normal] r
[normal]ising
[normal];
[normal] sea level is rising
[normal];
[normal] and ice 
[normal]s
[normal]heets and glaciers are losing mass globally
[normal].
[normal] In addition, t
[normal]here is 
[normal]now 
[normal]strong evidence that 
[normal]Green
[normal]land and W
[normal]est
[normal] Antarctic ice sheet 
[normal]reductions 
[normal]are 
[normal]contributing
[normal] significantly
[normal] to s
[normal]ea level rise.
[normal] Recent observations suggest that they are now nearly as 
[normal]important
[normal] as thermal expansion as a cause of sea level rise.
[normal] 
[normal]On the other hand, r
[normal]egional climate change and decadal variations depend on science that is still relatively young an
[normal]d
[normal] in need of signific
[normal]ant development.
[normal]There is a clear need for scaled up efforts to measure and monitor the climate system so that we can improve our understanding still further of the climate system response
[normal] to human emissions.  
[normal]Both satellite and in
[normal] 
[normal]situ 
[normal]measurements
[normal] are needed, particularly in the ocean. 
[normal]Furthermore the unique information contained in 
[normal]the measured 
[normal]spectra 
[normal]of solar and outgoing infrared radiation could 
[normal]be used to understand which climate com
[normal]ponents are
[normal] 
[normal]the cause of the changes observed and thus provide a 
[normal]more 
[normal]stringent
[normal] 
[normal]test of the climate models used to predict 
[normal]better 
[normal]how our climate will
[normal] 
[normal]evolve.
[normal] Further work is needed to improve our understanding of clouds and aerosols.
[normal] There also needs to b
[normal]e more work to improve our understanding of 
[normal]how 
[normal]the atmospheric circu
[normal]lation and 
[normal]regional 
[normal]weather systems
[normal] may change as the climate warms
[normal].
[normal]In a scientific context, uncertainty is the correct concept.  In terms of making decisions, either in politics or business, the concept of risk is potentially far more useful.  
[normal]In informing policy and the public, scientists working in this area should be a
[normal]s objective as they possibly can about the level of risk where there is uncertainty or less than full understanding. 
[normal]Risks to human society and the biosphere are expected to be covered in t
[normal]he IPCC Working Group II Report
[normal].
[normal]The IPCC AR5 WG1 dedicates one whole chapter of its report (Chapter 9) to the evaluation of climate models.  
[normal]The summary to this chapter gives a fair assessment of the improvements made by climate modellers since the last Assessment r
[normal]eport (AR4) as well as the remaining challenges.  For example, t
[normal]he AR5 
[normal]WG1 TS 
[normal]suggests that some models may be too responsive to the effects of greenhouse gases.  
[normal]We do not yet 
[normal]fully and quantitatively understand the mechanisms responsible for the recent s
[normal]lowdown in surface warming
[normal] (see our answer to Q9 for further comment)
[normal]. 
[normal]We agree however, with the key conclusion of the authors of Chapter 9 that
[normal],
[normal] “
[normal]Climate and Earth System models are based on physical principles, and they reproduce many important aspects
[normal] of observed climate. Both aspects contribute to our confidence in the models’ suitability for their application in detection and attribution studies (Chapter 10) and for quantitative future predictions and projections.
[normal]”
[normal]This does not imply bind acceptance
[normal] of the results from the current models: continual questioning of the results and improvements in the models is crucial.
[normal]The reduction in
[normal] global surface temperature rise since 1998 is the topic for a good scientific discussion in AR5 in terms of the forcing of the climate system and its natural variability.  In the period, the
[normal] 
[normal]energy imbalance of the atmosphere due to the high level of gree
[normal]nhouse gases has been somewhat 
[normal]reduced 
[normal]due to t
[normal]he solar minimum and some 
[normal]minor volcanic eruptions.
[normal] 
[normal]The fact that more than 90 percent of the additional net energy entering the climate system is stored in the ocean and only a few percent directly warms the 
[normal]atmosphere is discussed, and the AR5 gives evidence that the sub-surface ocean has continued to warm
[normal]. Since the cut-off date for the publishing of articles assessed by 
[normal]the IPCC
[normal], more evidence has become available 
[normal]for
[normal] the continued warming of the 
[normal]deeper
[normal] oce
[normal]an and the likely storage of the excess heat there
[normal], and that this is probably the dominant cause of the reduction in global temperature rise in the past 15 years
[normal].
[normal]The empirical and theoretical evidence for climate change 
[normal]due to human activity 
[normal]is extremely 
[normal]strong, with multiple independent lines of evidence.
[normal] Given the 
[normal]changes observed in other components of the climate system, notably the continued increase in heat stored in the deeper parts of the ocean, the slowdown in the rate of increase in the average g
[normal]lobal mean surface temperature in the recent period should not be interpreted as evidence that we do not need to be concerned about the risks of climate change. 
[normal]Weather-related events already impose significant costs on
[normal] society, despite a high degree of adaptation to the current climate.  Particular modes of climate variability, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), may be associated with distinct and sometimes damaging patterns of weather.  The seasonal monso
[normal]ons on which many people depend for their livelihoods can also cause significant damage and loss of life.  The 
[normal]frequency
[normal] of at least some weather related hazards is likely to change
[normal] 
[normal]significan
[normal]t
[normal]ly
[normal], though the 
[normal]natural variability of climate is
[normal] likely to rema
[normal]in important in some regions into the second half of the century
[normal].  
[normal]Increasing sea-levels will pose significant risks for low-lying coastal cities, e.g. from increased risks of flooding due to storm surges. 
[normal]Over the six years between AR4 and AR5, the core 
[normal]science has become
[normal] even firmer. The risk posed by continued
[normal] greenhouse gas
[normal] emissions is just as large as 
[normal]at the time of the previous report
[normal]. The AR5 for the first time makes it clear that there is a specific, limited amount of CO
[normal]2
[normal] that can be emitted if 
[normal]th
[normal]e 2
[normal]°
[normal]C limit is not to be exceeded
[normal] with a given probability
[normal]. This 
[normal]makes effective action to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions – at national and international levels - 
[normal]even more 
[normal]urgent
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]WG1 is strictly an assessment of the 
[normal]curre
[normal]nt state of the 
[normal]physical science
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]with respect to climate change. Furthermore, it 
[normal]seeks to make sure that the 
[normal]“
[normal]range of scientific views, as represented in the peer-reviewed literature, is considered and evaluated in the assessment, and that the state of t
[normal]he science is conc
[normal]isely and accurately presented”. 
[normal]It has done a credible job in the chapters and T
[normal]echnical 
[normal]S
[normal]ummary
[normal].  
[normal]The 
[normal]“Summary for Policy Makers”
[normal] (SPM)
[normal] has to be agreed by government representatives.  The diversity of government interests amongst the p
[normal]articipating nations suggests that it would be extremely difficult to push a political agenda or to include 
[normal]policy-relevant 
[normal]statements that were not fully supported by the evidence.  
[normal]There might however be pressure to make statements in a form that presen
[normal]ts a finding in a particular context. For example, in SPA Section A, the SPM says that “
[normal]Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface
[normal]”.  Yet this emphasis on decadal temperature changes is, we believe, ill-advised.  In 
[normal]the context of climate change, 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]short-term 
[normal]indices of the state of the climate system 
[normal]have little relevance.  It is quite conceivable for there to be a future decade in which the Earth’s surface temperature cools
[normal] even with continued climate chang
[normal]e. 
[normal]T
[normal]he UK 2050 
[normal]greenhouse gas
[normal] 
[normal]emissions 
[normal]target 
[normal]was based on calculated temperatures increases associated with a range of global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories
[normal]. They showed that to satisfy the two criteria of a 50:50 chance of staying near 2
[normal]°
[normal]C and a 
[normal]negligible chance of reaching 4
[normal]°
[normal]C it was necessary to at least halve global emissions from a 1990 level by 2050. The results and projections in the AR5 
[normal]give strong support for the idea
[normal] that halving global emissions by 2050 is indeed necessary for satisfact
[normal]ion of the two climate change criteria. The carbon budget perspective in AR5 shows the constraint on the total 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]emissions in the 21st century if such targets are to be achieved. Emissions reductions early in the century may lessen the necessity for stri
[normal]ngent (and perhaps impossible) actions such as negative total emissions later in the century. Consistent with this the UK should aim to perform as much reduction as it can well before 2050. The Fourth Carbon Budget in the UK, which was derived on the basis
[normal] of a least cost path to the UK 2050 target, is therefore even more important. The global carbon budget view 
[normal]might even
[normal] 
[normal]suggest that 
[normal]the UK target 
[normal]should even be tightened if 
[normal]th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]were possible.
