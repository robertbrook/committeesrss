[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Sky welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry on Women and Sport. As the Committee highlights there are a number of factors that influence levels of participation in women’s sport ranging from awareness to access. For the purposes of this response we have limited our comments to our areas of experience.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; As a subscription&#xa0;broadcaster in over 11 million UK homes we understand the importance&#xa0;of&#xa0;providing a service that caters for&#xa0;all our customers’ interests. In&#xa0;depth and comprehensive&#xa0;coverage of all sport&#xa0;has been a key part of that&#xa0;offering for over 20 years and&#xa0;women’s&#xa0;sport is an integral part of our sports&#xa0;offering.&#xa0;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; We also understand that coverage of female sporting events has a valuable role to play in raising awareness and framing perceptions of women in sport. Sky’s 6 Sports and Sports News channels are watched by 6 million women per month and provide an effective platform for women’s sport, creating opportunities to showcase sports and reach new fans and participants. We also believe that we can inspire engagement by women by showing all sport (men’s, women’s and mixed) in exciting and relevant formats that are inclusive and appealing to all. This includes having women presenters, reporters and athletes telling the story, reinforcing the perception of sport as a mainstream interest for women as well as men. &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; The ability of sports bodies to invest in their sport and opportunities for women to access sport, both at elite and grass-root level also a play role in influencing levels of female participation. Sky has been one of the leading investors in sport for over two decades not only through the investment we make in acquiring rights and airtime every year but through promotion and partnership with sports governing bodies, as well as the creation of our own initiatives to encourage participation and support athletes. &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; To that end our approach to women and sport encompasses not just showing women’s sport but showing all sport in a universally appealing way, as well as supporting women in sport, investing in the future of women’s sport and encouraging more women and girls to get involved.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Television provides a powerful means of showcasing and stimulating interest in sport. Beyond coverage of the sport itself, sports programming is able to provide a wealth of in-depth analysis and commentary that draws the viewer in and grows their understanding and connection with a sport. This in turn can become a catalyst for participation, inspiring ambitions to emulate sporting heroes or simply encouraging joining in for fun. &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0; As part of our wide-ranging sports offering Sky Sports shows an extensive amount and variety of women’s sports programming, consisting of a rich mixture of live sport, highlights, support shows and news.  As part of our schedule we show women’s sport every month, so far this year that has included coverage across more than 200 days. This airtime provides a valuable showcase for a wide variety of women’s sport  and has included:&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0; This is in addition to the news and results reports we carry on a regular basis. As Europe’s leading 24 hour sports news service, Sky Sports News will as a matter of course carry results of women’s matches. Where editorially appropriate the Sky News team also cover news stories around women’s sport and sportspeople. For example, following on from their victory in the Ashes, Sky Sports News interviewed members of the team on set about how their success can be built on at a grass roots level. Similarly in the last year Sky Sports News’ half hour documentary series, Special Report, has included profiles of Caroline Wozniacki, Petra Kvitova, Katie Taylor, Chemmy Alcott, Jess Ennis-Hill, Perri Shakes-Drayton, Christine Ohuruogu, Equality Games, Paula Radcliffe and the marathon. &#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;   As part of International Women’s Day Sky Sports News also committed to a week of coverage on women’s sport. Programming included a live debate with Judy Murray and Laura Trott, an extensive number of interviews with sportswomen including Gail Emms and Karen Brown as well as the Chair of the Youth Sport Trust, Baroness Sue Campbell. Sky Sports News will also shortly be launching Sportswomen, a new weekly half hour magazine programme dedicated to coverage of women in the sporting arena. It will provide a round-up of the latest news and results, explore key sporting issues from a female perspective and include inspirational sporting women as studio guests. The first show will feature former England football manager, Hope Powell and as part of ‘My Life in Sport’, a regular feature profiling women working in sport,  viewers will be able to go behind the scenes with the England netball team as they prepare for their International Test Series against South Africa.&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0; However, whilst it is important that women’s sport is appropriately represented in programming, sports coverage does not have exclusively to involve women to engage and inspire them. We know this because our female viewers also enjoy coverage of men’s sports, for example the Manchester United v Chelsea Premier League match on 26th August saw an average audience of roughly 2.6m of which 800,000 were female. [BARB/Techedge (Based on Match audience)]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Having female presenters and sportswomen as part of the team telling the story is an important aspect in making all sport relevant and more engaging to female viewers. Seeing knowledgeable women presenting and commenting on all types of sport sends a positive message that sport is very much a mainstream interest and pursuit for women.  As a broadcaster, it also makes sense to use the best talent able to talk expertly and passionately about sport.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Female reporters, presenters and production staff have been key members of the Sky Sports team for over 20 years. Reporters and presenters such as Vicky Gomersall, Natalie Sawyer, Alex Hammond, Anna Woolhouse and Orla Chennaoui cover a range of female and male sports and provide in-depth knowledge and expertise. For example Orla Chennaoui presented our male and female Olympics coverage last year and will be heading up our coverage of the men’s and women’s cycling World Road Racing Championships later this month.  This approach is also reflected on Sky Sports where Natalie Pinkham is a central member of the F1 team, whilst Sarah-Jane Mee appears on Cricket AM, Saturday Night Football and Sky News, and Hayley McQueen is part of the Champions League team.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;  Women also occupy several senior production roles at Sky Sports News. For example, Karen Willmington, is head of studio output and has been studio director for Soccer Saturday for more than 15 years, Melissa Bartlett, is a Senior Director, and Helen Kemp, is the Resources and Facilities Manager, in charge of camera crews, satellite trucks and regional bureaus.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Sky Sports coverage also includes contributions from female experts, on both women and men’s sports, for example women rugby players are frequently invited to discuss women’s rugby matches and Maggie Alphonsie has been a guest on The Rugby Club discussing the Game.  Charlotte Edwards also recently appeared as a guest expert with David Gower during the third men’s Ashes Test in August 2013.  &#xa0;&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Sports bodies’ ability to foster talent, develop training infrastructure, provide opportunities to participate and promote themselves is also essential to attracting more women into sport. We believe that partnerships between broadcasters and sporting bodies provide the opportunity for a much deeper supportive relationship affording not just the opportunity to grow sports using funding derived from sports rights, but working together to promote a sport.  Whilst it is up to the governing bodies how they invest in their sports we believe that our commitment and support has resulted in real benefits for both women’s and men’s sport.  &#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0; For example our support for women’s cricket spans 16 years and encompasses more coverage than any other broadcaster. The quality and volume of coverage has given the sport a platform that had not previously existed, bringing it to the attention of the next generation of female cricketers. Our commitment to the sport means more than just broadcasting the live sport. We also spend time and effort working to promote it, for example in the build-up to the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, Sky held a media day for the women’s team which resulted in a large amount of news coverage in both the front and back pages of the national press.  &#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Sky’s commitment also encompasses support through partnership. In October 2006, Sky Sports and the ECB teamed up to launch the Sky Sports ECB Coach Education Programme, a scheme building on the successes of the ECB’s previous coaching initiatives and designed to equip coaches with the necessary skills to deliver high quality coaching programmes at all levels of the game. Since the scheme began over 50,000 coaching certificates have been awarded and a large number of these have been awarded to female coaches, helping to create and inspire younger generations of female cricketers and coaches to take up the game.&#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, our partnership with British Cycling supports female as well as male elite cyclists and we are immensely proud of the exceptional progress made by the Great Britain team and particularly the elite female riders, who since 2008 have won 10 medals across two Olympic Games, inspiring women across the UK to ride their bikes. We also work closely with women’s golf and so far this year we have worked with a number of women golfers to build their profile and promote major tournaments such as the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the Solheim Cup and the Evian Championships, providing greater exposure to the game.  &#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0; More directly, our Sky Sports Scholarships scheme helps young athletes realise their potential in competition and beyond. It offers assistance through financial support, media training and mentoring in order to help with the day to day realities of life as a professional athlete and will hopefully create sporting role models of the future.  In August 2013 we announced the latest 12 scholarships which included 7 female athletes encompassing a diverse range of women’s sports and backgrounds including Savannah Marshall, a boxer from Hartlepool, Holly Bleasdale, a pole vaulter from Preston and Elise Christie, a short-course ice-skater from Livingston.&#xa0;4.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Sky Sports has also announced its commitment to the celebration of women in sport through our sponsorship of the Sunday Times Sportswomen of the Year Awards. The awards showcase the outstanding contributions to sport made by female athletes, coaches, administrators and community volunteers. Over the next few months Sky will be highlighting their achievements as well as hosting and broadcasting the awards ceremony in December.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Our position as a broadcaster enables us to inspire our customers to get involved in sport. While we do support some initiatives specifically focused on women, our primary focus is gender neutral as we believe that exciting and appealing opportunities to participate or be inspirational mentors have universal appeal and can be effective in encouraging more women and girls to participate in sport. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0; For example, Sky Sports Living for Sport is a free UK secondary schools initiative that uses life-changing stories and expertise of athlete mentors to motivate and inspire young people. 37 of the 74 mentors in the scheme are women, with sportswomen such as Jess Ennis-Hill and Katie Taylor representing strong female role models.  Nevertheless, we are also conscious that all the inspirational sportspeople we work with have the ability to encourage girls to take up sport, David Beckham being a case in point. &#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Our partnership with British Cycling began in 2008 and included an ambition to inspire one million people to cycle more regularly. This objective was achieved in October 2012 of which 345,000 women have been inspired to cycle. &#xa0;Through Sky Ride, our grassroots programme, we are creating routes and rides to attract more families into cycling through free mass participation cycling events and weekend rides. Our high profile Sky Ride ambassadors like Lorraine Kelly and Edith Bowman have helped us raise awareness of the benefits for cycling for fun, fitness and health. &#xa0;Plus our support and promotion of the British Cycling stars like Laura Trott and Shanaze Reade has provided a catalyst for growth in cycling participation with 40% more women commuting since 2008 and over 35% of the young people on our Go Ride Club partnership being girls. &#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0; We are proud to support Breeze, which is British Cycling’s volunteer-organised, led-ride programme that addresses the key barriers women face when considering cycling. Over 16,000 women have joined this network, reaching 200 local authorities across England. We will continue to support British Cycling with their ambition to inspire one million more women to ride by 2020, improving cycling for women at every level, whether as a sport or recreational activity.&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Sky also carries programming which is aimed at encouraging women and girls’ grassroots participation in sport. Two noteworthy examples include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
