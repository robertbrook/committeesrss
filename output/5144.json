"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Philip Morris Limited [TOB12]\nExecutive summary and Declaration of Interest1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPhilip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) is the\n&#xa0;\nleading international tobacco company.  \nIts\n products\n which include the \nworld’s number one cigarette brand Marlboro\n \nare\n sold in\n&#xa0;\nmore \nthan 180 countries.  PMI operates in the UK and Ireland through its subsidiary Philip Morris Lim\nited (“PML”)\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\nighting the illicit trade in tobacco is a top priority for PML.  \nWe invest significant resources in combating the illicit trade, and cooperate with government and law enforcement at every level, both in the UK and internationally.  \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough the UK’s legal framework provides adequate penalties for tobacco smuggling, deterrence is weakened by the difficulty of detection, and relatively \nlow tariffs linked to current sentencing guidelines.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSmuggling\n and the illicit\n \ntrade \ntakes different forms\n:\n&#xa0;\nCigarettes bearing trademarks that \nare\n manufactured without the \ntrademark owner\n’s\n permission.\nCigarettes that enter or are sold in a market in violation of fiscal/custom\ns\n laws.\nCigarettes that are produced in one market and primarily smuggled into and sold in another where they have no legal distribution.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt \nrange\ns\n \nfrom small scale smuggling (often involving criminals gangs), colloquially known as ‘ant smuggling’, to large container shipments involving organised crime.  Both the UK and Ireland face similar problems shaped by common drivers of supply and demand.  Irish ports are seen as a ‘back door’ to the UK and the illicit trade is frequently linked to paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.  \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe UK and Irish illicit markets are\n \nintricately linked\n.  \nAs\n plain packaging\n \ninevitably increases the ease of supply of illicit tobacco, the prospect of Ireland introducing this policy will inevitably impact the UK. \n&#xa0;\nRecommendations\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK should continue to invest in combating the illicit trade, with dedicated funding to help facilitate co-ordination across law enforcement agencies. &#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLaw enforcement needs a co-ordinated multi-agency approach to deterring small scale smuggling.  This includes greater focus on preventing illicit tobacco entering the UK, more effort to disrupt inland distribution networks, and heavier penalties\n, including aggressive pursuit of asset forfeiture opportunities,\n when offenders are identified.\n  More generally the Government should consider whether current penalties provide significant deterrence.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government should prioritise tackling the problem of factories in overseas free trade zones where local oversight is lax.  \nThese are frequently located in\n jurisdictions with which the UK and EU enjoy\n close ties, but provide a key source for \norganised crime\n groups\n \nincluding\n paramilitaries. \n Political engagement by senior levels of government and efforts to leverage EU influence \nwould complement the successes of HMRC’s overseas network of Fiscal Crime Liaison Officers. \n&#xa0;10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK must prepare a strategy to adapt to changes in the illicit trade arising from the Irish Government’s proposed introduction of plain packaging.  \nThis would include even closer cooperation between UK and Irish law enforcement agencies.  \nThe illicit markets of both countries are closely related, and since plain packaging is highly likely to increase the supply of illicit tobacco into Ireland, the policy will inevitably impact the UK (in the same way that its introduction in Scotland would impact England and Wales).  \n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, the UK should limit further tax increases to inflation, and avoid any sudden or excessive rises.  The UK (with Ireland) has the highest tobacco taxes in the EU.  Consumers’ resistance to ever higher taxes and their willingness to switch to easily available alternatives that are unlicensed, unregulated and untaxed lie at the heart of this problem.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPMI \nhas a global \nIllicit Trade Strategies &amp; Prevention team dedicated to fighting illicit trade with several initiatives:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nScale of the illicit tobacco problem\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIllegal cigarettes are a global problem that requires global action.  \nWhile much of the UK’s contraband originates from within the EU, counterfeit and illicit whites are often sourced from a \nrange of countries, including some within the EU, China, the Russian Federation, Belarus, the UAE and Ukraine.  Free trade zones in e.g., Singapore and Dubai also pose particular issues.\n \n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \n2012 KPMG \nStar Report estimated that \nthe \nillicit market \nrepresented\n 16.4% in the UK \n(\nand \nthe\n UK also experienced the largest annual\n increase \nin\n the EU)\n.\n  \nOLAF estimates that illicit tobacco costs the EU €10 billion a year in lost revenue,\n while HMRC estimates the UK loss at nearly £2\n \nbillion.\n  \nThe full cost is likely to be even higher than this due to broader consequences, notably:\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe illicit trade has changed rapidly in recent years, as acknowledged by a recent National Audit Office report\n.\n \nC\nross-border smuggling of UK tobacco brands and to a lesser extent counterfeit have \ndecreased\n relative to\n \nillicit whites\n which\n have risen rapidly\n. In 2012 the UK consumed an estimated 1 billion illicit white cigarettes, a 49% increase on 2011.\n  \n&#xa0;\nCo-operation with governments\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPMI assists law enforcement at every level, from \nthe \nlocal to international.  Globally, INTERPOL\n, with its presence across\n \n190 countries is ideally placed to lead this effort.  In 2012 \nPMI pledged €15m to INTERPOL’s global initiative against illicit goods trafficking, ‘\nFund for a Safer World’\n.\n  This programme seeks to\n dismantle the organi\ns\ned crime networks \nthat \ntraffic a range\n of illicit goods \nand\n \nidentify the routes \nthey use (which are often \nalso \nused by \nhuman traffickers and drug smugglers\n).\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPMI works closely with European authorities.  PMI signed a\n Cooperation agreement with the European Commission in 2004, to which the UK, Ireland and \nall other Member States are also party.\n  \nThe agreement established regular exchanges of\n information between PMI, OLAF\n and the Member States regarding seizures of counterfeit and genuine cigarettes.  \nThis information \nunderpins\n Project Star, an annual EU wide study of tobacco consumption that PMI commissions from KPMG\n.\n \nThe results\n \nare\n presented to both OLAF and representatives of all \nEU\n Member States\n and \nallows PMI and law enforcement to identify \nEU\n wide trends more quickly. \nThe \nCooperation\n agreement also established\n a range of supply chain control measures \nincluding enhanced ‘Know Your Customer’ checks, sales volume monitoring, and tracking and tracing obligations\n.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the UK PM\nL\n participates with the rest of the industry and HMRC in an anti-illicit trade working group,\n \nand also invests significant resources in commissioning research and gathering intelligence on the nature and extent of the illicit trade\n.  PMI, along with other industry players, is party to an Intelligence Sharing Protocol with HMRC (with extensive intelligence sharing with HMRC’s FCLO network) and further work is continuing on finalising a broader MOU between HMRC and industry participants.\n&#xa0;\nCurrent sanctions and penalties 19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scale of tobacco smuggling,\n the difficulty of detecting it, the involvement of organised crime\n, and the wider costs to society make it \nessential that there is adequate\n deterrence.  \n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDetecting tobacco smuggling is\n often \ndifficult as a significant proportion is imported \ninto the UK \nby \nsmall scale\n smugglers\n, a\n \nmethod\n \nincreasingly \nused\n \nby \norganised criminals \nwith\n networks of ‘mules’\n.  \nThis is especially true of the \nEast European variants (both counterfeit and contraband)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe penalty for smuggling tobacco into the UK carries a maximum sentence of seven years\n.\n Additionally, counterfeiters face sentences of up to ten years for improper use of trademarks,\n and \nany criminal proceeds\n can be recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act \n2002.   \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, tobacco smugglers rarely face the maximum penalty, and Trading Standards have recommended that the Sentencing Guidelines issued to the courts be reviewed.\n  Since 2010/11 approximately 43.5% of sentences in \nEngland and Wales \nwere non-custodial or suspended sentences, and in Northern Ireland \nthis figure\n was much higher.\n  \nIndeed\n, a \nrecent Court of Appeal \njudgment handed \ndown\n in relation to excise evasion on tobacco backed the need for stronger sentencing.\n \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther inhibiting effective deterrence is the different approach to enforcement across the country.  One success story has been in Liverpool, where t\nhe city’s Trading Standards’ Alcohol and Tobacco Unit was set up in 2008.  Funded \nuntil\n 2015 by a further injection of £400,000, it has five full time staff and \nalways prosecutes for illicit tobacco seizures, even for \ncases involving as few as\n 200 cigarettes.  This stance has seen a significant drop in seizures and positive test purchase operations from a peak in 2008-2009 when first formed.  However, this level of commitment is \nexceptional\n.\n&#xa0;Similarities and differences in tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland 24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe illicit trades in the UK and Ireland share many characteristics and are closely connected.  \nThe \n2012 KPMG \nStar Report estimated that \nthe \nillicit market \nrepresented\n 16.4% in the UK \n(the highest annual increase throughout the EU) \nand 19.1% in Ireland.\n  \nIt\n is \ncaused by several factors including high profits for relatively low risk, well organised criminal networks, t\nhe relatively high \nprice\n of tobacco (the UK and Ireland have the highest tobacco taxes in the EU), and increasing price sensitivity \namong consumers hit by\n economic \nhardship\n (which has led to a wider pattern of down trading to \nlegal \ncheaper tobacco products).\n&#xa0;\n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn both countries test purchasing indicates that illicit tobacco is readily available through a variety of channels, including\n market stalls, pubs, retail outlets\n \nas well as door–to–door sales, private houses, and via online ads.\n  \n&#xa0;\nSmall scale \nsmuggling\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK and Ireland are both vulnerable to \nsmall scale\n smuggling, facilitated by \ncheap and direct transport connections\n to\n \neastern EU Member States\n \nwith \nlow\ner prices\n, large \ndiaspora \ncommunities\n, and \nassociated\n retail outlets that \noften \nact as distribution network\ns\n.  \n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the most popular means of \nsmall scale\n smuggling into the UK is \nvia large van and minibus operators that make daily trips from the main Baltic cities to the UK. \n \nSmugglers are able to \nload \nunaccompanied suitcases filled with contraband \nfor a small fee.  These are\n dropped off at pre-arranged meeting points in the UK.\n  \n&#xa0;\nLarger scale smuggling\n28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the other end of the spectrum \ncriminals\n with sophisticated clandestine networks for importing and distributing illicit goods are attracted to smuggling tobacco by the relatively low penalties and chances of detection.  \n&#xa0;\n29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOrganised criminals are heavily implicated in the UK\n and Irish\n trade\ns\n.\n  A recent annual survey of Trading Standards’ experience of IP crime has shown the strong link between illicit tobacco and organised crime.\n \n  Similarly during \nrecent\n test purchasing fieldwork\n commissioned by PML\n, Trading Standards regularly pointed to the relationship between drugs trafficking and illicit tobacco\n.\n Indeed, \nDeputy \nGovernment Chief Whip\n Lord \nNewby recently stated in the House of Lords:\n&#xa0;\n“\nT\nhe people who smuggle cigarettes do, indeed, tend to smuggle other things, typically drugs, and sometimes even more dangerous things than that. \n \nI do not have an exact breakdown, but a lot of this smuggling is carried out on a large scale by criminal\n \ngangs who are looking to smuggle anything they can with a high value, of which cigarettes typically are only one component.”\n&#xa0;\nThe relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity30.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorthern Ireland is responsible for \na disproportionate share of the UK gangs involved in tobacco fraud,\n partly due to t\nhe activities of paramilitary groups.  \nOne hallmark of their involvement is the prevalence of illicit whites, which tend to be imported in bulk and afford larger profits.  These accounted for 78% of the illicit tobacco acquired during recent test purchases, an exceptionally high figure.\n  \n&#xa0;\n31.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of paramilitary groups has been well documented.  \nIn 2012 the PSNI and Garda warned that tobacco smuggling was generating significant sums of money for the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.\n \n It\n helps fund \ncriminal activity spanning drugs, firearms, human trafficking and bomb attacks.  \n&#xa0;\n32.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTobacco products from the Far East are often smuggled into Northern Ireland and the UK \nafter being landed at ports in Ireland.  These have been described as a ‘back door’ to the UK\n,\n \nmaking \nIreland a \n“\nhuge target\n” according to t\nhe head of Irish Customs’ criminal investigations branch.\n \n&#xa0;\n33.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn recognition of this dynamic, l\naw enforcement from both countries work closely together.   The \nCross Border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group (CBTFEG)\n was \nestablished in May 2010 to combat cigarette smuggling within the island of Ireland.  It aims to identify \nand disrupt\n key \ncriminal gangs\n involved in cigarettes smuggling on both\n sides of \nthe Irish land border.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe possible impact of standardised (or plain) packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK34.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlain packaging risks fuelling the illicit tobacco trade, as 24 former senior police officers in the UK have warned.\n  Given that large scale smugglers view the UK and Ireland as a single market,\n any increase in the supply of illicit tobacco to Ireland will inevitably flow through to the British mainland. \n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlain packaging \nfuels\n the illicit trade in three ways.\n  First, demand for \nbranded \ncontraband will increase. \n \nIntroducing plain packaging will not erase branded tobacco, it will just hand a monopoly to criminals who already provide a cheaper product.\n&#xa0;\n36.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecond, it will facilitate counterfeiting, as \nmultiple \nexperts have warned.\n  Economies of scale make it cheaper for counterfeiters to imitate a single plain packet design than multiple different brands.  \n&#xa0;\n37.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThird, by removing branding, \nthe policy will weaken brand loyalty and hasten\n the current trend towards down-trading\n.   Ma\nking tobacco a commoditi\ns\ned product with compet\nition based purely around price \nwill play into the hands of \norganised criminals.\n \n L\negitimate brands will not\n be able to compete on price\n \nagainst\n untaxed and unregulated i\nllicit whites\n.\n&#xa0;\n38.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIllicit whites are already a major and fast-growing problem, attracting\n the most\n price-sensitive smokers.  \nAn empty pack survey in Q4 2011 found 68 different illicit white brands in the UK, but over 450 have been identified worldwide.\n  Popular demand is proven: p\nlain packaging will\n make Ireland (and the UK) a target for increased supply\n. \n \n \n \nAlready ‘baggies’\n (illicit unbranded cigarettes sold cheaply in sealed transparent plastic bags) \nand unbranded loose tobacco are \ncommon in many countries. \n The situation\n in the UK and Ireland could easily deteriorate further.\n \n&#xa0;\n39.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nf, as anticipated, plain packaging leads to price reductions and therefore increases in tobacco excise to compensate, the price difference between the legal and illicit products will increase. This will increase the profit for tobacco smugglers and further incentivize them to target the Irish market.  For the reasons discussed above, any increase in supply to Ireland will flow through to the UK.\n&#xa0;40.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew data on the illicit tobacco trade in Australia\n, \nthe only country to have introduced plain packaging\n, \nwill be available by the end of September. \n PML intends \nto share this information with the Committee before the Inquiry closes.\n&#xa0;29 August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;\n Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ‘Stepping up the fights against cigarette smuggling and other forms of illicit trade in tobacco products – A comprehensive EU strategy’ at page 6.\n Project Star report op cit. at page 15.\n Communication op cit. at page 4.\n N\national \nA\nudit\n \nO\nffice report ‘Progress in tackling tobacco smuggling’ at page 4 available at \nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/10120-001-Tobacco-smuggling-Full-report.pdf\n \nIbid\n at paragraph 1.4\n.\n Project Star report 2012, at page 28, available at \nhttp://www.pmi.com/eng/media_center/media_kit/documents/project_star_2012_final_report.pdf\n ‘\nINTERPOL targets organized crime with global initiative against trafficking in illicit goods’, 22 June 2012, available at\n \nhttp://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News-media-releases/2012/PR050\n Information on the PMI \nand EU Cooperation Agreement is available at\n \nhttp://www.pmi.com/eng/tobacco_regulation/illicit_trade/pages/ec_agreement.aspx\n The European Commission Anti-Fraud Office.\n \nS.170(3) of \nthe \nCustoms and Excise Management Act 1979.\n S.93 Trade Marks Act 1994.\nAll Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health Inquiry into the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, \nMemorandum from: Trading Standards Institute Tobacco Focus Group, November 2012 available at \nhttp://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_888.pdf\n \nDepartment of Justice Northern Ireland consultation ‘Extension of Unduly Lenient Sentencing Provisions to Fraudulent Excise Evasion For Fuel and Tobacco’, May 2013, at paragraphs 2.2-2.3, available at \nhttp://www.dojni.gov.uk/index/public-consultations/current-consultations/unduly-lenient-sentencing-for-excise-fraud.pdf\n.\n \nR v Grew and McLaughlin\n and \nR V Mackle, Mackle and Mackle\n, [2011] NICA 31.\n  \n Information based on research commissioned by PMI from independent consultant Will O’Reilly.\n Project Star report op cit. at page 15.\n Will O’Reilly op cit.
