Written evidence from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents [TOB07]

[[[Introduction]]]1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the Committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the issue of tobacco smuggling.2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.3. The NFRN assists the independent retailer to  compete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expertise and services, it also represents its members’ interests at governmental and parliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry.

[[[emarks]]]4. The NFRN recognises that there have been a number of high profile and high value raids and seizures of illicit cigarettes in recent months. Notably in July 2013, officers from HMRC arrested five people during raids across the Peterborough and Spalding areas as part of an investigation into a suspected case of £6 million worth of cigarette smuggling fraud. 5. The NFRN also acknowledges the recent publication of the National Audit Office’s report into the progress of HMRC’s implementation of its tobacco smuggling strategy. However it was evident from the report that given HMRC’s estimate that tobacco smuggling cost the Exchequer £1.9bn in lost revenue over the 2010-11 period, and that it did not meet any of its “more stretching” targets in 2012-13, further action is required to tackle the problem accordingly. 6. The consequences of tobacco smuggling have a direct and far-reaching impact on the businesses of our members. The availability of cheaper, but illicit tobacco can result in cash-strapped consumers purchasing tobacco from alternative sources, at the expense of responsible and legitimate retailers.  Such behaviour not only impacts on the finances of businesses and the Treasury, but most importantly, on the health of consumers who consume the illicit products.7. It is also worth noting that smuggling also impacts on the under-age consumption of tobacco products. Unlike responsible retailers, sellers of illicit tobacco will not ask for I.D from customers who appear under-age. Therefore tobacco smuggling provides an accessible avenue for those who wish to obtain tobacco products whilst under-age. 8. Counterfeit cigarettes often pose additional health risks to those traditionally associated with smoking, due to the variety of ingredients used. A BBC investigation in 2012 discovered that illicit cigarettes sold for purchase in Sussex, contained levels of cancer-causing chemicals that were far higher than those found in the legal, regulated products. The NFRN would recommend that greater promotion of the dangers of dubious ingredients and potential health impacts of counterfeit cigarettes should be undertaken, in order to educate and discourage people from purchasing such products. 9. Whilst the NFRN supports the government in its aim to reduce the number of people who smoke and to prevent young people from starting the habit, it must be acknowledged that recent legislation such as the tobacco display ban could potentially result in unintended and undesirable consequences. When the ban comes in to force in small stores in 2015, it raises the possibility that consumers may turn away from legitimate retailers to illicit sources, as a consequence of legal transactions being made more difficult. Alternatively, for those customers unaware of the tobacco display ban, a belief that their local store no longer stocks tobacco may encourage them to seek out more convenient but illegal sources.10. The NFRN also considers the link between tobacco smuggling and organised crime to be a major concern. An attempt to smuggle 30 million cigarettes into the UK through the Port of Southampton in March 2013, highlights both the scale and professionalism of some smuggling operations that take place. As a consequence of the findings of the NAO report, it would desirable for HMRC to be equipped with all of the necessary resources in order to tackle this problem efficiently.11. The NFRN are campaigning actively on a number of issues relating to smuggling, including the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). The upcoming vote on the TPD is a potential further complication in the fight against tobacco smuggling as the NFRN fears that if the directive is agreed, the prohibition of ten packs, menthol cigarettes, slims, and the introduction of combined warnings (picture plus text) of 75% on both sides of the tobacco packet will only serve to encourage smuggling and counterfeiting, as packets may be easier to copy and some products such as menthols will only be available via illicit sources. As the directive will leave the door open for the government to bring in plain packaging for tobacco products in the UK, the NFRN is concerned that the packaging will be simpler and easier to counterfeit, resulting in a further influx of illicit tobacco. Similarly, those who wish to purchase the outlawed items may feel tempted to buy them illicitly.  12. The following terms of references will be focused upon in our submission to this inquiry:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK

[[[Declaration of interests]]]13. In 2012 the NFRN reorganised with the separation of the not-for-profit trade association from its commercial operations, NFRN Commercial Ltd.

[[[The NFRN]]]14. The NFRN, while working with tobacco manufactures on issues of mutual concern, has no financial links or arrangements with any tobacco manufacturer.15. The NFRN does work with the Tobacco Retailer Association, Tobacco Manufacturers Association and campaign groups such as “Hands Off Our Packs” and “No Thank EU” on matters of common interest.  In August 2013 the NFRN assisted in arranging the distribution of campaign and information packs from the “No Thank EU” campaign to NFRN members across the country.16. The NFRN does not receive any funding from, nor does it fund, any of these groups.17.  NFRN policy is set by members at its Annual Conference.   Members of staff, including those who deal with tobacco manufacturers and campaign groups, are not permitted to take part in the policy debates at the Annual Conference.18. In the Republic of Ireland, Transatlantic Public Affairs, who also work for Philip Morris, have provided no cost public affairs advice to the local NFRN district.  Such advice is monitored by the Head Office Public Affairs team to ensure compliance with the aims and objectives of the NFRN.19. The Public Affairs team works for the NFRN and does not  have sight of commercial agreements between the NFRN, NFRN Commercial Ltd and third parties, whether they be tobacco manufacturers or not.

[[[NFRN Commercial]]] 

[[[Ltd]]]20. NFRN Commercial Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary operated at arm’s length from the NFRN, maintains commercial relationships with most tobacco manufacturers.   As a result of these relationships an amount of £28,000 pa is spent by tobacco manufacturers on advertising and sponsorship.   21. As these relationships are with NFRN Commercial Ltd, the companies have no influence over NFRN policy.22. Senior management have received a modest amount of hospitality from tobacco manufacturers. All such hospitality is recorded and is available for inspection. As members of staff, they do not have any say in the adoption or revision of NFRN policy.

[[[Newtrade Publishing Ltd]]]23. The NFRN also owns Newtrade Publishing Ltd, publishers inter alia of Retail Newsagent and Retail Express.   Newtrade Publishing Ltd is operated as an arm’s length organisation, with contact limited to senior NFRN management and the Communications and Public Affairs teams who deal with Newtrade Publishing Ltd staff as normal press contacts.   Newtrade Publishing Ltd publications have carried advertising from tobacco manufacturers but this is unrelated to the work of the NFRN.

[[[General Principle]]]

[[[s]]]24. While the NFRN, NFRN Commercial Ltd and Newtrade Publishing Ltd believe that it is perfectly legitimate to have business relationships with the manufacturers of legal tobacco products, they are aware of the sensitivity of the sector and the potential for reputational risk.   The NFRN and NFRN Commercial Ltd therefore take a conservative approach to these relationships, ensuring that relationships are focused towards achieving the aims and objectives of the NFRN and that all commercial arrangements are proportionate to the service being provided. 

[[[Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate]]]25. Currently, the NFRN considers that the sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are not a sufficient deterrent. Given that 1.7 billion cigarettes were reportedly seized in the period 2010-11, it would appear that the financial incentives of cigarette smuggling are continuing to outweigh the risks of receiving a sanction and/or penalty. 26. This view is endorsed by Andrew Leggett, Deputy Director for Indirect Tax at HMRC, who gave evidence on the EU cigarette strategy to the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union - Home Affairs, Health and Education (Sub-Committee F), which was held on Wednesday 24th July 2013. 27. Leggett admitted that large amounts of money could be made from illicit cigarette sales, highlighting that a pack of “20 cigarettes is twice the price of an illicit pack of 20 cigarettes” and considered that “at the moment the 

[[[balance of risk and reward is a good one for tobacco ]]]

[[[[smuggling] ]]]

[[[globally]]]”. 28. It is important to note that whilst the NFRN would like stronger deterrence’s for cigarette smugglers, it would not support measures which would place further burdens on those who are legitimate sellers of tobacco products.29. The NFRN suggests that attention also needs to be given to the different methods of deterring the consumer from purchasing illicit tobacco. For example, in the Quebec region of Canada, they have opted to criminalise consumers of illicit tobacco through the Tobacco Tax Act, a policy the NFRN would encourage the committee to examine during its inquiry.30. Furthermore as mentioned previously in paragraph 6, the NFRN would encourage raising awareness of the ingredients and potential health implications that can result from the consumption of illicit tobacco products, as a potential means to reduce the level of tobacco smuggling.

[[[The possible impact of the introduction of standardized packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK]]]31. The NFRN disagrees with the introduction of standardised packaging for cigarettes in Ireland. Whilst the intention to make tobacco less attractive to consumers is a laudable aim, we consider that the policy could have unintended negative effects on consumers. It is worth noting that since the introduction of the display ban in Ireland, smoking has not decreased but the proliferation of illicit tobacco has increased.32. One unintended consequence of the policy if introduced could be that the number of counterfeit cigarettes could increase. As tobacco products would be subject to specific and generic packaging design requirements as set out by statute, there is a risk that essentially, a “how to” manual for counterfeiters is being produced. This combined with the fact that packs will be simpler in design, suggests that counterfeiting process will become easier, potentially leading to an increase in illicit tobacco.33. HMRC have also conceded that “the simpler you make a package, the easier it is to counterfeit it”, however they did state their belief that there was not the evidence available to “to quantify the extent to which those risks would materialise”.34. In addition, if the policy is implemented and it does lead to an increase in illicit tobacco as the NFRN believes, this will have a knock on effect for legitimate retailers who provide a valuable service to communities, potentially putting some of our members out of business and detrimentally impacting upon the health of consumers.35. The lack of evidence currently available is a further reason why the NFRN considers the decision on plain packaging in Ireland should be delayed. It would be sensible to wait until further data from Australia is published, so that there can be sufficient analysis and a fuller understanding of the potential consequences of the policy. 

[[[Conclusion]]]36. Whilst the NFRN acknowledges the steps HMRC have taken to reduce tobacco smuggling, the volume of the illicit market is still far too high. This is to the detriment of both the consumer’s health and the finances of hard-working, independent businesses in the retail and convenience sector. With the upcoming vote on the TPD rapidly approaching and the potential effects of the directive if passed on tobacco smuggling, the NFRN welcomes the committee’s decision to launch an inquiry into this issue.
