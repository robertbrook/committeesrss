[[[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]]]

[[[ and Transport for Greater Manchester (LTD0024)]]]Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) has welcomed the Government’s policy to devolve resources, decision-making and functions away from Whitehall and toward the city region. This submission to the Committee highlights in particular:

[[[hat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level ]]]

[[[decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?]]] 1.1              Greater Manchester established the first Combined Authority in the country in April 2011, reflecting the importance given to governance at the heart of our city region growth strategy, alongside the GMLEP, building on the long-standing tradition of effective joint working across local public and private sector partners in the city region. 1.2              We share Government’s view that an over-centralised state can act as a barrier to the most effective local public sector reform and economic growth; and we have developed a compelling case for how devolution can yield significant benefits at both the local and national level. Devolution to the right level of local government enables effective coordination and prioritisation of spending to be maintained in support of local growth and regeneration objectives. Moreover, at a time when public resources are scarce, we believe that it is more important than ever that we allow places with mature governance arrangements and clear strategies to determine their own transport priorities to drive GVA and growth.1.3              City region governance in Greater Manchester mirrors the conurbation’s functional economic area that generates an annual GVA of £48 billion and is home to a growing population of over 2.7 million people. Devolution has enabled decisions and funding considerations in relation to transport to be made in a much broader context, including strategic planning, future housing and employment site development, town centre regeneration - and provides for a fuller understanding of environmental impacts. 1.4              This has enabled GMCA and the GM Local Enterprise Partnership to secure a long term consensus on policy direction and spending priorities, as set out in the recently revised Greater Manchester Strategy, Stronger Together, with a clear focus on growth and value for money. Critically, through the GVA-led investment criteria that we have developed and adopted locally, we are able to ensure that our investment priorities are consistently focussed on growth in a way that Government department appraisal approaches cannot, with this being particularly so in the case of DfT’s transport appraisal methodologies.

[[[Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local ]]]

[[[transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?]]]2.1              Our city region governance system is supported by the transport expertise developed by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM, the renamed GM Passenger Transport Executive) providing policy support, technical appraisal and the delivery capability required for transport schemes of all sizes and complexity. This evolving, adaptable and accountable governance structure has ensured that Greater Manchester is well placed to work with Government’s new approach to funding major transport schemes to maximise local and national policy objectives. We look forward to developing further aspects of devolution through the new Growth Deal that we intend to agree with Government in 2014 with a view to progressing reform and efficiency across all agencies involved in delivering transport investment and services in Greater Manchester.   2.2              The optimum delivery body depends on local circumstances and requirements; it is to some extent a corollary of the devolutionary process that different arrangements will emerge as appropriate responses for different geographies and circumstances. Therefore, we welcome the Government’s continued policy intention, as established under the recent City Deal policy, to establish local arrangements for devolution that reflect local governance arrangements and local priorities in different parts of the country, so that those who are ready to progress with devolution quickly are able to do so. This is important in the case of Greater Manchester, where we have strong governance and delivery capacity already in place, thanks to the £2 billion transport investment programme underway here, and are therefore ready to accelerate the rate of devolution to a greater degree than will be the case elsewhere.

[[[What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?]]] &#xa0;3.1                            Greater Manchester maintains a dialogue with neighbouring authorities, with a view to addressing connectivity barriers that if resolved collaboratively can yield benefits for the wider economic area. This contemporary form of engagement offers significant benefits over the previous regional model, which attempted to determine collaboration between local authorities on the basis of artificial boundaries such as the North West. In the absence of these structural constraints, Greater Manchester has established new cross-boundary working, with South and West Yorkshire for example, that better reflect economic interdependencies and opportunities to secure improvements through economies of scale.&#xa0;3.3              We see further scope for collaboration in the future, particularly if the providers of key motorway and rail infrastructure linking Greater Manchester with neighbouring areas are also drawn into close working arrangements with us. However, under current arrangements that limit the funding available to local transport, neighbouring authorities are often constrained in their ability to collaborate in direct spending partnerships. Long-term funding deals with authorities would provide greater scope for cross-boundary spending partnerships.

[[[How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national ]]]

[[[transport agencies?]]]              4.1              In recent years, northern transport authorities have demonstrated their ability to collectively prioritise and promote genuinely transformative transport schemes that deliver cross-boundary impacts. The Northern Hub rail investment programme was established as a national investment priority following a concerted effort by all northern partners and Network Rail to promote a clear and consistent business case for the expansion of rail capacity to secure regional benefits. Closer working between TfGM, Greater Manchester highway authorities and the Highways Agency has also begun to bring benefits through a series of protocols that establish common principles for working across adjacent parts of the strategic and local highway system. Further effective project-based joint working has also taken place in relation to a number of schemes, such as the construction of the Ordsall Chord (a key element of the Northern Hub), a complex scheme which involves local highways and planning authorities, Highways Agency, Network Rail and TfGM.&#xa0;4.2              This local approach to regular and effective working is increasingly mirrored at a planning and governance level, with regular dialogue now in place between TfGM, the Highways Agency, Network Rail and DfT through a series of officer engagement channels.  In addition, representatives of Network Rail and other agencies attend meetings of the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee, both to brief members on specific infrastructure developments and to respond to service issues.&#xa0;4.3              We see scope to take these relationships further to ensure consistent alignment between local economic priorities and investment decisions made by national bodies, such as Network Rail and the Highways Agency. We are keen, for example, to explore the opportunities offered by the forthcoming revised Highways Agency arrangements to align investment activities across the local and strategic highways system in Greater Manchester.&#xa0;4.4              In the context of rail devolution and preparation for HS2, we are proposing a refreshed relationship with Network Rail to ensure that national investment supports local growth priorities and to promote partnership spending arrangements. Critically, HS2 offers a unique opportunity to secure long-term growth and regeneration in Greater Manchester, subject to the right levels of facility being secured at Manchester Piccadilly in particular. This will require long-term partnership funding arrangements with Network Rail that enable optimal scheduling of investment across Control Periods 5, 6 and 7 to ensure that transformational facilities can be delivered to unlock regeneration benefits at the earliest opportunity.

[[[Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local ]]]

[[[authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?]]]&#xa0;5.1              Effective devolution requires a predictable and stable funding regime over the long term. The level of funding available for major local transport schemes has historically been significantly below that required to meet economic growth potential. There remains a substantial funding gap between the large city regions outside London and the capital itself, with Treasury figures showing that the total public spend per head on transport in London is 2.3 times greater than the spend per head for the North of England and the West Midlands combined (source: pteg). In addition, the process for determining major scheme funding decisions has been constrained by a scheme-by-scheme analysis by central government. Collectively, this has undermined the ability of authorities to promote the programmes of infrastructure investment that give wealth creators the confidence to undertake entrepreneurial investment in a local economy, as has been seen in London from the Docklands Light Railway onwards. &#xa0;5.2              Locally, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities sought to address this through the £1.5 billion GM Transport Fund (GMTF) in 2009. This initiative built on the “self-help” approach to transport infrastructure provision that Greater Manchester adopted two years’ earlier to unlock a funding package for the £575 million Metrolink Phase 3(a) programme, more than half of which was provided by local funding. GMTF supports the delivery of economically focused transport investment through long-term commitments made both locally and for central government major scheme funding as set out below. &#xa0;

[[[100%]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;5.3              Hence, major scheme transport funding in Greater Manchester is now a complex product of direct (major schemes) and indirect (top-sliced ITB) central government funding alongside local prudential borrowing. Through the 2012 City Deal, GMCA has agreed the principle of an “Earn Back” model with Government, which builds on the self-sufficiency approach to delivering infrastructure investment. The model uses a formula to provide a long-term revenue stream to support further long-term investment, subject to additional GVA, measured in changes in rateable values at the Greater Manchester level, being created relative to a 2015 baseline. Earn Back, therefore, provides both a future revenue stream and an additional incentive for Greater Manchester to prioritise local government spending to maximise GVA growth. More recently, a number of other city regions have indicated their intention to develop self-reliance models as part of moves towards revised governance, demonstrating the importance of this approach. &#xa0;5.4              However, these new approaches will require consistent long-term commitment from all transport funding partners if their impact is to be sustained over the long-term. For example, through the forthcoming Local Growth Fund arrangement, Greater Manchester has been allocated a core provision of £110 million from 2015/16 to 2020/21, extending to £199 million by 2024/25. Whilst it is welcome to see Government establishing longer-term core allocations of major scheme funding, the scale of funding should be viewed alongside spending priorities for the city region.  For the period to the end of the current decade alone, the Greater Manchester LTB has identified a minimum investment pipeline of more than £300 million schemes, alongside the £350 million Metrolink extension to Trafford Park to support growth in the country’s largest industrial park, which is also home to the Trafford Centre and adjacent to the nationally important M60/M62 motorway. Beyond this, GMCA has set out the case for a major programme of tram-train developments, combining the country’s largest tram system with one of the fastest growing urban rail markets to enable growth to be sustained into the 2020s, alongside the delivery of transformational HS2 facilities discussed at 4.4 above. &#xa0;5.6              The Committee is also encouraged to not overlook the importance of ITB funding, which enables local transport authorities to directly deliver smaller investment schemes, such as local access and highways pinch-point measures, and acts as a long-term funding source to secure optimal larger solutions that could not be supported through development contributions alone. Since the CSR in 2010, ITB funding has reduced by around 50% compared to levels under the LTP2 period to 2010/11. We welcome the fact that ITB has been maintained as a policy for 2015/16 onwards, but note that the £458 million per annum to be made available for ITB nationally will still be around 30% lower than the national provision in 2010/11. In addition, we have concerns about the likely allocation arrangements for the £258 million of ITB following recent consultation on future allocation formula options, which suggested a shift in funding away from the metropolitan areas.&#xa0;5.7              The reduction in ITB has been in part offset by a wide range of DfT funding competitions. However, this approach to funding runs the risk of undermining Government’s devolution intentions. In addition, the short-term nature of funding competitions presents challenges for local transport authorities in planning for the long-term and in encouraging long-term private sector commitments to local investment or regeneration initiatives. Furthermore, significant staff resources are required to put together competitive bids. In Greater Manchester, officers have addressed this challenge by taking a city region-wide approach to bids, coordinated by TfGM. However, this has proved increasingly challenging for local authorities elsewhere and risks doing so here too in the context of further reductions in local authority funding. &#xa0;5.8              Finally, we would highlight the wider implications of further reductions in the local authority revenue support grant, following the recent Spending Round. Consistent access to revenue funds for on-going travel services and promotion measures, which are essential in sustaining modal shift amongst commuters, has been a long-standing issue. Reduced local authority revenues have already brought reductions in local supported bus services and other travel support measures in many areas of the country; and they are likely to place increasing downward pressure on budgets for transport services in the major city regions outside London. The element of revenue funding provided through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) has been a welcome change in this regard, albeit that LSTF is still time-limited in nature even after the recent commitment to its extension for 2015/16. The recent national LSTF conference highlighted the challenges that this will bring beyond 2015/16 for authorities in sustaining support for local carbon and active travel measures.

[[[What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth]]]

[[[ Fund have?]]]6.1              As already set out above, Greater Manchester is well-prepared for the further devolution and changes to transport spending governance that the LGF will bring. Our governance arrangements remain the subject of on-going review, and we welcome the opportunity through a future Growth Deal to establish local arrangements across the entire Greater Manchester investment framework, which may remove the need for an explicit LTB.  We will also be be looking to utilise this opportunity to secure further parallel reforms that ensure that the impact of LGF funds can be best maximised through clear long-term partnership and programme based investment frameworks across all local transport agencies operating in the city region.

[[[How can local authorities ]]]

[[[attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?]]]7.1              As set out under question 5 above, a core long-term central government funding commitment to local transport funding is a key component in attracting private sector funding. As also set out earlier, the Greater Manchester authorities recognise that not all of this funding can be accessed through traditional major schemes funding channels, but rather requires all parts of the public sector to align spending programmes in the interests of consistency. This could potentially include greater use of European Structural Investment Funds if UK Government can be persuaded of the case to press for greater deployment of EU SI Funds to support transport schemes that unlock real low carbon economic opportunity. 7.2              It also requires innovative thinking on the relationship between transport spending and future returns to the Treasury as shown in principle by the Earn Back model and in the current example of the funding agreement established for the transport infrastructure needed to support the Battersea/Nine Elms development in London. Looking towards the delivery of HS2 facilities, such as the proposed stations in Manchester, we see a need to develop this innovative approach to finance further, alongside the need for a long-term rail funding regime discussed above, so as to ensure that transport facilities are delivered at a scale and pace that ensures the wider economic impact of transport investment – in the form of new local employment and regeneration – is fully realised in practice.

[[[How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?]]]8.1              As set out above, Greater Manchester has established clear lines of accountability and a robust governance framework for transport expenditure decision making. However, there remains some uncertainty over the specific role that DfT will play in supporting devolved delivery of transport investment from April 2015. We would welcome clarity on this at the earliest opportunity, so as to ensure that systems can be best developed to support shared objectives.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
