defaultArthritis Care is the UK’s leading organisation working with and for people with all forms of arthritis. People with arthritis are at the heart of our work. We have around 13,000 members, who are involved in all of our activities and direct what we do. We run a national telephone helpline and have a network of 190 local groups across the country, which together with our internet forums and self management programmes bring people together to support one another in living life to the full.
default&#xa0;
defaultArthritis is not only the most common MSK condition, it is the most common of all long term conditions, comprising 28% of the total, followed by 
defaultheart conditions (16.8%)

defaultRESPONSE TO SPECIFIC ISSUESdefault&#xa0;defaultThe scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectivenessdefault              
default              
defaultA fundamental tool to delivering more out – of hospital care is
default risk profilingdefault. Systematic involvement of patient organisations will help deliver smarter

defaultThere are also

default defaultcare for people with long term conditions (LTCs)
default. F
defaultor example, improved care for

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTdefaulthe readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the communitydefault&#xa0;defaultWhen addressing this issue it is helpful to consider what patient outcomes such a shift in services should deliver. 
defaultSupported self-managementdefault (SSM) must be seen as a fundamental delivery goal of shifting care from hospital to community. 
defaultP
defaultatients who are effectively equipped to self-manage
default and engage in meaningful shared decision making
default are able to achieve a better quality of life and become less of a burden on the system. 
defaultThere is evidence that
default defaulteven the most challenged patients can be encouraged to manage actively.
default 
defaultOver the past

default and deliver
default 
defaultSSM elements of the
default strategy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditionsdefault&#xa0;defaultAssistance to commissioners must be based on a good understanding of the 
defaultrealities of commissioning LTC servicesdefault. 
defaultRecent research by the Nuffield Trust into commissioning care for LTCs
default  
default 
defaulthas concluded that s
defaultervices for those with long-term conditions are not easily ‘
defaultcommodified
default’ within a purchaser–provider market. Local commissioners are not following the standard purchaser – provider commissioning model, but are developing an alternative approach based on closer working between providers and commissioners. The report 
defaulthighlights a number of factors that have helped deliver effective LTC commissioning, e.g.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as addressing generic issues such as integration &amp; self management, commissioners need to address LTCs from the perspective of how they can 
defaultimprove defaulton a condition - defaultspecific defaultbasisdefault. The services for each condition needs to be looked at to see how it can improve, offer better value for money, and integrate better with other services. The 3

default sector has a wealth of knowledge it can impart, at both a national and 
defaultlocal level,

defaultquality o

defaultexisting 
defaultservices and 
defaultlevels of unmet 
defaultneed.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn a national level, condition – specific strategies can deliver impressive results. 
defaultFor example, the NHS 
defaultnational 
defaultheart disease and stroke s
defaulttrategy 
defaultha
defaults i
defaultn recent years delivered an track record of 
defaultsubstantial 
defaultimprovements: heart deaths have been cut by half, with a similar level of success for stroke survival, the fastest improvement in Europe.
default This has been achieved by collaborative working in a number of ways: encouraging specialists to form 
defaultlocal clinical networksdefault; 
defaultpreventing unproductive 
defaultcompetition between consultants,
default 
defaultand 
defaultconcentrating specialist care
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese 
defaultsuccesses 
defaulthave only been possible with centralised strategic planning and a condition – specific focus
default, and 
defaultprovide a strong argument for

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultManaging co-morbidities
default defaultis one of the most significant challenges for a LTC strategy.
default  
default 
defaultArthritis 
defaulthas strong links with other co-morbidities, e.g. cardiovascular and COPD. 
defaultAn Arthritis Care supporter recently described their experience of lack of coordination thus:
default&#xa0;
defaultI am currently under the care of four different consultants at the same hospital &amp; there appears to be great 
defaultdifficultly
defaultdifficulty
default in having appropriate &amp; timely communication between them &amp; myself. If there could be one consultation involving all Specialists, say every 3 months, I would need fewer appointments are get better, faster care. As often one Consultant has to wait for the results or decision made by another Consultant.
default&#xa0;
defaultEvidence 
defaultfrom patient 
defaultorganisations
default such as National Voices shows what people most want is access to 
defaultcare coordinatordefaultsdefault who 
defaultare
default able to arrange packages of care, 
defaultensure that specialist services are joined up, that patients are treated by the right people and in the most appropriate location
default.
default 
defaultThe care coordinator should be tasked with conducting 
default“whole person” needs assessmentsdefault at the beginning of an individual’s care pathway, 
defaultand for 
defaultcollaborative care planning defaultwith patients
default. 
defaultT
defaulthis role may be
default  
default 
defaultdelivered by primary care nurses, 
defaultbut can also be done by trained and well supported volunteers; something Arthritis Care is piloting now.
default Care coordinators should also function as an `internal’ patient advocate, arguing for patients when the system under-performs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent estimates put the number of LTC patient with care plans at 12%.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother essential component to dealing with co-morbidities is setting up 
defaultgeneric multidisciplinary teams default(MTDs), which 
defaultaim to move away from single-disease silos of care and to stop patients falling through the gaps as they are shifted from GPs to social workers, outpatients
default, etc
default. Integrated teams do not have to work under the same roof, but they must meet regularly – in person or through teleconferencing – to review at-risk patients and jointly decide care packages. MDTs should comprise GP, nursing and therapy input, as well as case co-ordinators. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultObesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addresseddefault&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to the conditions cited
default above
default, obesity is of equal importance to successfully tackling arthritis. There is evidence that increased services to promote lifestyle alterations would reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis, e.g. strengthening exercises, general fitness, anti-obesity programmes and the use of supportive appliances.
default 
defaultUp to half of all knee osteoarthritis is theoretically preventable by weight reduction and up to a third is preventable by preventative advice on activities that lead to joint 
defaultinjury,
default 
default(i
defaultbid).
default A national nutrition strategy under Public Health England would be a way to address poor diet and over-eating, with direct attention paid to the role of the major food companies
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditionsdefault&#xa0;defaultSee the comment on multidisciplinary integrated teams in the section on co-morbidities.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen thinking about better coordination it is important to have an understanding of all the ways it should impact on services, particularly the need for 
defaultimproving the connections / interfaces between servicesdefault, e.g.
defaultThese issues highlight the need for a variety of different types of coordination, e.g. parallel coordination between different care providers, and sequential coordination, i.e. the transfer of responsibility between healthcare professionals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ONEL project in Barking and Dagenham is an example a 
defaultjoint health and social care projectdefault, aimed at m
defaulteeting the needs of and maximising the
default quality of life for people with long-term conditions. A crucial element of its success has been gaining of detailed knowledge of the actual problems people in the area faced with their health and social care services
default. This
default highlights the need for commissioners to work out local solutions that are tailored to meet the needs of their areas, not just seek to impose “off the peg” examples of good practice.
default&#xa0;
defaultTorbay Care Trust
default is another oft-cited example of integrated health and social care, in this case, in respect of care for the elderly. Salient features include:
default&#xa0;
defaultKey factors in delivering these changes included:
default&#xa0;
defaultA drive towards greater marketization of services, with its corresponding increased fragmentation of services and staff churn, seem likely to 
defaultsubstantially 
defaulthinder, if not altogether preclude, attempts to integrate services along the lines of the Torbay model. (This factor is mirrored in the findings of the Nuffield Trust research, cited above, which similarly suggests the need for labour intensive long term relationship building between stakeholders in order to develop good LTC services).
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother example of successful, integrated care services is the Pennine 
defaultMSK
default Partnership
default, characterised by a single prime vendor holding one contract for all services within a specific pathway (in this case, 
defaultMSK services
default).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demand default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst it would be inaccurate to consider arthritis a disease solely of the elderly, approximately half of the elderly population have arthritis. 
defaultExpenditure on MSK conditions in general is increasing, in part as a result of an aging population: MSK spending has increased by 
default51.6%
default defaultin the last six years, and is now the fourth-highest area of NHS spending
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is mounting evidence of services for arthritis being restricted due to budgetary squeezes: people with arthritis already frequently report to us difficulty getting access to essential and timely services, e.g. assessment by specialist clinicians, physiotherapy
default. T
defaulthere are numerous reports of rationing of hip and knee surgery throughout the NHS, most recently from the Audit Commission
default. Given the projected increase in LTCs, it is difficult to see how existing services, frequently failing as they already are, could possibly 
defaultin their current state 
defaultwith the projected increase in need.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe extent to which patients are being offered defaultpersonalised servicesdefault (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes)default&#xa0;
defaultSee the section on co-morbidities, above.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultADDITIONAL COMMENTSdefault&#xa0;defaultA LTC strategy needs to make clear links with 
defaulthelping people with LTCs retain and return to work. defaultThe link between health and work has been increasingly recognised, particularly since Dame Carol Black’s 2008 Review
default. 
defaultArthritis and related conditions are the second most common cause of days off work.
default With government funding, 
defaultArthritis Care has worked with stakeholders to produce an online work retention toolkit for people with long-term fluctuating conditions and their employers.
default The strategy could reference this resource, and seek to build on it.
