defaultThe SJA was formed in 1948
default and 
defaultthe first British sports awards were introduced in 1949, making them the oldest in Britain.
default  
defaultTen years later the sportswoman of the year a
defaultw
defaultard was added
default to that of sportsman of the year
default, in hindsight an avant garde decision 
defaultto acknowledge sporting excellence no matter the gender.
default&#xa0;

defaultSports journalism 
defaulthas traditionally
default been a predominantly male occupation, mainly because football, rugby
default, cricket
default, motor sport, boxing, 
defaultracing, 
defaultgolf 
defaultwer
defaulte
default historically
default only 
defaultplayed by men and, therefore, reported on by men.
default The perceived wisdom was that men read the sports pages and women 
defaultwere simply not interested. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe membership of the SJA would have reflected thi
defaults.
default 
default There has only been one woman chairman – Pat Besford in 1976, who was also British Olympic press attaché for 11 years and president of the swimming commission of AIPS 1981-88.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen’s sports were, in essence, school sports – netball, hockey, lacrosse
default,
default rounders
default.  Girls did not grow up wanting to be footballers; in fact they were not allowed
default by the FA
default to play football.
default&#xa0;
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, in sports where gender does not matter – tennis, swimming, athletics
default, 
defaultequestrian
default events – there have always been elite sportsw
defaultomen. 
defaultSome of these elite sportswomen turned to writing and broadcasting after they retired and can be regarded as the fore-runners of today’s generation of female sports journalists. 
default&#xa0;
default6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnita Lonsbrough
default, who won an Olympic gold in the 200m breaststroke in 1960, became the Daily Telegraph’s swimming correspondent. Baroness Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, who led England to victory in the inaugural women’s cricket World Cup, similarly wrote for the Telegraph while 1
default957 French Open champion Shirley Brasher reported on tennis for the Observer.
default&#xa0;
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthese remained niche sports and the coverage was largely restrict
defaulted to broadsheet newspapers, which
default had the space to devote column inches to “minority” sport.  The trio named ab
defaultove would not have been seen as trend-setting, but simply as former elite spo
defaultr
defaulttswomen 
defaultand 
defaultexperts in their own field.
default&#xa0;
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUntil the 
default1970s it was unthinkable that a woman journalist would report on men’s sport. Football is Britain’s national game, 
defaultand, as such
default, is probably a good
default barometer by which to measure the progress of women in sports journalism
default and compare it to media coverage of women’s sports today
default.

defaultForty-four years ago 
defaultJulie Welch was a football fan and a journalist. She was also the first woman to
default write seriously about football
default, covering her first match for The Observer in 1969. She recalls that the opposition to her presence in the press box was so great that she was even assaulted with a chair by a male reporter.  In contrast, she was accepted by
default footballers and football managers.

default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 1980s saw the emergence of a few 
defaultmore female sports 
defaultprint 
defaultjournalists and there was a spell in the 1990s where nearly every paper employed one “token” woman
default, sometimes with little or no experience of reporting sp
defaultort. 
defaultMs Welch’s sports editor at the time labelled them “the 
defaultfluffies
default”
default 
default—
default an accurate indication of how women were viewed in the sports department.
default*
default&#xa0;
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
defaultre
default 
defaultwas, however, a small
default but committ
defaulted group of women who wished
default for no special treatment and who wante
defaultd to be judged purely on their journalistic ability. 
default 
defaultAnother of the forerunners was Sue Mott, who was working at the Sunday Times by the 1980s. 
default&#xa0;
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShe recalls that she asked Julie Welch for advice and was told “wear a cap and swear a lot.” She was also 
defaultinformed by a hugely influential football writer (male) at the time that women playing football was as unnatural as dogs walking around on their hind legs
default.*

default&#xa0;
default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFrom the mid 1990s onwards
default, 
defaultthere were other national newspaper 
defaultwriters; 
defaultJanine Self (The Sun),
default 
defaultVikki Orvice (The Sun), Alyson Rudd (The Times), Louise Taylor (Guardian), Amy Lawrence (Observer) were all press box regulars and accepted as such.
default 
default&#xa0;
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultToday the membership of the Football Writers’ Association 
default[FWA] 
defaultis believed to be 4% female. There has n
defaultever been a woman chief football correspondent.
default&#xa0;
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn tandem
default with the print industry, f
defaultemale voices were heard reporting 
defaulton football on 
defaultBBC
default radio
default. Eleanor Oldroyd was the first woman to present Sports Report in 1995 and can talk knowledgeably about rugby, cr
defaulticket etc too, 
defaultwhile Charlotte Nicol was 
defaultsenior football producer
default for many years and is now a sought-after freelance.
default&#xa0;
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe tv breakthrough, helped by the launch of Sky, saw the likes of Gabby Logan (formerly Yorath), Kelly Cates (formerly Dalglish), Rebecc
defaulta Lowe, Jill Douglas, Sonja McLaughlan, Clare Balding, Hazel Irvine, all emerge as top-notch sports presenters
default on terrestrial channels
default. 
default&#xa0;
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe late Helen Rollason presented Grandstand. Football, c
defaultricket, rugby, motor racing
default, racing
default are
default no longer
default seen as
default an all-male preserve.  Women were being accepted, if still in the minority. Sue Mott believes the problem starts in the class room when girls decide they do not like sport
default.*

default&#xa0;
default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, she cites the 
defaultcompetitive nature of the industry and the 
defaultpractical
defaultity of a woman covering major sporting events. She once 
defaultwent to t
defaulthe French Open 
default[
defaulttennis
default]
default with two small children, one husband, one nanny and 11 pieces of luggage and her daughter slept in a suitcase. This tends not to be a problem for men, who leave their 
defaultfamily at home

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJacqui Oatley found herself on the news pages when she became the first woman commentator on Match of the Day. Oatley had another claim to fame.  She was a former footballer, forced to retire early through injury, and a massive supporter
default of
default the women’s game while equally an expert on the men’s version.
default 
defaultOver the years she has continued to bang the drum on behalf of women’s football. 
default&#xa0;
default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe London 2012 Olympics appears to have been a watershed moment 
defaultfor women’s football 
defaultas far as mainstream
default media is concerned. The Great Britain team was given extensive coverage in print, on radio, on television, on the internet and on social media like Twitter. 
default&#xa0;
default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe crowds flocked to the matches, 
defaultwhich
default were reported on by recognised football journalists of 
defaulteither gender – a significant advance on the original theory that women had to write about women’s sport because men did not want to “lower” themselves.
default&#xa0;
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The knock-on effect was that the BBC announced live and extensive coverage of this summer’s European 
defaultChampionships, featuring England. When England went crashing out of the tournament, there was serious debate and the head coach lost her job.  
defaultHope Powell may not appreciate th
defaulte significance of the sack
default but it 
defaultillustrated 
defaulthow the status of women’s football
default has been elevated.
default&#xa0;
default23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEqually this summer has seen the England women’s cricket team take on Australia
default in the Ashes, while a 15-year-old girl golfer called Charley Hull emerged as the star of the European Solheim
default Cup team and Laura Robson briefly became the darling of Wimbledon. All were reported on.
default&#xa0;
default24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLast year’
defaults Olympic Games
default produced many female sporting heroes, from heptathlete Jess Ennis, cyclists like Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott, to rowers Katherine Gr
defaultainger and Anna Watkins
default to dressage gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin
default. They were afforded the same attention, the same respect as their male
default counterparts. 
default&#xa0;
default25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, it is a fact that none of the sports named above would continue to attract similar column 
defaultinches outside a major event/tournament/championships. This applies equally to men – Mo Farah, S
defaultir Bradley Wiggins, etc.
default&#xa0;
default26
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Dec
defaultember 2012, the SJA hosted its
default annual sports awards lunch at the Tower of London. 
default Jess Ennis, Sarah Storey and the rowing pair 
defaultof Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins were all winners. In recent years the SJA has recognised weightlifter Zoe Smith, taekwando star Sarah Stevenson and ironman Chrissie Wellington.
default&#xa0;
default27
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn March 2013, the SJA held its annual sports journalism awards dinner.
default  Not surprisingly, winners in recent years have been predominately male but times are changing. Clare Balding became the first woman winner of the broadcaster of the year award, which has been running since 2005.
default 
defaultThe Mail on Sunday’s Martha Kelner was nam
defaulted young sports journalist of the year, following in the footsteps of Emma John in 2008.
default 
default&#xa0;
default28
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSports journalism continues to be dominated by men, rather like fashion journalism continues to be dominated by women.  However, since Lo
defaultndon 2012 there have been ot
defaulther, significant, 
defaultbreakthroughs.
default&#xa0;
default29
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlison Kervin, a respected rugby writer and author, became the first sports editor of a national newspaper when she was appointed by the Mail on Sunday earlier this year
default&#xa0;
default30
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe power of Twitter cannot be discounted either. T
defaulthe Women’s Sport Trust provides scholarships/grants to aspiring sportswomen and 
defaultsupport
default all women’s sports in the UK while the Women’s Sports Net provides a complete service of reports and results on women’s sports. 
default&#xa0;
default31
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA new magazine, entitled Women in Spor
defaultt, has just been launched.
default&#xa0;
default32
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAIPS, which represents national sports journalist associations worldwide, is about to set up its first commission on women’s sport. The SJA have nomi
defaultnated vice chair Janine Self as a representative.
default&#xa0;
default33
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC
default 
defaulthave announced a commitment to women’s sports while BT Sport, new players in the broadcast market, cover women’s sport and have a Women in Sport section on their website.  
default&#xa0;
default34
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe days when women’s sports were regarded almost as an embarrassment are long gon
defaulte.
default  Tabloid newspapers still have a tendency to be “laddish” in their approach, especially in their choice of photographs.  Equally, glamour shots of an elite sportswoman could encourage 
defaultschool girls into participation if they believe sporty = sexy.
default&#xa0;
default35
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBroadsheet newspapers have the opportunity to project women’s sport because they have more space. A good story is a good story, regardless of gender, and stars like Ennis, Robson, Serena Williams, Paula Radcliffe, 
defaultcommand
default column inches whenever they speak.
default Virginia Wade’s Wimbledon triumph in 1977was given the same profile as Andy Murray this year.
default&#xa0;
default36
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNothing in Britain 
defaultwill supplant men’s
default football, 
defaultparticularly the 
defaultEnglish 
defaultPremier League. 
defaultLittle boys grow up wanting to be David Beckham or Wayne Rooney or Gar
defaulteth Bale.
default 
default 
defaultMen’s sport has had a head star
defaultt of over a century and newspapers will continue to reflect that, regardless of whether the writer is a man or a woman.
default&#xa0;
default37
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there has
default clearly
default been a gradual 
defaultgroundswell in terms of interest in women’s sport, 
defaultfuelled perhaps by the Olympics, and 
defaultmedia coverage has reflected this.
default&#xa0;
default38
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default In conclusion, therefore, the 
defaultS
defaultJA does
default not believe that media coverage in the last 13 months has had a 
defaultdetrimental effect on women’s participation in sport.
