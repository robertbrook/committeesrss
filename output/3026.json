"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Wildlife Trusts &#xa0;There are 37 individual Wildlife Trusts in England.  They are actively engaged in the planning system, promoting opportunities to improve the natural environment and reviewing more than 70,000 planning applications last year.  The Wildlife Trusts have more than 740,000 members in England including members of our junior branch Wildlife Watch.\n&#xa0;\n Our vision is to create A Living Landscape and secure Living Seas.\n&#xa0;\n Each Wildlife Trust is working within its local communities to inspire people about the future of their area: their own Living Landscapes and Living Seas.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0; \nAt present the majority of local planning a\nuthorities have no system in place to secure off-site compensation with long-term management commitments and this has proved in some instances to be detrimental to biodiversity and a barrier to achieving meaningful mitigation \nand compensation. Biodiversity o\nffsetting could provide a positive alternative to the existing approaches, providing: \n1.2\n&#xa0; \nThe development of such a system needs to be informed by resilient evidence. It is \ntherefore disappointing that the\n Green Paper has been issued before the completion of the \noffsetting pilots in April 2014. It will be vital to consider the findings of the\nse\n pilots and assess whether they achieved the required outcomes. Failure to do so, \nwill risk \nmissing important opportunities and lessons that should inform the potential for, an\nd design of, a future approach.\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nBiodiversity offsetting needs to have a clear purpose, set within a framework for delivering ecological networks. \nThe Wildlife Trusts \nsuggest\n that Government needs to set out a vision to create a National Ecological Network for\n England, which should be informed by \necological network strategies \nproduced by\n Local \nNature Partnerships (LNPs)\n. Within these strat\negies, ecological network maps w\nould show the existin\ng natural assets (our statutory and non-statutory sites and\n priority h\nabitats\n) and important areas for re-establishing s\ntrategic footholds for nature \ne\ng\n. buffers around protected sites and Nature Improvement Areas across the length and breadth of England.\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nIn order to make this vision a reality, the Natural Environment White Paper, Forestry Panel Report and \nBiodiversity \nOffsetting Green Paper could all be followed through and joined up by a land-mark piece of nature legislation. All this could connect to the Natural Capital agenda to create a substantive new framework Bill.  Specifically, for example, the Bill would set the context for biodiversity offsetting which would then have the purpose of helping achieve a coherent ecological network and the restoration of ecosystems.  In this way it could make a positive contribution towards meeting the need to rebuild our natural capital, resulting in a positive change in the country’s natural asset balance sheet.\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Wildlife Trusts welcome \nGovernment’s intentions that a biodiversity offsetting system should achieve a \nnet gain for biodiversity\n and that it \nwill not be appropriate \nto use \nin all \ncircumstances \n‘\nin view of the importance of the biodiversity that will be affected or the difficulty of creating similar habitat’\n. \n We have significant \ndoubt\ns\n \nhowever, about the delivery of these objectives in practice, if the objective is to make provision for biodiversity impacts\n ‘\nquicker\n and \ncheaper for developers\n’\n.\n \n3.2\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe assertion that biodiversity o\nffsetting will be ‘cheaper’ and ‘quicker’ does not appear to be underpinned by any evidence. Evidence gathered \nfrom local Wildlife \nTrusts \n about the biodiversity offsetting pilots shows that there has been a\n lack of uptake \nby developers This \ncould indicate that the potential schemes were too expensive and therefore not signed up to by developers.  \nFor developers which already deliver with regards to biodiversity, then offsetting may not introduce additional costs, but \ni\nf the system is to achieve net gains for biodiversity (as it should do in line with the NPPF), some developers are likely to have to pay more than they do currently.\n In addition, the assumption that compensatory habitat can be provided on less-expensive land may not always be the case, particularly as offsetting could push the price of some land up.\n3.3\n&#xa0; \nCurrently, the tone of the \nGreen Paper\n is weighted and focused \nmore \nin\n \nfavour\n of the benefits of biodiversity o\nffsetting to the developer \nrather than the natural environment\n. It also fails to adequately \nrecognise\n the importanc\ne of biodiversity and ecosystem services to society. biodiversity o\nffsetting is a complex issue and it is therefore vital that the development of a new system is not rushed or simplified at the expense of delivering positive outcomes for the natural environment and society as a whole. \nMitigation hierarchy\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBiodiversity offsetting should \nonly\n be used as a mechanism for compensating residual harm and should \nonly\n be applied if there is evidence that the significant impacts of a development cannot be avoided, reduced or mitigated.  The system needs to be mindful of assumptions in \napplying or interpreting the mitigation hierarchy – it has to be \nclear, that the application of biodiversity o\nffsetting must not weaken existing protection for important sites, habitats and the population status of species of conservation concern. \n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently\n,\n the planning system fails the natural environment, with most developments resulting in a net loss of biodiversity. There is an opportunity to design a system that addresses this, but if this is to work properly\n,\n there needs to be appropriate constraints and clear guidance\n,\n along with standards for avoiding and mitigating loss which should be applied rigorously.\nNet Gain/ Net Loss\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe objective \nof a biodiversity o\nffsetting system should be to achi\neve no net loss, and a net gain\n for biodiversity through the planning system. While we support the objective to enhance ecological networks and improve connectivity, this should not be at the expense of those species and habitats that need to be conserved in situ. If in-situ conservation is the best option to prevent a long term negative impact on a protected habitat or species\n,\n then biodiversity offsetting will not ensure compliance with legislation. \n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe concept that achieving a ‘\nnet gain\n’\n for biodiversity by rel\nocation of biodiversity assets ‘\nin a way that enhances ecological networks\n’\n might be true of some habitats, but is inherently dangerous to apply to others. For example, offsetting a small isolated ancient woodland by planting a larger new woodland in a strategic biodiversity area to achieve the same credit scoring, will not create a net gain in biodiversity, particularly as the current methodology doesn’t include any calculation for loss of connectivity in generating the credits. \n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, for high value and distinctive habitats in particular, finding and agreeing an appropriate offset project may not be that easy\n.\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA net biodiversity gain is only achieved if a proj\nect goes above and beyond the 'n\no net loss' threshold.   It is also unclear\n,\n at what geographical scale ‘no net loss’ is being considered in the Green Paper, or how this is being measured. Our view is that both ‘no net loss’ and ‘net gain’ s\nhould be judged at a sub-regional\n/county scale and to avoid biodiversity in one part of the country being lost in exchange for gains in another.\nMandatory\n for all developments\n3.10\n \nIf b\niodiv\nersity o\nffsetting is to be introduced, it should be plan-led and mandatory across the board\n for \nall developments with new land take\n,\n regardless of size\n. Feedback from Wildlife Trusts in the pilot areas has already indicated that a voluntary scheme does not work.  A mandatory and well regulated scheme will:\n3.11\n \nHabitats and species of importance may occur at any scale, for example, bat roosts and the only known breeding site for Jennings’ Proboscis-worm (which has no statutory protection) occur at very small scale. The number of houses is not necessarily related or comparable to the ecological impact, because a well located major development may have few impacts\n yet a\n small speculative development on a wildlife rich site could be disastrous for wildlife but below the threshold. \nIf developers are not required\n to\n offset residual loss of biodiversity, \non developments below a certain threshold, adequate \ncompensation for small developments and the cumulati\nve impacts of these developments will be lost\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe pilot metric appears to be based on some good principles and could provide a starting point from which to develop a robust metric.  It will be important to evaluate the experience and lessons of the pilots in considering revisions to the metric and its broader application. These findings could usefully be considered alongside:\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the complexities\n \nof ecosystems\n \nit will be vital that any future metric addresses a range of issues\n to ensure \nbiodiversity offsetting\n does\n no\nt result in lots of land of mediocre value, colonised only by a relatively small number of general\nist species that cannot support \nthe diversity of species and habitats that have been lost.\n \nThere are many\n issues \nthat must \nbe considered and addressed \nwhen developing and applying a biodiversity offsetting metric. Some of TWTs key concerns and risks are set out \nin paragraphs \n4\n.3 – \n4\n.8\n.\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAvailability of like-for-like physical conditions for compensation\n The value of many existing sites is in their long-term stability, history and physical characteristics\n,\n enabling them to support specialist species. The metric and associated cost of delivery of compensation land need to take into account the full biodiversity of a site. The quality and functionality of ecosystems depend on the interaction dynamics of diversity and fragile species. An offsetting approach will fail to deliver if it ultimately results in land of a generalised and species-impoverished nature, in relation to land lost.\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTemporary Ecological deficit\n There will be a temporary ecological deficit during the establishment of the offsetting site (which nationally could be substantial). This will persist \nunless and until offset habitats have reached equivalent quality, quantity and functionality locally and within the wider national ecological network.\n \nIn some cases, because of the highly fragmented state of our countryside, the site to be damaged/destroyed can be the only local reservoir of many specialist species. If local compensation is proposed and it hasn’t been put in place (and matured enough to support specialist species) before the existing site is destroyed, there will be a complete local extinction of those species. The compensation land will then never support the same full range of species because there will be nowhere for them to colonise from. The only way to resolve this issue is to ensure that habitats are created before they are required as compensation. This needs exploring and taking into account in a completed metric approach. In relation to this it will also be vital that investment is made upfront into a secure fund before the development takes place.\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTime required to recreate\n \nhabitat and re-establish ecosystems\n Consideration should be given to the issue that while it may be possible to quickly and successfully \ntranslocate\n individuals of some species (\ne.g.\n Great Crested Newts) and some assemblages of species, to suitable newly established habitat, it is nearly impossible to accurately recreate the detail, much of which, may not be well known. Re-establishment of microbial ecosystems, relationships between micro-fauna and flora of meadow soils, peat-based wetland communities and others will need a lot of time (decades to centuries) and/or a lot of very detailed research and management to deliver. There is little published and accessible casework on how quickly, or slowly, such complexity re-establishes itself in various habitats and habitat mosaics, over long timescales.\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCharacter of the receptor site\n It is not clear from Government proposals how risks are taken into account in terms of the character of a receptor site. Further consideration will need to be given to this in developing the metric. For example, it would be considered lower risk to restore a humid heath from a conifer plantation on \nheathland\n than from a maize field. The first is quite straight forward and could be achieved within a reasonable time scale, the second is much riskier with less certainty as to what habitats will emerge. While after m\nany\n decades\n,\n the ex-maize field may be the most interesting, this does not really help planning with certainty.\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSurvey of impacts\n We are concerned that a standard framework to assess impacts, may limit the level of survey and/or analysis of individual impacts and in-combination effects occurring with other developments\n,\n in the surrounding area.  All sites are different and survey and evaluation needs to consider distinctiveness and quality of habitat if there are to be true gains for biodiversity. If biodiversity offsetting becomes a permit to undertake a twenty minute survey, the biodiversity value of the site is unlikely to be assessed appropriately, with habitats and species missed\n,\n either due to the time of year or the lack of survey time and effort. The value of grassland and woodland cannot be assessed in twenty minutes.\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Variation 5.1\n&#xa0; \nWhile \na national framework of common standards could usefully provide consist\nency of approach, a system for b\niodiversi\nty o\nffsetting must provide scope for local variation and flexibility which should be set out within local plans. Local variation is important because habitat which is valuable or distinctive in one area may not be considered valuable or distinctive elsewhere. Unless the metric and offsetting system are sufficiently rigorous to cover all eventualities and retain ecological functionality, it is unlikely that one size will fit all.  Without local flexibility, the calculation may end up locally meaningless and won’t result in \nan equal or fair trade. It could also lead to the loss of small areas of semi-natural habitat, of relatively low ecological value, but highly valued by the local community.\n5.2\n&#xa0; \nSignificant harm is also an issue which needs to be placed in the context of the local area, the identified impacts and the feature to be lost. What is considered significant harm in one area might be considered less so in another. The balance to be placed on this is an integral part of the planning officer’s role when considering and applying local and national planning policy and should, as with other planning issues be informed by local ecological expertise.\n6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStrategic location of offsets6.1\n&#xa0; \nFor offsetting to be reasonable, there must be a meaningful ecological and social relationship between the development site and the compensatory scheme. This should be as close to the development as possible, ideally within the same district or county, but at the very least within the same sub regional level. \nThe Wildlife Trusts \ndo not accept \nthat offsetting should be evenly distributed across the country - where development pressures are lower, the requirement for offsets will also be lower.\n Nor \nwould \nwe \nsupport offsets on land:\n6.2\n&#xa0; \nLocation is a big consideration in addressing risk, for example, provision of new ‘quite interesting’ habitats adjacent to a matrix of ‘very interesting’ habitats may have greater ecological advantage than an equivalent area of isolated but ’very interesting’ habitat.\n \nThe offset system and planning generally, should \ntake a strategic approach to\n establish connective and permeable biodiversity networks everywhere, based on the principles set out in \nMaking Space for Nature\n of bigger, better and more joined up. Guided by this, \nLNP\ns \n(in collaboration with other partnerships such as \nNature Improvement Area groups and Catchment Initiative Groups\n)\n should develop ecological network and NIA visions and maps. These should be based on up to date data and information on statutory and non-statutory sites, priority habitats, geology, Natural Character Areas and opportunity areas\n and will require \nLPAs \nto\n cooperate across boundaries at a county/sub-regional level to inform \nthe\n strategy \nand agree the \noffsetting\n approach\n.\n6.3\n&#xa0; \nThese visions and maps should be embedded within local policy and the opportunities identified within them should be used to inform location priorities for targeting offsets.  \nIdentification of land for biodiversity offsetting would enable the quantum of habitat required to be assessed at a strategic level, taking into account: direct habitat loss; and the in-\ncombination and indirect pressures. It would also ensure that the offset is in a geographical area that will enable \ncolonisation\n by populations displaced by development\n,\n or expansion by populations within an existing habitat adjacent to the offset. \n6.4\n&#xa0; \nA further consideration that will need to be \ntaken into account\n when locating offsets is the degree of local community interest in the site that will be partially or wholly destroyed by the development.\n6.5\n&#xa0; \nOver the last decade, much work has been achieved through habitat opportunity mapping. These maps have provided local authorities and partners with vital information to support a robust, climate-proof, long-term landscape-scale vision for the benefit of the natural environment, society and the economy. This work has taken place in partnership across most English regions, where maps have been produced to identify biodiversity opportunity areas critical for restoration, based on agreed methodology. The opportunity maps provide clear and consistent information on sites of known value, they capture most or all of the resource which meet the agreed criteria, and take a landscape scale approach. As a result, they can provide a clear spatial framework for a local ecological network and support the effective targeting of local biodiversity offsets.\n&#xa0;\n Some of the Biodiversity Opportunity Areas identified through this process have been used to identify Nature Improvement Areas. \nWe believe that all areas should be covered by a robust evidence base and informed by identifying and mapping such areas.\n7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConstraints and restrictions7.1\n&#xa0; \nBiodiversity offsetting should not provide a mechanism to develop protected sites. \nThere are\n very few projects that would justify direct harm to the \nnational and international sites. A\n housing development or local infrastructure should not be considered to outweigh the need to protect these sites. In relation to a project of national importance there may be certain circumstances in which damage cannot be avoided. In these cases\n,\n we would advocate th\nat offsetting sh\nould occur\n \nimmediately adjacent to the site to provide replacement habitat within the SAC or \nRamsar\n complex\n,\n or for the species for which the \nNatura\n 2000 and \nRamsar\n sites are designated.\n 7.2\n&#xa0; \nOffsetting needs to be controlled. \nThere\n \nshould be no ‘down trading’ on habitats or \nbias towards habitats which are cheaper to create\n. S\no a high distinctiveness habitat should be offset with a high distinctiveness habitat.\n Where there are \nspecific connectivity requirements within an area which require certain habit\nat types in certain locations, changes of habitat type (from like-for-like), should be \nclearly justified \nand locally negotiated\n to meet the broader objectives of local biodiversity strategies and strategically defined requirements set by LNPs.\n7.3\n&#xa0; \nWe would be concerned \nwith \nany approach that permitted an environmental gain \n(\nthat might otherwise be lost\n)\n to \nbe \ncount\ned\n as an offset\n. This\n would risk: \ndiscontinuation of other sources of public spending on\n biodiversity\n; \nintroducing a ‘what-if' option into a framework which is striving to be solid, quantified and certain; \nand \na resultant net biodiversity loss. \n8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOffset assessments 8.1\n&#xa0; \nNecessary judgements on using the metric \nand making\n assessments \nshould be made by experienced ecologists\n,\n \nbased on up to date survey data and information. \nPlanning authorities will therefore need to have access to ecological expertise\n (either in-house or provided under contract/service level agreement\n).\n \nMany local authorities are choosing to cut their ecological expertise and support for data p\nroviders - currently\n only a third of local authorities have an in-\nhouse \necologist\n \nand local re\ncord centres are severely under\n–resourced. This must be addressed along with the inevitable increase in burden on already, overstretched local authorities as they \nset up, operate and learn about the new system. \n8.2\n&#xa0; \nAssessments should be guided by the expertise of a number of local organisations/partnerships. For example: the \nLNP\n; Local Records Centre; Biodiversity Partnerships; and nature conservation organisations such as The Wildlife Trusts. Collectively, with the LPA and Natural England, they can offer a range of ecological and planning expertise\n,\n grounded in local knowledge and an understanding of the strategically defined requirements for protecting and restoring the natural environment. \n8.3\n&#xa0; \nThe Core Strategy should clearly set out for developers whether and where o\nffsetting is appropriate in the\n local area, so that it is clearly and democratically defined in local policy. This should explain the local context to the metric, the broad scope of what the LPA will require in terms of offset habitat decisions and offset placement areas of the authority\n,\n based on the vision and strategy for ecological networks within the area.\n9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLong term management 9.1\n&#xa0; \nThe loss of area and quality of habitat to development will remain as an overall impact for a considerable time\n,\n if not in real perpetuity. Therefore we need to replace as much as we can for as long as possible. \nIn order to secure no net loss to biodiversity, offsets should \nrecreate/restore an area of habitat which is larger than is lost, \nbe secured in perpetuity and agreed within conservation covenants\n,\n so the land doesn’t become neglected or damaged.\n9.2\n&#xa0; \nLong term management is absolutely key to the success of offsetting projects and there should be a requirement for an agreed management plan to be produced and implemented. \nWe would expect all agreements to include a monitoring and review \nprogramme\n, to ensure that the regime continues to be effective and meet the objectives set.  It has to be \nrecognised\n that habitats (and species composition) may change naturally over time, including in response to climate change.  Some flexibility, or requirement to review manageme\nnt objectives will be important. \nIt will also be vital that the partners responsible have: clear protocols and resources to certify and enforce management agreements; secure, long term financial support for management of the offset site\n, secured in advance of the development commencing\n; and adequate ecological skills and expertise. \n&#xa0;\n17 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n Local Wildlife \nTrusts in pilot areas (2013): Verbal and written updates on progress with pilots.\n Somerset County Council, Somerset Environmental Records Centre, Somerset Wildlife Trusts (Nov 2012): \nSo\nm\nerset Biodiversity Offsetting – strategy and methodology\n)\n Lawton, J.H., \nBrotherton\n, P.N.M., Brown, V.K., \nElphick\n, C., Fitter, A.H., Forshaw, J., \nHaddow\n, R.W., \nHilborne\n, S., \nLeafe\n, R.N., Mace, G.M., Southgate, M.P., Sutherland, W.A., \nTew\n, T.E., \nVarley\n, J., and Wynne, G.R.
