[normal]Written evidence from [bold]the[bold] [bold]Pemphigus[bold] [bold]Vulgaris[bold] [bold]Network [bold](LTC 15)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Committee is exploring the scope for more people with long-term conditions to be treated in the community and outside hospital.
[normal] 
[normal]We quite understand the move to
[normal]wards
[normal] treating more people in the community but think it is entirely inappropriate and potentially dangerous for those of us with rare and life-threatening dermatology conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Pemphigus
[normal] 
[normal]Vulgaris
[normal] Network wants to stress that 
[normal]treating us in the community and outside hospital
[normal] is not what people with 
[normal]pemphigus
[normal] 
[normal]vulgaris
[normal] 
[normal]need
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given that 
[normal]pemphigus
[normal] is a 
[normal]volatile
[normal] and life-threatening 
[normal]dermatology 
[normal]condition
[normal],
[normal] we need our medical care to continue being treated in a hospital setting (
[normal]ie
[normal] following B
[normal]ritish 
[normal]A
[normal]ssociation of 
[normal]D
[normal]ermatology
[normal] guidelines).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Few GPs have ever had a 
[normal]pemphigus
[normal] patient 
[normal](it is an orphan disease) 
[normal]and whilst we need our GPs to be looking after our general health, especially given the possible side effects of necessary 
[normal]immuno-suppressives
[normal], the treatment for our condition needs to be determined by consultant dermatologists
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Indeed
[normal],
[normal] if the 
[normal]pemphigus
[normal] is not responding to standard drug regimens
[normal],
[normal] this care may need (at various points) to be with consultant dermatologists 
[normal]who 
[normal]speciali
[normal]s
[normal]e
[normal] in, and 
[normal]have a particular interest in
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]blistering diseases â€“ as is being currently defined by the work of the 
[normal]NHS 
[normal]Specialised
[normal] Commissioning Board.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To sum up: treatment in the community, outside a hospital setting, could put the lives of 
[normal]pemphigus
[normal] 
[normal]vulgaris
[normal] patients at risk.
