Written Evidence Submitted by [bold]the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (LAI 0046)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Please find attached a copy of JCWI's written evidence on the proposed legal aid changes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Due to fact that after the call for this evidence was made the Government have responded to the consultation on Tr
[normal]ansforming Legal Aid and have issued a further consultation on Judicial Review many of our originals submissions need to be reconsidered. JCWI has not had the opportunity to fully undertake this reconsideration and is in the process of doing so. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Accordin
[normal]gly, we submit a brief response which we hope will be of some assistance to the Committee. We would be grateful if our interest could be noted and should the Committee require further evidence JCWI would be happy to provide the same. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]JCWI will be doing a
[normal] full response to the Judicial Review consultation which is open until the 1st of November 2013. 
[normal]Further to the call for evidence on the implications for access to justice of the Government's proposals to reform legal aid
[normal], [bold]Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) is providing brief 
[normal]evidence on three aspects, the strength of connection to the UK, Judicial Review and borderline cases. This evidence is brief as the Government's response to the consultation Transforming Legal Aid has now been published and a further consultation on Judic
[normal]ial Review has been issued. JCWI is considering both of these in detail and will be in a position to provide further evidence if required shortly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Residence Test[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]JCWI has voiced serious concerns about the residents test and has given illustrations of 
[normal]how this would prevent the few protected groups under LASPO from access to legal representation. the Government's response to the consultation Transforming Legal Aid, does seem to have taken these concerns into account. In the original proposal only asylum
[normal] seekers and armed forces personnel were exempt from the test, now the exemptions have been extended to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              [bold]•[bold]              [bold]Detention cases [bold](paragraph 5, 20, 25, 26 and 27 (and challenges to the lawfulness of detention by way of judicial review under paragraph 19) of Par
[normal]t 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO)
[normal]              [bold]•[bold]              [bold]Victims of trafficking[bold] (paragraph 32 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO),
[normal]              [bold]•[bold]              [bold]Victims of domestic violence and forced marriage [bold](paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 16, 28 and 29 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO);
[normal]              [bold]•[bold]              [bold]Protection of children ca[bold]ses [bold](paragraphs 1, 349, 950, 10, 15 and 23 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO); and
[normal]              [bold]•[bold]              [bold]Special Immigration Appeals Commission[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The original proposals were unclear on how the residence test would affect those who wanted to make a fresh claim for asylum. Howe
[normal]ver, the response has 
[normal]clarified that anyone making a fresh claims and subsequent challenges by judicial review if the claim is not accepted as a fresh claim will be exempt from the residence test.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The concern remains for those asylum seekers whose claims 
[normal]are accepted and they are granted refugee status. Although the concession has been made that for refugees their continuous lawful residence will begin from the date they submitted the claim rather than the date they were granted asylum, in straight forward
[normal] and strong cases for asylum a person's case maybe decided very quickly within a couple of months but they would still have to wait the best part of a year before being eligible for legal aid in any other sphere. This amounts to treating refugees different
[normal]ly from other residents and contravenes Article 16 of the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the status of Refugees: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Article 16
[normal]...
[normal]2. A refugee shall enjoy in the Contracting State in which he has his habitual residence the same treatment as a national 
[normal]in matters pertaining to access to the courts, including legal assistance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where an asylum seeker has been unsuccessful in their asylum claim and their appeal rights had been rejected, they would no longer benefit from the asylum seeker exception to the 
[normal]residence test. Our concern remains that such individuals as well as those who have been in the UK for many years but with no status will not qualify for any legal assistance to regularise their status due the residence test. The aim of the test is to only
[normal] provide legal aid to those with a strong connection to the UK. It is hard to argue that someone who has been in the UK for 14 years for example does not have a strong connection. There are many individuals whose applications for the right to remain fall w
[normal]ithin the legacy provisions have and still not been decided. We illustrate this by using the following case study:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case Study:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Vietnamese woman H who came to the UK at the age of 14. Social services assessed her as a minor and she was placed in foster ca
[normal]re. An application for asylum was made on her behalf which was refused and the Home Office disputed that she was a minor. Her case was not pursued any further by her foster parents. She continued to live with and attend school. H left foster care at 18, at
[normal]tended college and at 20 met a British national with whom she had a child. Her daughter was given British nationality. The couple did not stay together and H was a single mother. Her studies had finished and she stayed with a friend in her flat. She wanted
[normal] to start working to provide for her herself and her daughter but realised she could not do so as she had no proof of her immigration status. She was also unable to claim any benefits and survived with the help of college friends. She made representations 
[normal]to the Home Office explaining her situation and saying she had made a claim for asylum six years ago but was unsure of the outcome. The Home Office wrote back saying her case was historic and was now being dealt with under the legacy programme by the Casew
[normal]ork Resolution Directorate.  They asked for evidence of residence and she supplied the same. After not hearing anything for several months she contacted the Home Office again and once again was asked to supply evidence which she did. Three years later with
[normal] no response and after having repeatedly sending evidence she contacted solicitors. The Home Office continued to be evasive and after her solicitors threatened to judicially review the delay H was granted limited leave to remain under the new 10 year route
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]H would have called foul of the residency test and would not have been able to access legal assistance.  There are many failed asylum seekers who have historically made further representations under Article 8 or on compassionate grounds (this is not th
[normal]e same as a fresh claim) and whose cases have not been concluded despite the end of the legacy scheme in April 2011. Until they get a response they are in a limbo with no status, eligibility to work or welfare assistance but in the UK often for over a deca
[normal]de with family, friends and in many cases British national children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Individuals who have been in the UK for a significant length of time cannot be said to not have 'strong connections' with the UK. It is particularly unjust if they are deemed to be unlaw
[normal]fully here because the Home Office has failed to make a decision on their cases. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Judicial Review:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Judicial review is of great constitutional significance  as it is the means by which the executive can be held accountable for its actions. It allows th
[normal]e enforcement of the Rule of Law. It is therefore of concern that Government proposed to remove payment for pre-permission work done on the case unless the Court grants permission for the application to proceed. Judicial review is specialist, top heavy wor
[normal]k, which means most of the work is done at the outset. If permission is not granted by the Court on a paper application there is the option to renew and ask for an oral hearing seeking permission. This means filing further grounds and instructing a barrist
[normal]er to attend the High Court for the hearing. If payment is depended on outcome many solicitors will simply not take a risk of lodging judicial reviews as few firms can afford the risk of not being paid for several days worth of work especially at a time wh
[normal]ere the existing Legal Aid cuts have made times very difficult for existing practices. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government's consultation response has been to introduce further consultation specifically on judicial review. It has suggested that pre-permission work could be p
[normal]aid at the discretion of the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). This appears a completely unworkable model with few solicitors willing to stake livelihood on the LAA's discretion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]JCWI has not had a chance to fully address the new consultation but will be providing
[normal] a detailed response to it shortly and would be happy to share this with the Committee. As an initial comment it is with grave concern that we note the Government's proposal to change the test for 'standing'. At the moment rightly and correctly judicial re
[normal]view proceedings can only be brought by somebody who has sufficient interest in the application. The current test for standing is prescribed in section 31(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, and requires that the 
[normal]court should not grant leave for an applicati
[normal]on for judicial review to be made unless the court “considers that the claimant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates”. This test has been interpreted by the courts as including cases where it is in the public interest fo
[normal]r an issue to be examined. The consultation quite clearly states that the Government thinks this is too wide and that its actions shouldn’t be challenged in the public interest. It says, “The concern is based on the principle that Parliament and the electe
[normal]d Government are best placed to determine what is in the public interest.” JCWI is gravely concerned that the Government is seeking to undermine the rule of law by removing the checks and balances that judiciary provide in controlling the executive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Bo[bold]rderline Prospects:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Removing legal aid for such cases increases the risk of miscarriages of justice. A borderline case is not a case without merit or one that is doomed to fail. These cases would not be funded at pubic expense and that is rightly so. But 
[normal]a borderline case is often one where legal opinions differ and until tested there is no way on knowing whether the client would have succeeded. This is of particular significance in areas where individuals lives are fundamentally impacted, for example in s
[normal]ecuring liberty or legal status. The current legal aid guidance says legal aid will be provided in borderline cases where it is 'of overwhelming importance to the individual'. It is only right that legal aid should remain for this category to ensure we do 
[normal]not fall foul of our human rights obligations.
