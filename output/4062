defaultb) Such editorial failures are increasingly apparent on social media which is in rising use by BBC employees.
defaultc) The BBC consistently fails to meet its fifth public purpose with regard to its representation of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Middle East peace process, failing to promote well-rounded audience understanding of these issues.
defaultd) The current system of self-regulation and the over-complicated complaints system are considered unsustainable by members of the public. 
defaultIntroduction:defaultBBC Watch (
defaulthttp://bbcwatch.org/
default) is an independent project of CAMERA (Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America) which was established in October 2012 in order to monitor the BBC's coverage of Israel for accuracy and impartiality as defined by the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines. 
defaultSince its establishment, BBC Watch has documented numerous breaches of those editorial guidelines and consistent failure to meet the terms of the fifth category of Public Purposes defined in the BBC's Charter 
defaultDuring that time, BBC Watch has also been contacted by many members of the public with regard to the unsatisfactory BBC complaints procedure. 
defaultHow well has the BBC performed in the current charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?default1) Breaches of Editorial Guidelines on Accuracy:
defaultFailures to meet Editorial Guidelines on accuracy are alarmingly common. Those failures appear in written, audio and filmed BBC content and increasingly on social media platforms used by BBC correspondents which, according to the BBC, are subject to the same editorial demands. 
defaultExamples of inaccurate information promoted on social media include:
defaultA false 
defaultclaim of an Israeli air raid
default on Gaza on 19/11/13.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultmisrepresentation of a picture
default from the conflict in Syria as having been taken in the Gaza Strip.
defaultInaccurate representation
default of casualty figures.
defaultInaccurate representation
default of cause of death of a Palestinian prisoner.
defaultExamples of inaccurate information in BBC reports include:
defaultRepeated misrepresentation of the Israeli view of the recent P5+1 talks with Iran – see 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default. 
defaultFalse claims of a 
default'secret' detention
default in Israel.
defaultMisrepresentation of a 
defaultcriminal incident
default as hate crime.
defaultHistorical inaccuracies in BBC produced content and on its dedicated educational website – see examples 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default. The significance of such inaccuracies is exacerbated
default by the fact that misleading articles remain on the BBC website as a 'permanent public record'. 
defaultThe repeated 
defaultmisrepresentation
default of the death of the son of a BBC employee in Gaza as having been caused by Israel (the 
defaultUN established
default that it was the result of a misfired missile launched by Palestinian terrorists). Images associated with that widely promoted BBC story were 
defaultlater
default 
defaultused
default at anti-Israel rallies in the UK. 
default2) Breaches of Editorial Guidelines on Impartiality:
defaultPromotion of political campaigns on social media by BBC journalists – see examples 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default.
defaultRepeated 
defaultpromotion and amplification
default of the agendas of politically motivated NGOs without due disclosure of their aims and agendas – see examples 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default.  
defaultUse of 'expert comment' without due disclosure of affiliations and political views – see examples 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default. 
default3) Public Purposes:
defaultThe fifth of the BBC's Public Purposes as defined in its Charter and Agreement is that of "Bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK". The BBC Trust's interpretation of that remit includes a commitment to "build a global understanding on international issues". 
defaultWith regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the BBC consistently 
defaultneglects
default to inform its audiences of the scale of terror threats facing Israeli civilians. It frequently ignores incidents of missile fire at civilian targets and 
defaultother
default terror attacks against them. It downplays the subject of Palestinian terrorism in general and has erroneously portrayed imprisoned terrorists as 'political prisoners' – see 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default.
defaultThe BBC's 
defaultrepresentation
default of the subject of the Middle East peace process is frequently 
defaultindistinguishable
default from that of the Palestinian Authority, with disproportionate – and 
defaultfrequently inaccurate
default - emphasis on factors promoted by the PA as 'obstacles to peace'. At the same time, factors no less relevant to the peace process such as the Hamas/Fatah split, Palestinian terrorism, official PA incitement and glorification of terror and Israeli security 
defaultconcerns are given considerably less coverage, thereby hampering audience understanding of the issue. 
defaultBBC reporting from the areas controlled by the 
defaultPalestinian Authority
default and Hamas is notable for its consistent avoidance of issues such as the oppression of minorities, women's rights, government corruption and the lack of press freedom. 
defaultRemarkable too is the sheer scale of BBC reporting on Israel. Over the past nine months (
defaultMarch to November 2013 inclusive
default), Israel has consistently been in the top five Middle East countries receiving the most coverage on the BBC News website, despite the fact that much of the rest of the region continues to be plagued by political and military turmoil. 
defaultOne particularly 
defaultworrying
default characteristic of the BBC's Middle East reporting has been its tendency to promote unchallenged conspiracy theories and propaganda produced by repressive regimes to worldwide audiences – see examples 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default, 
defaulthere
default and 
defaulthere
default. 
defaultThe past year has also seen several cases of the 
defaultdownplaying
default of 
defaultantisemitism
default both 
defaultin the UK
default and 
defaultabroad
default by the BBC and moderation of 
defaultantisemitic
default comments
default on the BBC's 
defaultpublic 
defaultfora
default has not infrequently proved to be inadequate. The BBC's decision to host a known 
defaultantisemitic
default Holocaust denier 
defaulton its Persian service
default is a cause for considerable concern and reinforces the impression that educational work on the subject of 
defaultantisemitism
default is urgently 
defaultneeded
default at the BBC.  
defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?default4) The BBC complaints system:
defaultBBC Watch receives considerable amounts of correspondence from the general public with regard to the BBC's complaints system. Many of those members of the public are frustrated by the system's labyrinthine nature, the difficulties they experience in navigating it and the often slow response time to complaints. 
defaultMembers of the public also express great dissatisfaction with the fact that the BBC is essentially a self-regulating body and that there is no possibility for impartial adjudication of complaints by an independent body. 
defaultThe material collected on this subject by BBC Watch suggests that many members of the public would like to see the establishment of an independent ombudsman to deal with complaints regarding BBC content and that the current system of self-regulation is unsustainable.
