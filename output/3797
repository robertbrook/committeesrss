defaultDear 
defaultSelect Committee,
defaultI'm speaking as a motorist, cyclist and pedestrian and believe there is enough space for all on the roads.
defaultBut, there needs to be a change of Attitude and Care
default, by some road users
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis
default proposal for a tightening of 
defaultpenalties,
default should make our roads safer at no cost:-
default&#xa0;
defaultConsider the case where a Pedestrian or Cyclist is obeying the 
defaultlaw
default and is injured or killed by a motorist.
defaultAs a starting point, that motorist 
defaultshall
default automatically lose their
default driving licence for the period that the victim is disabled.
defaultSo
default,
default if the pedestrian or cyclist is disabled for a year the motorist will lose their licence for a year.
default 
defaultIf the victim is killed the driver will never drive again.
defaultThis is a starting penalty; the
defaultre may need to be bigger penalties.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd remember, I AM A MOTORIST
default&#xa0;
default but
default it is the motorist who has the lethal machine.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso if a pedestrian is killed or injured by a cyclist, the cyclist will be banned from cycling for the period.
