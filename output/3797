[normal]Dear 
[normal]Select Committee,
[normal]I'm speaking as a motorist, cyclist and pedestrian and believe there is enough space for all on the roads.
[normal]But, there needs to be a change of Attitude and Care
[normal], by some road users
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This
[normal] proposal for a tightening of 
[normal]penalties,
[normal] should make our roads safer at no cost:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consider the case where a Pedestrian or Cyclist is obeying the 
[normal]law
[normal] and is injured or killed by a motorist.
[normal]As a starting point, that motorist 
[normal]shall
[normal] automatically lose their
[normal] driving licence for the period that the victim is disabled.
[normal]So
[normal],
[normal] if the pedestrian or cyclist is disabled for a year the motorist will lose their licence for a year.
[normal] 
[normal]If the victim is killed the driver will never drive again.
[normal]This is a starting penalty; the
[normal]re may need to be bigger penalties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And remember, I AM A MOTORIST
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] but
[normal] it is the motorist who has the lethal machine.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Also if a pedestrian is killed or injured by a cyclist, the cyclist will be banned from cycling for the period.
