&#xa0;Written evidence from Federation of Wholesale Distributors [TOB22]

[[[Introduction]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Federation of Wholesale Distributors (FWD) are responding to this inquiry as tobacco crime is a serious and growing problem in the wholesale distribution sector, which includes both cash and carry and distribution to business customers. &#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In particular, the trade in illicit tobacco has a strong adverse impact on our members, and it is regarding this trade that we are primarily responding to this inquiry. We are less qualified to comment on the smuggling of tobacco, although clearly inasmuch as smuggled tobacco fuels the trade of illicit tobacco, it does have a direct adverse impact on our members’ sales. &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our members’ primary concern is that they are frequently targeted by criminal gangs seeking to steal large quantities of legitimate tobacco products, often by violent means. Legitimate product stolen from wholesalers then forms a key constituent of the trade in illicit tobacco on the black market. It is blended with smuggled and illicit products, and sold on by organised gangs. As a consequence, the black market trade in tobacco directly undercuts our members’ businesses and that of their customers, legitimate retailers.&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We hope that our evidence is of interest to the Committee.  We would of course be delighted to provide further explanation or additional information if that would be of use.&#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By way of brief background, the Federation of Wholesale Distributors represents food and drink distributors across the UK.  Our members work with the largest brands to provide storage and delivery infrastructure to ensure that stock can reach both large and small retailers, caterers and private businesses. More than a third of members’ £28bn turnover is in tobacco.&#xa0;

[[[ – The scale of problem]]]&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The wholesale distribution sector is particularly vulnerable to theft due to the large amount of tobacco stock held at cash and carry or distribution centres and depots. Since January 2012 there have been at least 350 crimes against wholesalers and retail customers, leaving their employees under constant threat of physical violence. A retailer in Croydon, for example, required plastic surgery following an attack.  In another recent case, a retailer was killed during a tobacco robbery at a cash and carry.&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the nature of tobacco products – high value and low in weight – they are the most sought after product by criminals. &#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The average value of these crimes is £2,000, but many are significantly higher. In fact, the total value of goods stolen in the 350 thefts and robberies since 2012 is equivalent to 4.2 million cigarettes being stolen by criminal gangs for sale on the black market, with a street value of more than £1 million. &#xa0;9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; These legitimate products are often blended on the black market with tax paid tobacco and non-tax paid tobacco from other countries, as well as counterfeit cigarettes and illicit whites, which are cigarettes manufactured for the purpose of smuggling.

[[[ – Implications]]]&#xa0;10.&#xa0;&#xa0; The negative implications of tobacco theft for the wholesale distribution sector are severe. For example, in 2010 one Scottish cash and carry chain was the victim of 14 burglaries which resulted in a total of £3.2 million in lost sales, repairs, guarding costs and other associated costs. &#xa0;11.&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, there is a real threat of cash and carry retailers ceasing to trade due to the threat of violence, which results in lower sales. For example, a retailer in Sidcup was attacked on his way home from a cash and carry, and £2,000 in tobacco was stolen. A second attack occurred after he was followed home from the cash and carry, threatened outside his shop and forced to hand over £4,500 in tobacco.&#xa0;12.&#xa0;&#xa0; Many FWD members have highlighted that the constant need to divert considerable financial and human resources to dealing with the threat of tobacco related crime is unwelcome. Indeed, the need to divert finances in this manner means that our members are unable to invest resource in order to grow their business and to employ new members of staff. This is particularly difficult at a time when the country is desperate to find economic growth.

[[[Public Health ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]13.&#xa0;&#xa0; The flood of illicit tobacco onto the black market has implications both for underage access and public health more widely. The distribution of these products outside the responsible supply chain of legitimate wholesalers and retailers severely undermines the Government’s aim of controlling access through pricing, display regulations and age restrictions. &#xa0;14.&#xa0;&#xa0; Moreover, illegally sold tobacco products are often of poor quality due to criminals blending the products with other illicit tobacco.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Recommendations ]]]15.&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the growing problem of crime in the wholesale sector, the FWD continues to call for the following immediate policy responses:&#xa0;16.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Police forces should mobilise more resources and draw up appropriate strategies to tackle business crime]]]

[[[.]]] In this vein, the FWD believes that the advent of elected Police Commissioners presents an opportunity to ensure that area policing strategies to tackle business crime include measures to address crime against wholesalers. These should be properly developed alongside meaningful local business engagement and consultation. More attention should also be paid to the role that serious organised crime plays in fuelling criminal activity against wholesale, particularly in cases of theft of tobacco products.&#xa0;17.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[A joined up approach among ]]]

[[[neighbouring police forces, by sharing information and interacting more effectively]]]. Often in cases of vehicle theft in which the criminal target is in transit crossing different police force boundaries there is confusion as to which force is ultimately responsible. Furthermore, without effective cooperation it is difficult for different police forces to recognise patterns when crimes are committed in different policing authorities.
