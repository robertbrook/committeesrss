"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) \nrepresents\n 18,000 heads, principals, deputies, vice-principals, assistant heads, business managers and other senior staff of maintained and independent schools and colleges throughout the UK. ASCL has members in more than 90 per cent of secondary schools and colleges of all types, responsible for the education of more than four million young people. This places the association in a unique position to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the leaders of secondary schools and of colleges.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is welcome to note in paragraph13 that there is now a greater proportion of good or better schools than at any time since Ofsted began, particularly as the current inspection framework for schools is more demanding than it ever has been before. It is not clear, given that, why there is little or no discernible impact in outcomes produced by schools measured either by PISA (which was the same in 2009 and 2012) or GCSE, which was stable from 2012 to 2013. It would be helpful to probe why this might be the case. Is it, for example, a problem with what Ofsted is inspecting, or how, or is it a problem with the external metrics used for outcomes, such as PISA or GCSE?\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL members’ feedback on requires improvement (paragraphs18-22) points to two main issues. Firstly, generally the support in place for schools judged to require improvement has been of good quality, and monitoring (normally by an HMI) has been generally very helpful to the school in improving. It is too early to be certain what proportion of schools will improve to good within the target two year period. The second point is less positive. Many schools indicate that the requires improvement judgement has been damaging for them in terms of teacher recruitment and retention, student recruitment and stability in the local community, and reputation. In some cases headteachers have been summarily removed in the wake of a requires improvement judgement, without sufficient evidence that the headteacher lacked the capacity to effect the required improvements. This can further destabilize a school and deter potentially aspirant headteachers.\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, we welcome the explicit recognition now given to headteachers in schools ju\ndged to require improvement \nwhere leadership is \nnevertheless \njudged to be good.\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere a review of governance has been recommended as part of the requires improvement judgement, it is believed that weak governance may have been at the root of systemic weaknesses in leadership. There is little evidence in the report about \nhow effective the reviews of governance hav\ne been, \nor what level of take-up there has been for them. Indeed, paragraph\n \n82 indicates that there will be no detailed reporting on this until next year, which is disappointing given the prominence given, and presumably the expenditure committed, to this aspect of school improvement in the wake of inspection.\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the rise in the quality of teaching from last year (paragraph25). We also welcome the prominence given in paragraphs\n \n26-29 to the leadership of teaching in schools, and in the analysis of why teaching is sometimes less than good in paragraph\n \n37. However, it is with interest that we note the very strong guidance issued to inspectors in the Supplementary Guidance from January 2014 about the need for inspectors to judge teaching by its learning outcomes, not by whether the teaching conforms to certain accepted norms. It would be helpful to gain greater clarity about whether Ofsted has found that inspectors have, in fact, been overly focused on processes rather than outcomes when inspecting. If this is the case, what implications does it have for the validity of inspection data, and what possible implications does it have for the way in which Ofsted will develop their approach to inspection in the future so as to provide a reliable picture of schools’ effectiveness?\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is noteworthy how closely correlated inspections judgements for achievement and teaching are, with barely one percentage point different in proportions gaining each of the four judgements in these two areas. Given the strong emphasis on outcomes (achievement) in judging teaching, the question arises as to whether it is still helpful to separate out the judgements for teaching and achievement. Would it not make more sense for these to be a single judgement?\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the large proportion of academies in the secondary phase, it is right that the Ofsted Annual Report focuses on their achievements as evidenced through inspection (paragraphs\n \n43-50, and the graphs on pages 22-23). However, the focus of this section of the report is almost exclusively on the impact of sponsor-led academies, which constitute only 858 of 3484 academies in total, barely a quarter. Although the data presented on pages 33-34 indicate that academies are more successful by a wide margin in inspection than all schools, one wonders why, given that the process of large scale conversion, especially in the secondary sector, has been occurring since autumn 2010, we are told in paragraph\n \n46 that it is not until the current school year that the impact of conversion on the quality of education will be analysed in depth.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe report notes in paragraph\n \n57 that while sponsor-led academies are improving, they are still not performing at national averages. Understanding the context, it would be helpful to know what the evidence base is for the assurance in the same paragraph that the performance of such academies will improve over time, and whether, and when, it will reach or exceed national averages. It is unclear why sponsor-led academies have been omitted from the graph showing the gaps in performance of free school meal (FSM) pupils and all pupils on page 23: is the gap in performance as wide in sponsor led-academies as it is in converter academies, or, indeed, in all schools?\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe achievement data presented in figure 8, which shows the very large scale of the problem of the weak achievement of White British pupils on FSM, compared with all \nother groups, makes sobering reading. We are pleased that the report focuses on this problem. While we agree with the view expressed in paragraph\n \n52 that poverty must not be allowed to become a limiting factor in these young people’s achievement, we cannot agree with the view that it is \nonly\n a deficit in teachers’ or schools’ expectations which is a cause of the problem. While it is undeniably the case that there are examples to be found of such deficits in ambition, there are many other factors which must be considered. These would include wide discrepancies in funding between, for example, many inner city authorities on the one hand, and coastal and small town communities on the other, where many of these underachieving children live. The funding received by a child going to school in Hastings, for example, is less than half that allocated to a child going to school in Tower Hamlets. Paragraphs 71-73 and the geographical distribution of excellent and weak areas cited support this point. \n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMoreover, the recruitment of good, ambitious teachers and school leaders in coastal and some rural and small town communities is very challenging indeed. Our view is that in citing these other factors we are not making an excuse for poor performance of White British pupils on FSM, but rather highlighting the challenges which government and others face in addressing the problems. It is unfortunate that these points are not given any real consideration in the report.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 60, in analyzing the reasons for the relative underperformance of children with special educational needs, highlights deficiencies in the moderation of pupils’ work and a discontinuity between P levels and national curriculum levels. Paragraph 59 notes the poorer quality of performance information about pupils with special educational needs, including presumably those transferring from other settings into special schools. We fear that the imminent disappearance of standardized national curriculum levels, representing a commonly understood, if insufficiently used, language about achievement across all schools, will only exacerbate this weakness and risk further disadvantaging SEN pupils.\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraphs 83-95 focus on leadership. We are pleased that the importance of leadership in improving schools is given its due recognition. A number of questions arise from this section:\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 85 raises the question of intervention in and monitoring of declining schools, without making any distinction between local authority schools and academies. It would be useful to know whether Ofsted’s findings are that academies are more or less effectively monitored by the \nDfE\n than local authority schools are by their authorities;\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraphs 87-88 highlight the problems of weak leadership. \nN\not enough is being done at strategic level nationally to develop leadershi\np for the future in our schools; \nthe consequent leadership shortage will impact primarily on the lowest achieving schools and parts of the country first. In particular, the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) is in our view currently less effective than the scale of the potential problem demands.\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraphs 92-94 rightly highlight some of the difficulties in the distribution and effective deployment of national leaders of education (NLEs) and teaching schools. Paragraph 95 explicitly criticizes the absence of national strategic planning in the teaching school initiative (responsibility for which lies in part at least with NCTL), and it would be useful to know in more detail what evidence Ofsted has about the impact of this strategic deficit on school performance and children’s chances of receiving good education.\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is very little reference in the report to behaviour, other than the observations that poor behaviour characterizes, along with other weaknesses, less well achieving schools. Indeed, from the data on Ofsted’s website, behaviour is less often an issue than other weaknesses in such schools. In the period April to June 2013 about 1 in 7 English secondary schools was inspected, and 27% of these were rated outstanding for behaviour, against only 20% outstanding for leadership and only 12% outstanding overall. In this context, we must enquire what the evidence base is for the very extensive and, in our view, deeply damaging media and public briefing on the contribution of bad behaviour to failure in the school system. The evidence, either in the report or in the inspection data for the past school year, does not appear to support the idea that poor pupil behaviour is a significant cause of institutional failure. \n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe separate annual report on the further education (FE) and skills sector, covering in particular sixth form colleges (SFCs) and general FE colleges (GFEs) also describes a pleasing increase in the proportion of colleges being found to be outstanding and good, and a decrease in inadequate provision. Further, inspectors have noted an improvement in teaching and learning. This is welcome, as is the 71% of all providers judged to be good or outstanding at their last inspection – a 7% increase on the equivalent figure last year.\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA statement is made, for which little evidence is adduced in the report, that “\nthere is still too much provision that is not responsive to local employment needs. This provision is therefore inappropriate for young people, regardless of the qual\nity of teaching.” Apart from the obvious point that any inappropriate provision is too much, it is not clear how widespread is such provision, or how inspectors have arrived at such judgements. A reference is made to a case study, on page 18 of the FE and skills report, of the City of Bristol, where provision not aligned with the local enterprise partnership (LEP) priorities is deemed necessarily inappropriate. This assumes that the LEP must be correct, though many LEPs are relatively new and unproven organisations, and that its developmental priorities are intended to be exclusive of other provision, which is unlikely to be the case.\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe assumption is made in the statement quoted above (“therefore inappropriate”) that the only function of this sector is to prepare young people for local employment. But many students in colleges are in preparation for further study in higher education (HE), rather than for immediate employment, and some intend to enter a national labour market that may require them to have other skills and qualifications than those specified by local employers.\n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClearly, where courses are aimed at students intending to use them to obtain immediate local employment then they should be preparing students for vacancies that are likely to arise. Future vacancies have always been hard to predict, and it is to be hoped that the LEPs will be able to improve the labour market intelligence made available to colleges and other providers of such courses.\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe assertion is made that schools and colleges are not preparing young people sufficiently well for employment in general and apprenticeships in particular. This may be true but again little evidence is adduced to support it. That there were seven applicants for every apprenticeship vacancy in 2012/13 in fact suggests a rather different point – that there are too few apprenticeships available, which is an issue for employers and government to address rather more than for colleges or schools.\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regional reports are a helpful addition and strengthen the regions’ distinctive identities. However, we must again point out that some, though not all, aspects of the regional variation so apparent from these regional reports are impacted by factors which lie outside schools\n and colleges\n, such as funding or teacher recruitment. That is not to offer an excuse for poor achievement, and we recognize that the critical factor is a sense of empowerment and ownership by school \nand college \nleaders of the problem. However, translating that resolve to improve into actual improvements is made markedly easier if adequate funding is available and if it is possible to attract good teachers in good numbers. In some of our regions that is much more difficult than others.\n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is little information in the report about the inspection workforce. Paragraph 96 notes that a good proportion (51%) of section 5 school inspection teams now include one active or recently active school leader. Implicit here is a desire further to increase the numbers and proportions of serving school leaders engaged in inspection. However, in order to do so they must train. We have grave concerns about two aspects of this. Firstly, it is reported to us that the ISPs, the organisations (Tribal, Serco and \nCfBT\n) to whom inspection is contracted in England, do not have the capacity to train the numbers of inspectors required properly to refresh the inspection workforce. For example, Serco, one of the three contractors, reports that it is oversubscribed more than ten-fold for such training. \n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe laudable ambition of Ofsted to improve and refresh the inspection workforce is effectively being blocked by the inability of the contractors to rise to the challenge. Ofsted have responded by offering training to some school leaders (only NLEs, as far as we understand) provided directly by Ofsted. This is small in scale and insufficient to respond to the numbers needed, and it raises a question of fairness, as the contractors are charging much higher fees for inspector training than Ofsted directly, fees which are paid in most cases from school budgets (and therefore by the taxpayer). Moreover, we continue to receive reports that the quality of training provided by the ISPs is of variable quality, and sometimes is poor. Ofsted should in our view quality assure this (expensive) and important training for future inspectors more rigorously, and put in place ways to offer this training more widely and at a reasonable cost.\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, there is no data available on problems which have arisen with individual inspections. We know that a number of complaints are made every year, and that these are investigated. However, if the evidence and data on which the report is based are to be considered reliable, it is important for \nit \nto \nbe \nknow\nn\n how many inspection judgements were changed following challenges.\n&#xa0;\n27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI hope that this is of value to your consultation, ASCL is willing to be further consulted and to assist in any way that it can.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
