defaultThis paper describes the national strategy for surveillance of adverse events related to blood transfusion and the resulting improvements in patient safety. Blood transfusion is very safe and effective when used appropriately.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultQuestions about blood safety emerged following the appearance of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and discovery of its related virus (human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) in the 1980s.  Multiply transfused haemophilia patients treated with factor concentrates made from pooled plasma were noted
default in the late 1970s
default to develop hepatitis transmitted from these products. 
defaultThere was also concern that serious and potentially lethal errors (incompatible blood transfusions) were not reported.
default Therefore many countries decided to set up vigilance programmes. 
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe European Union
default published a series of Blood Safety Directives (2002-2005) which were transposed into the UK Blood Safety and Quality Regulations (BSQR) in 2005. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was appointed as the Competent Authority to implement the EU Safety Directives. The BSQR focus on serious adverse reactions and events which must be reported by law to the EU. 
defaultThe MHRA requires reporting of all serious reactions such as transfusion-transmitted infection or haemolysis, but also serious adverse events caused by a process failure in the quality management system in Blood Establishments and hospital transfusion laboratories regardless of whether the component was transfused, but the legislative remit extends only to the point where the transfusion laboratory reponsibility ends. Adverse events involving only clinical staff are not reportable under EU legislation but constitute the largest group of

default reports including avoidable or delayed transfusion, near miss events and mistakes with anti-D immunoglobulin administration to RhD negative women during and after pregnancy.

defaultHaemovigilance is defined (by the International Haemovigilance Network)  as surveillance procedures covering the whole transfusion chain, from collection of blood and its components to follow-up of recipients, intended to collect and assess info
defaultrmation on unexpected or undesir
defaultable effects resulting from the therapeutic use of labile blood products and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. 
default  Blood transfusion is a multistep process involving several different professional groups who need to work closely together (nursing staff, laboratory staff, medical staff, porters). The
default 
defaultUK
default national haemovigilance scheme, Serious Hazards of Transfusion (
defaultSHOT
default) was set up in 1996
default, prior to the introducion of the EU Directives, 
default and now has reported annually for 16 years
default (17

defaultSHOT
default collects and analyses information on transfusion reactions and adverse events from all healthcare organisations in the 
defaultUK
default that are involved in blood transfusion.  
defaultThis includes transfusion of red cells, plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelet concentrates.  
defaultSHOT
default works collaboratively with other bodies with responsibility for transfusion safety (e.g. the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the National Blood Transfusion Committee
default (set up in 2001)
default and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), the National Patient Safety Agency, and the Department of Health Blood Policy
default 
defaultUnit).
default  Reports required by the BSQR are submitted to the MHRA through their statutory SABRE online reporting system since 2005.  
defaultSHOT
default’s online reporting system shares a common portal – some events are only MHRA-reportable, others, particularly 
defaultmany 
defaultclinical 
defaultincidents
default may only be 
defaultSHOT
default–reportable and others require reporting to both schemes.  Reporters now enter demographic data once, and 
defaultSHOT
default and the MHRA are working towards a combined system.  The 
defaultSHOT
default Annual reports for 2011 and 2012 include a chapter describing the MHRA reports.  Meetings take place to reconcile the data (e.g.transfusion-related deaths, transfusion-transmitted infections).

defaultErrors continue to put patients at risk, particularly failure to adhere to basic procedures for identification of the correct patient at the time of blood sampling and at the time of transfusion. Errors make up more than half of all events reported to 
defaultSHOT
default.
default  Human errors 
defaultrelating to patient identification 
defaultcan be reduced by bar-code technology
default (recommended by 
defaultSHOT
default in
default 2009
default)
default to link patient identity to blood samples with a confirmation against the blood bag and wristband at the time of transfusion.  These methods have been demonstrated to reduce transfusion errors (evidence published from 
defaultOxford

defaultThe 
defaultSHOT
default haemovigilance scheme is an international field leader
default because it was one of the earliest, has detailed analysis and trending. T
defaulthe data 
defaultare
default widely used at international as well as national levels.  Many countries have developed haemovigilance schemes, particularly in 
defaultEurope
default, but the International Haemovigilance Network encourages all countries to set this up.  It is difficult to compare data between countries as data collection 
defaultand denominator data are variable
default.  
default27)
default&#xa0; 
defaultSHOT
default collects ‘near miss’ events where no harm came to the patient, but important lessons are learned from these observations. For example, for every wrong transfusion resulting from a wrong blood sample, there are about 100 ‘near miss’ events where the error was recognised
default before any transfusion took place,
default for example because the blood group previously recorded 
defaultfor the patient 
defaultwas different
default to the one associated with the current blood sample
default.
default28)
default&#xa0; 
defaultSHOT
default produces benchmarking data 
defaultannually 
defaultfor all participants
default,
default relating the number of reports to the 
defaultsize of the organisation as defined by the number of 
defaultblood components issued, and grouped geographically.  These show that the range
default of medians
default is 0.69 to 1.21 for the number of reports per 1000 components issued
default in the different sized organisations, with an overall range of 0 to 6.8
default reports
default. European and Canadian data are similar with 0.2 to 7.07 reports per 1000 units transfused or issued to hospitals.  A WHO Global Forum in November 2012 in association with the International Soiety of Blood Transfusion and the International Haemovigilance Network had representation from 46 countries. There is variable development of haemovigilance schemes hindered in many countries by lack of resources but also by a cultural fear of reporting adverse incidents.
