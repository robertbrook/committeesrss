[[[Safety]]]&#xa0;I have read in the Aberdeen Press and Journal newspaper that you are holding anenquiry into Helicopter Safety and wish to have evidence from pilots.  I fear that you are unlikely to get any frank response from currently serving pilots as they may feel that would jeopardize their position with their employer or the company with which their employers has contracts.  I have been retired long enough that I feel that I have no such restriction in my being able to give evidence.&#xa0;I trained as an Army pilot in 1972 and in 1977 started flying for British Airways Helicopters on the North Sea.  This was the time of the major expansion of the industry and when there was very little legislation or experience restricting operations.  I flew an SK61N helicopter from Sumburgh in Shetland for four years and also carried out SAR duties.  I move to Aberdeen in 1982 and transferred to flying an AS332L Super Pumas in 1984.  I was a Line Training Captain on the AS332L.  Concurrently with flying on the North Sea I also flew in The Army Air Corps TA Specialist Pool of pilots until 2001 finishing my service as a Major. For over twelve years I was the company representive, script writer and technical director responsible for making the passenger safetybriefmg videos and have therefore been closely involved with passenger safety.Although I did not hold a management position I was the project leader for many years in a number of areas relating to operational flying.&#xa0;I retired from the North Sea at the earliest pensionable age of 55 for three reasons. As well as feeling I should allow a younger person have the opportunity to fly I had become concerned about the operational standards and related safety issues follow the merger of CHC Scotia with Bond.  I was also increasingly concerned that the Oil Companies had an expectation that they could intervenein the safely related decisions required to carry out helicopter operations.&#xa0;After retirement from North Sea flying I flew freelance carrying out filming, videoing, power line patrolling, railway surveys, corporate work and similar tasks related to general helicopter aviation.&#xa0;As I have a son who flies in support of the Oil and Gas industry, and remain in contact with ex colleagues I remain aware of matters related to helicopter operations.&#xa0;If you think it appropriate I could give oral evidence covering any aspect that your committee may see as beneficial based on my experience.  In particular I feel the follow areas may be relevant.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I hope that I may be of assistance to your committee if necessary.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
