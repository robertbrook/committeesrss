[[[Habinteg]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Habinteg welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee’s inquiry into the ‘provision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system’. This response concentrates particularly on the implications of changes to support for housing costs for disabled people and, in particular, Habinteg tenants. We take into account changes as a result of the introduction of Universal Credit (UC) and other changes to housing support costs. We also respond to the committee’s request for information on the implications of the changes for housing providers, and for information on responses to the changes. As a housing provider, Habinteg presents information drawn from our own experience.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Habinteg is a housing association with more than 40 years’ experience providing homes and services to disabled and non-disabled tenants. &#xa0;2.1              Habinteg champions inclusion by working to:&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2              The social model of disability is crucial to every aspect of Habinteg’s work. We believe that people are disabled by barriers in society and negative public attitudes, rather than by their own impairments.&#xa0;2.3              Habinteg operates across more than 80 local authorities in England and Wales and manages over 3,300 homes. Of these more than 1,200 are designed for wheelchair users with the rest being designed to Lifetime Homes standards. Over 59 per cent of our tenants (April 2012) tell us that they define themselves as disabled people.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;To appreciate fully the impact of reductions in support for housing costs on disabled people it is important to understand the context in which these cuts are taking place. This particularly means the housing needs and housing-related costs of disabled people. &#xa0;3.1&#xa0; We draw attention to the following:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Habinteg believes that current changes to support for housing costs will further impoverish disabled people. In particular, they threaten to render important aspects of housing unaffordable. They will also place real strains on the ability of housing providers to meet the needs of disabled people.&#xa0;

[[[Bedroom ]]]

[[[Tax ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We firstly address the issue of the bedroom tax.&#xa0;4.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disabled people and bedroom tax&#xa0;The government’s own equality impact assessment of the spare room subsidy policy accepted that the majority of those affected by a cut to Housing Benefit via this route would be disabled people and that the average financial loss would be £14 a week across the total 660,000 people affected. The decision to continue on with this policy despite this evidence of disproportionate impact seems perverse. The ‘bedroom tax’ rule that Housing Benefit will be reduced by 14 per cent if a person is deemed to have one bedroom too many and by 25 per cent if two or more bedrooms has been subject to a number of challenges by disabled people. As a result, room space above the criteria can continue to be covered by Housing Benefit in certain circumstances, specifically where it can be demonstrated through medical evidence that disabled children require an additional bedroom or where a disabled person requires space for an overnight carer (but only where that person is not their spouse). This left disabled adults unable to share a room because of disability or who needed additional space still subject to the bedroom tax. Tribunal hearings in Scotland during September 2013, however, agreed with disabled adult claimants that their ‘spare’ rooms were too small to count as bedrooms and space was needed for reasons linked to impairment. Although these rulings do not constitute a legal precedent, they are important legal indications and point to the strong feeling that the bedroom tax is unworkable and unfair. &#xa0;4.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Impact on Habinteg tenants&#xa0;Habinteg has around 553 households in properties that will be subject to the under-occupancy rule. Of these, 240 are wheelchair standard properties. Therefore of all properties and tenants affected by the under-occupancy rule and who will experience a cut in housing support Habinteg estimates that 43 per cent are wheelchair accessible properties. This does not mean that only 43 per cent of those Habinteg tenants who will experience a financial loss are disabled people, as many people living in other properties will also be disabled people. However, it is important to identify the particular impact on those tenants in properties specifically designed for wheelchair users as such properties are in very short supply. As stated above, Habinteg tenants occupying wheelchair accessible properties have often waited several years before finding suitable accommodation. If tenants are forced to leave their current homes because they are unable to afford the rent, the prospect of finding small wheelchair accessible properties is limited.&#xa0;4.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Financial impact – arrears &#xa0;The impact of the bedroom tax on Habinteg tenants was felt quickly in the form of increased rent arrears. Overall Habinteg has a very good record in collecting rents and supporting tenants to keep arrears low. At the time of writing Habinteg is in the process of updating its data on arrears so can only give limited figures at present. On this basis we are able to identify an increase in arrears of £8,058 by those tenants identified as under-occupying under benefit rules in the four months between April and July 2012.&#xa0;4.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Habinteg’s response to the changes&#xa0;Habinteg does not agree with the bedroom tax. As a response to housing shortage it fails to recognise that alternative smaller properties are often simply not available, while treating tenants in receipt of Housing Benefit differently from other tenants. We are particularly concerned about the policy’s disproportionate impact on disabled people and introduction apparently without thought or understanding of why disabled people may need more space in their home. However, while making our concerns known – including by engagement with inquiries such as this – we are obliged to work with the policy. In this context, Habinteg, while lobbying against the policy, has taken a number of steps to help tenants faced with a cut in Housing Benefit as a result of the bedroom tax. This has included:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Outcome of responses&#xa0;The outcome of these steps is mixed. As identified above, arrears have risen and it is too early to be clear on the exact trend and how far rising arrears can be limited. At the time of writing Habinteg has been obliged to serve notice on 12 tenants in arrears purely attributable to the bedroom tax. We are very aware that many Habinteg tenants will be subject to the compound effect of multiple cuts to benefits, some still to come into effect, and the significance of lost income through the bedroom tax has to be understood in the context of these. &#xa0;With regard to exempt status, 516 of approximately 1200 Habinteg wheelchair accessible standard properties have so far been granted exempt status by local authorities. As this decision is made by individual local authorities, however, results vary, with households and properties in very similar positions being granted exempt status in one authority but denied in another. Some local authorities are only considering exemption in relation to under-occupation status, requiring further applications to be attempted for other circumstances when appropriate. This leaves households in an insecure position. &#xa0;With regard to DHP, as these applications are made by the tenant not the housing provider, we have less complete data on the outcomes. Again, however, we are aware of extreme variation in the result of applications. Tenants with very similar circumstances have been granted time limited DHP in one authority and refused in another. Research by Papworth Trust found that one in three disabled applicants were being refused DHP. DHP is also temporary and again this leaves households in an insecure position.&#xa0;4.1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Impact on Habinteg&#xa0;Habinteg’s survival – and its continued ability to provide and promote accessible housing – depends on its rental income. Rising arrears will present the organisation with unpalatable options: increasing rents for all tenants; evicting tenants (even those who may not previously have been in arrears and who try hard to pay their rent); accumulating debt and placing the organisation at unacceptable risk. Habinteg has had to allocate very significant resources to helping tenants understand and cope with the bedroom tax, and other changes to housing support. &#xa0;

[[[Service charges and Universal Credit]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Changes introduced under Universal Credit threaten to impact negatively on the independence, mobility and health of disabled people. &#xa0;4.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disabled people and service charges&#xa0;New guidance issued by the Department for Work and Pensions  renders service charges for maintenance of disability related aids and adaptations ineligible for repayment through UC. Ineligible service charges specifically include: ‘Installation, maintenance or repair of any special equipment or adaptations to the tenant’s accommodation in respect of disability or infirmity of tenants’. A service contract is essential to ensure that aids and adaptations (e.g. through-floor lifts, stairlifts, hoists, door openers, specialist baths) are kept in good working order and are safe to use. Removing service charges from repayment will have a very serious impact on many disabled people. It may make such equipment unaffordable and thereby severely limit mobility, independence within the home and ability to carry out carry out personal care and domestic tasks. As well as the potential financial implications, such changes may have both negative physical and psychological impacts.&#xa0;The guidance changes what has been the established practice whereby service charges were recouped under Housing Benefit. The DWP suggests that service charges can be funded through grant funding, such as Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs). However, many DFG grants do not include a maintenance element and even if such an element is included it is time limited, with the maximum period being five years in our experience. Even if an individual’s DFG included funding for that period, thereafter there would be no funding and responsibility would move to the individual. It must be remembered that research shows that current need for adaptations funding outstrips DFG funds by a ratio of about ten to one. Habinteg, like other housing associations, provides for servicing as part of risk management in order to ensure that equipment stays safe and thereby tenants and any carers or assistants are safe in operating equipment. &#xa0;4.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Impact on Habinteg tenants&#xa0;UC has yet to be rolled out, and these changes to the funding of service charges will impact on Habinteg tenants piecemeal if/when they transfer to UC. What we know at the moment is that Habinteg currently has 1427 properties subject to service charges for relevant equipment. It is not uncommon for properties to have multiple items. The service charges range from 55p per week to £31.33 per week. These charges cover such things as periodic health and safety testing and servicing, some of which is mandatory, and insurance cover. It does not include minor adaptations work and general responsive maintenance, which are covered by rent. It is easy to see from this range of charges that if funding is removed and tenants have to find money to pay, arrears could rise rapidly. Tenants might decide to go without adaptations, ask for adaptations to be removed, or try to risk not maintaining equipment. All these options pose tenants with risk and limits to their independence, safety and health.&#xa0;4.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Financial impact &#xa0;The total annual amount due to Habinteg of service charges is £223,000 plus 15 per cent on-cost. From this it is clear that if UC removes the service charges’ funding that was available under Housing Benefit there is a major threat to housing providers as well as disabled people. The impact on Habinteg stands out quite dramatically as our housing is delivered on a mainstream model, with disabled and non-disabled tenants living independently in our housing. At the same time, because our homes are accessible and there is a dire shortage of accessible housing, a large proportion of our tenants are disabled. Due to this it is possible to see clearly the impact of this change on disabled people, and the impact on housing providers.&#xa0;4.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Habinteg’s response to the changes&#xa0;Habinteg has strongly argued against the new guidance, engaging with the consultation in January 2013, meeting with DWP officials and liaising with others in the sector. We have devoted significant resources to clarifying our exact financial information and discussions are on-going on handling the impact of this retrograde step, should it proceed. &#xa0;We have also taken some early awareness raising steps about this sensitive and difficult issue. The change was raised at Habinteg’s National Tenant Forum and at the organisation’s Homes and Services Committee, which has tenant representation. Information has featured in publications to tenants.&#xa0;Habinteg is strongly opposed to limiting benefits that are essential for maintaining vital aids and adaptations. As already outlined, these aids support the independence of disabled people. In the process they secure cost-effective alternatives to expensive residential care. &#xa0;

[[[Habinteg strongly urges the Work and Pensions Committee to do all it can to raise awareness of this change, its likely impact on the independence and choice of disabled people, and request ministers to reconsider.  ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4.3 Direct payment of housing costs to]]]

[[[ tenants]]]&#xa0;The direct payment of housing costs to tenants has raised concerns among housing organisations, domestic abuse organisations and disability organisations, among others, about the potential for exploitation, victimisation and increased debt. Habinteg shares these concerns and is taking efforts to support tenants and to try to limit the growth of arrears. &#xa0;4.3.1 Habinteg asked those tenants in receipt of Housing Benefit how they would prefer to receive it – direct to them or to Habinteg. From this, 83 per cent said they would like payments to continue to be made to Habinteg, with only 8 per cent choosing payment to them. &#xa0;4.3.3 While we have major concerns about the impact of direct payments in increasing debt, triggering evictions and escalating individual and household problems, we have worked hard to ensure that tenants are supported in advance of the changes. Habinteg has been:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4.4]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Localised Council Tax Support]]]&#xa0;Localisation of Council Tax Support will create a postcode lottery. Instead of standard criteria that apply across the UK, it will mean that a person with a particular set of circumstances will be considered too poor to pay Council Tax in one area but well-off enough in another area. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2.4 million low-income families will pay on average £138 more in council tax in the year 2013/14.              4.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Impact on Habinteg tenants&#xa0;Habinteg has partial information collected from visits to and contact with tenants, but does not yet have comprehensive data on the impact of localisation of council tax support. We are concerned that localisation, alongside a 10 per cent cut in funding from central government to local authorities, will mean that many people who previously received support will not do so and that this will cause hardship. We estimate that many tenants who previously had support will have to find between £3 and £6 a week for Council Tax. Again, this change will take place alongside other reductions in income due to benefit cuts and restrictions in eligibility. &#xa0;4.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Financial impact &#xa0;It will be some time before we can aggregate data and calculate the impact of this particular cut on Habinteg in the form of arrears etc.&#xa0;4.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Habinteg’s response&#xa0;As with other changes, Habinteg has embarked on a programme of awareness raising combined with practical support.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The impact of changes to housing support outlined here represent intensified hardship and inequality for disabled people in particular. Habinteg is concerned about the impact on all its tenants in receipt of benefit, but wish to draw the Committee’s attention to the added impact that policies such as the bedroom tax and the cuts to funding of service charges for disability adaptations will have on the lives of disabled people.&#xa0;5.1              Habinteg would be happy to discuss these matters further with the Committee and hopes that the information provided is useful. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;26 September 2013&#xa0; http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-facts-and-figures.php#gd http://www.pssru.ac.uk/pdf/rs035.pdf https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/publications/working-papers/iser/2012-09.pdf http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-facts-and-figures.php#imp Department for Education (DfE), 2010, Children with Special Educational Needs 2010: An analysis, Department for Education.
