"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Electrical Contractors’ Association (BRC 69)&#xa0;The Electrical Contractors’ Association \n(ECA) \nwelcomes the opportunity to respond to the Select Committee’s call for evidence.\n&#xa0;\nThe ECA \nsupports the comments made in the submission by Certsure. However, n\notwithstanding the ECA’s role in Certsure,\n we felt i\nt important to make our own standalone response given our role \nas a trade association \nin representing the views of our 2,800 member\ns\n, \nthe broad scope of the Committee’s questions, and by dint of our experience in seeking to \nenhance\n \nsafety and the quality o\nf work \nundertaken in the domestic market.\n&#xa0;\nSummary of key ECA points&#xa0;\nAbout the ECA&#xa0;\nT\nhe Electrical Contractors’ Association is the UK’s largest trade association representing electrical engineering and contracting companies. \nOur members\n range from local electricians to national companies with several branches employing thousands. ECA members\n operate in the commercial and industrial sectors, as well as the domestic market. As\n \nsuch, they \ncarry out a wide range of work from domestic heating\n and lighting to installing cutting edge, environmental control technology on major projects and buildings such as Heathrow terminal 5 and the London 2012 Olympic Park.\n Most of the large contractors in the UK are members however, t\nhe bulk of ECA members ar\ne small to medium-sized contractors.\n&#xa0;\nOur competent person scheme activities are now carried out through Certsure.\n&#xa0;\nSince its formation in 1901, the ECA has championed safety, quality and standards within the electrical contracting industry. This included\n \nin 1923\n, for instance, establishing a Guarantee of Work scheme to underwrite the work of its members as a guarantee to their customers, and in 1968, forming the Joint Industry Board with (now) Unite the Union to create a card to identify ski\nlled operatives\n for the benefit\n o\nf employers/consumers (which is required for those working in\n the commercial and industrial\n sector\ns\n). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe public as a whole are not generally aw\nare of the structure by which \nelectrical \ncontractors are assessed a\ns\n competent. However, we note that among those who understand the ne\ned to use a competent contractor, there is strong brand awareness of the NICEIC brand\n in particular\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe believe that the issue is wider – we need to educate the public around the dangers of electrical DIY\n and rogue traders, as well as leaving\n any domestic electrical jobs to a registered \nprofessional, so that they are \nalways \nencouraged to seek a registered contractor in the first place. We need to do more work \nto understand \nhow\n \nhomeowners source contractors. \nIn the majority of cases, this is li\nkely to be via a personal recommendation that is not based on whether an electrician has been assessed as competent. Of the small number\n (10\n%) \nof domestic cust\nomers that do search the web\n, they may often do so\n through one of the number of unregulated sites\n that offer lists of traders that have not necessarily been assessed as competent.\n&#xa0;\nI\nt was our intention as the in\ndustry\n trade b\nody, working with the industry\n charity\n,\n to establish a \nthird-party \ncertification \nscheme\n operator\n \nin Certsure \n(replacing NICEIC, \nELECSA and ECA Certification\n schemes\n) \nthat could\n,\n \nthrough a single brand – covering 80% of contractors doing 90% of the work –\nfund \nbetter resourced \ncampaigns aimed at promoting the importance of finding a registered electrician\n.\n \nIndeed, the ECA and the Ele\nctrical Safety Council \nhave \ncommitted to surpluses going towards such awareness-raising \nactivities.\n&#xa0;\nAs is covered in more depth later in the submission, \nCertsure’s recent agreement with\n \nNapit \nto seek to develop one mark, underpinned by a register of elect\nricians \nregistered as competent\n, \nwill help in this regard.\n \nIndeed, w\nith the public more likely to recognise, understand and act on the basis of a \nthird-party \ncertification \nbrand – as opposed to\n taking notice of\n the comp\netent person scheme structure or\n the Building Regulations – we ar\ne confident of driving up electrical safety awareness\n \naround the new mark.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPart P of the Building Regulations, through the compete\nnt person scheme operators, tests companies\n ability to ensure that safe electrical work is undertaken\n. As part of \nthis, it assesses \nthe\n training and experience of the key individual or individuals\n (\nknow\nn as \nQS\ns)\n with\nin a \nfirm \nlegally \nresponsible for signing off on electrical work\n in the domestic environment.\n \nQSs are assessed in their own right and are also responsible\n for the competences of others they \noversee.\n This\n assessment process is \nsufficiently robust\n and \nindividuals need to be able to carry out\n and manage\n electrical\n work\n safe\nl\ny and correctly in order to pass.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst qualifications designed for \nindividuals\n to\n enter the domestic industry have\n existed for decades, the introduction of Part P has brought about an auditable trail for over 40,000 registered c\nontract\ning firms\n across all schemes. \nRegistration with Certsure, for instance, confirms that QSs\n hold the minimum qualifications and have been assessed as competent to undertake safe electrical work.\n&#xa0;\nWhen Part P was implemented, it allowed companies to obtain Part P status without \nthe individual responsible for signing off on work\n being required to h\nold\n a qualification.\n Concerned \nab\nout the implications for consumer safety and standards in the industry, the ECA sought to change this.\nThe ECA, along \nwith \nother competent person scheme operators, and the DCLG, sit on the Electrotechnical Assessment \nSpecif\nication \nCommittee, which sets the standards\n \nfor \nQSs\n in the domestic sector. \n(\nThe industry’s professional body, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, acts as the Secretariat.\n)\n \nThrough the EAS Committee, t\nhe ECA has played a leading role in the adop\ntion of higher minimum standards for QS\ns\n, \nwhich came into force in \nApril 201\n3\n \nfor\n new\n entrants and those moving jobs\n. \nThis has ensured\n that partly trained operatives \nhave\n cost effective routes to upskill to the current standard \nand gain a Level 3 qualifica\ntion\n.\n \nWe believe that \nover time \nthe\nse\n changes will allow us to raise standards in the industry \nby increasing the numbers of operatives to acquire formal Level 3 qualifications\n. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition, we have also established a progression route for domestic electri\ncians to be able to upskill to move into carrying out work in the commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) sectors. \nIt should be noted that d\nifferent entry standards exist depending on whether someone is working in the domestic, or \nC&amp;I sectors\n. In the C&amp;I sector\ns\n, \nwhere work can be of a greater complexity, \nall \noperatives \nhave to acquire a\nn (ECS)\n \nskills-card \nequivalent to Level 3 \nwhich allows them to work.\n Indeed, in our role of promoting standards, the ECA actually encourages domestic QSs to hold an ECS skills-card\n,\n whic\nh clearly shows an individual’s qualifications and \ndemonstrates their \nlicence to practise\n.\n \nWe\n would support \nthe \nadoption of this model \n(\nwhich already exists and is highly valued and endorsed by the industry and Unite the Union\n)\n as a requirement \nfor QS\ns in the domestic sector.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe assessment process is thorough \nand we do not believe it is possible for a contractor to pass the assessment if it cannot demonstrate how to carry out electrical work safely.\n&#xa0;\nIn terms of the process of reviewing the performance of contractors, t\nhe\n Part P \ncompetent person \nscheme\n \nassessmen\nt \nrequire\ns\n that an adequate sample of work is taken to represent the activities of the contractor. \nRe-a\nssessment is conducted annually through questioning and observation. \n \nA f\neature of the assessment is that the work is randomly checked\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThese a\nssessment\ns are conducted by assessors who are themselves required to have achieved a level of competence in excess of that which they are required to assess. The competence of assessors is reviewed annually \nby the\n \nUK\n \nA\nccreditation \nS\nervice\n and a regime of CPD is req\nuired to maintain their effectiveness and the consistency of all assessments\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is important that the certification regime reflects the range of competencies found across the domestic electrical labour force, and that it can ensure that works carried \nout \nunder the scope of Part P comply with the Wiring Regulations – which governs all electrical work.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAfter \na \nn\notifiable\n \njob \nis carried out by a registered contractor, the contractor will \nnotify the\n scheme operator \nwhich works have taken place via an online tool. This information is sent to the local authority for where the \njob\n was carried out, with the scheme operator also send\ning a certificate to the homeowner confirming who did the work\ns\n and that the work\ns\n compl\ny\n with the Building Regulations.\n&#xa0;\nAs noted earlier, a typical sample of the work that contractors perform is assessed on an annual basis. \nE\nxperienced\n,\n \nUKAS-assessed \nasse\nssors will conduct random inspections of this sample of work. They will check the work carried out and seek the correct justification for why the work was undertaken in the way that it was. As such, the assessment does not just \ncheck whether work has been\n \ncarried out correctly in\n these instances, but probes whether the contractor still maintains the methodological basis for working safely and correctly.\n&#xa0;\nI\nt is \nalso \ncritical to assess companies\n’\n ability to\n manage work, as well as test their\n staff who are\n qual\nified \nto sign off on work\n,\n as we know that either in isolation is not sufficient.  \n&#xa0;\nFrom Certsure’s operations, we note that approximately 20% of assessments either fail the contractor or recommend corrections that must \nbe \nadopt\ned in the contractor’s\n way o\nf working. \n Common p\nroblems found through inspections are used to inform the production of advisory and training materials to create a virtuous cycle of safety improvement.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is important to note that in the majority of cases, domestic consumers choose an electrician on the basis of a personal recommendation (who may or may not be \ncertified as competent). Of the small majority\n (\n10\n%) \nthat choose to find an electrician via the internet, they may do so from a variety of websites, many of which, such\n as\n \nCheckatrade and Rated People\n (which are recommendation-based), are not \nregistered under the DCLG’s competent person scheme\n.\n Indeed, we understand that Which? will also be\n launching a similar register. \n&#xa0;\nMany of these online registers belong to organisations that are not licensed by the DCLG, and some of which do not qualify th\neir listed tradespeople based on technical assessment or competence.\n Of the current \nseven entities \nthat are \nlicensed to operate electrical schemes\n by the DCLG – including both registers currently operated by Certsure and NAPIT – the public can be \nsure that\n the contractor\ns listed under these are\n assessed as competent.\n&#xa0;\nDespite this, \nwe appreciate\n there have recently been concerns expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consumers \nwith \nmore than one register that references electrical firms registere\nd under Part P of the Building Regulations. In order to overcome these concerns, a meeting \nwas recently held between\n \nCertsure and Napit\n \nwhere it was agreed\n \nthat they would \nseek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of a\nll full scope Part P registered electricians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electrician to do\n electrical work in their home.\nIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P Scheme O\nperators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline.\n&#xa0;\nNotwithstanding this development, we wish to explore the effect competition has had between competent person scheme operators\n to date\n. Indeed, w\ne believe that \nc\nompetition has\n had\n some benefits for the electrician and homeowner. \nS\ncheme operato\nrs \ncompete\n to offer\n \nlow \nprice\ns to contractors\n. This includes \nthe cost of annual scheme registration paid by contractor\ns and the cost per notification\n. \nWe note that \nCertsure’\ns \nannual registration fee \npaid by contractors \nis £370, with a notification fee of between £1.50 and £3.00 per job depending on whether a contractor \nis on a scheme which offers an\n insurance-backed guarantee option. \n(All ECA members are covered under the ECA\n Guarantee of Work Scheme).\n \nThis certainly compares very favourably to what some local authorities may charge to approve\n work\n, as we\nll as saving\n the contractor time\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe creation of Certsure has also allowed \npromotion of the competent person scheme \nto\n a level that Governm\nent may not have wanted to fund. This has happened\n as \na \nresult of the DCLG encouraging a competitive market in third-party certification.\n&#xa0;\nIndeed, we note that the Select Committee itself \nhas \nrecognised the benefits of the \nself-certification model, which has been run through a competitive competent person scheme framework. It was noted in the March 2012 report on the Building Regulations applying to gas and electricity that contractors save on time, effort and money, consume\nrs have a point of redress, and rogue traders are not able to satisfy the scheme operators to be able to self-certify work.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe D\nCLG supervises the \naccreditation \nschemes\n (includes other\n trades as well as electrical)\n. \nIt was stated\n in June 2012 that full compliance with \nUKAS accreditation \nwill be a \nrequirement \nfor DCLG-scheme operators \nfr\no\nm 12 June 2014.\n However for the electrotechnical scheme (Part P)\n, it\n \nis already a requirement and b\not\nh ELECSA and NICEIC achieved their accreditation in 2002 and in 2008 respectively. \n \n&#xa0;\nUKAS accreditation requires a tough assessment to ensure that the certification body has robust systems and processes in place to demonstrate how it \nsatisfies the followin\ng requirements\n:\n&#xa0;\n(\nThe above-mentioned\n DCLG authorisation criteria \n \neffective from June 2012 for f\null compliance by 12 June 2014 \nrequires all scheme operators to be accredited by \nUKAS against EN45011 for product certification. DCLG should\n, in the ECA’s view,\n stick to this requirement, as this demonstrates the confidence that UKAS has, through assessment and accreditation, of the various schemes.\n)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
