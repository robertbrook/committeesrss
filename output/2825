[normal]CASE [bold]STUDY: Undocumented young person S[bold]S approached 
[normal]The Children’s Society
[normal] in the summer of 2012 when she was 18 years old. S was sent to the UK as a 6 year old, to join her father. S’s father returned to his home country when she was 14; she did not have any 
[normal]legal immigration status. Since then, S has been living with a friend and her family. She approached social services as a 17 year old ‘child in need’ but they wrongly refused to support her on account of her immigration status. At the point of referral, S 
[normal]was sleeping on her friend’s living room floor, had no financial support and was unable to attend university due to her status. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IMPACT: 
[normal]As this issue arose prior to the implementation of the changes under LASPO, non-asylum immigration cases were still wi
[normal]thin the scope of legal aid. We were able to refer S a reputable legal aid firm. The solicitor applied for leave to remain based on the immigration rules and Article 8 right to family and private life grounds. With the support of a welfare solicitor, we su
[normal]ccessfully challenged the local authority’s refusal to support her, when she was a minor arguing that they failed in their duty to uphold the Children Act 1989. S now receives housing and monetary support as a care leaver.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With changes under LASPO and th
[normal]e residence test, S would not have been able to access legal aid with either her immigration application or her support claim.

[normal]CASE STUDY: Destitute young person from Iran who was ‘appeal rights exhausted’[bold] [bold]Peter
[normal] is a young Kurd who came to the UK alone from Iran to seek protection. But the Home Office rejected his asylum claim before his 18
[normal]th
[normal]birthday and six months later social services stopped his support and told him to go back to I
[normal]ran
[normal]. They called the police, 
[normal]who went to his house and broke down the door while he was not at home. They called him and told him to come to the police station. He was told that he could not go back to his house. 
[normal]He was made homeless for nine months. During this time he slept on buse
[normal]s, stayed with friends and sometimes in a mosque. He was not able to eat every day. Sometimes he ate only once or not at all. He stayed in unsafe places and regularly experienced violence and abuse on the streets. When he was homeless he had a headache eve
[normal]ry day and was coughing a lot. He tried to commit suicide more than once.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite The Children’s Society’s advocacy the local authority would not 
[normal]rehouse
[normal] him so we supported him to get a legal aid lawyer to challenge the local authority. Following this ch
[normal]allenge the local authority agreed to 
[normal]rehouse
[normal] Peter. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IMPACT: The residence test would mean that, as Peter was ‘appeal rights exhausted’, when the local authority made him homeless he would not be able to challenge this decision. As an Iranian national th
[normal]ere is no lawful way for him to get documentation in the UK, as there is no Iranian embassy in the UK, and Peter is not able to return to Iran. So he would be left homeless and would be at risk from others and at risk of harming himself.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I don’t find the National Referral Mechanism process particularly helpful right now just because a lot of the NRMs I am completing are coming back as negative results, because they are saying that the exploitation element ca
[normal]n’t be proved. So although you can prove that the young person has come in to the UK illegally through what you call ‘agents’ or ‘traffickers’ ...and they have been exploited on the journey, either sexually exploited or physically beaten, money taken off t
[normal]hem, so on and so on, you can’t prove the exploitation element once they are in the UK very easily – so for that reason they are coming back negative which is very frustrating, because you know, or you certainly suspect, that exploitation is occurring”

[normal]Young asylum seekers and refugees with status[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: The government should abandon the proposals to introduce a residence test because despite 
[normal]the government’s listed exemptions, the test will leave thousands of vulnerable children and young people out of scope from the vital support provided by legal aid.
[normal] This is vital in ensuring that children, young people and families, who will have no other 
[normal]means of paying for legal support, are able to access justice.
