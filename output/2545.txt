[[[Examples, research and litigation]]]Whether or not an asylum seeker as a determinant of legal aid &#xa0;

[[[Case study:]]] Mr A was assisted by a legal aid solicitor in making his application for support as well as his asylum claim. The Home Office had refused his application for support on the basis that they did not believe he had ever claimed asylum in the UK. His case was complicated because he had initially come to the UK through a third country to which he had been removed in 2006. But he had returned to the UK at some point and claimed asylum. Although the Home Office disputed this, he was able to show he had been interviewed by the Home Office and had yet to receive a decision on his claim. The Tribunal judge found that he was an asylum seeker and he was granted support. 

[[[Case study: ]]]Mr H had submitted further submissions to the Home Office following the refusal of his asylum claim. The Home Office rejected these saying they did not amount to a fresh claim for asylum. His solicitors then issued a Judicial Review which was settled by Consent Order. The Order made it clear that the Home Office had agreed to reconsider his fresh claim as an asylum claim. However, when he applied for support his application was refused on the basis that he was not an asylum seeker as his further submissions were still pending. It emerged in his support appeal that the Home Office caseworker had interpreted the Consent Order to mean that they were merely going to reconsider the further submissions, not that they had agreed they amounted to a new asylum claim. He won his appeal for support. 

[[[Case study]]]: Mr B’s application had been refused on the grounds that it was not believed he had an outstanding case.  However, he had recently obtained permission to have his case considered by the Court of Appeal following the Home Office’s refusal of his fresh claim. He had been released from immigration detention but shortly after was admitted to a psychiatric ward as he suffered from serious mental health problems. He was thought to be at risk of suicide and suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He was sleeping in parks at the time of his support appeal. He won his appeal and was given support. &#xa0;Connection to the UK as a determinant of legal aid&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case study: ]]]Ms B arrived in the UK 14 years ago and claimed asylum. In 2009 she submitted a fresh claim to the Home Office which was still outstanding when we met her. Given the delay in considering her fresh claim, she had been granted permission to work and had taken up a job as a care worker, paying taxes in the UK. In June 2012 following a change in policy the Home Office restricted the work she could do to the shortage occupation list. She lost her job. As she was not qualified to carry out any of the jobs on the occupation list she has not been able to work since then and is now in receipt of asylum support.  &#xa0;

[[[Case study:]]] Mr M has been in the UK for 12 years. He now has two young children who are settled in the UK, one of whom is British. Although he does not live with his children he has regular contact with them and takes an active role in their upbringing. When we met him he was in the process of preparing a further application to the Home Office on the basis of this established family life.Need for legal aid generally for our clients&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Cases we referred for litigation in 2012&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case study: ]]]The particular difficulties these individuals will experience when trying to leave the UK is highlighted by the case of Mr A, who is a Bidoon from Kuwait.   In common with many Kuwaiti Bidoons, Mr A and his family had lived Kuwait for many years but never acquired Kuwaiti citizenship.   Whilst in UK he had approached the Kuwaiti embassy several times to try and obtain documents to return but these were refused on the basis that he was not a national of Kuwait.  Following a decision by the Tribunal to refuse him support on the basis that he was not taking enough steps to return, we referred his case to a solicitor.   During the process of the judicial review, the Treasury Solicitor settled and agreed to grant him support and to backdate this to the day of his appeal hearing.  

[[[Case Study: ]]]This is illustrated by the case of Mr B who, following a successful appeal, was offered accommodation in Wales.   However, his partner and two young children were housed in London which would have severely limited the contact he could have with them.   The solicitors issued a letter before claim, pointing out Home Office’s duties to promote the welfare of children and also their obligations to preserve family life as far as possible.  Following the letter, UKBA agreed to house Mr B close to his family in London thus ensuring he had sufficient contact with his partner and children.

JR successful, and confirmed by the Court of AppealYesR (SSHD) v Chief ASA (Manzana not represented)&#xa0;[2003] EWHC 269SSHD challenging ASA decision on significant, but technical, procedural issue. JR successfulYesR (Rasul) v ASA and SSHD&#xa0;[2006] EWHC 435Failed asylum-seeker had been receiving s4 support on basis of no safe route of return to his home town of Kirkuk, Iraq.  SSHD then decided there was a safe route, so he no longer qualified under (c) and instead needed to show he was taking all reasonable steps (a).  Issue was whether the Tribunal could consider for itself issue of whether safe route of return, or, alternatively, allow appeal if SSHD’s opinion (that is safe) is unlawful on Wednesbury grounds.  ASA and SSHD both took view that the ASA did not have the jurisdiction to look behind the SSHD’s opinion, and were found to be right. Para 26 as to the ‘availability of judicial review in which the correctness in public law terms of the holding by the S of S of a particular opinion may be tested’ precludes the ASA having to do this. But clarified that ASA can substitute its view regarding (a).  Secondary issue as to whether a route of return is safe can be considered under (a), this was left open, but otherwise the JR failed. &#xa0;NoR (SSHD) v ASA (Osman and 3 others as interested parties)&#xa0;[2006] EWHC 1248SSHD challenging 4 decisions on test under Reg3(2)(b) – whether failed asylum seeker ‘unable to travel’- which it viewed as overly generous, and regs misconstrued.   JR successful, but test set out not totally unfavourable to asylum seekersNo R (SSHD) v ASA (Malaj as interested party not represented)&#xa0;[2006] EWHC 3059SSHD challenging ASA’s jurisdiction on procedural point, JR failedNo R (Ahmed) v ASA and SSHD&#xa0;[2008] EWHC 2282Iraqi safe route of return, can s4 support continue under (a) or (e).

[[[Table showing judicial review cases relevant to asylum support  ]]]Date and Name Issue and resultMigrant eligible post residence test?&#xa0;R( Westminster CC) v NASS&#xa0;[2002] 5 CCLR 511As to whether asylum seekers in need of ‘care and attention’ should be supported by the local authority (s21) or NASS (s95).Answer is the latterN/A as both sides public bodies, but clearly a considerable amount of public money spent on lawyers for both sides&#xa0;&#xa0;R (Anufrijeva) v SSHD&#xa0;[2003] UKHL 36For the purposes of support, an asylum claim is not determined until the individual has been notified by the Home Office&#xa0;No – subject matter of proceedingsR (Nigatu) v SSHD&#xa0;[2004] EWHC 1806Issue of what counts as fresh claim so as to trigger entitlement to support (so crucial to the proposals as the same ‘threshold’ is being used to decide entitlement to legal aid, 3.58). By time of full hearing of JR took place, the SSHD had accepted it as a fresh claim but Mr Justice Collins decided issue of importance so should proceed.  N had attempted to apply for support, but NASS refused it although they acknowledged that the HO had received his fresh claim (applications for s4 support prior to 2005 did not lead to an appeal and so JR was the only remedy here).  Judgment quotes Bingham in CA in Onibiyo 1996 on why the Refugee Convention must allow for fresh claims, and what test should be to qualify as one (new material etc) and that if it is a fresh claim, then there must be a right of appeal. And that JR is the correct remedy to use to compel the SSHD, if he errs, to accept it as a fresh claim. But therefore making a fresh claim and it being accepted as one are 2 separate stages, and only the latter triggers entitlement to s95 support&#xa0;Unclear&#xa0;Case contains essential guidance to both sides on when a ‘fresh claim’ is made, and therefore when asylum support (s95 or s4) becomes available.&#xa0;Although there will now be legal aid to make a fresh claim, it is unclear as to whether there will be legal aid for the same asylum seeker for an asylum support law case R (Erdogan) v SSHD&#xa0;[2004] EWCA Civ 1087&#xa0;On issue of when an asylum-seeker fails to appeal an asylum refusal in time, and instead submits an out of time appeal, and whether remains entitled to s95 support. The CA allowed the SSHD’s appeal.  Useful guidance on purpose of the asylum support system, and mechanisms to prevent it being abused (para 19), and also on the importance of the ‘supervisory role of the court in judicial review to give protection where necessary’ (para 20)&#xa0;Unclear, as aboveR (Limbuela, Tesema and Adam) v SSHDShelter as intervener&#xa0;[2006] UKHL 66IAA 1999 s55 preventing asylum support from those who did not claim on arrival.  All 5 law lords dismissed the SSHD’s appeal, and confirmed that this was a breach or Art 3. The SSHD had also lost at the High Court stageYes&#xa0;

[[[BUT]]] the implication of 3.57 is that they will lose legal aid if they are refused asylum, even for an ongoing case.  Therefore this test case would never have reached the lords. (Limbuela became a failed  asylum seeker, Tesema and Adam  became refugees so query whether legal aid would have continued for those two, as a test case)&#xa0;R (AW,A,Y) v Croydon, HackneySSHD as interested  party      &#xa0;[2007] EWCA Civ 266Same issue as NASS v Westminster but here it concerned failed asylum seekers so was between s21 and s4.  SSHD intervened on the side of the asylum seekers to argue it should be s21.  Lengthy technical judgment on the statutes and regulations which refers to the ‘elaborate paper chase through these interlocking provisions’ and ‘important area of law….in a difficult and sensitive field’&#xa0;NoR (M) v Slough BC &#xa0;[2008] UKHL 52Being HIV positive, and needing medication, did not mean M was in need of ‘care and attention’ under NAA s21.Not clear.  Judgment refers to proceedings related to his article 3 claim as ‘still continuing’&#xa0;Birmingham v ClueSSHD as interested partyShelter as intervener&#xa0;[2010] EWCA Civ 460Jamaican overstayer, by time of CA hearing she had been given ILR but case continued.  Established that if family has an outstanding Art 8 claim which is not ‘hopeless and abusive’ and they are destitute, local authority should support under the Children Act s17 pending determination of claim.  Issue for Birmingham was whether withholding assistance would cause ECHR breach (on facts of this case would). Birmingham’s appeal dismissed.  Case concludes with LJ Dyson ‘it is right that I should record the steps that the Sec of State has agreed to take to mitigate the problems that have been exposed by cases such as the present’.No&#xa0;Client had strong outstanding immigration case (fitted within DP 5/96 policy)&#xa0;Important guidelines set out for local authorities and SSHD in these type of cases (ie non-asylum seeking families) and how to liaise better so as to resolve them more quickly.   Attention of the Court of Appeal on issues clearly benefited the UKBA and local authorities, as UKBA decided to prioritise these cases, as they are not entitled to asylum support&#xa0;R (ZO Somalia) SSHD&#xa0;[2010] UKSC 36On whether a failed asylum seeker who has been waiting more than a year for the Home Office to consider their further submissions is entitled to work, under the EU Reception Directive&#xa0;unclearR (SO) v LB Barking and DagenhamSSHD interested partyThe Children’s Society&#xa0;[2010] EWCA Civ 1101On whether local authorities or the Home Office should support asylum seeking care leavers after they turn 18.  SSHD arguing on the same side as the asylum seeker and the Children’s Society against the local authority.

There is no similar provision regarding s4.&#xa0;Case proceeded regarding K only.Although the SSHD supported K at this hearing (ie that she should be supported under the CA), K had previously applied for s4 support, been refused and lost her appeal to the FTT(AS).
