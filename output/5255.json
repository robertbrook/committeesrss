"&#xa0;\nFurther written evidence from Sanjeev \nAppicharla\n (CYS0118)\n&#xa0;\nThe \nAdditional \nWritten Evidence is a \nS\nubmission by the author in \npersona\nl capacity. \n&#xa0;\nThe\n ai\nm of the S\nubm\nission is to inform the decision making process of the Chair and Members of Transport Select Committee by \ndrawing their attention to \nreview and analyse \nthe \ntragic \nevent of a \ncyclist death at Motts Lane level crossing, Witham, Essex on 24 Jan 2013. \n&#xa0;\nThe in\nput data for the review and analysis is gained from the RAIB Investigation Report dated 01/2014\n and other freely available public data and the System for Investigation of Railway Interfaces (SIRI) Framework. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor requests the staff assisting the Trans\np\nort Select Committee to map\n the concerns expressed in this paper onto the questions raised by the Transport Select Committee. Author thanks the staff for their mapping effort\n as the Framework used by the author cannot be subjectively mapped onto the quest\nionnaire. \n&#xa0;\nThe number of \nUS \nd\nollar billionaire\ns\n in the UK \nas per Forbes magazine 2012 data \nis approximately \nis 37\n. The population of the UK is around 63.23 million. The probability of a finding dollar bil\nlionaire is roughly five parts by million. In a more precise and accurate terms, the figure is worked out to \n5.85165E-06\n.  The probability of a cyclist killed at level crossing is (assuming the only cyclist killed at a level crossing is =1/63.23 million or\n \nroughly one part per ten million. The probability of cyclist being killed at a \ntrain \nlevel crossing is more unlikely than the probability of a \nUS \ndollar billionaire\n in the UK\n. \nThe probability of cyclist being killed on London Street and the probability of\n a US dollar billionaire are of similar magnitude of probabilities. \nHowever, this feature of similarity \nof probabilities \ndoes not induce similar intuitions. \nThe difference in intuitions \narising from consideration of these scenarios and their role on \nbehavi\nour is discussed later in the text. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNow, \nfollowing the work of \np\nsychologists like Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahnem\na\nn\n and Amos Tversky and Prospect Theory they advance\n, author\n judges \nthe situations as\n reflecting gambling tendency \nin both\n situations\n. Because \nactivities\n involving writing bestselling novels or crossing level crossing when train is coming \n \ninvolve risk taking\n involving very low probabilities of success\n(pp317)\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \nJonathan Haidt, a psychologist cited by \nDaniel Kahnemen expressed this tendency by the following saying, “emotional tail wags the rational dog”\n. This\n \ntype of think\ning about situations involving emotions that affect risk is \nsummarised \nby author \nas perceptions\n of harm being \nmore important than act\nual harm. \nThis type of thinking is not new. Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) counselled that perceptions of harm are more dangerous. Because whatever choices we \nmake Nature is divine and headed in a certain direction is\n the core idea\n at the hear\nt of the Stoic philosophy\n. \n&#xa0;\nNow, Let us consider\n \na \nhypothetical \nscenario: s\nuppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he\n \nhears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewellery store with a brok\nen window. Then\n \na gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which\n \nturns out to be full of expensive jewellery. The policeman doesn't hesitate at all in deciding that this\n \ngentleman is dishonest. But by what \nreasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion\n?\n What is the probability that this policeman is in error? \n&#xa0;\nThe idea of a US dollar billionaire in the UK conjures up image of one who is working very hard\n by being enterprising\n, striving to help the eco\nnomy by employing lot of people and being a useful member of society.  However, UK billionaire \nwriter is a different\n individual from this description \nand \nis told as rags-to riches story\n. \nBut,\n the idea of a cyclist dodging a train at a level crossing\n  inv\nokes \na different kind of feeling\n. \n&#xa0;\nMembers of the British Transport Police are \nreportedly \nhunting for the lone woman cy\nclist who jumped red lights but \nnarrowly escaped death. Author wishes to thank God for the miraculous save.  Whereas members of the Brit\nish Transport \nPolice, author speculates, \nmay admire imagination of the writer \nof Harry Potter Book \nwhen watching the Harry Potter film\n on the TV or at a theatre\n. \nAuthor speculates that members of the British Transport Police do not comprehend the idea of A\nristotelian\n (intuitive) physics in the theatre\n \nscenario \n \n(Penrose, 2004)\n,\n \n(Reason, 1990)\n. \nThe idea of criminalising the activity of jumping red lights may be\n a\n good option for policing activity at\n junctions where likelihood of traffic conflicts may arise \nand \nbut \nescaping the conflicts \nby jumping \nmay be good option \nfor the cycling activity \nas som\ne of the Submissions attest to. Whereas criminalising \nthe \nstealing of jewellery is reasonable policing ac\nt\nivity\n.   \n&#xa0;\nWhen thinking about \nsuch tragic cases involving death\n, \nit is not normally recognised that \nthe idea of \nT\nime is \nassociated with the changes of states\n and focal attention\n of a living being. \n \nThis association of Time and human experience is known \nas Entropy\n. Expressed in an informal manner, entropy is a physically perceptible process when a\n rubber band is stretched, a\nn egg is dropped onto a floor, a car crashes into a lamp post or a cyclist is struck by a train or another\n road vehicle\n. \nThese one w\nay processes\n \nare studied in physics as involving\n a quantity known as Entropy. The resulting dis-order can never be decreased\n or is \nir-\nreversible\n. \nIn other words, \nauthor argues that \nentropy and unsafety are identical concepts and are state properties\n like s\nweetness is of sugar\n and does not belong to its constituents\n \n \n(Walker, 2008)\n,\n \n(Ashby, 1957)\n. \nIn other words, an individual alone cannot be considered \nin the explanation but must involve \nwhole \nsocial\n-technical\n \nsystem.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\nA cyclist, car driver, train driver, \npilot may bring about harm to themselves and others because they may lack skills in riding a by-cycle, driving a car or \ndriving \na train or piloting an aircraft\n. B\nut under the conditions of modern \n21\nst\n century society, it is a rarity that people learn to do things by themselves without aid or help from\n others. Even learning from others \ninvolves in these circumstances engaging with a manufactured (or programmed) object.  Production of these objects r\nequire making plans, \ncarrying out the \nactivities\n to \nproduce, assemble , market and utilise them. Rules and regulations regulating the activity of individuals, on the job-training, type of school education and family influence are some of the factors shapin\ng the behaviour of the individual. Therefore, when thinking about such tragic situations, we employ what is known as Systems Thinking to prevent re-occurrence of tragic situations by learning about \nthe \nroot causal factors\n and acting upon them\n. \n&#xa0;\nTravel be\nhaviour of cyclists was discussed in a latest academic publication\n. \nHowever, there is another\n academic research \nthat has been useful to the author can be accessed from here\n. \n From these documents, \nauthor has learnt \nthere is no linear relationship that can be inferred between cycling activity and exposure to hazard at the level crossing that can be used as an indicator of safety. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor agrees to the two proposition(s) advanced by \nNobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. First, \ndomain experts are hostages to emotional, cognitive and social factors\n \nand failure to acknowledge their ignorance is encouraged by their clients.  Second, certain occupations need high resilience in the wak\ne of high failure rates. \nIn conclusion, economists who believe in the rational model of behaviour have driven out rational engineers from system safety management practice area and allowed their place to be taken by safety assurance providers. \nThe system \napproach to safety assurance does not delve into root causes nor is able to apply laws of probability correctly\n \n(A.G.Hessami, 2012)\n. \nThis leads to a dis-benefit to the society is that it pays the costs of harm directly. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe text in this section presents the hazard model in the form of HAZOP\n, EBTA \nworksheets in \na \ntabular form to represent the hazard faced by a cyclist, its causes and consequences as a desktop study.\nTable 1: Hypothetical Partial HAZOP study (Operating and Support Hazop Study) Drawing Number\nSignalling in the Witham area (only relevant down line signals and track circuits are shown)\n Figure 7 of RAIB Report \n and Figure 7.1 of In\ndustrial Supervisory System by James Reason\nSystem \nBirdle\nway\n type Level Crossing \n( BWLC) \nAnalyst \nSanjeev Appicharla dated 15 Jan 2014 \nOperator Task \nWalk across North-East and South-West Corridor \nDesign intent\nTo inform the operator of train arrival through red aspects ie perception of red aspect \nas proxy\n for danger\n.

Because in a relative (from Albert Einstein’s perspective) universe, inertial path is greater than accelerated path or in geometric terms, the diagonal of a\n triangle is more than sum of it sides is shown by Sir Roger Penrose\n \n(Penrose, 2004)\n. These findings are counter –intuitive to \nancient Greek (Pythagoras theorem) and 17\nth\n Century (Newtonian dynamics) physics\n \n(Reason, 1990)\n.  \nThe HAZOP Study can be applied to all other interfaces requiring a study. Similar detailed studies were performed by author and published\n \n(Appicharla, 2006)\n,\n \n(Appicharla, 2010)\n, \n(Appicharla, 2012)\n,\n \n(Appicharla, 2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\nHaving established \nthe fact that the Train Regulating and Controlling \nSystem can induce errors and contribute a collision hazard,\n it is necessary to pay attention to the barriers that can prevent and protect the cyclist from this occupation hazard\n. \n&#xa0;Table 2: Energy Barrier Trace Analysis Model (EBTA) Hazard ( Energy trigger) \nVictim \nBarrier\n \n( preventive as well as protective ) \nCollision hazard between a cyclist and a train\nLoss of life of a cyclist \nRegulation and control of train movements Less Than Adequate ( LTA)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSegregating of traffic streams LTA( civil engineers do not wish to construct bridge) \nThe application of UK Best Practice for Risk Management LTA\n&#xa0;\nEuropean Railway Agency is of the firm opinion that Common Safety Indicator of fatalities per activity is\n \na \ngood indicator of safety performance whereas empirical data analysis does not show any kind of linear relationship\n. Lack of Competence on the part of European Railway Agency in the application of System Thinking Approach to Safety \nas directed by EU Saf\nety Directive (2004/2009) \nis self –evident from the careful reading of the information listed on their website. \nEven UK HSE Reducing Risk and Protecting People suffers from this cognitive error\n. \n&#xa0;\nGeneration of collision(hazard)  scenarios during the scheme planning stages LTA( \nSpecification of train regulation and control schemes LTA \n(RSSB\n Railway Group Standards are the ORR basis for Network Rail’s Operating License)\n. The Railway Group Standar\nds do not specify conditions that may manifest hazards for the duty-holders. \nAccident Investigation techniques LTA (RAIB use of Haddon type of information on flow of sequence of events during pre and post-accident stages does not lead to James Reason’s\n Model). \nRepresentations to generate and capture hazard scenarios LTA ( ORR does not use any information to inform itself of the hazard scenarios) \nComprehension of systemic causal factors LTA (Network Rail Level Crossing Risk Assessment Mod\nel does \nnot capture engineering and management errors\n)\nAwareness of Systemic Errors (biases) LTA ( Network Rail Level Crossing Risk Assessment Model does not \nany branch to model them) Risk scoring does not help hazard causal factors. \n&#xa0;\nOn the question of \nsafety budget for eliminating risk from level crossings, Nobel\n Laureate Daniel Kahneman hypothetical argument \nagainst precautionary principle \nis difficult to sustain as the budget of £9 billion is insignificant in comparison to other amounts of £80 billion\n Finance Loan Schemes to support house buying activity\n. \nNobel\n Laureate Daniel Kahneman does agree that people do not wish to trade minute increase in risk to their health of their near and dear ones (pp350/351)\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Management Oversight and Risk Tree Work sheet is not applied in this Case Study as author earlier submission to the Transport Committee on the theme of Cycling Safety and Safety at Level Crossings have addressed the method already. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApplication of Management Oversight and Risk Tree Worksheet as part of SIRI Framework to the Case Studies of Challenger Accident, Japanese Nuclear Accident, and Herefordshire Level Crossing Accidents show that dependability type of approach applied by auto\nmation engineers and managers are not useful for identifying hazards and their elimination. \nThe combination of latent failures in understanding has been listed in this accident case study as well. By correcting these level of safety may improve. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSome of the references that guided author’s thinking are listed here. \n&#xa0;\nA.G.Hessami, 2012. \nA Systems Approach to Assurance of Safety, Security and Sustainability in Railways. \nCroatia: InTech.\n&#xa0;\nAlthaus, C.
