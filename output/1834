[normal]urning an innovation into market opportunity can be difficult for a number of reasons. For example, customers are not always keen to be the first mover when it comes to buying a new and relatively unknown product. Another issue can be that sales people nee
[normal]d to learn how to sell new products or services, and this can take time. These challenges in turning innovation into market opportunities are a particular issue given that manufacturers expect to use innovation to develop new markets.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Appendix A: [bold]Achieving better balanced growth – a role for R&amp;D[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A1.
[normal] 
[normal]As the UK came out of recession, a consensus emerged that we could not continue to grow in the same way 
[normal]we
[normal] had done in the previous 15 years. A better balanced economy would be one where growth was based on innovation, investment and trade rather than cons
[normal]umption.
[normal] At the time, 
[normal]forecasters were optimistic that this kind of growth could be achieved, but the recovery did not materialise as expected and business investment in particular remains well below its pre-recession average. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A2.
[normal] 
[normal]In 2012
[normal],
[normal] EEF 
[normal]published 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Route to Growth
[normal], our take on what an Industrial Strate
[normal]gy 
[normal]that would deliver better-balance
[normal]d
[normal] growth 
[normal]for the UK should look like.
[normal] 
[normal]The central principle was that government should to
[normal] take an economy-wide approach
[normal] towards 
[normal]creating the climate and conditions 
[normal]that would enable
[normal] businesses in all sectors to grow through investment and exporting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A3.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] UK has significant strengths on which to build, including a diverse and innovative manufacturing base and strong science capabilities. An Industrial Strategy must se
[normal]ek to build on these strengths
[normal] with a set of clear ambitions which lay out what government is looking to achieve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A4.
[normal] 
[normal]EEF’s vision for the economy is based on achieving four key ambitions:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A5.
[normal] 
[normal]The first of the ambitions is particularly relevant as innovation and R&amp;D are necessary to
[normal] develop new products and services wh
[normal]ich can
[normal] drive sales and exports. In order to understand whether the economy was making progress against this ambition we set out two key metrics
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A6.
[normal] 
[normal]While 
[normal]R&amp;D expenditure is not a perfect measure of innovation
[normal], 
[normal]it is a valuable metric and 
[normal]it is 
[normal]measured by a range of international comparator countries.
[normal] BERD is a key component of this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A7.
[normal] 
[normal]The SME R&amp;D tax c
[normal]redit indicator is important as R&amp;D expenditure is concentrated in large businesses, and smaller companies face the most acute barriers to innovation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Progress has been made [bold]&#xa0;[bold]A8.
[normal] 
[normal]To date we have seen
[normal] 
[normal]progress against both of these measures. BERD reached pre
[normal]-recession levels after strong growth in 2011 and the number of SMEs claiming the R&amp;D tax credit increased by 49% between 2008/09 and 2011/12.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A9.
[normal] 
[normal]Recent improvements to the SME R&amp;D tax credit scheme and the relative stability of its provision through the tax
[normal] regime will have played a part in the significant increase in the number of companies using the scheme in the past three years.
[normal] The tax credit 
[normal]should encourage a virtuous circle of i
[normal]nvestment in R&amp;D and innovation, and
[normal] the NAO’s report shows that over thi
[normal]s same time period there has been a corresponding increase in SME expenditure on R&amp;D.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]19% of manufacturers agreed with the statement “we are falling behind our competitors due to the level of our investment in innovation” whilst 54% of companies disa
[normal]greed. 
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]2013, 
[normal]three quarters of companies said that speed to market was more important than it was in the past.
[normal] 
[normal]Only 25% of companies said their performance was good or excellent 
[normal]when it came to speed of developing innovations
[normal], 
[normal]while 
[normal]30% of companie
[normal]s thought their performance was poor.
[normal] 
[normal]In EEF’s Innovation Monitor 2013, only 38% of companies rated their performance as good or excellent at turning innovations into market opportunity, though this is an improvement compared with our 2010 survey.
