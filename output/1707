defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultthe Royal College of Surgeons (WSC057)default&#xa0;default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis
default evidence sets out the Royal College of Surgeons’ (RCS) view on the issues facing women in surgical careers, and proposals to improve uptake. 
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTraditionally
default,
default surgery has been a male-dominated career
default. C
defaulthanging attitudes and support structures will be 
defaultthe 
defaultkey to ensuring the next generation of surgeons include 
defaulta greater proportion of 
defaulttalented women. 
default&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no hard evidence that explicit barriers exist for women who cho
defaulto
defaultse surgery as a career. However, comparatively small numbers of wom
defaulten choose surgery as a 
defaultcareer and for those that do, few become consultants. 
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough, t
defaulthe proportion of women choosing surgery, and reaching consultant level is rising year
default-
defaulton
default-
defaultyear 
defaultthe rise is 
defaultslow and from a low base level.
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFinland and Sweden have a sig
defaultnificantly higher proportion of women in surgical specialties
default highlighting 
defaultthat there are some country
default-
defaultspecific factors for this underrepresentation.
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSurgery is a craft specialty and understandably requires sustained practical as well as theoretical training over many years. The length of training, combined with key elements of surgical training at child-bearing age, can be an important 
defaultdeterrent
default for wo
defaultmen who may want to have children.
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR
defaultesearch shows that a lack of visible role models in surgery may also discourage women from considering surgery, leading them to subconsciously or consciously feel as though they will not ‘fit’.
default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThrough national and regio
defaultnal 
defaultcampaigns and 
defaultevents
default,
default the College supports women in, or considering entering, surgery, 
defaultproviding
default 
defaultadvice,
default practical skills and the opportunity to meet other women pursuing a surgical career. 
default2.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAthena SWAN offer a charter for women in science
default,
default and offer m
defaultedical schools awards if they can demonstrate that they have tak
defaulten steps working towards
default equality in STEM career progression. The College would like to see the charter extended to 
defaultmedicine
default.
default2.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is vital that 
defaultLess Than Full Time 
default(
defaultLTFT
default)
default 
defaultsurgical trainees receive the same high-quality training as their full time equivalents. We encourage Health Education England to consider how it can support LTFT trainees as part of its review of the tariff for education and training. 
default2.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultComparatively few w
defaultomen choose surgery as a career, despite ambition, aptitude and little direct discrimination. Women are choosing not to pursue this career due to a lack of positive role models, 
defaultand/
defaultor potential concerns about work-life balance.
default 
defaultIf surgery does not become 
defaultmore accommodating of flexible working patterns, it will fail to attract the best candidates, male or female. 
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultS
defaulttatistics 
defaultfrom the Universities
default and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) 
defaultshow that in 2011 55% of those accepted on to medical 
defaultdegree courses in the UK were women, however in the same year
default just
default 26% of surgical 
defaultspecialty 
defaulttrainees were women, and women made up 
defaultonly
default 8.7% of consultant surgeons.

default**The excess of women appointed over that expected from the numbers applying is significant (p=0.004).
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom this i
defaultt is clear that
default fewer w
defaultomen are choosing surgery as a career, 
defaultdespite aptitude, 
defaultand for those that do
default choose surgery
default, becoming a consultant surgeon is 
defaultcompara
defaulttively 
defaultrare. 
defaultThis data also shows a significant rate of attrition for women who have completed their core surgical training but 
defaulthave 
defaultnot chosen to progress 
defaulttheir career 
defaultwith specialty surgical training. 
default 
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent UK study of newly qualified doctors showed 25% 
defaultof 
defaultfemal
defaulte doctors expressed interest in a surgical career as oppose
defaultd to 42% of male doctors. 
defaultReasons included difficulty maintaining family life, limited flexible training,
default and lack of role models. 
defaultIrrespective of 
defaultpersonal 
defaultcareer interests, 59% of male and 68% of 
defaultfemale respondents believed surgery was not a career 
defaultwhich welcomed
default women
default.
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy contrast, general practice - 
defaultwhich is often considered to have more favourable working conditions
default - has recruited a higher proportion of women than men for many years. Since 2001 
defaultthe proportion of women among general practice
default registrars has been 60-61%.
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, o
defaultther medical specialties with 
defaultsimilar burdens
default 
defaultto surgery, 
defaultincluding out-of-hours 
defaultrequirements
default have gender ratios approaching parity 
defaultat the point of 
defaultentering 
defaultspecialty

default, for example the percentage of women in 
defaultAccident &amp; Emergency
default is
default 47%
default,
default Paediatrics 42%, Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 42% and Anaesthetics 40%
default.
default By learning from the 
defaultex
defaultamples of 
defaultthese specialties, surgery should be able to 
defaulttake
default positive 
defaultsteps
default. 
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEncouragingly, t

defaultfrom 
default4.7% of the total in

default 
default)
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe College hopes to support this 
defaultcontinuing 
defaulttrend 
defaultand recognises that G
defaultovernment
default, medical schools, training establishments and NHS Trusts
default also have a role to play. 
default3.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen are also underrepresented in leadership positions such as examiners and clinical directors, representing 
defaultthe need for a 
defaultculture
default change
default.
default3.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInternationally, the general trend of finding the highest proportion of women in primary care specialties or publ
defaultic health, and the lowest in acute medical and surgical specialties, remains the same.
default 
defaultHowever, Finland and Sweden have a significantly higher proportion of women in surgical specialties
default (for some, women constitute 50% of the workforce)
default,
default highlighting that 
defaultthere are some country specific factors for this underrepresentation.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no hard evidence that explicit barriers exist for women 
defaultwho cho
defaulto
defaultse surgery as a career. 
defaultR
defaulteports of bias in the recruitment 
defaultsystem
default,
default or
default overt

default,
default are relatively rare
default.
default 
defaultHowever, comparatively small numbers of women choose surgery as a career and for those that do
default, few 
defaultchoose to continue up to consultant level.
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor more than 
default13 years
default the College has worked to understand women’s surgical careers and factors affecting their success. Through national and regional 
defaultcampaigns and 
defaultevents the College supports women in, or considering entering, surgery, starting with workshops for school
default-
defaultage a
defaultspiring surgeons. These events provide knowledge, practical skills and the opportunity to meet women pursuing a surgical career. A network of members providing information and advice on all topics affecting women in surgery or considering a surgical career
default, including a flexible training advisor
default,
default is also 
defaultan 
defaultavailable
default asset
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSurgery is a craft specialty and understandably requires sustained

defaultyears of core surgical training, 
defaultfollowed by

defaultfor their chosen type of surgery.

defaultduation (age 27-30, based on a five

defaulta 
defaultspecialty training 
defaultprogramme 
defaultguarantees (subject to competence) permanent training posts until training is complete. When training is
default complete
default 
default(approximately ten
default years after graduation) they may apply for senior posts such as consultant positions or, more likely, further 
defaultspecialty 
defaulttraining. 
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe length of training, combined with 
defaultkey elements of surgical training at child-bearing age
default, can be an important 
defaultdeterrent
default for women who may want to have children.
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to provide doctors with the necessary broad experience
default,
default surgical training also requires movement between multiple hospitals
default,
default often in different geographical locations, with i
defaultnflexible 
defaultand unpredictable 
defaulton-call requirements. For both men and women, this knowledge, and the effect this may have on 
defaultfamily life
default, may play a role in a decision to pursue 
defaultsurgery as a career choice
default. 
default4.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLess Than Full Time (LTFT) training 
defaultis the means by 
defaultwhich doctors and dentists undertake training when they are unable to work and train full time
default. However, LTFT training 
defaultis

default, and will 
defaultnecessarily 
defaultadd years to the tr
defaultaining programme. 
default4.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOnly 7% of trainees across the medical professions are LTFT
default, and in the 
defaultmost recent 
defaultannual national training survey, the 
defaultGeneral Medical Council (
defaultGMC
default)
default f
defaultou
defaultnd 86.4% of LTFT trainees are women
default. For surgery,
default LTFT training
default is more unusual
default,
default 
defaultin 2011
default Medical Education England statistics showed there to be

defaultst 78
default LTFT trainees in surgery
default out of a total 
defaultof 
default4,381, 
defaulthighlighting
default how hard these posts are to 
defaultsecure

default as a result
default.
default With statistics 
defaultnot publically available 
defaulton the
default 
defaultapplication for

default and availability of
default,
default these training posts, the College would encourage t
defaulthe C
defaultommittee 
defaultto ask Health Education England 
defaultfor this information. 
default4.10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLTFT training can be arranged as:
defaultThe most common arrangement is the ‘slot share’ system. 
defaultHowever, in surgery it can be extremely difficult to find another trainee who will be seeki
defaultng the same specialist training
default because of low overall numbers
default in certain specialties
default.
default Supernumerary posts ar
defaulte the most effective arrangement for LTFT training and should be available more routinely.
default In addition,
default while it is vital that part-time trainees achieve the same competencies as those training full-time, the
default system 
defaultcan limit

defaulthow much training

defaulthich can increase the time spent training (already at 10 years) by more than they would ideally like. 
default&#xa0;defaultRole modelsdefault4.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversity of Exeter research shows 
defaultthat a lack of visible role models in surgery may also discourage 
defaultwomen
default from considering surgery
default, leading them to subconsciously or consciously feel as though they will not ‘fit’.
default4.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default research shows that when women think of a surgical consultant they think of a man with traditionally masculine traits, and this is then reinfo
defaultrced by a lack of women at consultant level.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultresearchers
default believe that where a woman perceives her attributes differ from these traits, they perceive that they are less likely to succeed in surgery which reduces career ambition and job satisfaction.
default4.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo 
defaultattract more women to a career in surgery the 
defaultresearchers 
defaultbelieve the importance is less about changing the career itself and more about changing some women’s negative perception that they do not have what it takes to succeed. 
default4.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe College
default, through its Wom
defaulten in Surgery team
default,
default 
defaulthelps to raise awareness and support women in surgical careers. This team
default has piloted a 
default‘near peer’ mentoring scheme for women 
defaultwhere medical 
defaultstudents were 
defaultmentored by foundation-level 
defaulttrainees, who were in turn mentored but 
defaulttrainees at 
defaultthe level above themselves, continuing up to consultant level
default. The scheme was well received and investigations are underway to consider
default how
default feasible it would be to roll
default out on a larger
default scale
default. The College has an important role to play in providing mentoring
default to trainees and is committed to ensuring it does so in the future.
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultComparatively few women choose surgery as a career, despite ambition, aptitude and 
defaultrelatively 
defaultlittle direct discrimination. Women are choosing not to pursue this career 
defaultdue to 
defaulta 
defaultlack of positive role models,

defaultIf surgery does not become more accommodating of flexible working patterns
default,
default it will fail to attract the best candidates
default, male or female. 
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendations for defaultGovernmentdefault5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment support should be actively offered for initiatives supporting women in areas where they are underrepresented. 
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultAthena SWAN 
defaultcharter, launched in 2005 and
default funded by the Equality Challenge Unit, The Royal Society, The Biochemical Society and th
defaulte Department of Health
default,
default exists to advance the representation of women in science, engineering and technology. Higher education institutions can earn gold, silver and bronze awards if they can demonstrate that they are aware of, and have taken steps working
default towards, equality in STEM career progression. The College would like to see the charter extended to medicine.
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLTFT training must be supported, and operate in a system where it is expected. 
defaultF
defaultunding for these positions
default, particularly supernumerary posts
default is 
defaultnot always available and 
defaultwe encourage the Committee to explore why this is the case and how this can be 
defaultrectified. 
defaultThe 
defaultG
defaultovernment must consider innovative ways to fund these posts to ensure 
defaultemployers
default are not disadvantaged by taking LTFT trainees on. 
default5.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRestructuring the funding model to ensure there can be flexibility in the amount of t
defaultime a graduate spends training
default,
default perhaps by incentivising 
defaultsupernumerary
default posts as 
defaultthe slot-share model
default can lead to the restriction of
default training 
defaultto 50% or 60% w
defaultorking patterns
default,
default 
defaultwhereas many trainees would find it more useful to work
default 70% or 80%
default.
default 
default5.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is vital that LTFT surgical trainees receive the same high-quality training as their full time equivalent
defaults. Ensuring funding ‘follows the trainee’ 
defaultwould help to encourage funding for 
defaulttailored LTFT
default rotations rather than 
defaulthaving
default to take part in 
defaulta broader 
defaultstanda
defaultrd programme designed for 
defaultfull-time 
defaulttrainees
default.
default We encourage Health Education England to 
defaultconsider
default how it can support LTFT trainees as part of its r
defaulteview of the tariff for education and training.
default 
default5.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2009 the Department of Health report 
defaultWomen doctors: making a difference 
defaultdetailed a number of recommendations including: 
defaulti
defaultmprov
defaulting
default access to mentoring and career advice; encouraging women in leadership; im
defaultprov
defaulting
default access to part-time working and flexible training
default;
default and improving access to childcare. The Committee may want to consider the progress

defaultRecommendations for mdefaultedical schoolsdefault5.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversity is a key moment to ensure all medical graduates actively consider surgery, and are fully informed about the pros and cons of surgery as a 
defaultcareer
default.
default 
defaultMentoring, and 
defaultcontact with positive role models
default,
default should be offered for all medical graduates.

default 
default5.11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities and medical 
defaultschools should actively seek an Athena SWAN award
default19
default confirming that 
defaultthe institution is aware of, and has taken steps working towards equality in STEM career progression. In 2011 the Chief Medical Officer announced that the National Institute
