[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]the Royal College of Surgeons (WSC057)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This
[normal] evidence sets out the Royal College of Surgeons’ (RCS) view on the issues facing women in surgical careers, and proposals to improve uptake. 
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Traditionally
[normal],
[normal] surgery has been a male-dominated career
[normal]. C
[normal]hanging attitudes and support structures will be 
[normal]the 
[normal]key to ensuring the next generation of surgeons include 
[normal]a greater proportion of 
[normal]talented women. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no hard evidence that explicit barriers exist for women who cho
[normal]o
[normal]se surgery as a career. However, comparatively small numbers of wom
[normal]en choose surgery as a 
[normal]career and for those that do, few become consultants. 
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although, t
[normal]he proportion of women choosing surgery, and reaching consultant level is rising year
[normal]-
[normal]on
[normal]-
[normal]year 
[normal]the rise is 
[normal]slow and from a low base level.
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finland and Sweden have a sig
[normal]nificantly higher proportion of women in surgical specialties
[normal] highlighting 
[normal]that there are some country
[normal]-
[normal]specific factors for this underrepresentation.
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Surgery is a craft specialty and understandably requires sustained practical as well as theoretical training over many years. The length of training, combined with key elements of surgical training at child-bearing age, can be an important 
[normal]deterrent
[normal] for wo
[normal]men who may want to have children.
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R
[normal]esearch shows that a lack of visible role models in surgery may also discourage women from considering surgery, leading them to subconsciously or consciously feel as though they will not ‘fit’.
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through national and regio
[normal]nal 
[normal]campaigns and 
[normal]events
[normal],
[normal] the College supports women in, or considering entering, surgery, 
[normal]providing
[normal] 
[normal]advice,
[normal] practical skills and the opportunity to meet other women pursuing a surgical career. 
[normal]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Athena SWAN offer a charter for women in science
[normal],
[normal] and offer m
[normal]edical schools awards if they can demonstrate that they have tak
[normal]en steps working towards
[normal] equality in STEM career progression. The College would like to see the charter extended to 
[normal]medicine
[normal].
[normal]2.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is vital that 
[normal]Less Than Full Time 
[normal](
[normal]LTFT
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]surgical trainees receive the same high-quality training as their full time equivalents. We encourage Health Education England to consider how it can support LTFT trainees as part of its review of the tariff for education and training. 
[normal]2.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Comparatively few w
[normal]omen choose surgery as a career, despite ambition, aptitude and little direct discrimination. Women are choosing not to pursue this career due to a lack of positive role models, 
[normal]and/
[normal]or potential concerns about work-life balance.
[normal] 
[normal]If surgery does not become 
[normal]more accommodating of flexible working patterns, it will fail to attract the best candidates, male or female. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]tatistics 
[normal]from the Universities
[normal] and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) 
[normal]show that in 2011 55% of those accepted on to medical 
[normal]degree courses in the UK were women, however in the same year
[normal] just
[normal] 26% of surgical 
[normal]specialty 
[normal]trainees were women, and women made up 
[normal]only
[normal] 8.7% of consultant surgeons.
[normal] 
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For 
[normal]female 
[normal]doctors
[normal] 
[normal]who 
[normal]do apply to undertake 
[normal]core surgical training (a two year period 
[normal]of training in a hospital covering a range of surgical specialties) and specialty surgical training (
[normal]a 
[normal]subsequent 
[normal]five or 
[normal]six year
[normal] period of 
[normal]training in a hospital focuss
[normal]ed
[normal] on one surgical specialty) 
[normal]data shows a higher than expected success rate
[normal] in obtai
[normal]ning a training post
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Female applicants
[normal] to training posts
[normal]Female appointments

[normal]Specialty surgical training 
[normal]in 2009
[normal]13%
[normal]15%
[normal]*The increase in proportion of women applying to core posts is statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).
[normal]**The excess of women appointed over that expected from the numbers applying is significant (p=0.004).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From this i
[normal]t is clear that
[normal] fewer w
[normal]omen are choosing surgery as a career, 
[normal]despite aptitude, 
[normal]and for those that do
[normal] choose surgery
[normal], becoming a consultant surgeon is 
[normal]compara
[normal]tively 
[normal]rare. 
[normal]This data also shows a significant rate of attrition for women who have completed their core surgical training but 
[normal]have 
[normal]not chosen to progress 
[normal]their career 
[normal]with specialty surgical training. 
[normal] 
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A recent UK study of newly qualified doctors showed 25% 
[normal]of 
[normal]femal
[normal]e doctors expressed interest in a surgical career as oppose
[normal]d to 42% of male doctors. 
[normal]Reasons included difficulty maintaining family life, limited flexible training,
[normal] and lack of role models. 
[normal]Irrespective of 
[normal]personal 
[normal]career interests, 59% of male and 68% of 
[normal]female respondents believed surgery was not a career 
[normal]which welcomed
[normal] women
[normal].
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By contrast, general practice - 
[normal]which is often considered to have more favourable working conditions
[normal] - has recruited a higher proportion of women than men for many years. Since 2001 
[normal]the proportion of women among general practice
[normal] registrars has been 60-61%.
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, o
[normal]ther medical specialties with 
[normal]similar burdens
[normal] 
[normal]to surgery, 
[normal]including out-of-hours 
[normal]requirements
[normal] have gender ratios approaching parity 
[normal]at the point of 
[normal]entering 
[normal]specialty
[normal] training
[normal], for example the percentage of women in 
[normal]Accident &amp; Emergency
[normal] is
[normal] 47%
[normal],
[normal] Paediatrics 42%, Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 42% and Anaesthetics 40%
[normal].
[normal] By learning from the 
[normal]ex
[normal]amples of 
[normal]these specialties, surgery should be able to 
[normal]take
[normal] positive 
[normal]steps
[normal]. 
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Encouragingly, t
[normal]he proportion of women choosing surgery
[normal], and reaching consultant level
[normal] 
[normal]is rising year
[normal]-
[normal]on
[normal]-
[normal]year
[normal] albeit 
[normal]slowly 
[normal]and from a low base level 
[normal](
[normal]from 
[normal]4.7% of the total in 
[normal]2001
[normal] to 8.7% in 2011
[normal] 
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he College hopes to support this 
[normal]continuing 
[normal]trend 
[normal]and recognises that G
[normal]overnment
[normal], medical schools, training establishments and NHS Trusts
[normal] also have a role to play. 
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women are also underrepresented in leadership positions such as examiners and clinical directors, representing 
[normal]the need for a 
[normal]culture
[normal] change
[normal].
[normal]3.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Internationally, the general trend of finding the highest proportion of women in primary care specialties or publ
[normal]ic health, and the lowest in acute medical and surgical specialties, remains the same.
[normal] 
[normal]However, Finland and Sweden have a significantly higher proportion of women in surgical specialties
[normal] (for some, women constitute 50% of the workforce)
[normal],
[normal] highlighting that 
[normal]there are some country specific factors for this underrepresentation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no hard evidence that explicit barriers exist for women 
[normal]who cho
[normal]o
[normal]se surgery as a career. 
[normal]R
[normal]eports of bias in the recruitment 
[normal]system
[normal],
[normal] or
[normal] overt
[normal] 
[normal]lack of 
[normal]respect once consultant status is reached
[normal],
[normal] are relatively rare
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, comparatively small numbers of women choose surgery as a career and for those that do
[normal], few 
[normal]choose to continue up to consultant level.
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For more than 
[normal]13 years
[normal] the College has worked to understand women’s surgical careers and factors affecting their success. Through national and regional 
[normal]campaigns and 
[normal]events the College supports women in, or considering entering, surgery, starting with workshops for school
[normal]-
[normal]age a
[normal]spiring surgeons. These events provide knowledge, practical skills and the opportunity to meet women pursuing a surgical career. A network of members providing information and advice on all topics affecting women in surgery or considering a surgical career
[normal], including a flexible training advisor
[normal],
[normal] is also 
[normal]an 
[normal]available
[normal] asset
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T[bold]raining[bold]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Surgery is a craft specialty and understandably requires sustained 
[normal]practical as well as theoretical 
[normal]training over many years. 
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal] me
[normal]dical graduate 
[normal]embarking
[normal] on
[normal] 
[normal]surg
[normal]ical training
[normal] 
[normal]can expect two years of 
[normal]hospital-based 
[normal]foundation training covering a range of specialties, followed by two 
[normal]years of core surgical training, 
[normal]followed by 
[normal]five or
[normal] six years of specialty training
[normal] 
[normal]for their chosen type of surgery. 
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Application to specialty tr
[normal]aining 
[normal]generally 
[normal]occurs 
[normal]four or five
[normal] 
[normal]years 
[normal]after gra
[normal]duation (age 27-30, based on a five
[normal] year medical degree). A place in 
[normal]a 
[normal]specialty training 
[normal]programme 
[normal]guarantees (subject to competence) permanent training posts until training is complete. When training is
[normal] complete
[normal] 
[normal](approximately ten
[normal] years after graduation) they may apply for senior posts such as consultant positions or, more likely, further 
[normal]specialty 
[normal]training. 
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The length of training, combined with 
[normal]key elements of surgical training at child-bearing age
[normal], can be an important 
[normal]deterrent
[normal] for women who may want to have children.
[normal]4.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to provide doctors with the necessary broad experience
[normal],
[normal] surgical training also requires movement between multiple hospitals
[normal],
[normal] often in different geographical locations, with i
[normal]nflexible 
[normal]and unpredictable 
[normal]on-call requirements. For both men and women, this knowledge, and the effect this may have on 
[normal]family life
[normal], may play a role in a decision to pursue 
[normal]surgery as a career choice
[normal]. 
[normal]4.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Less Than Full Time (LTFT) training 
[normal]is the means by 
[normal]which doctors and dentists undertake training when they are unable to work and train full time
[normal]. However, LTFT training 
[normal]is
[normal] available subject to eligibility, resource and training capacity of the relevant programme
[normal], and will 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]add years to the tr
[normal]aining programme. 
[normal]4.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Only 7% of trainees across the medical professions are LTFT
[normal], and in the 
[normal]most recent 
[normal]annual national training survey, the 
[normal]General Medical Council (
[normal]GMC
[normal])
[normal] f
[normal]ou
[normal]nd 86.4% of LTFT trainees are women
[normal]. For surgery,
[normal] LTFT training
[normal] is more unusual
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in 2011
[normal] Medical Education England statistics showed there to be
[normal] ju
[normal]st 78
[normal] LTFT trainees in surgery
[normal] out of a total 
[normal]of 
[normal]4,381, 
[normal]highlighting
[normal] how hard these posts are to 
[normal]secure
[normal], and h
[normal]ow disproportionally women are affected
[normal] as a result
[normal].
[normal] With statistics 
[normal]not publically available 
[normal]on the
[normal] 
[normal]application for
[normal],
[normal] and availability of
[normal],
[normal] these training posts, the College would encourage t
[normal]he C
[normal]ommittee 
[normal]to ask Health Education England 
[normal]for this information. 
[normal]4.10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]LTFT training can be arranged as:
[normal]The most common arrangement is the ‘slot share’ system. 
[normal]However, in surgery it can be extremely difficult to find another trainee who will be seeki
[normal]ng the same specialist training
[normal] because of low overall numbers
[normal] in certain specialties
[normal].
[normal] Supernumerary posts ar
[normal]e the most effective arrangement for LTFT training and should be available more routinely.
[normal] In addition,
[normal] while it is vital that part-time trainees achieve the same competencies as those training full-time, the
[normal] system 
[normal]can limit
[normal] 
[normal]how much training 
[normal]the LTFT tra
[normal]inee 
[normal]can 
[normal]undertake
[normal],
[normal] w
[normal]hich can increase the time spent training (already at 10 years) by more than they would ideally like. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Role models[bold]4.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]University of Exeter research shows 
[normal]that a lack of visible role models in surgery may also discourage 
[normal]women
[normal] from considering surgery
[normal], leading them to subconsciously or consciously feel as though they will not ‘fit’.
[normal]4.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] research shows that when women think of a surgical consultant they think of a man with traditionally masculine traits, and this is then reinfo
[normal]rced by a lack of women at consultant level.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]researchers
[normal] believe that where a woman perceives her attributes differ from these traits, they perceive that they are less likely to succeed in surgery which reduces career ambition and job satisfaction.
[normal]4.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To 
[normal]attract more women to a career in surgery the 
[normal]researchers 
[normal]believe the importance is less about changing the career itself and more about changing some women’s negative perception that they do not have what it takes to succeed. 
[normal]4.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The College
[normal], through its Wom
[normal]en in Surgery team
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]helps to raise awareness and support women in surgical careers. This team
[normal] has piloted a 
[normal]‘near peer’ mentoring scheme for women 
[normal]where medical 
[normal]students were 
[normal]mentored by foundation-level 
[normal]trainees, who were in turn mentored but 
[normal]trainees at 
[normal]the level above themselves, continuing up to consultant level
[normal]. The scheme was well received and investigations are underway to consider
[normal] how
[normal] feasible it would be to roll
[normal] out on a larger
[normal] scale
[normal]. The College has an important role to play in providing mentoring
[normal] to trainees and is committed to ensuring it does so in the future.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Comparatively few women choose surgery as a career, despite ambition, aptitude and 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]little direct discrimination. Women are choosing not to pursue this career 
[normal]due to 
[normal]a 
[normal]lack of positive role models, 
[normal]and/
[normal]or potential concerns about work-life balance. 
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If surgery does not become more accommodating of flexible working patterns
[normal],
[normal] it will fail to attract the best candidates
[normal], male or female. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Recommendations for [bold]Government[bold]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government support should be actively offered for initiatives supporting women in areas where they are underrepresented. 
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Athena SWAN 
[normal]charter, launched in 2005 and
[normal] funded by the Equality Challenge Unit, The Royal Society, The Biochemical Society and th
[normal]e Department of Health
[normal],
[normal] exists to advance the representation of women in science, engineering and technology. Higher education institutions can earn gold, silver and bronze awards if they can demonstrate that they are aware of, and have taken steps working
[normal] towards, equality in STEM career progression. The College would like to see the charter extended to medicine.
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]LTFT training must be supported, and operate in a system where it is expected. 
[normal]F
[normal]unding for these positions
[normal], particularly supernumerary posts
[normal] is 
[normal]not always available and 
[normal]we encourage the Committee to explore why this is the case and how this can be 
[normal]rectified. 
[normal]The 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment must consider innovative ways to fund these posts to ensure 
[normal]employers
[normal] are not disadvantaged by taking LTFT trainees on. 
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Restructuring the funding model to ensure there can be flexibility in the amount of t
[normal]ime a graduate spends training
[normal],
[normal] perhaps by incentivising 
[normal]supernumerary
[normal] posts as 
[normal]the slot-share model
[normal] can lead to the restriction of
[normal] training 
[normal]to 50% or 60% w
[normal]orking patterns
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]whereas many trainees would find it more useful to work
[normal] 70% or 80%
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]5.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is vital that LTFT surgical trainees receive the same high-quality training as their full time equivalent
[normal]s. Ensuring funding ‘follows the trainee’ 
[normal]would help to encourage funding for 
[normal]tailored LTFT
[normal] rotations rather than 
[normal]having
[normal] to take part in 
[normal]a broader 
[normal]standa
[normal]rd programme designed for 
[normal]full-time 
[normal]trainees
[normal].
[normal] We encourage Health Education England to 
[normal]consider
[normal] how it can support LTFT trainees as part of its r
[normal]eview of the tariff for education and training.
[normal] 
[normal]5.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2009 the Department of Health report 
[normal]Women doctors: making a difference 
[normal]detailed a number of recommendations including: 
[normal]i
[normal]mprov
[normal]ing
[normal] access to mentoring and career advice; encouraging women in leadership; im
[normal]prov
[normal]ing
[normal] access to part-time working and flexible training
[normal];
[normal] and improving access to childcare. The Committee may want to consider the progress 
[normal]of
[normal] these recommendations.
[normal]18
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations for m[bold]edical schools[bold]5.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]University is a key moment to ensure all medical graduates actively consider surgery, and are fully informed about the pros and cons of surgery as a 
[normal]career
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Mentoring, and 
[normal]contact with positive role models
[normal],
[normal] should be offered for all medical graduates.
[normal] 
[normal]5.10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sur
[normal]gery 
[normal]in the 
[normal]undergraduate curriculum
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] taught 
[normal]variably across the UK
[normal]. Having 
[normal]more 
[normal]defined courses and outcomes 
[normal]across institutions 
[normal]would 
[normal]enable 
[normal]all 
[normal]medical students to make informed decisions
[normal] about their future career choices
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]5.11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Universities and medical 
[normal]schools should actively seek an Athena SWAN award
[normal]19
[normal] confirming that 
[normal]the institution is aware of, and has taken steps working towards equality in STEM career progression. In 2011 the Chief Medical Officer announced that the National Institute 
[normal]of Health Rese
[normal]arch (NIHR) would only expect to shortlist medical schools for funding if a 
[normal]gold or 
[normal]silver Athena SWAN award was in place. The College would like to see all medical schools seek these awards
[normal],
[normal] regardless of whether they are applying for research f
[normal]u
[normal]nding fro
[normal]m the NIHR.
