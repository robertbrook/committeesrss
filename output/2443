defaultDetailed submissionsdefaultThe
default proposed
default residence test
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“125. Having carefully considered consultat
defaultion responses, we have concluded that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain matters of law (as set out in Schedule 1 to LASPO) would not be required to meet the residence 
defaulttest. The test will not apply to th
defaulte following categories of case (which broadly relate to an individual’s liberty, or where the individual is particularly vulnerable or where the case relates to the protection of children): 
defaultDetention cases 
default(paragraphs 5, 20, 25, 26 and 27 (and challenges 
defaultto the lawfulness of detention by way of judicial review under paragraph 19) of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO)” 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“We found a lack of nursi
defaultng input into the care of one detainee who had become agitated and distressed. Although she was subsequently seen and treated by a psychiatrist, a nurse who had been on duty since 7am told us at 2:15pm that he had not yet seen the detainee that day. There 
defaultwas also no documented care plan for this detainee, which was unacceptable practice.”
default&#xa0;
default“[W]e were disturbed to find one of the least safe immigration detention facilities we have inspected, with deeply 
defaultfrustrated detainees and demoralised staff, some of whom lacked the necessary confidence to manage those in their care. At the time of the inspection, Brook House was an unsafe place.”
default&#xa0;
default“A major area for on-going concern was health care, which remained a source of considerable complaint from detainees. Mental health needs were under identified and the inpatients department was described by staff themselves
default as a ‘forgotten world’. The poor service we witnessed the last time we visited was still evident in many respects […]”

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExceptional funding applications are made at risk. In our experience, they involve a substan
defaulttial amount of work that is in addition to the work needed on the underlying case. The absence of payment for making exceptional funding applications creates a chilling effect, evidenced most clearly by the low numbers of applications made to the Legal Aid
default Agency since 1 April 2013.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe test for getting exceptional funding is a complex legal one that it is difficult for applicants to understand and address without the assistance of a lawyer. The applicants who are the most vulnerable, and therefore the most
default in need of exceptional funding, will be the least able to navigate the exceptional funding scheme. 
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no emergency procedure for accessing exceptional funding. For ex-detainees in need of urgent community care, for example, the exceptional funding 
defaultscheme will be impossible to access in order to safeguard their needs, creating an unacceptable risk that their human rights will be breached either by the delay, or by the fact of having to represent themselves in the proceedings. 
default4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no procedure f
defaultor exempting children or people who lack capacity from the exceptional funding regime. 
defaultIn the absence of a litigation friend or pro bono legal representation, t
defaulthis means that the most vulnerable applicants
default who are unable to conduct proceedings alone, face 
defaulta complete bar from accessing the courts.

default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe test for granting permission is not a fixed one, meaning that claimant lawyers do not know from the outset what hurdle(s) they will have to jump for permission to be granted. Lord Bingham explained the need for flexibility in 
defaultSharma v. Deputy D
defaultirector of Public Prosecutions &amp; Ors (Trinidad and Tobago)
default [2006] UKPC 57 at paragraph 14, as follows:
default“The ordinary rule now is that the court will refuse leave to claim judicial review unless satisfied that there is an arguable ground for judicial review
default having a realistic prospect of success and not subject to a discretionary bar such as delay or an alternative remedy: R v Legal Aid Board, Ex p Hughes (1992) 5 Admin LR 623, 628; Fordham, Judicial Review Handbook, 4th ed (2004), p 426. 
defaultBut arguability can
defaultnot be judged without reference to the nature and gravity of the issue to be argued. It is a test which is flexible in its application
default” (emphasis added).
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a wide disparity in the number of permission grants made by different judges. This proposal w
defaultould make payment conditional on a judicial lottery that is impossible to predict.
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe claimant will routinely not be in possession of the relevant information for a proper merits assessment of the claim to take place until after the claim has been issued 
defaultor even until after permission has been granted and full disclosure has been made by the Defendant. Our experience is that disclosure from the defendant public body is routinely delayed until the Acknowledgement of Service or until the defendant serves its
default evidence after permission is granted. This reality is reflected in the Legal Aid Agency’s standard limitations on funding certificates, which requires the merits of a claim to be addressed by the claimant’s lawyers in a further application to the Agency f
defaultollowing the refusal of permission on the papers or, if permission is granted, following service of the defendant’s evidence.
default4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe time limits for bringing a judicial review are not fixed: the promptness requirement means that claimant providers may be of t
defaulthe firmly and honestly held view that a claim has been brought promptly, but the permission judge takes a different view. A claim may be knocked back because of timing, regardless of the merits of the substantive issues.
default5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvents that are beyond the control 
defaultof the claimant or his/her representatives may render the issue in dispute academic (for example, a policy change, or the actions of a third party), after the claim has been issued but before the permission stage. This has nothing to do with the merits of 
defaultthe case but will have the effect of preventing the claim from proceeding to or past permission.

default These areas of law remain in scope for civil legal aid under Part 1, Schedule 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. However, the exemptions for the residence test only apply to paragra
defaultphs
default 5, 20, 25, 26 and 27. This therefore excludes 
defaultparagraphs 6 (community care), 21 (abuse of position or powers by a public authority), 22 (breach of Convention r
defaultights by a public authority) 
defaultand 43 (claims
default under the Equality Act 2010
default). 
default The allegations have been widely reported. See for example:
