[[[Written evidence submitted by the Royal Astronomical Society (WSC048)]]]Declaration of interestsThis is the official response from the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) to the Committee inquiry into Women in STEM careers. The RAS is active in work in diversity and equalities, so has an interest in the subject of the inquiry. With the exception of our support for the Daphne Jackson Trust, we have however no direct financial relationship with the bodies referred to in this response.SummaryIntroduction&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;If the Government wishes to see faster progress in bringing and retaining women in STEM careers, it could mandate Research Councils UK to stipulate that only university departments that have obtained the status of Athena SWAN Silver or its equivalent will be eligible for research grant funding. This is already the case for NHS National Institute for Health Research and would push universities to embed practices that advance the careers of men and women on an equal basis.September 2013&#xa0; http://www.daphnejackson.org/ http://www.sheisanastronomer.org/ http://tinyurl.com/RAS-demography http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5632 and private communication, Christiane Helling Diversity in University Physics: Statistical Digest 2010Â  http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2010/page_43857.html https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-people-to-find-and-stay-in-work/supporting-pages/introducing-a-tax-free-childcare-scheme http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/oct/24/physicists-show-bias-against-female-job-applicants https://www.iop.org/policy/statistics/education/page_43188.html and private communication, Sean McWhinnie, Oxford Research and Policy http://www.sheisanastronomer.org/index.php/press/98-ewass-launch-of-she-is-an-astronomer http://www.ras.org.uk/images/stories/Publications/Big_science_for_the_big_society.pdf http://www.ras.org.uk/images/stories/Publications/beyondthestars.pdf http://www.iop.org/policy/diversity/initiatives/Juno/ http://www.athenaswan.org.uk/ http://www.crus.ch/information-programme/programme-cus-p-4-equal-opportunity-gender-studies/modul-3-dual-career-couples-dcc.html?L=2 http://gender.stanford.edu/dual-career-research-report http://www.athenaswan.org.uk/content/history-and-principles
