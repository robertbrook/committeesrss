[normal]Written evidence from Nick 
[normal]Mitcham
[normal] (TIC 092)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The last bus from Taunton to Minehead leaves at 8pm
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please Find below a copy of my letter to my MP, Ian Liddell-Grainger (to which I am still awaiting a reply) and Cllr Hugh Davies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dear Sir,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the end of this week, "First" have decided,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in their
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]draconian manner, to cease operating the last evening bus service
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]as it is no longer viable? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It seems to me to be fairly well patronized, with many relying on these services as their transport home from work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would be interested to see what figures they base this on and what the spread is over the day.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This will now leaves
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]usurers with the last service leaving Taunton at 20.00hrs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and Minehead, Bancks St at 07.45!! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Instead of the now last services leaving 22.45 and 21.30 respectfully.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have already previously seen cuts to the evening buses on this route, with the withdrawal of funding from the Somerset County Council under their
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]austerity
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]plans. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This leaving a large gap, 20.00hrs - 22.45 with the Taunton departure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, this at least keeps the ability to cover the day for people to get home. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]route and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]maintaining that coverage is essential to the community as without this flexibility it places great constrains on
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]peoples ability to get to and from work, onward travel and homeward travel. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Stranded, because of a late train or plane, and so on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"First" have their buses poster out with "Our commitment to our customers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that there should always be a bus when you need one"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Really? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They do employ a great bunch of drivers, who as you can
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]imagine, are
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]hardly
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]impressed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]with that plaster over the inside of the bus!! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The state of the buses are
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]disgraceful as they are well past their prime. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Four breakdowns last Friday and the doors jammed on the bus I was travelling on that day.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am sure that with a little imagination, a couple of the half hour services during the slack period of the day could be cut.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also, during the day, the alternative"Webbers" 18 service, which, albeit a slightly different route, is transport to Taunton, giving 2 services an hour with "First" cutting one.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I write this letter as a bus pass holder and also disabled and live on this route because of the service. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nevertheless, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]it is NOT just self interest but written on behalf of a community that will suffer in many ways with a restricted bus service in this modern day and age.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So, can you help your
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]constituents and bring some pressure to bear with at least maintaining our late night services?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I look forward to your early replies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours faithfully,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nick Mitcham.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As I hope you will note, I have made some recommendations in the context of the letter, however, I list below some further thoughts below:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the saddest aspects of this, is the people who have had jobs that have depended on the late night service, who have had to quit as their employers are unable to shuffle hours to accommodate for the lack of a bus. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](Information supplied by the Bus Drivers)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. First Buses lack a commitment to serve the Community, as of the reasons stated in my letter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.Council funding should be reviewed within terms of contract or used differently to the best advantage of the community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Relating to the above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The introduction of a Bus Credit Pass (on the Web). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You have a Bus Pass Credit Account that you can credit and then use the pass for your journeys. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There should be Residents passes (lower fares with the aid of council funding) offering different Radius miles from the address and priced accordingly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Visitors Bus Passes on a 1day/3day/1week/2week etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This will help 1. Funding for the buses. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Ease of operation for drivers and passengers alike.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am sure there are many other ways that these services can be made more viable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I must say that cutting this last service on the 28 route to Minehead 
[normal]on the 29th July, during the holiday season, is a sure fired way to lose revenue!! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On a final note, there is an X28 service that also operates direct (no visit to Watchet) that it would appear not everyone knows about. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I followed one the other week....not a soul onboard!!! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Enough said?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this proves of use in your deliberations and should require any further input I am able to offer, please feel free to contact me.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours faithfully,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nick Mitcham.
