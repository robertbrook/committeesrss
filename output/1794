defaultThe last bus from Taunton to Minehead leaves at 8pm
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease Find below a copy of my letter to my MP, Ian Liddell-Grainger (to which I am still awaiting a reply) and Cllr Hugh Davies.
default&#xa0;
defaultDear Sir,
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the end of this week, "First" have decided,
default&#xa0;
defaultin their
default&#xa0;
defaultdraconian manner, to cease operating the last evening bus service
default&#xa0;
defaultas it is no longer viable? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt seems to me to be fairly well patronized, with many relying on these services as their transport home from work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI would be interested to see what figures they base this on and what the spread is over the day.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will now leaves
default&#xa0;
defaultusurers with the last service leaving Taunton at 20.00hrs
default&#xa0;
defaultand Minehead, Bancks St at 07.45!! 
default&#xa0;
defaultInstead of the now last services leaving 22.45 and 21.30 respectfully.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have already previously seen cuts to the evening buses on this route, with the withdrawal of funding from the Somerset County Council under their
default&#xa0;
defaultausterity
default&#xa0;
defaultplans. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis leaving a large gap, 20.00hrs - 22.45 with the Taunton departure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, this at least keeps the ability to cover the day for people to get home. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis
default&#xa0;
defaultroute and
default&#xa0;
defaultmaintaining that coverage is essential to the community as without this flexibility it places great constrains on
default&#xa0;
defaultpeoples ability to get to and from work, onward travel and homeward travel. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStranded, because of a late train or plane, and so on.
default&#xa0;
default"First" have their buses poster out with "Our commitment to our customers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that there should always be a bus when you need one"
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultReally? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThey do employ a great bunch of drivers, who as you can
default&#xa0;
defaultimagine, are
default&#xa0;
defaulthardly
default&#xa0;
defaultimpressed
default&#xa0;
defaultwith that plaster over the inside of the bus!! 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe state of the buses are
default&#xa0;
defaultdisgraceful as they are well past their prime. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFour breakdowns last Friday and the doors jammed on the bus I was travelling on that day.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am sure that with a little imagination, a couple of the half hour services during the slack period of the day could be cut.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also, during the day, the alternative"Webbers" 18 service, which, albeit a slightly different route, is transport to Taunton, giving 2 services an hour with "First" cutting one.
default&#xa0;
defaultI write this letter as a bus pass holder and also disabled and live on this route because of the service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless, 
default&#xa0;
defaultit is NOT just self interest but written on behalf of a community that will suffer in many ways with a restricted bus service in this modern day and age.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo, can you help your
default&#xa0;
defaultconstituents and bring some pressure to bear with at least maintaining our late night services?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI look forward to your early replies.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultYours faithfully,
default&#xa0;
defaultNick Mitcham.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs I hope you will note, I have made some recommendations in the context of the letter, however, I list below some further thoughts below:-
default&#xa0;
default1. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the saddest aspects of this, is the people who have had jobs that have depended on the late night service, who have had to quit as their employers are unable to shuffle hours to accommodate for the lack of a bus. 
default&#xa0;
default(Information supplied by the Bus Drivers)
default&#xa0;
default2. First Buses lack a commitment to serve the Community, as of the reasons stated in my letter.
default&#xa0;
default3.Council funding should be reviewed within terms of contract or used differently to the best advantage of the community.
default&#xa0;
default4. Relating to the above. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of a Bus Credit Pass (on the Web). 
default&#xa0;
defaultYou have a Bus Pass Credit Account that you can credit and then use the pass for your journeys. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere should be Residents passes (lower fares with the aid of council funding) offering different Radius miles from the address and priced accordingly.
default&#xa0;
defaultVisitors Bus Passes on a 1day/3day/1week/2week etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will help 1. Funding for the buses. 
default&#xa0;
default2. Ease of operation for drivers and passengers alike.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI am sure there are many other ways that these services can be made more viable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI must say that cutting this last service on the 28 route to Minehead 
defaulton the 29th July, during the holiday season, is a sure fired way to lose revenue!! 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOn a final note, there is an X28 service that also operates direct (no visit to Watchet) that it would appear not everyone knows about. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI followed one the other week....not a soul onboard!!! 
default&#xa0;
defaultEnough said?
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope this proves of use in your deliberations and should require any further input I am able to offer, please feel free to contact me.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours faithfully,
default&#xa0;
defaultNick Mitcham.
