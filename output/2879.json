"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Submission by Wildlife &amp; Countryside Link &#xa0;&#xa0;\n1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWildlife and Countryside \nLink (Link) brings together 42\n voluntary organisations concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife and the countryside. Our members practise and advocate environmentally sensitive land management, and encourage respect for and enjoyment of natural landscapes and features\n, the historic and marine environment and biodiversity. Taken together our members have the support of over 8 million people in the UK and manage over 750,000 hectares of land.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLink welcomes the opportunity to respond to the \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Af\nfairs (EFRA) Select C\nommittee’s enquiry into CAP implementation 2014-2020.  \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \nresponse is supported by the following \n14\n organisations:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEach of the four UK countries \nis\n yet to determine their CAP implementation decisions and so it is impossible to determine their impact o\nn\n farm compet\niti\nveness at this point.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, Link believes that there are three crucial decisions to be taken in each country \ncontext, which\n if made well, would\n boost both farming’s environmental performance, something which is much needed given the findings of the recent ‘State of Nature’ report\n, whilst also supporting improved farm compet\nit\niveness. \nIn an English context, Link calls upon Def\nra to\n:\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLink \nfully supports\n maximum transfe\nrs from Pillar I into Pillar II\n. \n15% modulation would rebalance England’s anticipated\n, and deeply inadequate,\n Pillar II allocation and ensure existing \nagri-environment \ncommitments are honoured and new agreements can be of\nfered during the 2014-2020 period. This is \ncritical\n to ensure England’s most progressive farmers can continue to be supported through schemes which deliver clear environmental benefits\n and \ndeliver against \nkey Defra policy objectives such as those relating \nto NATURA 2000 and the Water Framework Directive. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe transfer of funding from Pillar I into Pillar II is a well-established mechanism in the UK, in use since 2001. It has been critically important in partially compensating for \nthe UK’s\n disproportionatel\ny low Pillar II allocation and the funds generated have been used to invest in more ambitious and effective rural development programmes\n.\n \nWe believe that English farmers would be at a disadvantage if they were deprived of the \nchance  to benefit from \nknowle\ndge transfer \nmeasures, sharing of \nbest practice, \naccess \nvocational training to increase skills levels, \nand to  develop \nnew market opportunities\n through on farm diversification\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) prioritised spend\ning on Environmental Stewardship schemes and given the scale of environmental need there is clear justification for continuing to do so for the successor scheme, referred to as \nNELMS.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWell-designed, targeted and funded \nagri-environment \nschemes are proven to deliver tangible \nenvironmental \nbenefits\n. The successful implementation of \nthe government’s B\niodiversity 2020 strategy \nwill be at risk \nif \nNELMS\n \nis \ninadequately resourced.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgri-environment schemes also have wider socio-economic benefi\nts. A report by \nthe \nC\nountryside and \nC\nommunity Research \nI\nnstitute\n has highlighted that \nevery £1 of Environmental Stewardship money \ngenerates a total output\n in the local economy of £1.42.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn contrast, Pillar I funds work against farm compet\nit\niveness by act\ning as an artificial buffer to market forces\n. They also\n contribute to inflated land\n and rental\n values\n, \ncreating \na hurdle to new entrants\n to farming\n.\n Even though ‘reverse modulation’ is now permitted, Link firmly believes its use in any country context woul\nd further exacerbate the negative impacts of untargeted Pillar I payments  whilst at the same time further stripping away the ability of Pillar II to address the real and pressing market failure to reward\n the delivery of\n environmental public good\ns\n. As such\n, reverse modulation should \nnot \nbe used in England, or \nin \nother UK countries.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNELMS should continue to prioritise the delivery of positive land management activities that maintain and enhance biodiversity, landscape character, and encourage public access\n \nto the countryside\n. This will not only help to address the market failure to reward the delivery of such environmental public goods but will also make a vital contribution to the \neconomic vitality of farming and rural areas, for example through tourism.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLink welcomes Defra’s intention to make NELMS more targeted, focused and ambitious relative to Environmental Stewardship and this is fully in keeping with the leadership role England has \nplayed in the development of agri-environment schemes over the last 2\n5 years. There are several key lessons to \nbe \nlearn\ned\n from Environmental Stewardship, particularly the need to ensure each agreement contains the right package of land management options to deliver the intended environmental outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven that the Defra \nwill be subject to budgetary cuts of 30 per cent, it is vital that these do not hinder the ability of Natural England to provide expert advice to farmers and land managers through the lifetime of \nscheme\n agreements. This advice should not be viewed as a negative and burdensome ‘cost’ but rather a key component of maximising the positive environmental outcomes NELMS can deliver.\n&#xa0;\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWell-designed\n ‘greening’ measures c\nould\n also contribute to\n improve\nd\n competiti\nveness \nby encouraging farmers to diversify their cropping choices and thus spreading risk. There are also several land management options, currently deployed under Environmental Stewardship but which could be delivered under Pillar I greening, which \nbenefi\nt agricultural production by supporting pollinating insects, regulating pests and supporting soil formation. In turn therefore, greening requirements \nshould\n be implemented in way\ns\n which support agricultural production and long term \ncompetitiveness\n but in o\nrder to be most effective, an ambitious approach is necessary.\n Link therefore supports the use of a National Certification Scheme (see section 5).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the UK, High Nature Value (HNV) farming – that which makes a particularly high contribution to the provision of environmental public goods - is mainly associated with low-intensity livestock systems, large\nly found in the uplands. \nDespite the environmental benefits many such systems deliver, maintaining, or indeed even reaching, economic profitability remains a challenge. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIt is also important that the Government implements part one of the Commons Act 2006\n throughout England, to ensure up to date and accurate registers of common land to provide accurate base for mapping for CAP.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are open to changes in CAP payment approaches which would uplift financial support to upland farmers \nas long as these payments\n were linked to\n environmental\n public\n goods\n \ndelivery and not simply a blanket payment which could perversely \nlead to negative environmental impacts e.g. intensification of in-bye land and under grazing of hill areas. In addition\n,\n NELMS design must ensure that appropriate uplands management options and payment rates are available to encourage the uptake of additional positive management over and above that required by Pillar I requirements.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scope\n for\n attaching environmental co\nnditionality to Pillar I payments remains limited and the tools that are available are fairly blunt. However there is potential to secure some environmental conditionality from Pillar I via a National Certification Scheme (NCS) approach to greening. This w\nould \nincrease \nthe scope to include land management \nmeasures \nthat protect and enhance upland landscapes\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe challenge for the UK’s implementing authorities will be to implement the new CAP framework so that it adequately supports and drives farmers and land mangers to address long standing environment\nal\n problems.  For \ncomplex environmental challenges complex responses are often required however this does not mean that the interface with farmers and land managers has to be complicated. Indeed we would support as user-friendly a system as possible but it is vital to recog\nnise that in order to secure effectiveness in outcomes, intelligently designed and evidence based systems of delivery will be required\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLess bureaucracy and improved environmental delivery could be secured through two approaches: opting for a simple inter\npretation of the active farmer test (see 4.2) and a National Certification Scheme (NCS) which covers all farming systems (see section 5).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nany farming \nsystems which are particularly beneficial for biodiversity and\n the provision of\n other \nenvironmental \npublic goods are characterised by very low stocking rates. Defra’s approach to implementing the active farmer test must ensure that the criteria for minimum\n activity are not set at a level which would exclude very extensive livestock producers – many of which would be found in the English uplands.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch\n has\n identified\n that\n \nCAP payments are no\nt\n \nnecessary to underpin\n \nfood production.\n Indeed, in their absence, the likely reduction i\nn food production would be less than 0.25%.\n \nW\nhere the CAP does have a clear role is to support farmers to produce food and other commodities in a sustainable way\n,\n and to adequately reward the provision of environmental \npublic goods where the market fails t\no do so.\n This is particularly important for those farming systems which are \neconomically \nmarginalised but deliver outstanding levels of public good\ns\n through their land management practices. We had hoped that the most recent round of reform would better lin\nk environmental public good delivery with CAP payments (the ‘public money for public goods’ principle) however this has failed to materialise and as such, many marginal farms remain dependant on Pillar I payments and \nthe delivery of \ntheir environmental pub\nlic good\ns\n remains largely unrewarded.   \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRather than Pillar I greening, w\ne would have preferred a \nprogressive \ntransfer of funds into Pillar II\n. However\n, we \nacknowledge that \ngreening \ncan\n and must\n \nplay \nan important role in increasing the value for money fro\nm the public spending in \nPillar I. The greening payment \nwill constitute\n one third of the Pillar I budget - £5.3 billion across the UK for the period up to 2020, or approximately £495 million in England each year alone\n.\n \nT\nhis amount of money could \ndeliver substantial environmental benefits if it is tied to meaningful environmental measures, \nb\nut if not, it will achie\nve little more than greenwash. \nThe details of greening implementation will vary across \nEngland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland\n, bu\nt there are certain principles that must be adhered to. \nLink\n \nwill only support an approach to greening that\n \nrewards\n the provision of non-marketable environmental public goods\n and \nrequir\nes\n \nall\n farmers to play their part: there must be \nno exemptions from gre\nening that are not justified on the basis o\nf sound \nenvironmental evidence.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nbelieve that the best way to implement greening in England is via \na N\national \nC\nertification \nS\ncheme\n, designed \nto implement \nmeasures\n \nthat help \nEngland’s \nvaried \nfarming systems\n addr\ness their \nparticular \nenvironmental challenges\n.\n Existing certification schemes and assurance standards should not be considered \nas providing equivalence \ndue to \nthe\n complian\nce\n issues (many are focused on production methods rather than environmental outcomes)\n \nwith \nassociated disallowance\n risks\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\ne reject th\ne\n \ninference that Pillar I greening that is tied to meaningful environmental requirements equates to ‘\ngold plating\n’.\n \nThe greening\n payment is exactly that, a payment, and not a regulatory requirement and in t\nhis instance, Defra’s obligation is not to farmers, but to taxpayers by ensuring value for money through clear environmental effectiveness. \n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe greening payment should be viewed in the same way as Pillar II agri-environment schemes are: as the means to\n u\nse public money to\n \nreward\n \nenvironmental\n public goods\n delivery\n. Whilst the nature of Pillar I payments means they are more restricted\n \nt\nhan Pillar II\n (for example they are annual and non-contractual)\n they can be \nused to r\ne\nward\n \npositive\n land management which \nin turn supports food \nsecurity by protecting\n and enhancing the\n natural resource\n base\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe willingness of farmers to enter the Higher Level Stewardship scheme demonstrates a welcome desire to undertake sophisticated environmental management delivering \nenvironmental \nobjectives.  Should this work be undone by cuts\n to Pillar II\n, valuable invest\nment will be lost.\n Therefore, continued use of maximum modulation should be a clear take-home message for the government.\n \nIn contrast, the Entry Level Scheme has delivered poor value for money.  Offering a broad and shallow scheme \nw\nithout a\ndequate checks o\nn agreement\n quality \nhas allowed numerous \nweak and unfocused agreements\n.\n \nI\nt is imperative that every \nnew scheme \nagreement offered \nprovides high quality\n environmental outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring the Health Check of the CAP in 2008, the then UK government expended sign\nificant political capital to secure the ability to implement a set-aside mitigation measure in cross\n-\ncompliance. However, when it came to implementation, the Secretary of State chose to pursue a voluntary approach instead via the Campaign for the Farmed En\nvironment (CFE). Whilst the CFE has certainly raised awareness among farmers about the best way to optimise \nenvironmental\n benefit from land management options, it did not succeed \nagainst \nits \noriginal\n \nobjectives.\n \nWe therefore urge the current government to \nlearn \nfrom \nthis experience\n of \nusing \nvoluntary approaches for environmental delivery\n. Defra fought hard for the ability to apply higher rates of modulation into Pillar II, and also to use a National Certification Scheme to implement Pillar I greening. The e\nvidence base which led Defra to prioritise these objectives during negotiations has not changed therefore making full use of both is the only logical\n course of action.\n \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/stateofnature_tcm9-345839.pdf\n Countryside and Community Research Institute (2010) \nEstimating the Incide\nntal Socio-economic Benefits of \nEnvironmental Stewardship Schemes.\n \nNowicki et al (2009) Scenar 2020-II - Update of \nAnalysis of Prospects in the Scenar 2020 Study - Contract No. 30-CE-0200286/00-21.
