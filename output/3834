[normal]Supplementary evidence from the Ministry of Justice[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence session follow-up[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the oral evidence session on 5 November I 
[normal]am 
[normal]pleased to provide additional information on the following topics
[normal] 
[normal]as requested
[normal] by the Committee. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have spoken to colleagues in 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal] and the Department for Transport 
[normal](DfT) 
[normal]and 
[normal]it is 
[normal]apparent
[normal] that consultation on this issue
[normal] is ongoing
[normal]. 
[normal]In recent years the 
[normal]Overseas
[normal] 
[normal]Territories
[normal] and 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal] have become increasingly interested
[normal] in the establishment of aircraft registers, or expanding existing aircraft registers, to target the offshore market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] While 
[normal]the DfT had
[normal] previously advi
[normal]sed
[normal] the Overseas Territories and 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal] 
[normal]on 
[normal]what is required if they run offshore registers, in light of increas
[normal]ing
[normal] interest 
[normal]they decided that they
[normal] should make a definitive statement of 
[normal]the UK’s
[normal] policy in this area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Overseas
[normal] 
[normal]Territories
[normal] and 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal] were fully consulted 
[normal]d
[normal]uring the development of this policy
[normal]. Th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]consultation with the 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal] was 
[normal]conducted
[normal] through their Directors of Civil Aviation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Earlier this year 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal] obtained quotes for insurance to meet the cost
[normal]s
[normal] of investigating accidents involving aircraft on their register in circumstances where the obligation to 
[normal]investigate
[normal] would fall
[normal] to
[normal] the state of registry of the aircraft.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Such costs arise 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]from the need to recover wreckage from the high seas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal] also sought quotes for insurance against the cost
[normal]s of
[normal] investigating accidents occurring in 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal] and its territorial waters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The insurance quotes they received in respect of accidents involving aircraft on the Guernsey register were reasonable
[normal],
[normal] but those for accidents occurring within 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal] were prohibitively expensive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Guernsey then queried whether 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal] was
[normal] expecting them to pay for the cost
[normal]s of investigating
[normal] accidents in 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]DfT
[normal] advised them that the new 
[normal]Government 
[normal]policy only covered accidents involving aircraft on the 
[normal]registers of the 
[normal]Overseas
[normal] 
[normal]Territories
[normal] and 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, 
[normal]DfT
[normal] also s
[normal]tated
[normal] that it seemed reasonable 
[normal]for
[normal] such costs 
[normal]to
[normal] be met by Guernsey rather than the 
[normal]UK
[normal] taxpayer
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he UK Air Accident’s Investigation Branch is legally responsible for carry out the investigations under 
[normal]UK
[normal] legislation extended to Guernsey, there does not appear to be any agreement on who should meet wreckage recovery or other costs arising from an accident in 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, f
[normal]ollowing further consideration 
[normal]and consultation with the 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal],
[normal] DfT
[normal] now 
[normal]consider
[normal] that it would be unreasonable to expect an 
[normal]Overseas Territor
[normal]y
[normal] or
[normal] Crown Dependenc
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]to pick up the (potentially very high) costs of 
[normal]investigating an 
[normal]accident
[normal] 
[normal]in their waters. 
[normal]G
[normal]iven the very low likelihood of such an event
[normal] and the high premiums, DfT’s view is that 
[normal]it 
[normal]would be
[normal] unreasonable for the
[normal] 
[normal]Islands
[normal] to purchase
[normal] insurance. 
[normal]DfT
[normal] are therefore 
[normal]exploring 
[normal]the 
[normal]option of 
[normal]accepting responsibility for these costs in the unlikely event of an accident occurring within the territorial waters 
[normal]of 
[normal]an 
[normal]Overseas
[normal] 
[normal]Territor
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]or 
[normal]Crown Dependenc
[normal]y
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would expect Government Departments and the 
[normal]Crown Dependencies
[normal] to work together to resolve any disagreements as to issues between themselves. Where an internal resolution is not possible, M
[normal]o
[normal]J officials are able to act as a point of reference on constitutional issues
[normal]. 
[normal]We do recognise that there are times where external support is necessary to resolve the issue and we deal with these on a case by case basis to ensure that the most appropriate part of the UK Government is able to offer assistance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Cabinet Office has never been the only po
[normal]r
[normal]t of call for dealing with constitutional issues.  However, we have in the past
[normal] sought the views of 
[normal]the Cabinet Office European lawyers
[normal] on issues regarding the interpretation of EU Law
[normal]. There may be times when other legal input is more appropriate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The issue referred to the Committee by officials in Guernsey concerns whether Customs and Excise legislation has preserved certain historic functions in relation to the 
[normal]Channel Islands
[normal], and if so whether this would provide a basis for a current data-sharing “gateway”.  In this specific instance referred to by 
[normal]Guernsey
[normal] we 
[normal]have considered, with Cabinet Office and other officials, 
[normal]the best way of obtaining clarification on the legal position and – more importantly – how to resolve the issue
[normal]. 
[normal]As
[normal] th
[normal]is particular 
[normal]matter concerns the interpretation of a piece of HMRC legislation
[normal],
[normal] we consider that 
[normal]the best 
[normal]a
[normal]pproach 
[normal]to resolving the issue is for 
[normal]MoJ officials 
[normal]to
[normal] continue to engage with HMRC and Guernsey and facilitate discussions between the
[normal]m
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]MoJ’s 
[normal]Crown Dependencies team consists of four policy officials. The team is supplemented by three lawyers who work on the Crown Dependencies and other policy areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If there are any other area
[normal]s
[normal] on which you would like further information, please do get in touch.
