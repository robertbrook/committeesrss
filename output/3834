defaultEvidence session follow-updefault&#xa0;
defaultFollowing the oral evidence session on 5 November I 
defaultam 
defaultpleased to provide additional information on the following topics
default 
defaultas requested
default by the Committee. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI have spoken to colleagues in 
defaultGuernsey
default and the Department for Transport 
default(DfT) 
defaultand 
defaultit is 
defaultapparent
default that consultation on this issue
default is ongoing
default. 
defaultIn recent years the 
defaultOverseas
default 
defaultTerritories
default and 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default have become increasingly interested
default in the establishment of aircraft registers, or expanding existing aircraft registers, to target the offshore market.
default&#xa0;
default While 
defaultthe DfT had
default previously advi
defaultsed
default the Overseas Territories and 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default 
defaulton 
defaultwhat is required if they run offshore registers, in light of increas
defaulting
default interest 
defaultthey decided that they
default should make a definitive statement of 
defaultthe UK’s
default policy in this area.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe 
defaultOverseas
default 
defaultTerritories
default and 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default were fully consulted 
defaultd
defaulturing the development of this policy
default. Th
defaulte
default 
defaultconsultation with the 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default was 
defaultconducted
default through their Directors of Civil Aviation.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultEarlier this year 
defaultGuernsey
default obtained quotes for insurance to meet the cost
defaults
default of investigating accidents involving aircraft on their register in circumstances where the obligation to 
defaultinvestigate
default would fall
default to
default the state of registry of the aircraft.
default&#xa0;
default Such costs arise 
defaultmainly 
defaultfrom the need to recover wreckage from the high seas.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultGuernsey
default also sought quotes for insurance against the cost
defaults of
default investigating accidents occurring in 
defaultGuernsey
default and its territorial waters.
default&#xa0;
default The insurance quotes they received in respect of accidents involving aircraft on the Guernsey register were reasonable
default,
default but those for accidents occurring within 
defaultGuernsey
default were prohibitively expensive.
default&#xa0;
defaultGuernsey then queried whether 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default was
default expecting them to pay for the cost
defaults of investigating
default accidents in 
defaultGuernsey
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultDfT
default advised them that the new 
defaultGovernment 
defaultpolicy only covered accidents involving aircraft on the 
defaultregisters of the 
defaultOverseas
default 
defaultTerritories
default and 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default.
default&#xa0;
default However, 
defaultDfT
default also s
defaulttated
default that it seemed reasonable 
defaultfor
default such costs 
defaultto
default be met by Guernsey rather than the 
defaultUK
default taxpayer
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe UK Air Accident’s Investigation Branch is legally responsible for carry out the investigations under 
defaultUK
default legislation extended to Guernsey, there does not appear to be any agreement on who should meet wreckage recovery or other costs arising from an accident in 
defaultGuernsey
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, f
defaultollowing further consideration 
defaultand consultation with the 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default,
default DfT
default now 
defaultconsider
default that it would be unreasonable to expect an 
defaultOverseas Territor
defaulty
default or
default Crown Dependenc
defaulty
default 
defaultto pick up the (potentially very high) costs of 
defaultinvestigating an 
defaultaccident
default 
defaultin their waters. 
defaultG
defaultiven the very low likelihood of such an event
default and the high premiums, DfT’s view is that 
defaultit 
defaultwould be
default unreasonable for the
default 
defaultIslands
default to purchase
default insurance. 
defaultDfT
default are therefore 
defaultexploring 
defaultthe 
defaultoption of 
defaultaccepting responsibility for these costs in the unlikely event of an accident occurring within the territorial waters 
defaultof 
defaultan 
defaultOverseas

default 
defaultor 
defaultCrown Dependenc
defaulty
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would expect Government Departments and the 
defaultCrown Dependencies
default to work together to resolve any disagreements as to issues between themselves. Where an internal resolution is not possible, M
defaulto
defaultJ officials are able to act as a point of reference on constitutional issues
default. 
defaultWe do recognise that there are times where external support is necessary to resolve the issue and we deal with these on a case by case basis to ensure that the most appropriate part of the UK Government is able to offer assistance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Cabinet Office has never been the only po
defaultr
defaultt of call for dealing with constitutional issues.  However, we have in the past
default sought the views of 
defaultthe Cabinet Office European lawyers
default on issues regarding the interpretation of EU Law
default. There may be times when other legal input is more appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe issue referred to the Committee by officials in Guernsey concerns whether Customs and Excise legislation has preserved certain historic functions in relation to the 
defaultChannel Islands
default, and if so whether this would provide a basis for a current data-sharing “gateway”.  In this specific instance referred to by 
defaultGuernsey
default we 
defaulthave considered, with Cabinet Office and other officials, 
defaultthe best way of obtaining clarification on the legal position and – more importantly – how to resolve the issue
default. 
defaultAs
default th
defaultis particular 
defaultmatter concerns the interpretation of a piece of HMRC legislation
default,
default we consider that 
defaultthe best 
defaulta
defaultpproach 
defaultto resolving the issue is for 
defaultMoJ officials 
defaultto
default continue to engage with HMRC and Guernsey and facilitate discussions between the
defaultm
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultMoJ’s 
defaultCrown Dependencies team consists of four policy officials. The team is supplemented by three lawyers who work on the Crown Dependencies and other policy areas. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf there are any other area
defaults
default on which you would like further information, please do get in touch.
