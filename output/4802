[normal]Written evidence from the[bold] Police and Crime Commissioner for North Wales [CST0050][bold]&#xa0;[bold]What, if any, targets do you set for your police force?  What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?[bold]In my Police 
[normal]and Crime Plan I do not set any numerical targets for North Wales Police Force to achieve.
[normal]------------------------------------------[bold]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?  To what extent can you trust the cr[bold]ime statistics for your area?[bold]North Wales Police employ a “Crime Registrar” whose role it is to monitor and audit recorded crime figures. The Registrar maintains an Audit Plan, which is used to ensure that North Wales Police follows a consistent and accura
[normal]te process to record crime.  Information from the Audit Plan is shared directly with my Office.  
[normal]In November 2013, I raised the national issue of the integrity of police crime statistics at a Senior Executive Board meeting.  (The Senior Executive Board is
[normal] the key forum where, amongst other things, I hold the Chief Constable to account).  I explained the importance of scrutinising crime recording processes and that as North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner I must be satisfied that these processes are fit
[normal] for purpose. 
[normal]On 4
[normal]th
[normal] December 2013 I received a briefing by the Chief Superintendent of Corporate Services to explain the processes North Wales Police use to ensure the robustness of their crime recording activity.
[normal]North Wales Police have a Crime 
[normal]Recording User Group which is chaired and attended by senior officers within the Force.  The terms of reference for the group include the following:
[normal]Aims and Objectives [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]It is now agreed that my Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner attend that meeting for scrutiny purposes.
[normal]I have long been aware that the principles North Wales Police apply to th
[normal]eir crime recording processes are not necessarily applied to the same extent in other police forces.  This has 
[normal]sometimes led to comparatively less favourable crime statistics for North Wales and is a matter that has been raised by North Wales Police and my
[normal]self with HMIC.  
[normal]From what we know at present there is nothing to indicate that we should not trust the crime statistics maintained by 
[normal]N
[normal]orth 
[normal]W
[normal]ales Police.  However, as stated above we are in the process of increasing scrutiny with regard to this subject.
