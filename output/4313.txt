[[[About the RSPB ]]]The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (the RSPB) is the largest wildlife conservation organisation in Europe with over one million members. We believe that sustainability should be at the heart of decision-making. The RSPB’s policy and practical work covers a wide range of issues including agriculture, water, climate change, energy, planning  and marine issues. We also manage one of the largest conservation estates in the UK, covering c.143, 000 hectares. Around sixty of our reserves are farmed, covering more than 20,000 hectares, with around 170 tenant farmers, and 200 employees. We protect and enhance habitats such as lowland farmland, heather moorland, lowland heath, wet grassland, estuaries and reed beds, and our reserves help to protect 63 of the 77 most rare or threatened breeding birds in the UK. 

[[[Summary]]]Food security is an issue in the UK, not because there is a lack of food but because of poverty and inequality.  In the long-term, food security ultimately depends on maintaining the productive capacity of agriculture and therefore is inherently linked to the concept of sustainability. One of the major threats to future food security is the unsustainable nature of the current global food system. Environmental degradation presents a real threat to the UK’s food security because it undermines the UK’s ability to produce food.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; UK (and EU) food security would best be improved by a complete overhaul of the current agriculture and food policy framework to ensure its long term sustainability. A series of high level reports have highlighted the need for a transition to a more sustainable agricultural model. The current system receives high levels of public support but fails to work in the public interest. The Natural Capital Committee recently highlighted that the UK’s natural capital assets are in decline at an unprecedented rate. These assets underpin long term productivity. Urgent action is needed to shift the production model on to a more sustainable footing. 1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Government should build on the findings of the National Ecosystem Assessment and recognise that agriculture should be appropriate to the natural environment which underpins it. Food production is one of a suite of services that society needs from land and we should aim for the optimal balance between this range of services. Focussing solely on maximum food production and efficiency could jeopardise the natural resources which underpin production.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Although it is clearly important to use resources efficiently to avoid waste, when determining the best approach to secure long term production targets efficiency must not be the primary driver. Efficiency – based on extreme specialisation – can result in decreased resilience within the farming system. Instead the overarching aim must be to achieve sustainable food production to ensure long term food production. 1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; An approach which considers only the efficiency of certain elements of the system could result in approaches which are fundamentally unsustainable in the long term, fail to make best use of the land in a given area nor deliver the greatest benefit for society and indeed could be more susceptible to failure due to a lack of resilience (see discussion below).1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no single correct approach to more sustainable agricultural system. Farms should ensure that the levels and type of production respect and operate within environmental limits, recognising and responding to the particular tensions with environment that exist in its location. There are a number of considerations which can help guide decisions. Any farm which is seeking to be sustainable should aim to: enhance soil quality; protect and enhance carbon stores; enhance and sustain wildlife; utilise a variety of crop types and livestock breeds to maintain genetic diversity; minimise direct and indirect Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (in total terms and not just per unit of output including carbon sequestration and storage impacts), eliminate pollution and adverse impacts on the water environment and not compromise the ability of other countries to manage their own land sustainably.1.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; A consideration of all these elements undoubtedly adds to the complexity of the task but will also ensure that we are investing in approaches which secure our natural resources and food security in the longer term. 1.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to improving the sustainability of production there is a need to encourage the uptake of a more sustainable diet to make the best use of land and tackle the epidemic of diet related illness which afflicts those on western style diets (characterised by high intakes of red meat and dairy, sugary and high-fat foods, refined grains and processed meat). The predicted rise in demand for food – potentially doubling by 2050 - comes not primarily from increasing populations but from changing diets. The rise of the middle classes in countries such as China and India will result in a demand for diets richer in meat putting increased demand on the global food system. To ensure that the UK is leading the way in demonstrating integrated policy which recognises the importance of sustainable consumption as part of solution to food security government must take action to facilitate the uptake of more sustainable dietary choices. The recent green food project developed a set of principles for a sustainable diet which should be developed and communicated to highlight the importance of changing our diets for society’s health and that of the environment.  2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; If we are to achieve a sustainable food and farming system it is important that the price of food accurately reflects the costs of producing it and any public subsidies are transparent and clear in their aims. The negative externalities of unsustainable production systems should be reflected in the price of food rather than being paid for elsewhere. Alongside a robust regulatory baseline this will benefit sustainable producers, improve our long term food security, increase resilience through more diversity in farming systems and reduce the likelihood of extreme price fluctuations.  For example, the reliance of intensive livestock production in the UK on imported protein means these systems lack resilience and are vulnerable to increases in input prices.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is insufficient transparency and clarity about where the money goes to in the food and farming system, both in terms of money paid at the till and public funding and the impacts on the health of our countryside. The complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy is a barrier to understanding of the impact of this policy on the environment, while lack of transparency in the food supply chain makes choosing sustainable options difficult. The public’s ability to discriminate between options in order to support more sustainable producers is made difficult. The result of this is that the most sustainable  farmers are disadvantaged. There needs to be much greater transparency, awareness and accountability within the food system to correct this imbalance. 2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is often a lack of clarity over where consumers money goes within the food supply chain. An organic lamb can be sold in major retailers at £13.98/kg, but the farmer who produced it on the hills of a National Park, using no inputs and extensively reared, receives only £1.98/kg, often the same as non-organic producers higher input systems. Greater transparency within the food system is needed to enable the public to better understand where their money is going by creating clear lines of accountability between producers, processors, retailers, shoppers and taxpayers. This would provide clarity on which sectors get most 'value-added' down the food chain, and help ensure that a fair share of the cost of food flows to the most sustainable primary growers and farmers. 2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no shortage of food in the UK today but there are people who are unable to eat a good diet as they are unable to afford it or access it. Producing more food at the expense of our environments health and potentially public health, is not a solution to this problem. The Marmot review into social-related health inequalities in England, ‘Fair Society, Healthy Lives’, sets out a framework for action to ensure social justice, health and sustainability are at the heart of all policies. Recommendations include promoting sustainable local communities, access to good quality green space and sustainable food production.3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Government statistics show that the UK is over 60% self-sufficient in food (or over 70% if you consider only the foods that can actually be grown here). By comparison, we were less than 50% self sufficient for much of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. So although the UK is more self reliant than it was we are still part of the global market and as such will be subject to the fluctuations which exist. The UK can play a role in helping to reduce the impact of these fluctuations by developing a more sustainable and resilient approach to our domestic agricultural system and so reducing our reliance on imported feedstocks and the exposure of our food and farming systems to external shocks, be they economic, physical or environmental. 3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK should play a leading role in the international policy debate to eliminate harmful policies such as those which result in biofuels driving up commodity prices. Future volatility will be connected to extreme weather events or shifts in growing conditions linked to climate change. Therefore food security policies will be increasingly dependant on international action to secure a global deal limiting dangerous climate change, and on domestic action to ensure sustainable adaptation to new climate conditions for agriculture in the UK.4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Science has an important role to play in developing a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system to ensure future UK food security. The UK could take a leading role in developing new models of sustainable agriculture which meet the need to produce enough to feed a growing population within environmental limits. In order to achieve this research must take a broad perspective and fully address the environmental impacts as well as the agronomic. Currently there is an issue that research is siloed and as such fails to take account of the multifunctional nature of agriculture.  Research should focus on sustainable production methods which address both farm, farming system and landscape levels. It is vital that the use of any technology does not lead to further narrowing of the range of crops grown: diversity is key to ensuring resilience in the face of unpredictable change. 4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; With regard to GM technology there may be potential for GM crops which contribute to a more sustainable agricultural system however this has not been the focus of developments to date, indeed the predominant GM crops are those which facilitate the use of agrochemicals which can damage soil and do not encourage integrated pest control. In developing and implementing new research the following considerations should be taken into account:4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a need to improve the dissemination of research findings through effective knowledge transfer systems to ensure that reaches farmers and to allow them to adapt their farming systems accordingly.5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; The horsemeat scandal at the start of this year highlighted both the importance of transparency within supply chains, and the need for effective oversight. The ability to trace the provenance of food is key both to maintaining consumer trust and understanding the environmental impact of a product. Shorter more transparent food chains are essential to develop a better understanding of where the money goes within the food system for a range of products as discussed above. Shorter supply chains would help enhance traceability and build trust, but also to allow environmentally friendly farming to be supported via more direct connections to markets.5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; A better understanding of the true costs of production can help improve resilience in its broadest sense, through a better understanding of the weaknesses in the system. A more detailed exploration of the importance of resilience is given below.6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; In the UK climate change is predicted to result in increased temperatures and increased rainfall extremes, however it is not clear what this will mean for crop yields. It is expected that the UK will remain food secure over the next 40 years. Building resilience into the farming sector will be an important strategy to minimise both economic and output losses due to extreme weather events. 6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no consensus on a definition of resilience – the ability to absorb shock and, in some definitions the ability to change or reorganise as a response to such a shock is often cited. It has been described as the ability of social-ecological systems, both to withstand perturbations from, for instance, climate or economic shocks, and to rebuild and renew itself afterwards. Loss of resilience can cause loss of valuable ecosystem services.6.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Society and institutions often find it difficult to shift to more resilient models. There are many reasons for this. The fact we work in hierarchies and silos may make it difficult to understand the interconnections and potential benefits of different approaches.  In agriculture, the use of monocultures where diversity is denied in the pursuit of economies of scale can make change difficult. Another reason is the attraction of focusing on efficiency and short term profit maximisation, this increases the risk that economic models quickly buckle when stress is applied. Finally a failure to invest in appropriate infrastructure to underpin more resilient models can present an obstacle. 6.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to overcome these issues we need to accept the complexity of systems and rather than seek to oversimplify them, better recognise the multiple benefits which are delivered by such systems,  e.g. sustaining biodiversity, living within ecological boundaries and  generating social capital. 6.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; For example UK agriculture’s increasing specialisation into specific farming types, contraction of crop rotations, increased stocking density and reduction of genetic diversity have all had profound environmental impacts. They have also made the system more brittle in that: 6.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; One approach to address these problems is to look for down-stream fixes eg building new reservoirs and develop new pesticides and drugs. While such actions can be useful, a more cost effective approach may be to seek to address the fundamental risk of failure which could have devastating consequences in a highly specialised agricultural system. Building resilience through seeking alternative environmentally sustainable approaches, such as by extending crop rotations, using integrated pest management and introducing traditional breeds less reliant on inputs although more complex, can deliver a wider range of beneficial outcomes and reduce the potential impacts of extreme weather events.6.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; Investment in ever more efficient approaches without a proper assessment of alternative approaches can result in sector becoming ‘locked in’ to unsustainable approaches and therefore being unable to deliver a broader range of benefit to society.7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; In the short term in the UK we don’t need to increase production, we need to make it more sustainable – environmentally, economically and socially. Simply pursuing increased production does not necessarily result in increased profit and is not good for farmers, society or the environment. What is vital is creating value - for society and for farm businesses - in sustainable ways. Food is not the only output from our agricultural system; there are a range of other services that matter to us all, such as water quality, carbon storage, flood alleviation, the landscape, recreation, employment, high animal welfare and wildlife habitats. But the market often fails to distinguish between those providing these wider benefits to society, and those who are not. Often farmers seeking to be more sustainable are unable to compete with those farming in a less sustainable way.7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The £3bn public funding for UK agriculture via the Common Agricultural Policy should be supporting farmers to become more sustainable and rewarding them for the wider public goods they produce. But only a tiny proportion of this expenditure represents good value for the public purse by being targeted to sustainable farmers. 7.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Increasing agricultural specialisation, driven by a narrow focus on efficiency, has resulted in polarisation of production and the loss of mixed, rotational farming that has underpinned good soil, crop and animal husbandry for centuries. Historically farms utilised rotations which build soil and circulate nutrients. Mixed farms now find it difficult to compete with the extremely specialised arable and livestock systems as the benefits of mixed systems and the externalities (soil degradation, feed and nutrient imports) of intensive systems, are not reflected in our current economic model. This specialisation, concentration on just a few major commodity crops and reliance on imported protein (the EU is already reliant on importing three-quarters of protein-rich feed) has left limited diversity, which combined with increasingly unpredictable extremes of weather, leaves food production vulnerable and lacking resilience.7.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Understanding and encouraging such complexity in the farming sector relies on skilled advisors. Too often the provision of advice is now left to those with vested interests and narrow specialities. In order to support the shift to a more sustainable agricultural system a well informed, impartial advisory network is required.  7.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; This shift should be underpinned by the infrastructure required for mixed, sustainable agriculture systems such as more small and medium sized abattoirs, to enable shorter chains and trustworthy traceability.8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Within this submission we have referred to a number of actions we believe are required to support a thriving UK agricultural system. These include better direction of support payments, investment in skills, training and advisory support to better equip the industry to pursue a more sustainable approach and investment in infrastructure to underpin this shift. 8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; A change in peoples eating habits to more sustainable diets as described above would also improve our self sufficiency. However reducing use of cereals and oilseeds in animal feed through less intensive livestock farming could make the UK more self-sufficient in these crops and would reduce reliance on imported protein. More sustainable diets would also benefit UK horticulture through increased demand for vegetables.&#xa0;&#xa0; Foresight future of food http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf&#xa0; IAASTD http://www.europarl.europa.eu/webnp/webdav/users/jribot/public/JCM%20Agriculture/IAASTD%20Report.pdf UNEP Avoiding future farmines  http://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/avoidingfamines/&#xa0; The Natural Capital Committee http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/files/State-of-Natural-Capital-Report-2013.pdf PNAS Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture David Tilmana,1, Christian Balzerb, Jason Hillc, and Belinda L.
