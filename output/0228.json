More than three quarters of respondents believed that there was significant risk of miscarriages of justice within the current system. It is highly significant that two high profile errors were identified \na matter of weeks \nafter\n \nthe prophetic \npublication of the New Scientist report (see next section). The New Scientist survey demonstrated the importance of discovering the morale and opinions of \nemployees. \nIn the interests of restoring public confidence, I would recommend that a new survey is initiated to discover if the position has improved. \n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe loss of quality predicted by the New Scientist review came to fruition with two high profile cases \n in: \n‘wrongful arrest of Adam Scott’\n[\n5\n]\n and the \ncontamination event combined with a \ntransposition error in \n‘Death of \nGareth Williams\n’\n[\n6\n,\n7\n]\n. Both errors were the result of \nbad practice (clearly not following international guidelines\n e.g.\n[\n8\n]\n \n) \n– \n in particular, \nignoring negative controls that give DNA profiles (Scott); failure to check results before uploading to the national DNA database (Williams\n).\nA zero error rate is scientifically untenable\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regulator review was critical of the offending laboratory but \nsuggested\n that no further contamination incidents \nwere\n present in a batch of 26,000 samples\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther work is needed, however. \nTo clarify the position: \nt\nhe\nre is no test for contamination (the effect is hidden) \nand it is not possible to equate \nthe\n (presumed)\n regulator’s view of \n‘\nabsence of evidence\n’\n \nwith ‘evidence of absence’.  \nIn a\n (contradictory) \n piece of work to understand the mechanisms and impact of contamination\n,\n \nGill \nand Kirkham\n[\n9\n]\n \n, working under FSS auspices\n,\n showed that it was possible to estimate contamination rates, but \nit is \nnot\n possible to identify \nwhich\n samples were contaminated. \nA review carried out under FSS auspices on a typical casework process demonstrated a contamination rate \nof 1 in 1000 samples analysed\n. \nNot all contamination events lead to errors of interpretation, however\n[\n9\n]\n.\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n zero error rate for commercial providers\n is scientifically untenable\n \n(\nnote that the statistic quoted in Scott was 1 in 1 billion, and ignored the possibility of error\n)\n. There needs to be \npro-active\n assessment of error rates that \nshould\n be disclosed and published.\nWhat should be the role of the forensic science regulator?9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClearly the regulator role \ncan\nnot \nproperly function\n in isolation but needs to be part of a coherent centralised organisation that is devoted to forensic science. \nIn previous submissions to the committee I recommended that the \ncore functions: research, regulation/accreditation, \nand \nstandards\n,\n \nwere\n subsumed and coordinated centrally \nby\n a national centre of excellence\n[\n10\n]\n. \n \nForensic science is rapidly changing and improving. This means that there needs to be a mechanism in place to implement research into casework \n– implementation\n needs to be simultaneous across UK laboratories. \nThis is difficult to achieve within a highly fragmented environment. \nT\nhe \nnecessary \ninfrastructure required to validate and \nto \nimplement new technology to the same standards across providers does not \ncurrently \nexist\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe way forward\n&#xa0;10)\n&#xa0; \nW\ne \nmust \naccept that the FSS (as it existed) was no longer fit for purpose, but \nit seems obvious that the core functions could have been preserved in a national centre of excellence\n (UK could also have retained its international ra\nn\nking and associated credibility by this route)\n. This course of action would have resulted in divestment of routine casework activities to commercial organisations, but the new centre would have retained the ability to carry out analysis of complex casework requiring novel technology that \nis not used by any commercial provider. This is because the profit motive precludes use of any technique that \nis loss-making\n. \nThis has resulted in a \nrapidly growing technology-gap \nin the UK. For example implementation of \nlatest \nnew body fluid markers (RNA), mitochondrial DNA analysis; Y chromosome analysis; informative SNP ancestry markers are not in routine use\n11)\n&#xa0; \nThere is a concern that the Home Office exerts undue influence over the regulator and the role should be remote and independent from \nthis government body\n. \n Otherwise conflict of interest may arise.\n12)\n&#xa0; \nThere is a concern that the regulator role is restricted to committee discussions without the necessary resources to implement recommendations\n.\n13)\n&#xa0; \nThere should be much more focus on discovery of error rates and limitations of evidence. The information should be in the public domain.\n14)\n&#xa0; \nAs a prime example: t\nhere needs to be much more \npro-active\n assessment of laboratories to prevent errors \noccurring\n. \n \nNote that the laboratory involved with the Scott and Williams cases was fully accredited by the authorities, but this did not prevent catastrophic failure. \nThe \nregulator \nresponse to the \nScott case \nwas\n \nmainly \nre\n-\nactive\n. \nHowever, we must recognise that t\nhere is an implied \nweakness \nwithin the \naccreditation\n/regulatory process \nitself \nin that it failed to detect major deviance from acceptable laboratory practice\n in the first place\n . \nIn a recent review by Gill et al\n \n[\n11\n]\n, under \nUK \nregulator auspices, \nit was proposed to develop three over-arching ‘assessor’ roles\n (if properly resourced, this will  begin to address the concerns)\n. The new roles are\n:\n15)\n&#xa0; \nHowever, s\nignificant resources are required to implement the points above (in a purely commercial environment this is quite challenging\n).\n \nAlso this is further evidence of the need for a UK centre of excellence to take over the combined roles of research/implementation/ standards etc.\n&#xa0;\nList of references[1]\nhttp://www.researchresearch.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;template=rr_2col&amp;view=article&amp;articleId=1085593\n.\n[2] \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22658771\n.\n[3] \nhttp://www.enfsi.eu/\n.\n[4] \nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328514.600-forensic-failure-miscarriages-of-justice-will-occur.html\n.\n[5] \nhttp://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/fsr/dna-contam-report?view=Binary\n.\n[6] \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17826633\n.\n[7] \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Gareth_Williams\n.\n[8]\nhttp://www.enfsi.eu/sites/default/files/documents/bylaws/guidance_document_for_best_practice_manuals.pdf\n.\n[9]\nhttp://projects.nfstc.org/workshops/resources/literature/Amplification/27_Development%20of%20a%20Simulation%20Model%20to%20Assess%20the.pdf\n.\n[10] \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/855/855vw19.htm\n.\n[11] \nhttp://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/fsr/interpretation-of-dna-evidence?view=Binary\n.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n"
