defaultThe structure of the Northern Ireland banking sector is fundamentally different to the rest of the UK where we have a high degree of foreign ownership and relatively small banks dominating our local market.
default 
defaultOf our four main banks, only U
defaultlster 
defaultB
defaultank is UK owned, by RBS. But Ulster Bank operates in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and it is headquartered in Dublin. Its recent performance and financial strength reflects the totality of its operations and it had been the worst
default performing part of the RBS group for some time now. First Trust Bank is owned by the Irish based Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland (UK) is also Irish owned while Danske Bank is Danish owned.
default 
defaultTherefore our main banks are all subject to the decisions o
defaultf parent banks based outside the region, and indeed outside of the UK. The Irish position has a huge influence on us given the close links between our economies, banking sectors, and property markets.
default 
defaultThe property boom and bust in Northern Ireland has lef
defaultt our banking sector severely constrained
default.

default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile Barclays, HSBC, and Santander also have a presence in Northern Ireland, this is largely as a result of the acquisition of former building societies which tend to have a relatively small share of the local
default business banking market.
default 
defaultI would like to see greater competition in this segment of the market and believe a growth in the share of banks such as these, which are more prominent in GB, would be a means of achieving that.
default 
defaultAll these banks have indicated t
defaulto us that they would like to grow their operations here.
default 
defaultBut this is currently being constrained by their understandable reluctance to refinance distressed property debt that is an issue for many local businesses here. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Republic of Ireland’s National
default Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is 
defaultan 
defaultadded factor in Northern Ireland. While we initially had concerns about the impact that NAMA could have on the local property market, 
defaultwe have 
defaultsought and received repeated assurances from both the NAMA Chairman and Iris
defaulth Finance Ministers that the Agency would not engage in any ‘firesale’ of Northern Ireland assets. Generally speaking I believe the Agency is taking a long term strategic approach in the management of Northern Ireland based assets. Indeed, I believe NAMA i
defaults playing a positive role in Northern Ireland. It 
defaulthas 
defaultmade significant funding available for the development of assets in Northern Ireland, offers vendor finance for potential buyers of commercial property, and is currently exploring how its 80/20 Deferred
default Payment Initiative for mortgages might be extended to Northern Ireland. All of which will help in stimulating activity in the local property market.

default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultI recently wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer outli
defaultning my views in relation to the future of Ulster Bank. In that correspondence I outlined how Ulster Bank is crucially important to the Northern Ireland economy and the competitiveness of our local banking sector and relatively more so, in my view, than RB
defaultS would be to the UK economy.
default 
defaultIt is our leading bank with over 30% market share, just under eighty branches and over seven hundred thousand customers of which almost fifty thousand are corporate customers.
default 
defaultIt is the only 
defaultone of our four major players tha
defaultt is UK owned and is often the only one of our banks that offers access to the UK government initiatives to improve access to finance.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe Parliamentary Commission Report on Banking Standards’ conclusion that the weak capital position of RBS was impai
defaultring its ability to support the UK’s economic recovery can only be magnified for Ulster Bank where the level of losses has been greater and over 40 per cent of its portfolio is non-performing. While a large proportion of this is attributable to Ulster Bank
default’s activities in the Republic of Ireland this can mean the application of lending policies in Northern Ireland that are unnecessarily restrictive
default. 
defaultIt has been my Departments position for some time now that urgent Government action is needed to resolve Ulst
defaulter Bank’s issues. How that is achieved is a matter for the Treasury, but I have made it clear to the Chancellor that I believe it would be hugely damaging for us if all of Ulster Bank was placed in any sort of ‘bad bank’ which might not then be in a positi
defaulton to function in a way which was in the interests of the NI economy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThis is an issue my department have been engaging with both the Irish Department for Finance and NAMA on. In June, my predecessor both met with the Irish Minister for Finance and wrote to the Chair of NAMA to 
defaultpress for NAMA (for whom the IBRC were previous
defaultly managing assets already acquired by the Agency under a Service Level Agreement up until 30
defaultth
default June 2013) and Capita (appointed by NAMA then as servicer of those loans) to adopt an operational model where some element of this work, and the jobs that go wi
defaultth that, is Belfast based. This we argued would enable the Agency and Capita to draw on and benefit from the local knowledge and expertise of the current workforce and also maintain important debtor relationships. Since then it has been confirmed that such
default an operational model with a presence in Belfast has been established and I understand a number of former IBRC staff have taken positions in Capita.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultAccess to Finance has been a huge concern for my Department for a number of years now and we have 
defaultraised
default this numerous times with Treasury Ministers over that time. I strongly believe this is acting as a constraint on our economic recovery and is a matter 
defaultthat needs to be addressed. The issue of Access to Finance has been extensively raised by the business community in consultations with Ministers and there are strong concerns that banks are not responding to the finance requirements of business. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultMy D
defaultepartment and the previous Finance Minister met with the seven prominent banks operating in Northern Ireland, each of whom indicated that they did have money to lend, but cited depressed demand as an issue. Businesses on the other hand suggest that the ban
defaultks are operating in a manner where the cost and conditions attached to credit are prohibitive and I am sure that this is a major factor also – and one which could also be discouraging potential demand. This situation was recognised in March 2013 report by 
defaultthe Independent Economic Advisory Group (established by the Northern Ireland Enterprise Minister).
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultWithout more detailed information on this from the banks it is difficult to assess the degree to which a lack of bank lending is impacting on the abilit
defaulty of businesses to access the finance they need to continue to trade and grow. The Executive does have an Access to Finance Strategy in place, led by DETI and Invest NI to assist with targeted inventions where appropriate. But the availability of bank lend
defaulting is central to this and is crucial for our economy and SMEs in particular.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultFurthermore, we have been disappointed at the implementation of the Better Business Finance Taskforce recommendations in Northern Ireland and in particular the uptake of the
default mentoring scheme and the independent appeals process. This is a matter I will be raising with the BBA Chief Executive Anthony Browne when I meet him in September.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultThe struc
defaultture of the banking sector in Northern Ireland has limited the effectiveness of the initiatives that are being taken nationally by both the Bank of England and the Government to improve the liquidity of the banking sector in order to get the 
defaultbanks
default lending 
defaultagain.
default 
defaultOur local foreign owned banks, while part of larger groups, have relatively small UK operations which can mean that participation in national schemes is either not feasible or financially advantageous. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultAs such, Ulster Bank as part of RBS has 
defaultoften been the only one of our ‘big four banks’ to participate in these initiatives in Northern Ireland. However, the reserved nature of banking means there is little the Executive can do here. And while the latest scheme in this regard, Funding for 
defaultLendin
defaultg,
default was more positively received by our local banks it too was only operational in the Ulster Bank until recent
defaultly
default when the Bank of Ireland joined. The other banks have also been in discussions with the Bank of England in this regard but progress has been sl
defaultow.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultSo not withstanding this recent progress, the continued failure of such schemes locally is a matter that my Department continues to press with the Treasury. My predecessor had also raised this on numerous occasions with Ministers there calling for
default a tailored regional response to be taken to address this problem.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultHowever I am encouraged that the Government has recognised this in the recent Economic Pact between the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government, 
defaultBuilding a Prosperous and Unit
defaulted Community
default, which acknowledged the significant challenges facing Northern Ireland banks, and the difficulties in accessing finance that remain a major concern for local businesses. In particular, the Pact includes a commitment to create a Joint Ministeri
defaultal Taskforce to lead work examining whether tailored support is required for Northern Ireland’s banks and how we can maximise support for businesses in Northern Ireland.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultThe Pact also outlines that the Government and the Business Bank will work with t
defaulthe Executive to support lending to businesses in Northern Ireland. The Business Bank will work with finance providers in Northern Ireland to deliver products that provide relevant solutions to the access to finance difficulties in the region, as part of it
defaults role in boosting access to finance across the UK. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultThe lack of transparency around bank lending data has been a problem for a number of years now and another area where my Department has been p
defaultressing for progress on. And while the British Bankers Association (BBA) 
defaultdo
default now provide me with some quarterly data on business lending to SMEs on a confidential 
defaultbasis -- 
defaultwhich includes data on new lending, data on the total stock of lending, and data on t
defaulthe numbers
default of applications and approvals 
default- it is limited. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultDFP has been calling for a more comprehensive breakdown of lending data by banks operating in Northern Ireland - both in terms of coverage and scope - and the banks and BBA have indicated that
default they have been exploring how this could be provided. However, progress on this has been slow. This is a matter I will be following up on when I meet with the BBA Chief Executive Anthony Browne later in September. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultI fully appreciate that banks need to examine their cost base as they seek to restructure their operations. However, I have been concerned at the branch closures announced in recent times, and in particular the impact of this in rural communities.
default 
defaultMy 
defaultpredecessor raised the issue of rural access with all four main banks here as part of his ongoing series of meetings with banks. And this is an issue I will continue to monitor and press local banks on in terms of their maintaining a strong rural presence 
default– particularly for elderly customers, who may not be as willing to use remote banking services and still require a face-to-face service.
