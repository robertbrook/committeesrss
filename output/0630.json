"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Anthony Trewavas FRS, FRSE (CLC016)&#xa0;\n1.This short paper is written by Professor Anthony Trewavas FRS, FRSE, Academia Europea\n. It\n is in response to a request from the Science and Technology committee for information on why the public seem disinclined to go along with its policy on climate change. That assumes its policy is correct, I see a need to be more circumspect. \nIn summary, the following are outlined.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nUnless otherwise stated\n,\n the \nclimate \nevidence to which I refer is to be found on http://climatedata.info and its various subsections on proxies, ice cores, etc.\n This site provides a scientifically\n-\nbalanced introduction to climate data.\nThe Difference between Projection and Prediction\n3. \nThat there are problems with \nthe \npublic perception of climate change is not surprising and results from the common confusion between pr\nedictions \nand pr\nojections.\n  \nA prediction is a defined future; \ninstead, \na projection \nis \nwhat might happen\n.\n \nIt is the difference between \ncertainty and \npossibility. \nU\nnpredictable events, large volcanic eruptions, asteroids can destroy all attempts at pr\nediction \nas can changes in technology.  \n4. \nHydraulic fracturing \nis just one \ninstance; its introduction \nhas \nmade nonsense of many predictions\n of fossil fuel \nlimit\nations of natural \ngas resources and \nalso \ninadvertently reduced USA emissions\n*\n. \nThere will be other technologi\ncal advances\n; we are a highly creative species.\n*\n[\nA\nny scrutiny of the US governments EIA (environmental information administration) would have indicated several centuries worth of technically recoverable reserves of coal, oil or gas].\n \n5. \nClimate models can only provide projections, they are not predictions. Confusion between these different words has led to many \nclimat\ne \nmodels \nbeing presented \nby government\n, NGO’s \nand some scientists\n \nas predictions\n.\n No doubt those scientists\n,\n who did so\n,\n were well meaning\n. They admitted sometimes to exaggerating effects to convince the public. But \nt\nhe \nrole \nof science is to provide unbiased\n,\n balanced assessments\n.\n If the public are told that climate science predicts continual warming then several \nvery \ncold winters, lead\ns\n to rejection of the \nclaim\n.  \nThe complexity of climate \nrender\ns\n \npredictions \nimpractica\nb\nl\ne\n \nand there is \nneed for honesty and transparency about the uncertainties of climate change.\n What was omitted was that climate models \nat best \nonly offer probabilities\n, something it was felt the public would not understand.  \nThe essence of science is scepticism.  \n6. \nSceptical assessments form the basis of scientific progress. \nModels are only as good as the information put into them. Questioning climate models is an essential part of progress on understanding.\n7. \nThose who produced climate models should have been those most vigorous in attacking their own hypotheses and making others aware of their limitations. That is how scientific knowledge expands. Instead as the unfortunate case at the University of East Anglia showed, this group were acting as cheerleaders of their own modelling even to the extent of attempting to d\namage \nthe credibility of those that questioned what they had published. \n8. \n \nT\nhe term Denier or Denialist \nto describe sceptics \nis indicative of the closed mind and a term of abuse for the scientific process.  It \nis \nreminiscent of Galileo’s problem with the inquisition in the 16\nth\n century and politicians of all kinds should have slapped the term down.  \n9. \nThe last IPCC in 2007\n indicated \nthat there were some 20 or so different models\n, projecting estimates anywhere from 1.5 to 6\n◦\n C for \neither \n2100\n or a doubling of CO\n2 \nlevels\n. T\nhat in itself should have\n negated \nthe notion of climate models as predictions\n. It \nindicate\ns\n climatological uncertainty\n.  The\n variety results from different \nbasic \nassumptions \nbut given there is only one future, \nonly one\n model \n or none can actually \nprove \nright.\n \nCan climate models be tested or refuted.\n10. \nKarl Popper laid down some simple criteria of a scientific enterprise. What is proposed must be capable of being tested or refuted.  \nWhereas normal science is experimental and conforms readily with Popper’s description of easy refutation, climatology is reduced to modelling only and \nthus suffers inevitable uncertainties\n \nbecause knowledge is incomplete\n. \nThe extent of ignorance is unknown.\n \nT\nhe only way \na climate model \ncan be refuted is to compare the projections over suitably long periods of time (15-20 years)  with actual climate observations.  \nIf policy is based on models\n,\n as is the case\n,\n \nthere is a large inherent risk that after 20 years the policy will have been seen to be wrong because the model was inaccurate\n.\n Is this not now \nbeginning to be \nthe case?\n11. \nAll the models proposed in the late 90’s and early noughties have so far proved poor predictors of climate temperature variation and I refer to the apparent stasis in temperature from 1998 onwards. \nA similar period \nof\n stasis occurred in the 1940’s and in both cases atmospheric CO\n2\n continued to climb. \nIf this coming year continues\n,\n \nas the previous 12-14\n years\n,\n \nthen the 95% \nconfidence level \naround the current common mean \nprojected \nclimate temperature\n,\n will have been breached\n (\nE. \nHawkins. \nwww.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2013/updated-comparison-of-simulations-and-observations\n)\n.  \n[A breach of the 95% confidence level  indicates a probability of less than 1 in 20 and is usually used in all areas of statistics to indicate \nhigh significance\n].\nWhen politicians were urged to act by some scientists, none of the climate models generated at this time included a period of stasis. \nAll \nshould have been more circumspect.\n12. \nThe apparent stasis indicates that there are aspects to the climate which modellers have not taken into account\n because they are not un\nd\nerstood\n. N\natural variation \nis \none \nascribed reason \nand \nsomething\n \nstudiously ignored \n20 years ago \nwhen mankind was blamed for any change of climate.  I know of no unambiguous way in which natural variation, whatever it is, can ever be distinguished from mankind’s contribution.  Even if the climate temperature had \nvaried as models indicated \nfor \na decade or more \nthat does not indicate it is correct\n.\n \nCorrelations are not proof. \n13. \nThe climate temperature can do one of three things; go up, down or stay the same. Given the error\ns\n in modelling it seems to me that modellers have a 1 in 3 chance of being approximately right. If the projected temperature is \nincreasing \nslightly faster or slower but \nsimilar to \nthe \ngeneral \ndirection\n,\n I get the impression most modellers would consider they were justified in their claims. But even with these three categories\n,\n the current set of models have failed because the temperature \nis\n,\n at present\n,\n \napproximately \nconstant so they have failed \non a 1 in 3 chance. \n14. \nThe reaction by some \nscientists \nto the apparent stasis \nhas been to state that the temperature of the last 20 years is higher than the previous 20 years and therefore \nclimate models and assumptions are correct. \nThe \nclimate \ntemperature has been rising for the last \n150-\n300 years \ndepending on whose results you look at, \nso that is hardly a surprising observation\n. \n Current models are poor predictors \nand \nthat creates uncertainty for \npolicy \ndecisions.\n \n15. \nIf \nclimate change is primarily natural\n,\n nothing can be done \nexcept to adapt. \n To describe climate change as dangerous is to downgrade our ability to create solutions and is not based on real situation\ns\n given \nthe \nenormous complexity \nand difficulty of predicting any future \nworld \nsituation.\n \nMisleading ‘hockey sticks’.\n16. \nThe original \n‘\nhoc\nkey \nstic\nk’ graph of climate change \nwas generated by Professor Michael \nM\nann at \nPennsylvania State University. The graph figure\nd\n strongly in the IPCC 2000\n,\n notably on the cover and \nfive times \nelsewhere in the report but \nit \nis an artifice.  What was not made clear at the time is that the \nflat part of the graph is a temperature proxy (dendrochronology) whereas the increasing part that was grafted on \nto it \nis actual temperature measurements.  \nTree rings are formed by the activities of the dividing cells of the cambium\n,\n a kind of inner sheath\n,\n  that generates new phloem to the inside and new xylem to the outside of the cambium.  \nTree rings are part of the process of plant development in large woody dicotyledonous angiosperms. Because it is development\n,\n \nthe size of the tree ring is determined by everything that affects \nall aspects of \nplant development. Th\nese are : \nsoil nutrients\n and structure;\n light\n variations;\n \ncarbon dioxide\n;\n \ncompetition from other trees\n;\n disease\n;\n predators\n;\n \nage\n;\n rainfall\n; previous developmental activity \nas well as temperature. \n T\nemperature\n,\n \nfor which it supposedly acts as a proxy\n,\n \nis just one \ncontributor \namongst many\n and of course reflects local conditions only\n. Mann\n’\ns \n‘H\nockey \nS\ntick\n’\n failed to register the historical variation of warm medieval period when Greenland was actually green \nand \nthe little ice age that dominated \nin the years \n1600-1700\ns\n. Greenland was abandoned in the late 1400’s\n as temperatures declined\n.\n  \nTree rings on their\n \nown are \nnot a\n reliable \nproxy and examination of tree ring\ns from trees from numerous sites\n indicates inco\nnsistencies. Stable isotope analysis of tree rings may be more useful. \nPolicy \nwas probably influenced by this uncertain information.\nThe conflict of carbon dioxide and temperature.\n17. \nPaleoclimatic analysis has indicated that CO\n2\n concentrations in the atmosphere have varied enormously\n;\n \nin the past \nup to ten fold \nhigher than current levels\n. In the Milankovitch cycles, temperature \nrises \nprecede those of CO\n2\n \nand CO\n2\n lags temperature during the falling phase.  \n&#xa0;\n18. \nAtmospheric CO\n2\n \nlevels \ndeduced from ice cores \nha\nve\n been rising since 1750\n. \n \nT\nhat \nobservation is puzzling \nfor the popular view\n,\n that all CO\n2\n results from anthropogenic sources. The world population \nthen \nwas about a tenth of that today, \nfossil fuel use \nwas largely limited to the UK and photosynthesis \nand the oceans \nshould have sequestered any increase.  \nThe increase \nin CO\n2\n \nin the 1800s \nis ascribed to \nmassive \nforest clearing\n,\n \nsupposedly reducing photosynthetic area, \nand \nincreased use of wood for fuel\n.  \nEven so there is no simple relation \nwith population \nhere. \nSubsequent industrialisation and \nfossil fuel use \nhas left its isotopic mark in the atmosphere\n \n[\nGhosh, P\n.\n Brand WA\n.\n International Journal of Mass Spectrometry 228 (2003) 1–33\n].\n&#xa0;\n19. \nFrom 1880 onwards\n,\n \ndirect \nmeasurements showed \nocean surface temperatures declined \nfor about 20 years \nand then have \nrisen \ncontinually \nsince\n. \nL\nike other\n direct temperature records\n,\n a century \nis \na \nshort \ntime \nin climate terms\n.  But the solubility of carbon dioxide in water is temperature dependent\n,\n so as global temperatures have risen\n,\n \nit is likely that \nless \natmospheric \nCO\n2\n will be absorbed and more dissolved CO\n2\n will be released.  This then gives rise to the question of whether it is CO\n2\n that causes temperature increases\n,\n or temperature increases give rise to elevated atmospheric CO\n2\n,\n or \na mixture of \nboth. \n20. \nNorwegian geoscientists [\nHumlum et al\n.\n,\n \n2013\n.\n Global Planetary Change\n 100, 51-69]\n  have pr\no\nvided \nthe first \ndetailed analysis of the \npotential \nphase \nrelationships between \nglobal tem\nperature \nrecords, global CO\n2\n levels,\n o\ncean surface tem\nperatures \nand anthop\no\ngenic  CO\n2\n from 1980 to 2011\n,\n using Fourier analys\ne\ns\n;\n \nthe appropriate \nmathematical \nway \nto detect phase \nsequences\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n21.\nTheir \nexacting analysis \nhas \nturned \nclimate models on their head.  These analyses \nindicate \nthat temperature \nincreases \nfirst in the ocean surface\n,\n followed by atmospheric tempe\nrature \nand \nthen \nnearly a\n \nyear later by atmospheric CO\n2\n. \nThe lag \nin CO\n2\n \nthey ascribe to delays in mixing. \nThey \nalso report \nthat anthrop\nogenic \nCO\n2\n&#xad;\n is only a small contributor to the \noverall \ntemperature\n. \n&#xa0;\n2\n2\n. \n I quote\n to indicate\n their conclusions.\n \n“As cause always must precede effect, this observation demonstrates\n \nthat modern changes in temperatures are generally not induced by changes in atmospheric CO\n2\n. Indeed, the sequence of events is seen to be the opposite: temperature changes are taking\n \nplace before the corresponding CO\n2\n changes occur”.\n \n \n“\nO\nur \nfigures \n2–8\n \nreveal that the common notion of globally dominant temperature\n \ncontrols exercised by atmospheric CO\n2\n is in need of \nreassessment.\n \nEmpirical observations indicate that changes in temperature generally\n \nare driving changes in atmospheric CO\n2\n, and not the other way\n around”. “O\nur analysis suggests that changes in atmospheric CO\n2\n appear to occur largely independently of changes in anthropogene\n \nemissions. However, by this we have not demonstrated that CO\n2\n released by burning fossil fuels is without influence on the amount of atmospheric CO2, but merely that the effect is small compared to the effect of other processes”.  \nThe conclusion of these authors is that the present high period of solar activity since 1920 may be responsible for the changes detected in atmospheric CO\n2\n.\n&#xa0;\n2\n3\n. \nWhile their analysis will no doubt be further examined\n,\n \nparticu\nlarly \nby those with a vested inter\ne\nst in the \nstatus quo\n, \nthese observations indicate why no government should have legislated on anthropogene emissions because the situation does not have the certainty originally claimed. \n&#xa0;\n2\n4\n. \nThere is no \ndirect \nrelationship between \nrising \natmospheric CO\n2\n and global temperature\n,\n as the temperature stasis periods \nduring the 40’s a\ns well as from \n1998\n \nonwards \nindicate\n. \n \nHowever all models seemed to have assumed that rising CO\n2\n \nmust \ndrive temperature\n increases \n,\n ever since Arrhenius identified the potential for CO\n2\n as a greenhouse gas over 100 years ago.  The paper by \nProfessor \nHumlum \n and others \nis salutary \nin \nthat things are no\nt\n always what they seem.  \n&#xa0;\n2\n5\n. \nC\nomplex equations are used for climate mo\ndels \nand the \nequations are constrained to \nfit known temperature changes.  \nUsing the \nrelatively \nrapid temperature rise \nof\n the \nlate \n90’s \nto fit these\n \nequations \nm\night \naccount for \nthe \ncontinued increase in temperature that models predict but which failed to match actual observation.\n \nA \nNorwegian group \nhas incorporated the present stasis\n \nin a model \nand calculated \na\nn acceptable\n 1.5\n◦\n C rise \nfor CO\n2 \ndoubling\n.\n&#xa0;\nLegislation on climate change should be revoked. \n&#xa0;\n2\n6\n. \nI feel very strongly that legislation on climate change should not have been \nenacted\n. Climate science is young and there is a deal of uncertainty in its claims. Legislation has propelled us on a path which is difficult to retreat from but is going to inflict real damage on our economic activity and wealth because we are going to make \nour \nelectricity\n,\n the life blood of all economic activi\nty,\n the most expensive world\n-\nwide.\n No doubt the gesture of reducing emissions was consider\ned\n nob\nle\n but it has now turned into the ultimate gest\nure \npolitics beca\nuse \nno one else in the wor\nl\nd is going to follow suit.  \nThis policy will merely accelerate the decline of the UK and Europe.\n \n&#xa0;\n2\n7\n. \nIn seeking to understand the alacrity  with which the popular view of climate change as being anthropogenic  was incorporated into law\n,\n \nthree \nadditional \nreasons \ncan be given\n as well as the assumption that temperature rises were man\nkind\n-\ninduced\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n(A).\n \nThe\nre is the \nclaim by developing countries that western industry and society is guilty of the present state of atmospheric GHG.  \nThe \nW\nest may have accounted for much atmospheric  GHG but good use has been made by inventing \nmobile phones, tarmacked roads, railways, aeroplanes, the internet, computers, trains, modern agriculture and food abundance, modern transport, electricity and use of gas, metallurgy, books, science, antibiotics\n,\n vaccines, modern medicine, liners, steel ships,  etc.  \nThe world \nhas benefited.\n&#xa0;\n(B).\n \n Highly\n-\npublicised a\ngitation by well-funded, well-organised but largely unqualified ideological \ngroups\n. Often self-righteous\n,\n they\n,\n \nseemingly\n,\n are against all human progress\n.\n&#xa0;\n(C).\n \nUnreliable world sources of energy. Shale gas and hydraulic fracturing has changed the UK perspective\n. Methane can be derived from coal seams.\n&#xa0;\n28\n. The effect of \nlegislating \non \nclimate change \nwa\ns \nto emphasise renewables \nin generating policy\n on the basis that they are free\n at source\n. \nSo are coal, oil and gas; exploitation is what costs.  \nAll \n‘\nrenewables\n’\n require huge areas of land or sea to gather energy (MacKay, DJC\n.\n Sustainable \nE\nnergy \nwithout the \nH\not \nA\nir). Because of subsidies to these, there has been no financial driver to investigate alternatives that are recognisably less damaging to the countr\nyside and seas. Even the use of\n \nthorium or modular nuclear reactors seems to have been discarded\n,\n despite the UK being at the forefront of nuclear technologies in the past. There’s enough uranium in the oceans to last for millions of years. The\n cost of \nrenewables \nplaces the heaviest burdens on the poorest. \n \nThe increasing proportion of renewables in electricity generation will eventually threaten its stability. \n29. \n \nC\nriticism of \nclaims about \nthe extent of \nemissions reduction \nfrom renewables \nneed\ns\n to be acknowledged.\n \n \nRenewable\ns\n \ndamage to the countryside is only perceived by those that live there but unspoilt countryside is at a premium in this crowded island.\n3\n0\n. \nMuch is made of the supposed consensus on climate change but this was init\ni\nated by Arrhenius\n who identified CO\n2\n as a GHG and \nwho calculated \nthat \na \ndoubling of CO\n2\n \nwould increase \nglobal temperature by \n2◦\n \nC\n, a value little different from most models\n. But Arrhenius\n’\n kn\nowledge of climate was limited and a major failing was not to include the negative feedback of clouds\n although he recognised the effect of water vapour on temperature\n.\n  \nSince that time\n,\n c\nlimate scientists of all \nkinds \ntend not \nto think outside this box and \nare constrained to \nincorporate that simple idea \nthat \n‘\nCO\n2\n \nmust drive \nglobal temperature\n’\n.\n There is enough discrepancy to indicate that a reassessment \nof that simple idea \nis essential\n.\n \nD\niscarding Arrhenius\n’\n simple relation\n as a simplification that does not match the real world\n would be a start\n.\n \nClimate is a \nvery \ncomplex \ninteractive \nsystem and systems properties are often counterintuitive.\n I suspect \nProfessor \nHumlum\n’s group \nassessment \nwill turn out to \nbe \nmore accurate than the popular view of climate.\n \n&#xa0;\n31\n.\n \nIt would help if the committee acknowledged th\ne uncertainty\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n \njoewheatley.net/how-much-co2-does-wind-power-save/\n and\n www.clepair.net/IerlandUdo.html. Wheatleys article is ‘in press’\n \n For example, car speed is a simple interactive system and most would intuitively identify the accelerator as the speed control. But changing down, brakes, going up or down hill etc., all contribute to speed, indicating the accelerator is not the simple control implied.\n"
