&#xa0;Written evidence from Donna Howitt (TIC 014)&#xa0;I am very sorry to I may have to give my job up, I live in Minehead and work in Williton. My shift starts at 21.30 and the bus I used has stopped. I have work at croft house for coming up 3 years and enjoy it very much. We really need the 28 to start running again.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
