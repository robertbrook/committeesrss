[[[Whether the UK’s implementation of CAP might put English farmers at a competitive disadvantage to their regional and European counterparts]]]

[[[.]]]&#xa0;1.1 A focus on short term competitive advantage/disadvantage masks the issue of the long term health of the environment and the extent to which this determines the viability and future of farming, and thus the incomes that farmers derive from land management. We want to see the concept of environmental land management  ‘mainstreamed’, with

[[[ ]]]management of the environment no longer culturally divided into activities described as ‘farming’ and those attributed to 'conservation’. For example, wildflower grasslands perform important functions across the agricultural landscape. The insects they support are crucial for the pollination of crops and this habitat provides food for all stages of their life cycle.  Invertebrates in wildflower grasslands play an important role in dung removal and soil creation. Wildflower meadows provide food and breeding areas for predator species such as beetles, spiders and parasitic wasps, which carry out natural pest control of insects in arable crops. Grassland soils are a major carbon sink and many wildflower species sustainably fix atmospheric nitrogen. These grasslands perform all of those functions AND provide high quality food which is produced with low inputs – an economic and environmental benefit. &#xa0;1.2 The way in which CAP is implemented must help farmers build ecological resilience and restore the environmental performance of the land – ensuring that it continues to provide food, but also that it delivers environmental public goods other than food. If farmers are adequately rewarded for the delivery of environmental public goods then this should help ensure that they are not placed at competitive disadvantage in the future. Indeed it will ensure that those farmers who currently do most to protect environmental public goods will not be disadvantaged. A research project that forms part of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment has concluded that spending CAP funds on improving access to attractive countryside, protecting wildlife and cutting greenhouse gases could produce annual benefits of over £18bn, for a loss of less than £0.5bn in UK agricultural production. &#xa0;1.3 An approach that takes account of the full range of goods and services farmers can provide, requires effective Pillar I Greening measures and a well funded Rural Development Programme that prioritises environmental land management schemes.  &#xa0;1.4 Embedding a value for environmental public goods

[[[ ]]]in farm management via greening measures linked to direct payments, provides a justification for public money to be given to farmers. It provides to society and businesses a clear message about the important role that farmers play in protecting and enhancing the ecosystems that provide us with these goods and services.   &#xa0;1.5 It is also in the long term interest of the farming industry to have healthy soils, areas that support pollinating insects and predatory insects, and so on. The value of having nature side by side with farming are clear and in the longer term we believe can bring competitive advantage.  &#xa0;&#xa0;1.6 We recommend that Government:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.7 We believe that the public want healthy food that is good value for money, the production of which does not damage the natural environment. Against this background, it is hard to argue against the value of spending taxpayers’ money on programmes whose outcomes will benefit nature, the long term viability of farming, English farmers and the public. &#xa0;1.8 

[[[New Environmental Land Management Schemes]]] Agri environment schemes are a key mechanism for Government delivery of policy objectives. The added value that they can bring for society, the economy and rural communities is under-appreciated. We refer the committee to a series of ‘Farming for A Living Landscape’ case studies which we have produced http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/living-landscape/farming. These show how farmers’ entry into agri environment schemes, when supported by effective advice, can bring wider benefits. For example, Avon Wildlife Trust helps farmers to get into Higher Level Stewardship schemes, enabling them to manage their fields with low inputs.  The lower input costs provide an economic benefit to the landowner as well as a positive benefit for ecosystem services. Combining gains for wildlife with potential commercial benefits for landowners is a high priority for this project. More generally, work undertaken by the Countryside and Community Research Institute (2010) has shown that every £1 of Environmental Stewardship money generates a total output in the local economy of £1.42.&#xa0;&#xa0;1.9 As mentioned above, appropriate advice and facilitation (which can for example bring farmers together to develop collaborative agreements across wider areas) is a key element in successful land management schemes. We welcome current discussions around the merits of a ‘facilitation fund’, which would ensure that farmers would have access to appropriate advice and help, and that the opportunities for added value were fully realised. &#xa0;1.10 The movement of 15% monies  from Pillar I to Pillar II can  ensure that maximum benefit is  derived from measures across the whole rural development programme. The strategic and SMART application  of all measures within Pillar II when  employed  accordingly (including NELMS)  can if  effected properly secure the progress of RDP in delivering its objectives for farm competition across the EU.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[steps the Government might take in implementing CAP to help tenant farmers in upland areas, and to take acc]]]

[[[ount of issues pertaining to common land.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1 Financial support for tenant farmers in upland areas should better reflect the scale of the ecosystem service benefits and the quality of the benefits upland farming can provide. The new CAP should be used to support farmers and tenant farmers who protect and enhance the value of upland catchments in retaining and slowing down water flow to reduce flooding impacts, providing clean drinking water, storing and sequestering carbon and providing special habitats for declining species. &#xa0;2.2 Farmers in these areas can derive benefits from recreation and tourism or potentially could be paid directly by businesses such as water companies. But there is currently not a clear model or mechanism for the provision of income to farmers for ecosystem services other than food, especially in the more marginal farming systems. We must therefore look to the direct payments system, including via the Greening payment, and to the New Environmental Land Management Schemes of Pillar II to provide support for those marginal but environmentally valuable farms and farming systems –in upland areas and elsewhere. &#xa0;2.3 The value of extensive grazing systems, where the level of grazing animals provides protection for important ecosystem services, but where income from livestock is relatively poor, must be recognised, with support provided for these farmers to market and sell what are often high quality products. We think that much can be learnt from existing good practice. For example in Worcestershire, The Wildlife Trust has teamed up with Old Yarr Estates, promoting the sale of beef from cattle that have been grazing on the Trust’s nature reserves. http://www.worcswildlifetrust.co.uk/wildlife-friendly-beef-boxes.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[s]]]

[[[ to take to ensure the reformed CAP will be less bureaucratic than its predecessor and what might prevent this ambition from being achieved]]]&#xa0;3.1 While it is recognised there are key principles such as simplicity of design and a desire not to ‘gold plate’ schemes, these should not constrain thinking on how to achieve potential gains.  Simple delivery should not mean partial delivery and effective environmental benefits need not amount to “gold plating”. The key principle should be focused around SMART design identifying where and how a number effective environmental outcomes can be delivered in combination with agricultural outcomes. There should be no confusion between simplicity of design and ineffective delivery.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.2 We believe that the importance of appropriate advice and facilitation is key to reducing time spent on paperwork and that a flexible and nuanced approach is needed to both this and inspection regimes. The delivery of Greening through a National Certification Scheme (NCS) would certainly provide a clearer and more straightforward process, and a single but tiered Environmental Land Management Scheme should introduce some further simplicity. &#xa0;

[[[How the Government ]]]

[[[might ]]]

[[[define the minimum activity required for qual]]]

[[[ification as an ‘active farmer’]]]&#xa0;4.1 As mentioned above, low stocking densities are vital for maintaining and enhancing the health of many ecosystem services, for example grassland systems that can slow down or store water, such as the culm grasslands of Devon or the maintenance of upland or lowland heath vegetation. It is vital that the minimum activity required does not penalise those low intensity management systems and inadvertently lead to damage to habitats that are the source of farm incomes in themselves for example through tourism incomes.   The level of minimum activity should therefore  be able to reflect the farming system that is appropriate  to maintaining  such  habitats and other services provided by them. A ‘one size fits all’ method of defining appropriate levels  of minimum activity should thus be avoided. If implemented properly ‘minimum activity’ could  confer its own sense of value to those habitats, farming  systems and other services provided by such activity.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ensure that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food production]]]&#xa0;5.1 We believe that CAP payments should address areas where there are currently market failures – specifically, provide farmers with payments for the ecosystem goods and services they provide to the public. We are very concerned that marginal farm systems that provide society with high quality public goods will remain on the verge of, or will be tipped into, bankruptcy, whilst some farming systems that continue to damage the natural environment will continue to be rewarded with public money.   &#xa0;5.2 It is essential that the public perceive the outcomes from the money they provide to farmers. There must be a transparent way of the public seeing that the payments they make to farmers both via Pillar I and Pillar II deliver outcomes in addition to food.  The 30% Greening payment of approximately £495 million per year to English farmers, must be made to work effectively to deliver perceptible environmental benefit. It should also be clear to the public that the bulk of the direct payment money (70%) should not be linked to damaging activities, with a robustly enforced cross compliance system. &#xa0;5.3 We believe that the key ambitions for Greening should be to: &#xa0;

[[[We have set out our key tests for Greening as follows: ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;5.4 The movement of the maximum 15% of Pillar I monies into Pillar II to support Rural Development measures and the high prioritisation of new environmental land management schemes are essential to ensure that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits. New Land Management Schemes that foster collaborative working by farmers across landscapes could, with the right facilitation and advice, deliver excellent environmental benefits and lead to opportunities to promote products derived from special local landscapes. A more transparent and public face to CAP payments which articulates how this public money helps to enhance local landscapes and production of quality local food which results in reduced transport costs, potentially reduced prices and reduced carbon emissions, would be helpful.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.5

[[[ ]]]The success or otherwise of implementation of this round of CAP reform for the environment will be determined by the sum of all of the parts: cross compliance, Pillar I greening, additional voluntary measures and Pillar II land management schemes.
