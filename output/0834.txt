[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[About us]]]Action on Hearing Loss is the new name for RNID. We're the charity working for a world where hearing loss doesn't limit or label people, where tinnitus is silenced – and where people value and look after their hearing. &#xa0;Our response focuses on key issues that relate to people with hearing loss. Throughout this response we use the term 'people with hearing loss' to refer to people with all levels of hearing loss and tinnitus, including people who are profoundly deaf. We are happy for the details of this response to be made public.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]Action on Hearing Loss welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence on the management of long-term conditions within the NHS and social care system. Hearing loss is a long term condition affecting over 10 million people in the UK – one in six of the population. Our recently released evidence-based report Joining up showed how large cost savings and improvements to quality of life could be achieved from better provision of health and social care services to people who have hearing loss and also have other long-term conditions.&#xa0;

[[[Hearing loss and other long-term conditions in a]]]

[[[n ageing population]]]3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unmet communication needs, arising from unmanaged hearing loss, pose a challenge to provision of care and hence the wider management of other long term conditions. 3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; People with hearing loss experience greater difficulties in accessing health and social care services and public health information, and receive a lower standard of health service across the board. 3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unmanaged hearing loss can bring about challenges in terms of the management of particular conditions such as diabetes, where patients can play a large role in self-managing their condition, so effective communication with health professionals is essential.3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Particular psychological and behavioural challenges can result where people have unmanaged hearing loss alongside other conditions that can cause additional communication difficulties such as stroke, dementia, sight loss or Parkinson’s.

[[[for people with long-term conditions]]]13.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GPs and all health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of hearing loss and links between hearing loss and other long-term conditions. They should enquire about whether the person has a hearing loss, cross-refer and cooperate with other professionals.13.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Opportunistic and targeted hearing checks should be integrated into other services and settings, such as in pharmacies, care homes, consultations for other conditions, and alongside other health checks at GPs. An adult hearing screening programme for 65 year olds would ensure people manage their hearing loss when they are most able to adapt.13.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All health and care providers should ensure that staff are trained in deaf awareness and communication tactics, that proper processes are in place for booking communication support, that assistive technologies are used and that services are accessible to people with hearing loss and deafness.13.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Information, guidance and health promotion campaigns around other long-term conditions should be provided for people with hearing loss and deaf people who use British Sign Language (BSL) in a format that they can access.13.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Develop better diagnostic tools, specialist services and guidance to support people with hearing loss who also have other long term conditions, and make sure these are used. For example, audiological assessments for people with dementia have been developed which simplify instructions, and some audiology departments have adapted their testing procedures so that they meet the needs of people with dementia. 13.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure that resources are allocated in a cost effective way by properly managing hearing loss in people with other long term conditions. For example, the lack of resource allocated to hearing loss within the National Dementia Strategy for England should be reviewed.May 2013 Action on Hearing Loss, Hearing Matters 2011 Action on Hearing Loss, Joining up: Why people with hearing loss or deafness would benefit from an integrated response to long-term conditions 2013, www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/joiningup http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=412 http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Documents/Reports/Diabetes-in-the-UK-2012.pdf Action on Hearing Loss, Hearing Matters 2011 Action on Hearing Loss, Hearing Matters 2011 Action on Hearing Loss, Hearing Matters 2011 Action on Hearing Loss, Joining up 2013 Lin F.R. et al., ‘Hearing loss and cognitive decline in older adults’ Internal Medicine 2013, 173(4):293-299 Boxtel van, M.P.J. et al., ‘Mild hearing impairment can reduce verbal memory performance in a healthy adult population’ Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology 2000, 22(1): 147-154 Gates G.A. et al., ‘Central Auditory Dysfunction May Precede the Onset of Clinical Dementia in People with Probable Alzheimer's Disease’ Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 2002, 50(3): 482-488 Lin F.R., ‘Hearing Loss and Cognition Among Older Adults in the United States’ The Journals of Gerontology 2011, 66(10): 1131-6 Lin F.R. et al., ‘Hearing Loss and Incident Dementia’ Archives of Neurology 2011, 68(2): 214-220 Fratiglioni L. et al., ‘Influence of social network on occurrence of dementia: a community-based longitudinal study’ The Lancet 2000, 355(9212): 1315-1319 Lin F.R., ‘Hearing Loss and Cognition Among Older Adults in the United States’ The Journals of Gerontology 2011, 66(10): 1131-6 Verghese J. et al., ‘Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly’ New England Journal of Medicine 2003, 348(25): 2508-2516 Boxtel van, M.P.J. et al., ‘Mild hearing impairment can reduce verbal memory performance in a healthy adult population’ Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology 2000, 22(1): 147-154 Burkhalter C.L. et al., ‘Examining the effectiveness of traditional audiological assessments for nursing home residents with dementia-related behaviors’ Journal of American Academic Audiology 2009, 20(9): 529-38 http://www.alz.co.uk/info/diagnosis Burkhalter C.L. et al., ‘Examining the effectiveness of traditional audiological assessments for nursing home residents with dementia-related behaviors’ Journal of American Academic Audiology 2009, 20(9): 529-38 Action on Hearing Loss, Joining up 2013 Rosenhall U. and Sundh V., ‘Age-related hearing loss and blood pressure’ Noise Health 2006, 8(31): 88-94 Margellos-Anast H., Estarziau M. and Kaufman G. ‘Cardiovascular disease knowledge among culturally Deaf patients in Chicago’ Preventative Medicine 2006, 42(3): 235-9 McKee M.M. et al., ‘Impact of communication on preventive services among deaf American Sign Language users’ American Journal of Preventive Medicine 2001, 41(1): 75-79 McKee M. et al., ‘Perceptions of cardiovascular health in an underserved community of deaf adults using American Sign Language’ Disability and Health 2011, 4(3): 192–197 Action on Hearing Loss, Joining up 2013 Brentari D. and Poizner H., ‘A Phonological Analysis of a Deaf Parkinsonian Signer’ Language &amp;
