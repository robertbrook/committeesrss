[[[Written evidence submitted by Jonathan Isaacs [FBB0029]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;My name is Jonathan Isaacs. I am a 54-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer and journalist born and living in London.&#xa0;I believe there is no future for the BBC and it should be wound up without delay, as Greece has successfully wound up its national broadcaster.&#xa0;My reasons are:&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The continuing scandal of the 52-years of child rape and abuse on BBC premises by the late BBC DJ Sir Jimmy Savile.&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the continuing scandal of rape and child abuse by other living BBC employees.&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 141 current unresolved legal cases of bullying at the BBC&#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the scandal of widespread non-payment of the BBC Â£145.50 annual licence fee, accounting for one in ten UK court cases, reports The Daily Telegraph.&#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the scandal of non-transparency for licence fee payers, whom the BBC Trust has not allowed to investigate records relating to these scandals.&#xa0;2) BBC continuing leftist bias, notably against the democratic state of Israel, which I believe no British television watcher should have to pay for on pain of imprisonment or tolerate. This bias is amply evidenced in websites "Biased BBC" and "BBC Watch."&#xa0;I believe these scandals go to the heart of Britain, involving police officers, doctors and employees at 32 British hospitals, together with as-yet-unindicted BBC senior staff and former staff. The BBC is a corrupt liability to Britain and I urge MPs to break it up as soon as possible and refuse to allow an extension to its Royal Charter.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
