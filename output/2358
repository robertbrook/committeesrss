defaultRoad Safety GB – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your request for the views of Road Safety GB on the proposed 
defaultlifting  of
default the requirement to notify the Secretary of State before a pedestrian crossing is removed.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur view is that, provided that stakeholder and local consultation continues to be a requirement, this proposal will have no negative effect on road safety. It will be one less administrative task for all 
defaultconcerned, that
default has no safety benefit, which we welcome.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours,
defaultHonor Byford
