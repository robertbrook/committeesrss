[normal]Road Safety GB – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your request for the views of Road Safety GB on the proposed 
[normal]lifting  of
[normal] the requirement to notify the Secretary of State before a pedestrian crossing is removed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our view is that, provided that stakeholder and local consultation continues to be a requirement, this proposal will have no negative effect on road safety. It will be one less administrative task for all 
[normal]concerned, that
[normal] has no safety benefit, which we welcome.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours,
[normal]Honor Byford
[normal]Vice Chair
