default              
defaultThe West Midlands Local Transport Plan has a Key Objective towards Supporting Economic Growth. 
defaultThe West Midlands is located at the heart of the UK strategic highway network with key motorways running through or to our includ
defaulting the M6, M5, M40, M42, M69 and key trunk roads including the A38 and A45/46. 
default2.
default              
defaultThe West Midlands welcomes the investment 
defaultannounced in Action for Roads 
defaultwhich will see additional Managed Motorways on the M6 J2-4
default and M5 J4a-6 as well the M54/M6/ M6 Toll;
default A45/A46 
defaultTollbar
default End junction upgrade. 
default3.
default              
defaultThis will contribute towards our economic growth
default objectives
default,
default support environmental policies and
default unlock 
defaultthe 
defaulteconomic developments
default as promoted through our Black Country LEP, Greater Birmingham &amp;
default Solihull LEP and the Coventry &amp; Warwickshire LEP
default including enterprise zones at i54 in the Black Cou
defaultntry and Birmingham city centre as well as
default Coventry 
defaultFriargate
default.
default4
default.
default              
defaultReflecting the dynamic nature of transport networks and the West Midlands location on the 
defaultnational road network, 
defaultt
defaulthe 
defaultWest Midlands
default recognises the interaction between the local and strategic road networks and the role of both in supporting and facilitating economic growth.
default This means the 
defaultWest Midlands
default 
defaulttakes interest in issues, funding, projects 
defaultand programmes 
defaultrelated to the strategic road network and the Highways Agency as well as the local highway network. 
default5
default.
default              
defaultReflecting the sustainable travel 
defaultpolicies 
defaultof the 
defaultWest Midlands
default, it is welcomed that the Government has recognised the historic underinve
defaultstment in all highways both local and strategic. The 
defaultWest Midlands
default 
defaultwelcomes that the Government has recognised the need for all highways
default,
default to work effectively and 
defaultefficiently
default as possible 
defaultand that highways perform multiple functions as well as 
defaultprivate vehicle use, especially sustainable transport modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. 
default6
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default welcomes that the Government has 
defaultfocused on network capacity and efficiency rather 
defaultchosen to undertake a programme of new roads
default 
defaultalong 
defaultwith an increase in highway maintenance
default spending
default. 
defaultThis 
defaultis 
defaultallows the strategic highway network to perform effectively to support the economy whilst minimising physical environmental impacts.
default7
default.
default              
defaultHowever, the West Midlands 
defaultnotes
default that the Command Paper
default does not make reference to the M6 Toll or its role on the strategic highway network. It is noted that the M6 Toll is excluded from the outputs of the National Transport Model, demonstrating that if operated correctly, there is a crucial role for the M6Tol
defaultl as part of the strategic road network and should be specifically included and discussed within Action for Roads. This is discussed further in 
defaultpara
default 
default34.
default8
default.
default              
defaultThis means the West Midlands still suffers from congestion, 
defaultair 
defaultpollution, unreliable journeys and 
defaulthindrance to markets which has national as well as local implications. Such road congestion presently costs the West Midlands £2.3bn per annum
default whilst as many as 7% of all deaths in the West Midlands 
defaultare linked to poor air quality with the M6 recognised to 
defaultbe the largest single source of poor air quality emissions
default in the metropolitan area
default.
default 
default9.
default              
defaultIn relation to the local road network, the 
defaultWest Midlands
default notes 
defaultthat the Command Paper identifies that the local road network makes up more than 97% of all UK roads yet just 
default8
default pages dedicated to them within the document. This disproportionate focus on the strategic road network fails to identify the crucial role of the
default local network and the considerable opportunities for the local road network to contribute to economic growth, carbon reductions and supporting greater sustainable travel. 
default10
default. 
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default notes that the significant disparity between strategic and l
defaultocal highway 
defaultmaintenance
default. In 2012/13 the Government allocated the Highways Agency £421M approx to maintain the strategic road network which represents 3% of the total highway network. 
defaultIn 2012/13
default, ITAs and Local Authorities in England were allocated £779M t
defaulto maintain the large majority of the remaining 97% of the UK roads which 
defaultalso 
defaultincludes pavements, street lighting and other 
defaulthighway 
defaultassets. 
defaultThe West Midlands believes this Committee should examine the impacts of this issue further.
default11
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default wo
defaultuld welcome stronger Government commitment to local road asset management which if suitably funded would generate cost savings for the Government if local highway assets could be maintained through long term planning rather than costly end of life replacem
defaultent. This would also generate economic benefits and productivity gains to the UK economy.
default12.
default              
defaultFinally, there is a need to ensure the evidence used to develop Action for Roads is fully tested and would benefit from additional quantitative data.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2. How doedefaults the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?default&#xa0;default13
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest 
defaultMidlands
default,
default whilst welcoming investment in the 
defaultstrategic and local highway n
defaultetwork
defaults
default, believes that the 
defaultDfT
default needs to fully understand and assess the transport gaps and barriers which mean people and businesses need to drive rather than use public transport. For instance, in the West Midlands some 40% of AM peak trips on the urban sections
default of the M5 and M6 are for less than 
defaultthree junctions
default – in effect short hop trips. 
default1
default4
default.
default              
defaultThese huge numbers of local short hop trips 
defaultmake 
defaulta major contribution to the traffic congestion of the M5/ M6
default/ M42
default which regularly overspills to cause congestion on the local network causing unnecessary impacts to both the local and national economy 
defaultand environment
default. 
default1
default5
default.
default              
defaultThis demonstrates the need for the Government to ensure an integrated approach to understanding an
defaultd crucially solving transport problems. The Government is empowering local areas to drive local economic growth and in this context, there is a need for the same 
defaultlocally driven influence and priority to be given to 
defaultdecision making and 
defaultfunding to be applied
default to the Highways Agency
default 
defaultto address transport gaps and barriers to growth
default. 
default1
default6
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default is of the view that more focus needs to be given to ensuring the Governments policy for roads is integrated so that challenges are addressed by both ‘demand for’ 
defaultand
default ‘supply of’
default highway capacity.  
default1
default7
default.
default              
defaultTo that end, it could be considered that in order to 
defaultaddress some of the challenges of congestion facing the strategic road network some of the solution should be funded wholly or in part by the Highways Agency. 
defaultIn the West Midlands, investment in a Metro 
defaultand Rapid Transit 
defaultnetwork could likely make a major r
defaulteduction in the 40% of local trips using the urban sections of the M5/ M6
default/ M42
default in addition to our aspirations for junction improvements at the M6 J8
default,
default J
default10
default; the 
defaultM5 J1 and J2
default and; the M42 J6 all
default of which are crucial elements to support economic growth and to 
defaultthe 
defaultdevelopment 
defaultof Strategic Economic P
defaultlans
default by our LEPs
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault3default. How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast? default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1
default8
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default notes that the 
defaultDfTs
default National Transport Model has identified that traffic on the strategic highway network is forecast to grow 
defaultby 46% for strategic road network and an average of 43% for all roads and 41% for all other roads
default in the central growth forecast
default,
default 
defaultunderpinned by population and economic growth along with technology 
defaultenhancements
default to motoring
default and propulsion
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default9
default.
default              
defaultWith the West Midlands alone predicted to see an increase of 10% approx in population by 2026, the 
defaultWest Midlands
default believes the fundamentals underpinning the need to travel are valid. Uncertainty therefore only focuses on the levels of economic growth and future technological transport changes
default which, if decoupled 
defaultfrom carbon fuel sources, could see the cost of motorin
defaultg decline
default.
default20
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default 
defaultbelieves
default even with the levels of uncertainty outlined by the 
defaultDfT
default, there should be Government 
defaultconcern of the consequences of these forecasts. 
defaultEven the lowest scenario of growth, traffic would increase by 23% by 2040
default with hig
defaulthest range seeing growth of 76% by 2040
default. 
default21.
default              
defaultThe Government should not look to repeat approach of the past and undertake a ‘predict and provide’ but rather ensure a robust ‘predict, manage and provide’ to ensure investment in alternative transport 
defaultinfrastructure to ensure future road traffic growth is minimised.
default Investment in rail, buses, walking and cycling will help minimise traffic growth whilst improving access to jobs, improving health, air quality and reduce carbon emissions.
default22
default.
default              
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultWest Midl
defaultands
default would be extremely concerned at the consequence of 
defaulteven just a 23.6
default% increase in traffic on the M6 t
defaulthrough the metropolitan area. Such traffic growth would mean major impacts to 
defaultour economy, air quality and other pollution 
defaultand thus
default to our residents an
defaultd businesses. 
default23
default.
default              
defaultFinally, the 
defaultWest Midlands
default 
defaultbelieves
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultDfT
default should not just focus on the growth and implications of future road traffic growth predictions. The 
defaultDfT
default national transport model predicts between 21-54% 
defaultincreases
default in road traffic which is 
defaultnot part of the Strategic Road Network including the local highways networks. 
default2
default4
default.
default              
defaultThe Government policy focus should be to ensure this level of growth is minimised and funding is provided to metropolitan areas to develop integrated public transport networ
defaultk to support this growth. Such investment would ensure the ‘double win’ of preventing the economic and environmental impacts of the otherwise predicted traffic growth as well in itself supporting economic growth and reducing environmental impacts to the be
defaultnefit of residents and businesses located in our core cities and within their economic geographies.
default2
default5
default.
default              
defaultOverall, these strategic and local levels of traffic growth would be extremely detrimental to the economic and environment objectives of both the West M
defaultidlands and the wider UK. It is crucial the Government ensures a focus on providing the policy framework to ensure the majority of these trips occur in a sustainable manner with a focus on rail for interurban trips and public transport, walking and cycling
default for local trips. This is likely to involve a balanced approach to supply and demand.
default&#xa0;defaultQ4. How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2
default6
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default has expressed the view that all road travel needs to be viewed and addressed in an integrated manner which addresses supply and demand of road travel. If the need to travel by roads can be addressed through investment in public transport and sustainable t
defaultransport then it is prudent that those road trips which do 
defaultoccur,
default are undertaken in an efficient and effective manner. The 
defaultWest Midlands
default, through the development of both the Local Transport Plan and the Metropolitan Freight Strategy have identified the hig
defaulth priority of journey reliability
default to personal and freight road journeys
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default7
default.
default              
defaultThe use of new information technologies has a huge role to play in managing traffic and providing information on all transport modes for end users.  The provision of live and in
defaultteractive journey planning technologies wedded to the application of new vehicle technologies in integrated systems can make an effective difference, enabling 
defaulttravelers
default to make informed decisions on what mode of transport to utilise and the most appropriat
defaulte routes to take.
default&#xa0;
default2
default8
default.
default              
defaultIn relation to M
defaultanaged Motorways, the 
defaultWest Midlands
default would welcome a long term plan as to where further Managed Motorways should occur. The 
defaultWest 
defaultMidlands
default believes there is already a strong rationale for Managed Motorways to be deliver
defaulted on the M5 between the M6 interchange and M5J4a 
defaultand between M6 J4 – M6/M1 J19 Interchange 
defaultwith the rest of the West Midlands motorway box been treated with Managed Motorways thereafter. 
default&#xa0;
default29
default.
default              
defaultFurthermore, to ensure the on-going effectiveness of existing 
defaultand future Managed Motorways schemes (and the efficiency of the strategic road network as a whole), targeted investment should be directed towards resolving existing and forecast ‘pinch-points’ on the network.  This is particularly pertinent for circumstan
defaultces in which those pinch-points act as a barrier to economic development and growth.  
default&#xa0;
default3
default0
default.
default              
defaultFor example, investment in M42 Junction 6 would unlock large scale growth of key national, regional and local assets such as Birmingham Airport, NEC, Jaguar Land Ro
defaultver, Birmingham Business Park and the proposed HS2 Interchange Station and surrounding area.  The scale of growth that could be achieved in relation to these assets, should such investment be made, is highlighted by the UK
default 
defaultCentral 
defaultmasterplan
default (
defaulthttp://www.uk-c.com/
default).     
default&#xa0;
default31.
default              
defaultIn addition the A46/M69 Corridor provides a strategic north/south link within the West Midlands plays a crucial role in supporting economic growth within the Warwickshire Sub-Region 
defaultincluding significant housing growth within the next 20 year local plan period. It provides an alternative routing for vehicles travelling north-south from Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire to the south, avoiding the already congested M42 Corridor. The bu
defaultsiness cases for the junction improvements at 
defaultLongbridge
default and 
defaultTollbar
default End acknowledged the strategic importance of this corridor which can support the connectivity and delivery of High Speed Rail 2.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default              
defaultAdoption of the above principles in developing a long
default term vision would support the aspirations of the Government to allowing the HA to become more independent and allow the 
defaultDfT
default to have a strategic policy and funding role akin to the structure of the railways.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault5default. What mechanisms are there for Government tdefaulto increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default33
default.
default              
defaultFrom the 
defaultWest Midlands
default experience, there appear to be two models of private financing of new roads. Firstly there is the model used for design build and operate the M6 Toll which has so far not performed as originally intended. This model of financing relied on private companie
defaults developing their business models based on assumptions to long range traffic growth forecasts. This meant a high level of risk was built into the model and 
defaultcosted
default accordingly
default and with regulation to toll structures or levels
default. 
default&#xa0;
default34
default.
default              
defaultThis is the model used for the M6Toll with limited benefits. 
defaultO
defaultur studies suggest that approximately 
defaultthere remains more than 30,000 vehicles per day which 
defaultpass 
defaultthrough the West Midlands (i.e. are strategic in nature)
default that could otherwise use the M6Toll if t
defaulthe apparent barriers to greater usage were addressed. 
defaultTolls appear to be now set at levels to manage MEL debt servicing rather than be aligned to road user needs and encouraging greater usage
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default35.
default              
defaultThe M6 Toll only carries approximately half the 70,000 ve
defaulthicles per day the road was originally envisaged to carry.
default&#xa0;
default In comparison, the M6 carries 125,000 vehicles per day. This adds further weight to our view that the M6Toll needs to be fully utilised and that barriers to greater usage of the M6 Toll addressed 
defaultto maximise the economic and environmental opportunities for the West Midlands.
default&#xa0;
default3
default6
default.
default              
defaultThe second model is to use the concession model once the strategic infrastructure has been built and opened. This allows far greater certainty of risk for actual road usag
defaulte which is likely to drive a more competitive concession process to the benefit of the tax payer. This model would require 
defaultthe public sector to pump prime the infrastructure with the private sector leasing or even buying the infrastructure thereafter. 
defaultOnce
default the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be modelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the concession could then be recycled to fund other appropriate transport schemes. 
default&#xa0;
default3
default7
default.
default              
defaultThis model was successfully applied to the 30-year concession on 
defaultHS1 Ltd which is jointly owned and operated by Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario 
defaultTeachers
default Pension Plan until 2040 from which thereafter it is returned to Government for a concession.
default Cruci
defaultally this allows for appropriate regulation of user costs.
default&#xa0;
default3
default8
default.
default              
defaultIn summary, should the Government
default wish to better encourage private sector financing
default for new roads
default, there appears to be a better balance of risk and costs if this is pursued with the second mod
defaultel identified with the public sector building infrastructure and the private thereafter operating the infrastructure through a concession model.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQdefault6default. How should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles defaultshould Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3
default9
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultWest Midlands
default does not have a view towards how the Highways Agency should be reformed but supports the Governments 
defaultvision
default that the Highways Agency needs to have greater 
defaultautonomy towards 
defaultdecision making and longer term funding certainty akin the governance and funding arrangements between the Government and Network Rail. 
default&#xa0;
default40
default.
default              
defaultAs highlighted above, it is crucial that the 
defaultrefo
defaultrmed Highways Agency has the duel responsibility to manage daily operations of its network and undertake long term planning to ensure a holistic ‘supply of’ and ‘demand for’ highway capacity. To ensure a fully integrated approach this should include suppor
defaultt schemes which reduce demand for the strategic highway network as discussed above. This would 
defaulthave a far closer alignment to the role and responsibilities of Local Highway Authorities who undertake such functions. 
default&#xa0;
default4
default1
default.
default              
defaultIn order to support and facilitate 
defaultlocal economic growth, the Highways Agency 
defaultneeds to be a proactive partner who works with local authorities, developers and others to deliver a strategic road network which can support economic growth. This approach would complement the guidance provided w
defaultithin the recently published Department for Transport Circular 02/2013 ‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable Development’. At present the Highways Agency is very reactive, especially in regards to development and impact upon the SRN. 
defaultWhilst this is understandable for motorway routes, other non-motorway routes could be planned and managed more flexibly to support connectivity to potential development sites.
default&#xa0;
default4
default2
default.
default              
defaultFinally, Government reform should ensure the 
defaultnew Highways Agency 
defaulthas a far 
defaultstronger relationship with ITAs, LEPs and Highway Authorities to ensure the balanced, integrated approach discussed in this response can be delivered successfully to the benefit of the economy in local areas and across the UK.
