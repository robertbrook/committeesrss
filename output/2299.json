"&#xa0;\nJudith Davey â€“ Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am long standing member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance and as such I have supported them in their efforts in preserving the green lanes and protecting them from damage and nuisance inflicted by 4x4s and motorbikes.\n&#xa0;\nIn recent years with the heavy rainfall the lanes get damaged by this so called recreational activity very severely.\n&#xa0;\nI wish to register my support for the following proposals\n&#xa0;\n1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways, and\n&#xa0;\n2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. \n&#xa0;\nI would be grateful if you would kindly make my views known to the Parliamentary committee scrutinising the Deregulation Bill.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n29 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
