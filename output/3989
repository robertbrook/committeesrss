[normal]Written [bold]evidence submitted[bold] by Nicholas Lewis[bold] (IPC0017)[bold] [bold]I am an independent, self-funded climate 
[normal]science 
[normal]researcher. In recent years I have specialised in the key area of climate 
[normal]sensitivity. My work has been published in the peer reviewed literature and is cited and discussed in the IPCC
[normal]’
[normal]s Fifth Assessment Report
[normal] (AR5)
[normal].
[normal] I was an expert reviewer of AR5.
[normal]are unreliable
[normal] and/or unable to provide usefully well-constrained estimates
[normal]. I 
[normal]agree with
[normal] this conclusion.
[normal] That
[normal] leaves in essence only
[normal] estimates based on 
[normal]observations of warming over 
[normal]multi-decadal periods
[normal]. Useful surface temperature records extend back approximately 150 years (the 
[normal]‘
[normal]instrumental period
[normal]’
[normal]). However, 
[normal]global warming ‘in the pipeline’
[normal] is predominantly reflected in ocean heat uptake, calculated from changes in sub-surface temperatures, records of
[normal] which extend back only 50 years.
[normal]This last 
[normal]approach 
[normal]represents poor design
[normal]. It is impossible to estimate aerosol forcing 
[normal]– which largely affects the northern hemisphere –
[normal]with any accuracy without separate 
[normal]temperature 
[normal]data for, at a minimum, 
[normal]the 
[normal]north
[normal]ern
[normal] and south
[normal]ern
[normal] hemispheres. 
[normal]are eliminated from the assessment,
[normal] the average ECS for those that remain
[normal] is, at 1.8°C, 
[normal]considerably
[normal] lower than the GCM average of 3.2°C, but close to the energy-budget 
[normal]best 
[normal]estimate of 1.7°C that was outlined in the last paragraph. 
[normal]is unscientific.

[normal]Observationally-based methods
[normal] involve some limited use of models.
[normal] In the form of a weight given to each possible value for it.
[normal] The posterior takes the form of a probability distrib
[normal]ution for the property of interest rather than a point estimate.
[normal] 
[normal]Such a prior is not a representation of an understanding of the likely value of 
[normal]what is being estimated
[normal], but is simply a prior calculated to give an objective answer.
[normal] Incorrectly in two c
[normal]ases.
[normal] 
[normal]When, as is very much the case for ECS, the parameter involved does not have a straight line relationship with the observational data from which it is being estimated, a uniform prior generally prevents the estimate fairly reflecting the data.

[normal] Forster and Gregory 2006 used standard non-Bayesian statistics, which are intrinsically objective and (as often the case) gave the same results as using an objective Bayesian method.

[normal] 17–83% probability
[normal] In other words, the average of the GCM estimates and their range (which was interpreted conservatively).
[normal] In principle, studies that used observat
[normal]ional data to form their own estimate of the aerosol effect would be unaffected by a revision in the consensus estimate of it. However, in practice all such climate sensitivity studies featured in AR4 were badly flawed in other ways. 
[normal] The method involves comparing changes in the average levels of three key variables between two multi-year periods, normally one early in the instrumental period and one at the end of it.
