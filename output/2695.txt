[[[AES Southern Ltd]]]

[[[              ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; AES Southern Ltd was established in 2005 as a direct response to demand from developers for independent, practical advice on delivering sustainable developments in line with current and future regulations, which they could rely on. Keeping this at the heart of everything we do, AES Southern has grown to become a leading sustainability consultancy to the new build industry in the UK. We work with a broad range of clients including top 10 UK developers, delivering an end to end service from pre-acquisition and planning advice to on-site post construction assessment and certification. Our portfolio of services to both residential and non-residential developments include strategy documents, SAP, SBEM, CfSH, BREEAM, psi value calculations and overheating risk analysis. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are actively involved in a number of industry groups such as the HBF and Zero Carbon Hub, providing insight and responses based on our knowledge and experience to key consultations. Currently we are represented on 4 working groups advising the ZCH in regards to the Industry and government sponsored project on “Closing the gap between design and as-built performance”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our highly experienced team of consultants shares a passion for developing their technical expertise whilst promoting sustainable design. We engage with the wider industry to keep abreast of the issues that matter to our clients and make sure the advice we are giving is up to date. Through our engagement with projects at an early stage we are able to propose energy and sustainability strategies that we know are deliverable. We believe that the Code for sustainable homes has provided an excellent platform for driving sustainability in the built and associated environment, and by doing so, has been the catalyst for significant investment in technological advances and innovation as well as providing structure for developers, suppliers and manufacturers
