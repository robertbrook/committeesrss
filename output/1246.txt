[[[&#xa0;]]]It is widely accepted that women are significantly under-represented throughout Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) based subjects. From secondary school level and onwards what Blickenstaff (2005) describes as “layers in a sex-based filter”, or what the Committee refers to as a ‘leaky pipeline’, systematically and disproportionately removes women from STEM subjects. In direct and stark contrast with this, however, it is well recognised and accepted that women predominate in forensic science in ways that are atypical of the patterns seen in all other STEM subjects. Houck (2009) observes a situation where “the percentage of females (on US forensic science degrees) was 78% when the average percentage of females for non-forensic science bachelor’s degrees ranged from only 32% to 47%”. Although under-researched, the situation seems to be even more dramatic in the UK forensic anthropology community. For example, in the 10 years that the undergraduate forensic anthropology degree has been offered at Dundee University, it has always attracted over 75% female students and in some years this has risen to over 90% female representation.&#xa0;The situation in forensic science has led to the suggestion that the subject might be “a Gateway for Women in Science” (Houck 2009) and the unusual demographics displayed in forensic anthropology may offer an even more focussed opportunity to interrogate and exploit the potential for this unusual pattern as we attempt to understand this well-recognised, but little understood, reverse gender bias phenomenon. That this is an international situation is borne out by the fact that women form the majority of forensic laboratory staff in the US (Houck 2009) and in the UK, the British Association for Forensic Anthropology has confirmed that it currently has 102 female members and only 44 males - a ratio of nearly 2.5:1. Interestingly, despite an increasing focus on addressing gender inequalities in STEM (for example, as part of the Athena Swan Programme), forensic science has been curiously overlooked as a possible template for a solution and, in this, we believe that we may have missed a golden opportunity.&#xa0;We do know that forensic anthropology offers clear evidence to falsify the common (though weakly-evidenced) claim that under-representation of women in STEM is down to lower ‘natural’ ability levels. Forensic anthropology is an especially useful and powerful example, as it demands rigorous, robust and defensible science that is tested in the adversarial arena of the UK judicial courts on a daily basis. A recent audit undertaken by the British Association for Forensic Anthropology showed that, of those forensic anthropologists who regularly defend their science in court, over 80% are female – suggesting that the ‘leaky pipeline’ has been firmly plugged in this STEM science. If women are able to progress notably well in one challenging branch of STEM, it becomes harder to argue that there is any intrinsic reason why they cannot do so in others.&#xa0;Forensic anthropology in the UK may therefore offer strong indicators for possible solutions to the ‘leaky pipeline’ in other STEM subjects. It may have some lessons that could be learned and best practice that could be adopted to perhaps reverse, or at least slow down, the way this ‘leaky pipeline’ affects women entering, remaining and progressing in STEM subjects. &#xa0;References:Blikenstaff, J.C.
