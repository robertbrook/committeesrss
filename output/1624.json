"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Energy Technologies Institute (HOT32)SummaryThe Energy Technologies Institute (ETI), a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering firms and the UK Government, believes the UK can have an affordable, secure \nand sustainable energy system in the future\n.\n However\n,\n it is \nimportant\n that the right steps are taken to ensure the cost of carbon reductions are affordable in the context of sustaining UK economic growth and industrial development\n.\nThe ETI carries out two \nkey activities – (1) modelling and analysis of the UK energy system to \nidentify the \nkey challenges and potential solutions to meeting the UK\n’s\n 2020 and 2050 targets at the lowest cost to the UK, and (2) investing in major engineering and technology demonst\nration projects which address these challenges with the aim of de-risking solutions – both in technology and in supply-chain development – for subsequent commercial investors\n.\n \nThe ETI \nis investing\n more than £210m in projects across nine technology program\nme areas, including buildings, distributed energy and smart systems and heat.\n \nThe \nETI believes that the future approach to practical, cost-effective and sustainable domestic heat supply will vary from location to location across the UK.\n  For example, district heat networks in dense, urban areas and electric heating in rural areas.  Further\nmore\n, we believe providing heat at least cost to the consumer, in any one area, should consider an opti\nmum of both supply-side and demand-\nside measures\n (i\nncluding building retrofits).  \nThe ETI’s \ns\nmart \ns\nystem\ns and h\neat (SSH) \np\nrogramme is developing\n a software tool \nthat will \nallow the design of practical, cost-effective local energy systems (both heat and power)\n.\n \n \nThe \nSSH \nprogramme \nis working with\n \na number\n of \nlocal authorities\n across the UK \nto develop the software tool and subsequently create and demonstrate the resulting practical, cost-effective local energy solutions for their areas.  Importantly, the activity will prove that the capability and approach \ncan be adopted nationally.\n  \n \n&#xa0;\nDetailed Responses to Questions 1 - 12&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe G\novernment has recently launched the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation mechanisms to address \nenergy efficiency in the building stock.  We see the aim of the combination of these to stimulate innovation and capacity building in the supply chain for cost\n-effective building retrofits.\n&#xa0;\nWe made detailed comments in response to the pre-launch consultat\nion.  We reiterate three key points:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWith these qualificatio\nns we believe that these policies have an important contribution to developing a better approach to energy efficiency in buildings.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nW\nhile the general demand trend \nfor heat \nis downwar\nds, we believe \nthe relative importance of weather, the economic downturn, energy prices and improvements to the existing building stock \nis \ndifficult to \nascertain\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBiomass is attractive for heat production from a cost, \nflexibility and GHG perspective. \n \nH\nowever for the latter to be truly optimised, good accounting \nmethodology is required in order to facilitate informed choices about biomass feedstock type\n, agricultural practices\n, transportation choice\ns, and conversion technologies.  Increasing the amount of sustainably produced biomass removes carbon dioxide from th\ne atmosphere.  Incentivising the use of biomass for energy production does not necessarily lead to an overall increase in \nsustainable\n production.\n&#xa0;\nAny methodology needs to strike an appropriate b\nalance between robustness\n, tractability and auditability. \nThe\n effects of direct land use c\nhange are not fully supported by sufficient scientific evidence and \nindirect land use c\nhange effects add further complexity\n. \n \nCurrent methodology for accou\nnting for lifecycle GHGs does not\n take account of the length of time tak\nen for carbon emissions released from biomass combustion to be removed from\n the atmosphere (carbon debt).  \nIt also allows generators to use default values instead of actual values for many of the GHG sustainability criteria calculations, without verificati\non. Therefore these \nare\n na\ntural improvements, which we understand are receiving attention.\n&#xa0;\nThe ETI E\ncosystem Land Use Modelling (E\nLUM\n)\n project is collecting detailed \nexperimental \ndata on the changes to soil carbon and GHG emissions associated with land us\ne transitions to bioenergy \ncrops \nin the UK, and will generate significant evidence to inform the debate on carbon accounting of biomass production and associated land use change.  For UK biomass production it is much easier to understand the counterfactual\n – what would have happened if biomass had not been grown and used for energy production.  Nevertheless there may well be opportunities for \nGHG\n reduction by using imported bioenergy\n, provided confidence can be es\ntablished in the counterfactual and the cred\nit is not claimed under agriculture by the producer and \nunder \nenergy by the UK consumer.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe understand that these guidelines are currently under review\n.  Current cr\niteria cover\n \nland use change and GHG emissions. \nWe note\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHe\nat is currently generated mainly by the combustion of gas, oil, wood and coal.  All of these generate nitrogen oxides (Nox) and all but gas generate some level of particulates.  Large central generation plant addresses these emissions more effectively than\n smaller CHP generators.  Road traffic is a very signif\nicant source of these emissions, especially in terms of individual exposure.\n&#xa0;\nTypically we would expect well-designed biomass CHP schemes to produce lower levels of emissions than existing \noil-fired or\n coal heating systems\n.  The overall production of Nox from a CHP scheme compared to domestic boilers and central generation is unlikely to be problematic in terms of air quality in urban areas, although this should be considered in planning and siting.\n&#xa0;\nA\ndvanced technology for g\nasification of biomass and wastes enables clean-up of emissions and may be attractive for this reason in addition to its likely cost and efficiency benefits.  \nThe ETI Waste Gasification project is currently investigating the overall\n efficiency and carbon balance of th\nree\n technolog\nies\n, at a scale suitable for deployment at the ‘town’ level. The evidence generated from this project will accelerate the ability to provide \nvery \nclean CHP in more challenging air quality locations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe have estimated the costs of providing comfort and cleanliness in a typical dwelling using either a modern condensing combi-boiler or a very high efficiency air-source heat pump, such as \nthose\n now being launched in\n the UK market.\n&#xa0;\nThe annualised cost of \nthe combi-boiler is £930, of which £645 is gas costs at retail prices and the rest is maintenance and boiler capital charges.  The annualised cost of the heat pum\np is £1265, of which £205 is fuel cost\n at wholesale prices and the rest is the capital and ope\nrating costs, including the heat-pump, but also electricity generation \nby a modern Combined Cycle Gas-Turbine \n(CCGT) \nand \nother \nsupply\n costs\n.  This calculation \nincludes an allowance for upgrading the electricity distribution system.\n&#xa0;\nThe \ncombi-boiler produc\nes 2.9 Te\n CO\n2\n/year and the heat-pump 1.8.  Whereas the heat-pump can be made nearly zero-carbon by using a low carbon source, the gas-boiler emissions can only be reduced by some combination of increased insulation, reduced comfort and cleanliness and redu\nced wastage (eg \navoiding \nover-heating unoccupied dwellings\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur response \nrecently \nto the \nEnergy and Climate \nChange Committee’s c\nonsultation on Local Energy \ndescribed several barriers\n.\n&#xa0;\nCommunity he\nating via CHP has to compete with \ndomestic \ngas.  \nCommunity heating via CHP\n can achieve a 30% primary fuel use reduction.  \nHowever t\nhe lower\n operating costs a\nre offset by\n higher capital costs.  The technology is \ngenerally \nwell known and well established, \nwith some potential for improvements, but the main barriers are \nmostly \nfinancial and commercial:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe note that \nt\nhere is \nno framework \ncurrently \nto support\n integrated local future planning to utilise waste heat from existing \nindustrial \nplants and \nlarge thermal\n generating stations for community heat.\n&#xa0;\nTypically infrastructure projects of a similar nature (such as water supply,\n waste treatment and electricity) have been originally developed by governments at very low \ncosts of capital and or discount rates, making these projects more attractive. This is also comparable \nto other\n infrastructure projects such as railways, roads and \nair\nports.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe only heating solution which has strategic flexibility is District Heating, which ETI analysis suggest\ns\n could apply to up to 40% of buildings in the UK, although dense inner city areas would be the best location for in\nitial investment.  \n&#xa0;\nUntil we are confident of the timing of decarbonisation of electricity generation in the UK, the\n high cost of heat-pumps\n \nmakes them a problematic investment at a mass-scale.\n&#xa0;\nThe \ncombination of a small heat-pump with a gas boiler is potentially attractive in terms of maximising the return on the system efficiency benefits of the heat-pump and the ability of the gas boiler t\no meet the relatively infrequent peak heat loading requirements at low capital cost.\n  Units designed for this application are starting to be launched in the UK.\n We note these hybrids are not supported by the domestic RHI.\n&#xa0;\nUntil Smart Meters are widespread\n and we can see how variable electricity pricing works in practice, there are significant risks in projecting demand and supply side responses to this new relationship.  While consumers are used to complex tariffs for wholly private services such as hotel \nrooms and air travel, there is a tendency to simplify the tariffs for regulated services.  Clearly this can drive very significant cost increases \nthrough under-use of the expensive assets involved.  These will be borne ultimately by consumers.\n&#xa0;\nHeating sys\ntems design and control will have to develop significantly in the UK if the benefits of new technologies are to be exploited.  \nBad publicity\n stories attached to new heating technologies provide evidence of the risks.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis is a very important question in terms of longer term strategy.  We are not aware of any authoritative analysis for the UK that covers the complex social, technological, economic and climate change issues \ninvolved.  We anticipate that activities already planned by the Research Councils UK Energy Programme will provide better evidence for policy development over the next few years.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nn/a\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe answer to this depends on many factors which are beyond the remit of the ETI and we therefore cannot answer the question directly.  We note however that:\n&#xa0;\nWe also note that DECC has\n included detailed monitoring within the implementation which will enable the scheme performance to be accurately assessed.  We understand the initial objec\ntives of this scheme are to drive supply-side innovation and capacity building and gain valuable learning as a basis for future policy development.  We cannot see any significant opportunities for improvement.\n&#xa0;\nNo doubt the level of tariffs will be much de\nbated.  In our view it is difficult to discover the appropriate market level of tariffs prior to launching a scheme and prudent use of social resources would argue for a moderate but realistic start point.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe assume this question refers to thermal storage within buildings, since there are already market\n mechanisms to reward thermal storage in commercial settings, such as heating networks.  \nWhere district heating is likely to be the long-term best heating option for a group of dwellings, then providing financial support for retaining or installing storage\n in individual buildings would be an unproductive use of social resources, with distribution-scale storage more appropriate.  \nGiven the current limited coverage of \ndomestic \nheating networks, we will not make f\nurther comments, although large-\nscale geologica\nl \nheat \nstorage has been the subject of\n preliminary\n ETI r\nesearch\n, along with geo\nlogical storage of hydrogen \nas the lowest cost seasonal low carbon energy store.\n&#xa0;\nThere is limited value in thermal storage for buildings heated by gas or oil and much \nof\n this is being removed because of the very high \nutility\n of space in the UK, modest efficiency gains and industry practise\n (wall mounted combi-boilers)\n.  Electrically heated buildings typically include significant storage in the form of storage radiators or\n large structural thermal mass (such as underfloor heating).\n  There are already tariff structures, such as Economy 7 that reward storage associated with electrical heating, either resistive or heat-pump based.\n&#xa0;\nThis question is really about preparing for the future in buildings where heat-pumps are likely to be the best solution.  \nCurrent key government actions in this area include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnder \nour \nSSH\n \nProgramme \nwe are launching a wide range of projects which examine the role of storage technologies as part of an integrated systems solution for different types of location across the UK\n, working closely with selected local authorities.\n&#xa0;\nUntil there is a compelling evidence base to support policy development and an overall strategy for the development of the UK energy system\n the only area of additional activity we would recommend is to en\nsure that new build properties include sufficient hot water storage to avoid demand peaking for domestic water heating.  This is on the grounds that it will be hard to retrofit these properties with heat stores later, once the requirements are clear.  New \nbuild properties should have relatively low space heating demands and good design practise would include sufficient thermal mass to avoid temperature swings.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
