[normal]Advisory Council for the Education of Romany and other [bold]Travellers[bold] (ACERT) – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]This response is from [bold]ACERT[bold] ([bold]Advisory Council for the Education of Romany and other Travellers) who can be contacted via the website as below…[bold]http://www.acert.org.uk/
[normal]We wish to comment on Clause 21 of the Draft Deregulation Bill regarding the removal of the power of Ministers to require local authorities to prepare housing strategies under Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003.  
[normal]Whilst this proposal is consistent with the Government’s desire to promote localism and reduce bureaucracy, we believe that it fails to recognise both the particular and urgent need for the provision of additional accommodation for Gypsy / Roma / Traveller communities and the current slow progress of local authorities towards meeting that need.
[normal]Clause 21 as proposed states:
[normal](1) Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (which confers powers on the Secretary of State, in relation to England and the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to require local housing authorities to have housing strategies and to prepare housing statements) ceases to have effect in relation to England.
[normal]Section 8 of the Housing Act 1985 [bold]requires local authorities to consider the various accommodation needs of all local populations and to carry out periodic reviews in order to provide relevant and appropriate provision to meet these needs. 
[normal]Section 8 (1) actually says:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Every local housing authority shall consider housing conditions in their district and the needs of the district with respect to the provision of further housing accommodation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additionally, 
[normal]Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004 [bold]requires local authorities to develop and implement strategies to respond to the specific accommodation needs of the Gypsy and Traveller communities living in their areas
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our understanding is that these two pieces of legislation will remain in place and are not subject to the provisions of the Deregulation Bill.
[normal] [bold]Assuming
[normal] [bold]that this is the case and that the duty to consider the "needs of the district" will still apply in the future, if local authorities are still carrying out such assessment work then we suggest it does not seem logical to discontinue the requirement to produce housing strategies and statements for reasons of public accountability at the very least. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local Authorities were previously under a formal legal duty to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers. This was established by the Caravan Sites Act 1968 which was a private members bill proposed by Eric Lubbock MP, now Lord Avebury. This piece of legislation was successful in causing a significant number of sites to be provided prior to the Act’s effective repeal as a result of measures contained within the Criminal Justice &amp; Public Order Act 1994. 
[normal]Since 1994 the numbers of Gypsies and Travellers requiring authorised places to live or stop on far outweigh the number of authorised pitches available. Since Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004 was enacted along with other measures, there has been at least some positive progress in site provision, but the effect of Clause 21 of the Deregulation Bill would threaten such progress. 
[normal]According to the current most reliable figures, some 20% of the Gypsy and Traveller population in England who live in caravans reside on unauthorised encampments and unauthorised developments.  The simple reason why this occurs is that there is still inadequate provision of sites.  
[normal]It has been widely reported that the UN Special Rapporteur on Housing, following her recent visit to the UK, stated:
[normal]In closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and Traveller communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Governments and society as a whole. Despite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decision with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller settled communities remains a source of concern.
[normal]The Government’s current planning policy, 
[normal]Planning policy for traveller sites
[normal], states that every local authority should already have in place a five year deliverable supply of sites. We would suggest that virtually no local authorities have such a supply in place within their Local Plan.
[normal]We also suggest that this means that not only should there continue to be proper local housing strategies in place but also there should be on-going Government involvement to ensure that sites are provided, otherwise history has shown that local authorities will not provide the necessary sites.  
[normal]In summary then, we [bold]foresee considerable issues with Clause 21 and ask that it be removed from the Bill.[bold]September 2012
