"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nMy name is Peter Martin, a private resident in the UK.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI submit evidence because I believe the BBC as it stands in word and deed no longer represents me or my family, our wishes or the best interests of the country whose name it \nbears.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI can see no justification for their ‘unique’ funding to be compelled by a tax on the population for watching broadcast content live, and certainly not (as some suggest) in future for possessing the means to receive web-based content by any means. I\nt is an anachronism in the global village of 2013 and beyond.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 I seek to address two main questions listed from the committee document, as all others become rendered redundant if the answers to these are proven to be negative:\n&#xa0;\n* \n              \nHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?\n&#xa0;\n* \n              \nHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?\n&#xa0;\n2.2 BBC Charters and guidelines and fancy mission statements aside,\n simply put, I would like the committee to shine a spotlight on whether the BBC has, is and can in future deliver a professional, accurate broadcast product based on objectivity and integrity.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 And does the BBC have regulatory mechanisms in place that \nare transparent, fair, responsive and effective to keep it that way?\n&#xa0;\nYes... or no?\n&#xa0;\n2.4 If no, and examples to follow will provide substantive evidence of this, funding or governance, remits, representations, promotions, etc are moot.\n&#xa0;\n2.5 If a national b\nroadcast media monopoly can't be accurate or trustworthy, it has no business being in business.\n&#xa0;\nEspecially by state-enforced, compelled funding means.\n&#xa0;\n2.6 Hence I propose to illustrate failures of purported mission during Charter period, and in complemen\nt worse failures in oversight as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAppreciating that individual complaints can and will not be entertained, nonetheless my (vastly documented) \npersonal experiences with the latter do have a bearing and will be mentioned (evidence available).\n&#xa0;\nThe abuses are egregious and go to the core of all the BBC needs, at last, with luck via this committee, to be held to account for properly.\n&#xa0;\n3. Mission Creep &amp; Failure&#xa0;\n3.1 There seems of late a plethora of inquiries, reviews &amp; consultations &amp; surveys regarding the BBC, from inside to out.\n&#xa0;\nIn short order we have had Pollard (as will be discussed later, one must wonder what its £3M tag was that worth?) \nhttp://bl\no\ngs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100246954/lord-patten-must-find-out-the-truth-about-j\nimmy-savile-mark-thompson-and-the-pollard-review/\n ) &amp; Rose, the NAO and PAC. Maybe more.\nPlus various BBC initiatives.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://consultations.external.bbc.co.uk/bbc/news_review\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/whoweare/wherenext/\n?\n&#xa0;\nAs a mere member of the public it is often hard to keep up, much less stay on top of it all. But as one taking\n a big interest in the national broadcaster that claims to speak for me, more often at me, when an opportunity to speak back comes, especially out of their often less than trustworthy controls, it needs to be grasped.\n&#xa0;\nOne recognizes there’s a danger such \ninterest and challenge sees key issues get lost in the attrition of vast volumes of testimony and data.\n&#xa0;\nBut these are all not appearing by mere coincidence. There has been for too long something very rotten at the heart of the BBC, and despite great claim\ns, there are some (even those well entrenched and often with the empathy of familiarity) with reduced confidence.\n&#xa0;\nThe committee will be getting many submissions of detail into BBC failures of bias and impartiality as broadcasters, plus eye-watering waste \nand inefficiency as a public-sector ‘business’. I will add a few lowlights of my own. But for a neat summary you could do worse than these on who there spends what money how well:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2515367/LITTLEJOHN-And-BBC--1bn-wasted.html\nOr this:\nhttp://standpointmag.co.uk/features-december-13-scrap-the-licence-fee-and-privatise-the-bbc-tim-congdon\n?\n&#xa0;\n3.2 Here’s a recent review by Open Democracy. They post infrequently, and often err on the ‘understanding’ of the BBC’s mission and issues, but \ncan\n delve deeply, so this one was a novel detailed critique to see:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.opendemocracy.net/ourbeeb/lis-howell/tony-halls-speech-didnt-answer\n-any-of-real-questions\n&#xa0;\nThe whole point to any BBC supposed response and… what often seems an attitude from top down epitomized by the Trust Chair: ‘the BBC only asks questions and does not answer them’.\n&#xa0;\n’I don’t think James Purnell really answered the\n points I made. These weren’t debating points or arguments about stance or even about policy. There were things I wanted to know – practical factual things which I wanted Tony Hall to tell me.‘\n&#xa0;\n’If your pension or your salary comes via investments in ITV \nor Sky, or any other media organisation which isn’t subsidised by the licence fee, you have every right to be alarmed by the BBC using your licence fee money to undercut the commercial organisations which pay you. This was an issue which was supposed to be\n dealt with by the BBC Trust,’\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC is non-commercial, obviously. But it seems to exist, and is uniquely funded, to crush opposition. Overseen by that ill-named Trust. \n&#xa0;\n’it seems highly likely that there will be fewer licence fee payers in the future,\n even though one-person-homes have increased. So the money just isn’t going to be there’.\n&#xa0;\nUnless, of course, those who have hacked away at critics online and print (the Times? Since when?) get their ways to seeing a propaganda and censorship-guided, state\n-enforced imposition of a fee that any PC or internet connection requires a BBC tithe too? That is, of course, a question. As is this…\n&#xa0;\n’Do Tony and James really understand the vast numbers of well-informed people with hugely differing demands out there?’\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC won’t, or will try and get it lost in a sea of attrition, so I’ll offer a definitive answer: No.\n&#xa0;\nBut that won’t stop them doing all in their power to ensure such people are isolated, mocked, twitter-hounded and crushed in having any say, or influ\nence on a majority of sofa-bound UK public who get their information, in, out or ‘enhanced’ via the BBC edit suite’s highly unique filter.\n&#xa0;\nYou can’t tell everyone how much you are trusted or transparent you are, when you’re not, without learning a few les\nsons from history. Some treasures may end up better buried.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 Here’s another telling comment from a hardly critical source about the BBC, claims, ‘sources who say’, and what they expect of others but wouldn’t dream of applying to themselves:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://tradingaswdr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/busy-line.html\n&#xa0;\n‘The DG told MPs this week that one employee has left the organisation following an investigation into harassment – but will we ever kn\now their name, and departure details ?\n \n&#xa0;\nI wondered about that. Can’t you just see some hapless CEO, under full glare of a Paxo or Humph seeking answers to a something costing the public a bob or two or, worse, an ‘ism, coming out with a ‘someone is respon\nsible and they are now elsewhere’ without a wee bit more probing?\n&#xa0;\nIn a world now no longer as sanguine about rewards for failure, it is one thing to bribe the less able to take the heave-ho, but delving into those deep, uniquely-funded pockets to remove a\n bully, on top of their avoiding censure or publicity not always accorded the rest of the non-gilded classes, seems… very generous. \n&#xa0;\n3.4 Just a couple more organisations who have, are and will rightly ask questions, but who have rarely seen any answers:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://bbcwatch.org/2012/11/22/not-enough-israelis-killed-by-home-made-contraptions-for-bbcs-mishal-husain/\n&#xa0;\nhttp://isthebbcbiased.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-ottomans-armenian-genocide.html\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2013/10/bbc-trust-rejects-thought-for-the-day-bias-complaint\n&#xa0;\n3.5 I am mostly steering clear of bias, as it is like nailing jelly to the wall, and indeed the BBC savours the opportunity to do so, but even so the\nre are certain matters of fact that can still matter:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.\ndailymail.co.uk/news/article-2478643/Duncan-Smith-blasts-BBC-bedroom-tax-bias-Work-Pensions-Secretary-accuses-corporation-promoting-Labours-views-furious-letter.html\n&#xa0;\nMisleading viewers, and the phrase was ‘innately political and indeed factually wrong’\n. Correct or not?\n&#xa0;\n3.6 Acting as an unofficial opposition, in frustration at the calibre of those that fail in the BBC’s view to hold governments to proper account, is not the role of the BBC. Even the BBC’s own staff seem conflicted about what a lack of a\nccountability delivers:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/29/graham-norton-bbc-multimillion-payoffs\n?\n&#xa0;\n“\"sacks of cash\" were being \nhanded to people who had brought the corporation into disrepute at a time when others were being asked to tighten their belts.”\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3916147.ece\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2492363/BBC-big-left-wing-ignored-critics-immigration-Brussels-head-news-a\ndmits.html\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/28/bbc-coverage-favouring-climate-change-sceptics\n?\n&#xa0;\n‘the organisation should be\n taking much greater care over the accuracy of its reporting – especially in the area of science where misreporting can cause disastrous results,’\n ‘28Gate’ highlighting truly dire practices.\n&#xa0;\n3.7 And when their own top staff get told to shut up when concer\nned:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/04/bbc-critics-cohen-dimbleby-saunders-damaging-corporation\n&#xa0;\nWhat chance for hapless publi\nc critics? The arrogance and sense of invincible entitlement is palpable.\n&#xa0;\n3.8 There is something deeply troubling about how things between ‘official’ bodies, oddly complicit press, and the BBC itself, often do give the appearance of serious exchange and r\nesponse, when in fact it is no more than making a fiction of ‘balance’ out of complaints from two sides. \n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2013/10/31/miller-light.html\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21511904\n&#xa0;\nA rare beast, A BBC interactive post with over 2,000 comments. But look at the top-rated ones. See how many do not support the BBC corporate line and, more crucially, how ma\nny have ceased to exist.\n&#xa0;\nA potent reminder of how the BBC’s propaganda does \nnot speak for this nation, and who it is defending by censorship.\n&#xa0;\n4. Failure in Trust &amp; Transparency&#xa0;\nhttp://bbcwatch.org/2012/11/19/bbcs-jon-donnison-tweets-malicious-fauxtography/comment-page-2/#comments\nSeems I am not alone:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/eldar-elaev/my-complaint-to-the-bbc-due-to-their-liar-of-a-reporter-jon-donnison/1\n0151175668408802\n&#xa0;\n4.1 I am reminded of much regarding the BBC Complaints ‘techniques’ following the internal furore recently created by the gaffe-prone new Newsnight Editor (ported to a broadcast role from the Guardian by the ever unique logic of the BB\nC high command) getting rid of an employee, which seldom plays well with the staff:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/susanwatts/2009/01/restoring_\nscience_to_its_right.html\n&#xa0;\n4.2 Worth checking what became of others’ efforts at expressing concern. A litany of deceit mainly. A BBC unchallenged is a BBC given licence to run wild. Look what happens when they do…\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2012/11/25/28-gate-still-running.html\n&#xa0;\n4.3 Actually, not a lot. Even when nailed. The irony is how those involved in this have subsequently foundered, but not on the basis of s\nuch activities, or in a timely manner. And then there’s the utterly bizarre Wild West of the BBC staff twitter accounts:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://biasedbbc.org/in-their-own-tweets/\n&#xa0;\n'I present The Newsroom on the \nBBC World Service. Not a BBC spokeswoman. Occasionally facetious. And, sigh, RT doesn't = endorsement.'\n&#xa0;\nOne just from the other day. In her bio she says she presents stuff on the BBC, but is not a BBC spokeswoman. No other organisation would get away with\n this.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 All overseen, in theory impartially, by ‘The Trust’, paid by and beholden to the licence fee… not its payers. And at the very top:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://tradingaswdr.blogspot.co.uk/20\n13/11/dog-with-bone.html\n&#xa0;\n“We do not see why it is \"inappropriate\" to question—in public—a publicly-funded organisation on a review it has conducted, and what it will be doing to follow up that review. The BBC Trust's defensiveness on this point is deep\nly disappointing and the broad-brush nature of the refusal will be of interest to all Select Committees.”\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-d\niary/plot-thickens-over-pollard-review-8978057.html\n&#xa0;\n“\nThey have had\n&#xa0;\na response and have written straight back in frustration at what they see as BBC stonewalling.”\n&#xa0;\nhttp://order-order.com/2013/12/02/patten-of-cover-ups-at-bbc/\n&#xa0;\n“It later emerged the Pollard Report did not contain the key piece of evidence that Mark Thompson was told about the allegations the show was preparing to make. This we already know, and Lor\nd Patten continues to claim the report was all above board despite two weeks ago being played a tape recording of Nick Pollard admitting his report is deeply flawed and that he made “a mistake””\n&#xa0;\nhttp://order-order.com/2013/12/04/a-patten-emerges-pressure-turned-up-on-bbc-chairman/\n&#xa0;\nAnd yet we are continually told that The Trust is there to prevent abuses. \nRubbish. It does not, and is complicit in enough o\nf its own. \nI make complaints to the BBC when I feel they err. It is my right. It is their duty to respond, and act if necessary. \n&#xa0;\n4.5 And not too little, too late, dragged from the living flesh to delay and obfuscate so it can’t matter any more:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/12/james-hardings-right-the-bbc-must-do-some-a\nccountability-journalism-but-on-the-savile-scandal-report/\n&#xa0;\n4.6 On Monday, on FaceBook, they had this:\n&#xa0;\nShould ‪#\n&#x200e;\nThai‬ Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra step down?\nhttp://www.bbc.\nco.uk/news/world-asia-25181806\n&#xa0;\nI find that an extraordinary way for the state media of my country to ‘report’ on the politics of another, and want no part of it in my name. \n&#xa0;\nAre you in Thailand? Have you been protesting in Bangkok? Please tell us your experiences using the form below&#xa0;\nWhy are they drumming up support from and for self-confessed rebels clearly not too keen on democracy? Pure propaganda.\n&#xa0;\n4.7 And when faced with such questions, what they actually do is procrastinate, prevaricate and in e\nxtreme cases lash out in total abuse of their authority. I am currently ‘banned’, meaning they don’t feel they need look at respond to any concerns I raise. Why?\n&#xa0;\nMore critically, what gives the BBC the right and authority to investigate me using what is in effect private detectives, simply to silence a critic?I made a complaint (around May 2012) to the BBC via its online portal. They responded by claiming they are banning me from pointing out their inaccuracies and unprofessionalism based \nnot on merit of complaint, but on the number of times I catch them out. More crucially, they dredge up ‘alleged’ evidence, and to date umproven, based on what appears to be a concerted effort to search the entire global internet for commenters who are crit\ncial about the BBC and may be me. Or at least close enough for their purposes.\nI demanded to know what they are playing at making searches across the internet and social media even attempting, but failing to prove any linkages between me the complainant an\nd any critics they may be obsessing about in service of internal grievances. Far from providing any explanation, they initiate a vast, several month long multi-£ ‘investigation’ into the ‘case’, but actually more on me, \ndragging in outside investigators to\n further share in/enhance the information held.\nThe ‘investigation’ and ‘evidence’ is held in camera, and anonymously within the BBC at all times, with no opportunity for challenge or clarification. The right to question or challenge is routinely ignored.\nThe BBC Trust arbitrates upon this, and dismisses any concerns on such extra-BBC activity as a matter of ‘belief’ the BBC has nothing to answer for. I beg to differ. The ICO also has now expressed interest.\n&#xa0;\n4.8 The BBC 'Trust' Star Chamber of course meets\n in secret, and only interviews un-named BBC-selected witnesses and/or experts behind doors closed to the public. What they see and hear is therefore anyone's guess. This is a key part of their steamroller unaccountability (of course such as previous DG's,\n Nick Pollard, etc, have discovered/claimed that they can't be held to account because mystery underlings have kept them out of such loops... another Beware of the Leopard implausible deniability creation of theirs for just such a reason). At the start Pol\nlard was mentioned, not in a good way. Now, it is back again, and in light of what is raised here, in even less good a way.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100247971/why-nick-pollards-report-on-jimmy-savile-just-doesnt-make-sense/\n&#xa0;\n4.9 This of course focuses on but one, if highly-remunerated and Teflon-coated member of the BBC top tier. One in whom I have \nmaintained an interest as she was at the time of my expediting at highest level of the process in complement to the Trust on matters of editorial complaint.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-tossers-who-could-win-for-the-tories-425799.html\n&#xa0;\n‘Don't bother emailing complaints to BBC head of news Helen Boaden… Discussion turned to protest groups and lobbying outfits which email their views to\n senior editors. Boaden's response: \"Oh, I just changed my email address.\" So much for the Beeb being accountable.’\n&#xa0;\nAs with Mr. Pollard’s claims and those in the Indy, if they are not true, one might wonder why they have not been challenged? So, much expl\nained. So very little excused.\n&#xa0;\n5. Conclusion Maybe the last words on BBC trust, transparency and sincerity in response should go to the BBC, or at least from its pages to those it purports to ‘speak for’ (well worth looking at the top rated):\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25213116\n&#xa0;\nI would have chipped in myself but, as so often happens when things veer from the BBC-preferred narrative, the plug got pulled &amp; comments clos\ned before most get home from real work. Such propaganda backed by cynical censorship has a depressingly familiar historical ring to it.\n&#xa0;\nA BBC hiding behind such practices has no future I can endorse\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
