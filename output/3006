defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:
default Good 
defaultafternoon and thank you for coming. We are somewhat depleted this afternoon because some of my colleagues want to participate i
defaultn question and answer on the F
defaultloor of the House on press self
default&#x2011;
defaultregulation
default—
defaultsays he, choosing his words carefully
default—
defaultso would ask to present their apologies. Could you very briefly introduce yourselves? I think you have both been before the Committee before.
defaultMark Addison:
default 
defaultIndeed. My name is Mark Addison. I am the chair of t
defaulthe NMC and this is Jackie Smith, 
defaultthe chief executive.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much. You are probably aware that we saw the Professional Standards Authority in July and their assessment suggested that the NMC was making some progress toward
defaults
default an improved registration/regulation service
default,
default which gives you some external view 
defaultof progress being made, b
defaultut I wondered how you rate your own progress. Self
default&#x2011;
defaultassessment
default might be more demanding than external assessment.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultThank you
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat gives me a good cue
default 
defaultto say the first few words I thought I might say
default—to do a bit of scene setting—
defaultat the beginning. Then, if it is acceptable to the Committee, the
defaultre are two specific areas 
defaultI think it would be helpful if Jackie could flag up initially and then we can move on to the more specific areas you may want to cover. It will be very brief.
defaultChair:default 
defaultPlease, yes.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultThe first piece does play exa
defaultctly to that, I think, Chair. 
defaultThe points I want to make are about the progress we have made, which will play to the news I hope t
defaulthat you have heard from the PSA, and
default the challenges in the year to come and beyond. 
defaultI
defaultt also might be sensible to clear up right at the outset my own and indeed Jackie
default’
defaults position. It was a specific recommendation that the Committee made last year and I thought it might be useful to get that out on the table up
default 
defaultfront. 
defaultOn progress
default we are just over halfway through the two
default&#x2011;
defaultyear timetable, effectively, that
default 
defaultthe PSA
default, as it is now, 
defaultgave us to get our act together. We are 14 months into that period. My view is that we have delivered some sound an
defaultd solid progress against all 
defaultthe recommendations in that initial report. The areas I would highlight particularly 
defaultthat
default the PSA dealt with concern clarity of purpose, the governance of the organisation
default—
defaultwe have, of course, a new slimmed
default&#x2011;
defaultdown
default council
default—
defaultthe performance on some 
defaultaspects but by no means all 
defaultaspects of fitness to practise, which we will no doubt come on to in more detail, financial stability and capacity. The culture of the organisation and the mood of the staff I
default think have improved—
defaultJac
defaultkie will say a word about that—
defaultand we have also strengthened relationships with external stakeholders. Those are all things that the PSA mentioned where we have made some solid and sound progress. That has enabled us to begin to think about getting beyond the engine
default&#x2011;
defaultroom
default fixing stage that I described last year to thinking more generally about the protection of the public and how that can be strengthened 
defaultand what our role is in that. 
defaultThe 
default“
defaultchallenges ahead
default”
default moves on absolutely seamlessly from that analysis, I think. First o
defaultf all there is still 
defaultvery clearly unfinished
default 
defaultbusiness around some aspects of performance. On the FTP front that is essentially around the adjudication timetable. We have a target of getting that down to six months, as you know, by the end of the next calendar year; that remains a big challenge. There is still a mountain to climb in relation to adjudication. We also have work to do to complete the review, 
defaultand the 
defaultdevelopment of new policy on and ensuring compliance with registration processes, which we are well advanced on but there
default is still further work to do. 
defaultM
defaultore substantively, 
defaultbeyond that, we have a big agenda around public protection
default,
default which is linked to the Francis report. So in the coming year we will be focusing very much on revalidation, the review of the code and the standards, the strengthening of coll
defaultaboration with other regulators and on
default developing a more proactive presence across the four countries out there
default,
default closer to the front line and to employers
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat agenda
default, I think, 
defaultwill 
defaultnot just 
defaultoccupy us for 
defaultthe following year but 
defaulta good deal beyond 
defaultthat. 
defaultIf I may, I will finally say a word about my own and Jackie
default’
defaults position
default,
default to set out where we have got to. My original appointment was for 18 months, which would have taken me up to the middle of March next year. Following a discussion with the council and then with the Department, the current intention is that my appointment would be extended until the end of the next calendar year, so until the end of 2014. There would then be an open competition to find a successor
default,
default which would start up effectively in the second half of next year, to complete and find a successor by the close of the calendar year. As to Jackie
default’
defaults position, when we were last before 
defaultyou 
defaultshe was the substantive chief executive. She is now the permanently appointed substantive chief executive of the NMC, I am delight
defaulted to say. If Jackie could 
defaulthave a couple of minutes of your time on two items
default—
default  
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI promise not t
defaulto take up too much time, Chair, if I can just 
defaultraise two points. As Mark said, the Committee understandably probed us last year on the culture of the organisation. We have done quite 
defaulta bit in the last year. We 
defaultcarried out a staff survey which I 
defaultthink underlines that the organ
defaultisation understands its purpose:
default 94% of staff responded saying they understood the ai
defaultms and objectives of the NMC. 
defaultThe second thing
default is in relation to revalidation. I hope the Committee will have seen that council approved the proposals for the model for validation in September
default. O
defaultbviously we will answer questions.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe will certainly come on to revalidation. I want to start, if I may, by going back to some of the discussion of last year about the fitness
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultpractise
default process. The Royal College of Nu
defaultrsing has talked to individual m
defaultembers of the Committee and submitted evidence to the effect that some cases are still taking up to five years to resolve. 
defaultI am not suggesting there are
default large numbers, but any number that takes that long I assume you would agree is unacceptable. 
defaultJackie Smithdefault: I think we 
defaultsaid in evidence previously that we had 1,589 cases that were opened before January 2011. We had a target to complete those by December 2014. We currently have 44 left, 41 of which have be
defaulten scheduled for a hearing. T
defaulthe case load, aside from that, came into existence after January 2011. 
defaultT
defaulthe cases that we have been dealing with in recent months have been the most difficult because they are the oldest and I completely accept that is too long, but I think we can demonstrate that we have improved significantly in clearing the historic case load.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultApart
default from that 44, you have no case from before the beginning of 2012. 
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultExcept where there are 
defaultthird-party investigations. I
defaultf there is a police investigation being carried out, we will wait until that concludes. There will be some cases, but not very many.
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultDo you know how many?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI can certainly update the Committee afterwards with that figure.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultGiven the history, in terms of confidence building, apart from anything else, as well as performance management, it would be helpful to be able to say, 
default“
defaultWe know every single case that exists from before 2012,
default”
default which is now nearly two years away.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI can certainly update the Committee afterwards on that figure
default, but I 
defaultassure you it is small.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Then we go on to what is acceptable 
defaultfor the future. Could you c
defaultlarify to the Committee 
defaultyour current thinking about acceptable performance for 
defaultboth investigation and decision,
default because if y
defaultou are an individual registrant
default the key thing is t
defaulthe length of time to a decision?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. At the moment, on average, it takes us just over eight months to investigate a complaint. Two years ago it was taking us 22 months. On average, at the moment it is taking us just over seven month
defaults
default to adjudicate a case. That has not changed hugely, although it has come down. That partly reflects the sheer volume that we have in the adjudication stage. 
defaultOn
default average at the moment it is taking us just over 15 months. With the introduction of case examiners, thanks to the Department of Health helping us with our legal framework, the investigation stage should be quicker
default, but I am afraid that, 
defaultuntil we get the Law Commission 
defaultat the table
default and are able to dispose o
defaultf cases other than at a hearing,
default we are not going to do a great deal to shorten the adjudication part.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultTaking the two stages separately, what do you think is a reasonable objective in terms of an adjudication time scale?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultA reasonable objective is six months. We would like to get it down from that position, but we cannot bring it down until we have alternative methods of disposing of cases.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Focusing for a second on that small word 
defaultyou used, 
default“
defaultaverage
default”
default, averages conceal a lot of evils. What is the maximum period of time that it should take you to investigate a case?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe want to get to 15 months by the end of 2015.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat i
defaults the maximum for investigation.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: A
defaultnd adjudicatio
defaultn—from start to finish.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default M
defaultaximum, not average? The reason I am pushing you is that some of the papers that have been presented to us, I think, have confused 
default“
defaultmaximum
default”
default and 
default“
defaultaverage
default”
default.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. We were rather conscious of that. The Committee
default’
defaults recommendations last year were couched largely in terms of timetables in terms of averages
default,
default with the important proviso that no case should take longer than a certain amount, which is one way of doing it. In fact, the way we have set targets is a combination of those two notions and requires us to complete 90% of cases within a certain time
default 
defaultframe. These averages and 90% figures are quite hard to compare. Jackie has been using the language that the Committee used around averages, but it does leave open the risk that you can have a very long tail, which is why, in a sense, it is quite helpful to thin
defaultk of the target that Jackie 
defaultmentioned of 90%, or the vast majority of cases, being within 15 months, which we think is achievable
default—
defaultperhaps I could just clarify this
default—
defaultwith the benefit of the 
defaultsection 60 
defaultchanges that we have been promised by the Department
default, which
default will allow us to introduce case examiners as well as the right to review investigation decisions. That is what we think we can achieve with the current policy commitments. What we can achieve with the other changes 
defaultthat
default may come with the Law Commission is a different matter and will enable us to get within striking distance, if not achieve, the sort of average timetable that the Committee was talking about last year.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What I would 
defaultfind helpful
default—
defaultand I hope my colleagues
default on the Committee would—is 
defaultto receive from you a statement of what you think is a reasonable definition
default 
defaultof key performance indicators for fitness
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultpractise
default procedures
default,
default given the state of the current law and 
defaultrecommendations for the future, 
defaulthow you think that KPI should be formulated, reflecting what I think would be the Committee
default’
defaults view that it is one thing to have an average or a 90% indicator but if you are an individual nurse the thing that matters most is the guarantee that the case will be disposed of, on a worst case, within a given time scale. 
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYes, understood. We are very happy to do that and we will try and make it clear when we are talking about averages, when we are talking about 90%, when we are talking about everything
default,
default and we will also try and be clear about what is achievable under different policy envi
defaultronments currently planned and, 
defaultaspiration
defaultally
default, 
defaultwith the 
defaultLaw Commission.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much. That would be very helpful.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultCan we move on to the Francis report? Your organisation published a full response in July 2012, including a series of actions and time scales
default:
default 
default“
defaultTo evaluate our education standards,
default”
default 
default“
defaultTo raise our profile,
default”
default and, third
defaultly
default, 
default“
defaultTo strengthen our collaborative work with other regulators.
default” 
defaultWhich of Francis
default’
defaults recommendations are you implementing, please?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe are implementing the ones 
defaultthat
default directly impact on the NMC. You have touched on
default those—profile and 
defaultproactivity
default 
defaultparticularly. We will evaluate our pre
default&#x2011;
defaultregistration
default nursing standards, which we launched in 2010, in 2014
default,
default and we are reviewing the code in readiness for our revalidation proposals.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultBut do you feel you have addr
defaultessed those three basic points—
defaulteducation standards, getting your profile up so that people know you exist and 
defaultthe 
defaultstrengthening of collaborative work with other regulators?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI think we have started to address them. I do not
default—
default 
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default You 
defaulttalked about nursing standards.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI am sorry, I did not hear that.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultYou referred to some other points, but I wondered if yo
defaultu had managed yet to tackle th
defaulte core points that were in your response in 2012.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes. We responded in July this year
default—
default2013. That was the response that went to council. We have just started to scope what improved profile and 
defaultproactivity
default would look like and we have set out a timetable for the code and our standards.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultDo you think you can deliver within the resources you have?
default Is there a resources issue? D
defaulto you feel you have enough money to do the work? Surely you are going to say no
default;
default everyone always does.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultIt is a very big question.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe have evaluated the cost of the Francis recommendations that impact directly on the NMC. We have been clear about the cost of revalidation to the NMC. There is a different discussion around fees. I have no doubt that this Committee will want to come back to that, but we are happy to remind the Committee of the decision that council took last October when it made the very difficult decision to increase fees from £76 to £100 with, obviously, support from the Gove
defaultrnment. Our current priorities—
defaultwhat we h
defaultave said we will set out to do—
defaultare affordable.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultYou have set out your stall and the various actions you are taking, but what overall can the NMC do to prevent another Mid Staff
defaults
default?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI think there are many things that we can do better. We have to 
defaultwork alongside nurse directors. O
defaultne of the proposals we are making
default is
default to have regional officers. We have to work better with the CQC in England
default, and
default the system regulators in the other countries too. We need to make better use of our data and we need to identify areas that represent a high risk. All those things will help us identify if there is another Mid Staff
defaults. T
defaulthere is plenty the NMC can do, is doing or is working towards doing.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultCan I add to that list one thing that we have been 
defaultaddressing 
defaultrecently, which is other registrants being prepared to raise concerns and encouraging them to come forward? One of the striking 
defaultthings for me about Mid Staff
defaults was the number of cases that went through our fitness
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultpractise
default regime 
defaultthat
default we ourselves referred rather than them coming from the trust or colleagues there. It is an interesting and concerning point
default,
default and we are 
defaulttrying to place
default a lot more emphasis on encouraging and enabling nurses and midwives to see that part of their responsibility is to alert employers and, if necessary, us to failures of practice out there.
default That should help resolve it.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultTalking of failures of practice, how many cases from Mid Staff
defaults
default do you still have ongoing?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThe precise number I do not have to hand, but I can provide the Committee with it. We have a number that are in the queue for
default a hearing. There are some which
default have been adjourned and are coming back for a decision in November.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultThere have been 55 in total.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWith this new regime you have, how are you going to get the information out about the lessons that have been learned? Do you have a plan to disseminate the lessons that come out of these cases?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: Recently we 
defaultlooked at our FTP data over the last 18 months, looked at the cases that were closed by an investigating committee and closed or dealt with at a final panel and said, 
default“
defaultThis needs to feed into the code. This is part of the code review.
default”
default If there are areas where our registrants are falling foul of the code, we need to strengthen the code and make it clear. That is part of the lessons learned work.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultMay I as
defaultk a question about revalidation? 
defaultPlans for revalidation of nurses have been ongoing for a very long time. What are your plans for revalidation? Are you confident that delivering this model
default—
defaultI think there is a model, is there not,
default 
defaultfor revalidation
default—
defaultby 2015 will not jeopardise your ability to deliver your core function of regulating fitness to practise?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: I would say that o
defaultur core function is continuing fitness to practise, which in effect is what revalidation is proposing to deliver. We have proposed that we build on the existing structure
defaults—appraisal—
defaultas a way of assuring continuing fitness to practise
default,
default and I think that is a sensible model for the NMC, with the size of its register, to take forward.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI would simply add the point that, essentially, your concern and the questio
defaultn you ask is a fair one for an 
defaultorganisation that is struggling to do some of its basic processes adequately and 
defaultI quite understand why you 
defaultraised it. The council
default’
defaults judgment, when 
defaultit
default looked at the revalidation proposals, was that the organisation had got itself into a position
default—
defaulthad achieved a sufficient degree of recovery, if you like
default—
defaultto begin to take on some new responsibilities as long as they were carefully prioritised
default and
default thought through. The council clearly will watch very carefully to see how that process rolls out to the end of 2015. But you are right
default—
defaultI think I made the point when I made my opening remarks
default: 
defaulto
defaultur capacity and capability need
default to be at 
defaulta
default point where we can begin to take on new work
default,
default and there are new things now on our agenda.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultFine. 
defaultBut w
defaulthen I asked about resources, you certainly did not say, 
default“
defaultYes, we need more money.
default” You seemed—dare I say it?—
defaultalmost 
defaultcomplacent about your funding.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI do not quite know what to say in response to that, given that
default—
default 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Well, c
defaultomment on what I have said.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultResources are a huge and important issue for us. Maybe I could say a word about our financial strategy, which I think is the framework within which we work. The council last year agreed a financial strategy for three years
default,
default which was based on a certain level of income from fees. It factored in the £20 million grant from the Department and it made an assumption that the fee level would be such as to generate, effectively, £120
default&#x2011;
defaultworth of fee income a year over the next three years. That is the assumption on which it is based. Within that envelope, every commitment we have made 
defaulth
defaultas been 
defaultcosted
default and added. 
defaultE
defaultvery time the council is asked to consider a proposal, the executive have to satisfy the council that it is affordable within that financial envelope. That is the discipline that we are working to 
defaultat present and it is very clear. It is very
default well set
default out and very well understood, s
defaulto you can be assured that any of the commitments that we have publicly committed to are affordable within that cost envelope. But that does only take us to 2015
default&#x2011;
default16.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you very much.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I jog you back a stage to when you were discu
defaultssing your response to Francis—
defaultthat you are going to evaluate your
default education standards? Do you have
default any comment to offer on the Government
default’
defaults view that before nurses go on a degree course they should have experience on the ward?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe know that most applicants or students who want to be nurses and midwives have prior experience
default,
default and we encourage universities to take account of prior experience. I cannot produce evidence to say
default, “T
defaulthis is the number who have had prior experience,
default”
default but from what we know a good proportion do.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultAre you engaged with the Government on the evolution of this policy?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThey are runnin
defaultg
default pilots, as I understand it.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: They are. T
defaulthat is right. We are a member of the steering group and we are very keen to see what develops.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou envisage being involved in the crystallisation of this proposal as part of your thinking about your own education requirements presumably.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIndeed. It is a statutory responsibility for us and we are very keen to play an active part.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultCould I add a 
default“
defaultfour country
default”
default po
defaultint here because it is relevant? One of the things that we 
defaultneeded to address is that most of the reviews, of which there have been a large number in the last year, are England
default-
defaultbased. We set standards across the UK and therefore we need to be very much aware that 
defaultif we are to change 
defaultour requirements or standards 
defaultthey 
defaultare 
defaultgoing to have to work in all of the four countries of the UK, not just England. That puts us in a slightly different position when we are evaluating pilots in relation to an England
default exercise from
default some of the other folk around the table.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultDoes it follow 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have to have exactly the same arrangements for education, fitness to practise, registration and revalidation in all the four home countries?
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultIt might be implemented and interpreted in different ways, but the basic standards are UK
default&#x2011;
defaultwide
default.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default While we are o
defaultn the Francis report, your 
defaultrole is to take up 
defaultthe individual cases, which David asked you about a moment ago, and you said you have 55 that are currently at various stages of investigation. Having looked at the report itself and recognising that in many cases nurses were reporting issues of concern, 
defaultone of the themes you 
defaultpicked up is the need to make sure that, in their professional role, they should feel 
defaultconfident
default to be able to report to their em
defaultployers. In terms of 
defaulttaking that forward, are you content that nurses have that confidence
default and—
defaultone of the outcomes of the work you have done on Francis
default—
defaultthat they are reporting more than perhaps they have in the past? Are you picking 
defaultthat up
default where there are concerns?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: T
defaulthat is very difficult to quantify. One of the reasons why we decided to 
defaultrelaunch
default our guidance 
defaulton raising concerns was that 
defaultwe felt there was a need to remind nurses and midwives of their responsibility to raise concerns where they see them. We need to look at what comes our way
default,
default take stock and see if i
defaultt does actually make a difference
default. The guidance is very important and we need to continue talking about the important role that registrants play.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultTaking that a stage further, if they are reporting those concerns, are you able to distinguish in your role as the NMC in maintaining and keeping watch on professional standards between where there is a failure of clinical practice of them as professionals and where
default—
defaulta clear theme running through the Francis report time and time again
default—
defaultit is a resource issue, in other words, where there are insufficient nurses on the ward? The complaint was that nurses felt th
defaultey were being left unsupported—
defaultnot that their colleagues were being unprofessional but that there were not enough of them in certain circumstances. Are you able to distinguish between
default them
default, and is it appropriate that you should keep an eye on, as it were, the resource itself rather than the failure to meet professional standards?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIf I may say so, the whole issue of staffing levels and resources and what is an appropriate number is an interesting question. Our role, as you know, is protecting the public
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe code says, 
default“
defaultIt is your duty to put the care of your patient first.
default”
default Where you are not able to do that, or where you feel you cannot do it or are not being listened to, we are encouraging those individuals to raise those concerns, for employers to take a look at what is acceptable locally. It is very difficult for 
defaultus as a regulator to enter 
defaulta territory where, frankly, we may be completely unsighted on what the issues are.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default This leads to my 
defaultquest
defaultion; 
defaultit is all runn
defaulting together, I think. You 
defaultmentioned the guidance, but there is a balance to be achieved between cases that should be resolved locally and those which need regulatory action. Yet the guidance that you have just referred to is published on raising concerns mainly with employers rather than directly with 
defaultyourselves. Going back to Francis, how can you help a nurse in Helene Donnelly
default’s position in Mid Staffs? S
defaulthe tried to raise concerns locally but she was not listened to
default.
default How is it helpful if you are putting out guidance to say 
defaultto people in that position, as
default she was, 
default“
defaultComplain to your employer,
default”
default and then your employer does not listen to 
defaultyou? There is a difficulty
default, is
defaultn’t there
default, if the failure extends to a failure to listen 
defaultto people, as was the case
default? It is not enough, is it, to say, 
default“
defaultRaise it first with your employer,
default”
default because people may be in a position of 
defaulttrying for 
defaultmonths and failing to get anywhere with
default their employer, or they just give up.
default That is the worst case. They may think, 
default“
defaultNobody is listening to me and I am not going to persist with it.
default”
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultAbsolutely
default,
default and that was the case in Helene Donnelly
default’
defaults position.
default What we are trying to say 
defaultis that there will be many situations where you can resolve it locally. It may not represent a patient safety issue but where it does and you feel you are not being listened to, escalate it. Where we come in is in supporting nurse directors.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultHow do you do that? That is the point.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIt is the regional adviser model, so working alongside, understanding where the low
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel concerns are and tackling them before they become an issue 
defaultthat
default it is too late to deal with.
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIf we take the other aspect of this, the public being involved
default—
defaultthe public who Francis described as 
default“
defaultthe prime and most valuable source of information about the conduct of nurses
default,”
default clearly the people on the wards with their family members who can see failures in nursing
default—
defaultyou are talking about 
defaultrelaunching
default your website next year with guidance for the public, but is that information about your role going to be made available to patients as well as it is to others
default? That is what Francis recommended.
default 
defaultH
defaultow are you going to measure whether you become more visible to patients and to the public? Otherwise, you are missing that valuable source of information
default,
default which he stressed was a good source of information about the conduct of nurses.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI do not think we are at the point where we could say that our visibility is such that members of the public 
defaultwould be
default aware of what our role is. I think we have a way to go.
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultHow will 
defaultyou measure it once you start
default? Obviously 
defaultthere are actions 
defaultyou are taking next year. How will you be able to measure it?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: If we see a
defaultn increase in referrals 
defaultit 
defaultwill indicate that we are having an impact
default,
default and that is what I expect will happen. When we are based locally and we are supporting nurse directors and others, I think what you will find is that our visibility will be increased and it may well lead to an incr
defaultease in referrals, as it did 
defaultat the GMC when they ro
defaultlled out affiliates locally. 
defaultI think that 
defaultis one measurement
default. I am sure there will be others, but it is in the early stages of our thinking at the moment.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI suppose there will also be feedback from patient groups
default,
default 
defaultand that could be valuable. I 
defaulthope that the regional officers
default—
defaultthey are a plan, by the way
default; they
default are not in place yet
default—
defaultwould have access to local patient networks that would also provide us with s
defaultofter intelligence
default about the effectiveness of that strategy. Maybe it is jus
defaultt worth saying that 
defaultin two weeks
default’
default time, on 24 October, 
defaultthe council will 
defaultspe
defaultnd 
defaulta day thinking about our forward strategy over the next five years: what we should be prioritising, how we should be beginning to put some measures around it and assessing our own progress. We have been focused on fixing the basics so far. We now need to start thinking a bit longer term about the forward direction 
defaultfor the organisation. 
defaultI
defaultssues around how we determine what our priorities should be and how we assess and measure progress against them will be very much something that they will want to have in their sights on the 24th and beyond. We are aiming to come up with a product from all this work to coincide with the beginning of the next planning year.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultBefore I ask my question, can I pose a question fol
defaultlowing on from what Barbara 
defaultsaid about local resolution? What would
default you say to nurses, for example
default in Liverpool
default,
default complaining about the senior management of their trust 
defaultand 
defaultwho, therefore, would be complaining
default—
defaultand have done
default—
defaultto the very people they are complaining about? I unders
defaulttand the Royal College of Nursing
default and Unison are taking a joint grievance. What would you say to those nurses who are very concerned? I will not go into the detailed medical bit, but, for example, they cannot get investments in certain wards, yet the trust have just moved into the most plush headquarters
default. We would be very envious of tho
defaultse and we will find how much they cost in due course. 
defaultU
defaultsing your regulatory purpo
defaultse, these nurses have concerns—
defaultthe practi
defaultce of the trust, the Liverpool c
defaultommunity 
defaultt
defaultrust and t
defaultheir wards and everything else—so h
defaultow would 
default“
defaultjust complain locally
default”
default sort that out?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: I
defaultf nurses are seeing a system operating 
defaultthat
default is impacting on patient safety, 
defaultwe would say 
defaultthat is an issue for us. We try to reflect in the guidance that there are different levels of concern
defaults 
defaultand we hope that the vast majority that
default a nurse or a midwife encounters
default can be resolved locally
default; where they
default cannot
default 
defaultand patients are being put at risk, 
defaulti
defaultt is a regulatory matter.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultBut we want nurses to speak up
default—
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe do.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultAnd 
defaultnot just about 
default“
defaultat risk
default”
default incidents. In fact, I was involved in what would have been an untoward
default incident, had it happened—
defaultit was that close
default. M
defaulty dad spent a month in hospital this summer and they did not have his notes; they e
defaultnded in 2007, so six years 
defaultpassed for an 88
default&#x2011;
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaulto
defaultld man and nobody knew. There we
defaultre some serious things, but that did not become an untoward incide
defaultnt because I sorted it out. W
defaulthere staff are concerned
default—
defaultwhat we now have too is the Royal College and other people
default—
defaultI think you have a role and I wonder how you are really connecting with the people out there
default,
default because they are not compla
defaultining about individual nurses; t
defaulthey are saying, 
default“We are really worried.”
default 
defaultD
defaulto you think you have a role there?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe have to encourage individuals to speak up. I think that is the point you are making. We have to do that. We cannot simply say that it is not a matter for us. If there are issues that impact on public protection, then we have a role to play and we have to work alongside the other playe
defaultrs in the field. We 
defaultneed to do that, but fundamentally we cannot erode our primary function, which is protecting the public.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI will stop on that, but let me tell you that some people have been moved on, some feel bullied and some feel that if they make further complaints their jobs will be in jeopardy and nobody once ever mentioned the NMC. I put it to you that that is something to be concerned about.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI agree.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultNow I can go to 
defaultthe question I should be asking—
defaultit almost 
defaultimp
defaultinges on tha
defaultt—which is
default the NMC 
default“
defaultshould not have to wait until a disaster has occurred to intervene.
default”
default You rejected that recommendation and I wonder why you did that
default. D
defaulto you think you need to be a more proactive regulator?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: I
defaultn fact we accepted entirely what Robert Francis said and that is a quote from his report. We entirely accept th
defaultat we need to raise our profile and
default be more proactive 
defaultin 
defaultpromoting what the NMC does. I am sorry if we have left you with the impression that we
default rejected that. I
defaultt is absolutely not the position of the NMC.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultYou rejected the recommendation that the NMC should be better equipped to investigate situations where concerns about nursing fitness to practise appear across the health system.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI think what we
default rejected was stepping into 
defaultterritory which is for the CQC, but that does not mean to say that we would not want to work alongside the CQC where we see systemic problems.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultDoes the fact that the CQC does not have a director of nursing affect how you operate in the liaison with the CQC?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI do not think their personalities or positions affect the way in which we are operating with them. We are about to sign another MOU with the CQC. We are doing a significant amount of work with them. We are in the middle of visiting the trusts that are on the Keogh list, so our relationship with the CQC is better than it has been. I do not think their positions there affect our relationship.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultBut in response to Francis you say that you will improve the memoranda of understanding between the regulators, but the Professional Standards Authority says that is not enough
default,
default and good communication across each level must exist
default—
defaultcase managers and staff teams. How would you des
defaultcribe your main channels of day-to-
defaultday communication with the other regulators?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: It is at various levels. S
defaultometimes it is at the highest level
default,
default when Mark and I meet with the chair a
defaultnd chief executive of the CQC. B
defaultut it operates at a local level and it is sometimes the regional inspectors; it is sometimes staff below that level. All sorts of different staff are involved in 
defaultthe CQC 
defaultinspections and we have daily contact with them.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultWhat we are really looking for almost is that the information flow just happens automatically at each of those levels.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I develop tha
defaultt 
defaultfor 
defaulta moment? The area that we are interested in is the extent to which the NMC is developing a proactive professional regulator role of the 
defaultkind
default that the GMC is in the process of developing. I am not suggesting they have got it right or perfect, but for various reasons they seem further down the road of developing networks to give them the necessary information to be an effecti
defaultve preventa
defaulttive regulator rather than simply waiting till the case is presented for investigation.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThat is exactly the position that we are in. The GMC are further down the road. They have been operating the model of affiliates for some time now. We are only just about to launch that next yea
defaultr, but it does not stop us 
defaulthaving conversations with the CQC 
defaultand sharing information, which is what we are doing. 
defaultW
defaulte are trying to move to the position that the GMC is in and has been in for a while, but we are not there yet.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultThe relationship between the professional regulators and the systems regulators in the form of the CQC in 
defaultEngland
default is clearly a critical one. To go back to the point about why we were reluctant to get drawn into assuming powers of inspection and so on
default, we think 
defaultbroadly 
defaultthere is a 
defaultclear distinction between our own focus on individuals and the CQC focus on systems. 
defaultW
defaulte have to make sure between us that there are no gaps between the two and that, as you say, the collaborative arrangements work at every level. 
defaultMy strong sense over the last year is that those linkages are getting stronger all the time and there are practical results now, as Jackie says, around the way we are visiting Keogh sites and providing the CQC with intelligence and they are providing us with intelligence
default,
default which I do not think would have happened pre
default&#x2011;
defaultFrancis
default. So there are steps being taken in that direction. We will 
defaultprobably 
defaultgo
default rather more carefully
default and 
defaultmodestly initially
default around developing proactive capability simply because we are an organisation coming out of a troubled and challenged past and we do not want to start taking on r
defaultemits and setting targets 
defaultwe think we might not be able to meet. We have been very clear that we are only going to adopt ambitions if we are confident they can be delivered. But there will be a serious programme of pilot activity, as Jackie says, for these regional offices with a view to completing the roll
default&#x2011;
defaultout
default of that in 2015. That will be a significant development for us.
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultLinking that to the discussion we were just having with Andrew George, do you agree with the proposition that in a better developed world it simply is not a defence for a nurse, a doctor or any other registered professional to say, 
default“
defaultThe staffing here was inadequate,
default”
default if they knew the facts and did not raise the concern before the event?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultAbsolutely.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultAbsolutely.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou said 
defaultthat
default quietly, but 
defaultthe word
default 
default“
defaultabsolutely
default”
default 
defaultis very important—
defaulta fundamental part of what it means to be a professional in a modern hospital.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYes, and it goes back to the raising concerns point and the routes available to people to r
defaultaise issues—
defaultif not with their employer, with us directly
default—
defaultand their willingness to do so.
defaultRosie Cooper:default If I may come in
default, it is really important that I recount to you
default—
defaultnot necessarily which executive
default—
defaultthat I had a discussion with a chief executive of a hospital recently about Salford hospital
default’s record on
default saying whatever number of staff they need for the case mix on ward
defaults
default each day. I asked the chief executive about it and he said, 
default“
defaultWhat do you want me to do
default—
defaultfrighten everybody by letting them see
default”—
defaultthis is the chief executive
default—“
defaultthat we do not have enough nurses on each of those wards every day?
default”
default And there you are saying what you have just said and a chief executive can acknowle
defaultdge to an MP that he knows 
defaultthose wards do not 
defaulthave enough nurses, he hasn’t
default got them and is not going to get them, 
defaultsaying, “
defaultDo you want
default me to actually tell everybody? 
defaultI will only frighten them.
default”
default How many hospit
defaultals is that happening in today? 
defaultI say that because it is very complacent to talk about what we think is going on when, on the ground, that is the reality. The absolute answer was, 
default“So what do you want me to do? W
defaulthat?
default”
defaultChair:default What the Committee 
defaultsaid in its most recent report is, 
default“
defaultYes, it is his job to publish that information because, without it, nurses and doctors cannot discharge their professional obligations.
default”
default It is a very straightforward answer: yes.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultAbsolutely, but the reality is that that is what is going on out there.
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultAt the risk of us having a conversation among ourselves and not asking you a question, I would like to know this. You said 
default“
defaultabsolutely
default”
default, that of course nurses should be reporting their concerns about understaffing 
defaulton wards
default, but you 
defaultknow that presupposes there is not a culture that
default actually discourages them from doing that. Do you acknowledge that there may be a culture, in some hospital settings especially, which discourages them from raising those issues
default—
defaultindeed, the Francis report identified this as well
default—and 
defaultwhere there is a culture of bullying for those nurses tha
defaultt in fact do attempt to do that?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI cannot sit h
defaultere and say I know that a hospital there or there
default is doing that but Francis makes it absolutely clear that there are cultural problems that need to be tackled. Being open and transparent about those sorts of issues, which may well impact on patient safety, is very important, so I agree with the Chair that 
default“
defaultyes
default”
default is the answer.
defaultAndrew George:default I
defaultn a theoretical world, though.
defaultChair:default 
defaultNo. It is real patients.
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultYes, but who is going to do it? 
defaultForgive me. Y
defaultou are the regulator. 
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe need to work alongside people. The point I am trying to make is that this is a serious problem.
default It is not just for the NMC. I
defaultt is for everyone to say, 
default“
defaultThere is an issue here. What is it and what is the best way of tackling it?
default”
default Our remit is public protection. If that impacts on public protection, then 
defaultobviously 
defaultthere are responsibilities at every level in that organisation to deal with it and that is what we would expect.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultBut this is like when we had Jane Cummings 
defaultsitting
default where you are and
default—
defaultI cannot remember which organisation
default—I think it was
default 
defaultthe 
defaultCQC who said that 14 hospitals did not have enough nurses and I asked her what she
default,
default the chief nurse
default,
default was doing about it. 
defaultShe was waiting for reports. Hello? Waiting for reports?
default 
defaultShe is the chief nurse. F
defaultorgive me, you are the regulator and we are going to have lots of other different people. I have read this and I hear that you do not have a great financial base to do all this investigation, but
default—
defaultthis is reality
default—
defaultwhen the next Francis comes, each of these regulators or people are going to be in the dock looking at each other waving flags and saying, 
default“
defaultWe all knew a little bit, but nobody knew it all.
default”
default That is what I am trying to get across. If a chief executive absolutely knows he needs to have that number of nurses but financially he cannot or will not, or whatever you want to say, and his view is, 
default“
defaultWell, look, are you telling me that every nurse in that hospital does not know?
default”—
defaultof course they know
default—
defaultwho is going to make that chief executive deliver the right number of nurses?
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe question, therefore, for the NM
defaultC is how should the nurse 
defaultwho is working in that hospital
default react
default?
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhat is the answer?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI am going to sound like a broken record. The answer is
default 
defaultif they see that patient safety is being compromised, we would expect them to raise it
default.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultForgive me, when you 
defaultsay
default things like that, it is like the TSA in housing saying, 
default“We have only got two options
default—
defaultnuclear or we will just keep a watchful eye on it.
default” What they would say is,
default 
default“
defaultIt is just the very fact that we are doing what we are doing, trying to make sure that patient safety is maximised.
default”
default But if you said, 
default“Itemise each incident,” and they say they are just short of staff,
default the end result is 
defaultthat
default they are not going to be able to write down a list. 
defaultThat is why p
defaulteo
defaultple do not come forward; 
defaultthey cannot sit and itemise each of those untoward or potential
defaultly
default untoward incidents.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultCan I put it as a question? Do you have a concept that there may be circumstances 
defaultthat
default make it difficult for nurses to report inadequate staffing levels and do you accept that in some circumstances nurses are not reporting when they should be reporting the understaffing of hospital wards
default,
default and why that may be?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultAs I said earlier, I think, I am not in a position
default—
defaultI do not have the evidence
default—
defaultto say that there is a problem here and a problem there.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultNo.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: No. 
defaultSo I cannot say that that is my view. Staffing levels is clearly a very important issue but, fundame
defaultntally, i
defaultt is not an issue for the NMC. The NMC
default’
defaults role is protecting the public. If staffing levels impact on public protection and patient safety, then
default clearly
default there is an issue that we need to be concerned about. But we are not here to determine staffing levels.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultI appreciate that, so you will purely take each case on its own professional merits
default, if that nurse fails in their duties.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIndeed.
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default E
defaultven if that failure in duty may be because they are overstretched becau
defaultse they could not fulfil all 
defaultthei
defaultr requirements because there were
default insufficient staff.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIt is about individuals and their responsibilities.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultW
defaulte can have a final shot on this
default otherwise we are going to get stuck.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultThere is no escaping the fact that our entry point into this argument is around the nurse
default’
defaults or midwife
default’
defaults ability to comply with the code. If they find there are circumstances, whatever they may be
default—
defaultwhether they are resource driven or something else
default—
defaultwhere they cannot comply with the code, then they have an obligation to raise it. That would be a relevant factor in any fitness
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultpractise
default hearing. If you want to put it into a legal context, it would be a factor to surface in that context. The Helene Donnelly story is quite interesting. You may well have heard from her personally about her own story and how she 
defaultactually 
defaultdid go home a
defaultnd itemise all the issues 
defaultsh
defaulte had spotted on the wards that
default were preventing her and her colleagues from complying with the code. That was the basis on which she finally gave evidence to Francis and others. It also led her, in the end, in despair to leave the trust. But it is possible to itemise.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYour view, if I may put words into your mouth, is that the right way of doing that is to raise it locally first and
default if there is no response
default to raise it direct with you.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYes. 
default“
defaultFirst
default”
default is a key word.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default Do you mean i
defaultn the 
defaultDatex
default report on a daily basis then?
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI am sorry?
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default I said i
defaultn the 
defaultDatex
default report, which is what Helene Donnelly was doing on a regular, daily basis.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYes, okay.
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultWe will move on a little. Francis was clear in his view that no nurse should be 
default“
defaulttoo posh to wash
default,”
default and repeatedly expressed concerns about the erosion of compassion and basic caring skills in nursing. You have stated that changes to nursing education and standards will address this, but, in essence, what do you do to audit whether that is translated 
defaultin
defaultto actual improvements on the ground? Francis also argues that being an observer or a supernumerary on the ward does not substitute for actual experience. To go back to the question the Chairman asked
default—
defaulttacking it on at the end
default—
defaultdo you agree with the policy that people should be on the wards as part of that education process?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI think there is a misunderstanding about what our education standards
default actually
default deliver. The pre
default&#x2011;
defaultregistration
default nursing standards, which we launched in 2010, test for care and compassion. There are a number of points during the cycle that a student nurse has to go through
default,
default and care and compassion is tested as part of that process. 
defaultT
defaulthat is set out in our standards. 
defaultW
defaulte need 
defaultto evaluate those standards—
defaultwhich we
default are proposing to do next year—
defaultto try and deal with the issue that what is being produced at the end is a nurse or a midwife 
defaultwho
default fails to display the necessary care and compassion. The second point is that 50% of their learning is spent on wards. It is not 100% of the time in a classroom
default;
default 50% is spent delivering hands
default&#x2011;
defaulton care. I think there is a misunderstanding as to what our standards deliver.
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThis is about the regulation of healthcare support workers, as a resu
defaultlt of the Francis inquiry,
default and the potential future role of the NMC with regard to expanding its responsibility to cover those professions that are coming in
default. S
defaultupporting nurses is very critical in taking on a number of nursing roles. Where do you see your role in the future with regard to the potential regulation of healthcare support workers in hospital settings?
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultPerhaps I could say a word about that. It was obviously an important recommendation in the Francis report
default, and it
default was not accepted initially by the Government. The Government
default’
defaults position is that that is not the right way forward, as you know. Francis recommended registrat
defaultion rather than regulation, but,
default be that as it may, the position that we adopted in front of you last year remains 
defaultour position: t
defaulthe decision on regulation or registration is one for the Government
default,
default and if the Government decided that they wanted to pursue regulation or registration of healthcare support workers
default,
default the NMC would not be in a position at present to take it on. That was what we said to you last year. We are grateful
default,
default by the way
default,
default for your recognition of the force of that argument. 
defaultSo here we are a year on and where are we on those issues? It remains the case that that is a decision for the Government and they are producing their final response to Francis, I think, 
defaultin November. 
defaultM
defaulty own view
default—
defaultand I have not put this to the council
default—
defaultand Jackie
default’s view is that, as things stand at 
defaultpresent, the absorption of that additional responsibility, which would be for at least the registration of several hundred thousand support workers
default,
default would be a step too far for the NMC given where it is on the recovery curve. However, we are on a strengthening trend. We are a year on. We have more confidence in ourselves
default 
defaultand the outside world has more confidence in us as a regulator who is able to at least get on top of the basic responsibilities
default,
default and we are beginning to look more broadly, for all the reasons we have talked about, at the forward agenda. 
defaultSo I do not think 
defaultthat 
defaultwould be our position for ever
default—that we would never be in a position to absorb that responsibility—
defaultbut it remains the case that we are not there yet. We would like to leave the possibility open at some future date, if that policy decision were taken by the Government, to have a good practical conversation with them about whether we were yet in a position to absorb that extra work or not.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultDoes it concern you, neverthel
defaultess, that registered nurses, whether from professional choice
default or as a result of the circums
defaulttances they find themselves in, are—
defaultadmittedly
default,
default in a supervisory role with regard to healthcare support wo
defaultrkers—
defaultrequiring or asking healthcare support workers to increasingly undertake functions 
defaultthat
default previously were solely undertaken by registered nurses? Do you not think that it is those functions that you should be looking at rather than necessarily those registered to perform those duties?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThe code is clear about delegation, taking responsibility for delegating to someone who has the skills to do what you are asking them to do. On that front it is very clear. I am not sure there
default is much more we can add
default.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultWe are, of course, looking at the code, as we have explained, next year in the context of revalidation but more generally following on from Francis and the standards alongside it. One of the issues that we will be thinking about when we review the code is to make sure that it is as clear as it needs to be about delegation responsibilities and approaches. There are a number of other things we will
default want to look at carefully post-
defaultFrancis as well, but that will be one of them. We are not expecting to want to make major changes
default,
default but that would be a focus of the council
default’
defaults attention when it comes to looking at the code.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default O
defaultn that
default—
defaultand it does play out to other themes
default—
defaulta lot of your answers are based on seeing your role as policing the regulated sector and those who are registered. 
defaultT
defaulto what extent 
defaultis 
defaultthere a theme developing here in the same way 
defaultas we were discussing 
defaultstaffing levels earlier
default?
default Given the fact that you are looking at a s
defaultystem when it fails—or at least allegedly fails 
defaultand
default,
default therefore
default,
default 
defaulta 
defaultcomplaint is made and it reaches the NMC
default, so it must be quite significant—do you not pick up themes 
defaultyou feel that you can then convey
default? Y
defaultou are in a far better position than many other people
default—
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultAbsolutely, yes.
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou can 
defaultconvey patterns or developments that are happening within the nursing profession or across hospital settings, for example, 
defaultbut
default it seems that you are kind of standing away from 
defaultthat 
defaultand simply seeing your role as
default the policeman or woman for
default those registered nurses.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultCan I say a coupl
defaulte of things in response 
defaultan
defaultd then Jackie will want to come in? 
defaultFirst of all, as to the policing role, it is important to look beyond fitness to practise. 
defaultFitness to practise was described as our core function earlier. I think we have a number of core functions, one of which is the setting of education standards.
defaultAndrew George: defaultYes, of course.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultWe are working with the HEE in that territory to make sure that those responsibilities are clearly understood, as well as registration. Policing is, if you like, the FTP bit of that tripod. On the point about intelligence and analysis and making the best use of the information we have, which I think is the general territory your question was in
default—
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultAbsolutely, yes.
default 
defaultMark Addisondefault: I
defaultt is a big question for the NMC. It is a big question for all the
default regulators, but it is a big question
default for us. 
defaultI
defaultt is fair to say that we have lagged behind some of our fellow regulators in taking that seriously. We do have access to information and intelligence
default,
default and we can commission focused work to bolster that intelligence. We have not done a lot of that in the past. We have done some of it, but we have not done a lot. Jackie and I certainly share
default 
defaulta view that there is more we can do to use the information we have intelligently to inform our policy and practice into the future. 
defaultI
defaultt will be something 
defaultthat the council will want to think about 
defaulton 
defaultthe
default 
default24 October strategy 
defaultday that I referred to earlier
default. I’d
default be a bit surprised if one of their major preoccupations over the next few years 
defaultwas not 
defaultto strengthen our capacity to analyse information and make informed decisions using the information, as I say, that we have ourselves
default—
defaultand only we can have
default—
defaultand also is available out there more generally
default,
default in order to make sure we set the right prioritie
defaults and get the right results. 
defaultI would accept the general point but I have probably made it a little wider than the original question. 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultOkay, yes. That is helpful. I can see you have taken on the point about gathering intelligence for your own purposes. I was thinking more of gathering intelligence and providing an annual commentary, or whatever, in terms of the
defaultmes that 
defaultare developing
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulthere you see a 
defaultpattern of activity going on—
defaultobviously it is very much a debating point about whether staffing levels are an issue or not
default, and 
defaultwhether the interface between nurses and healthcare workers is a potential risky fault line
default 
defaulteme
defaultrging in the healthcare system—
defaultit would be an important role of the NMC, if you have identified that as a theme developing, 
defaultto then report
default 
defaultit 
defaultto other policy 
defaultmakers, including Ministers. 
defaultI really am urging you to see your role as reporting back not just intelligence to yourself to help you develop your work but also reporting to us.
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut do not write the report for them, Andrew.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultI am walking the tightrope about whether there is an issue there or not.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultCan I say
default—
default 
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBefore you do that, I want to strengthen that point because it goes back
default to the discussion about 
defaultonce you become more visible to the public
default. Y
defaultou made the point that you might start getting referrals, but you could possibly see a stressed 
defaultorganisation in those reforms.
default 
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultAbsolutely.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default You could possibly see the 
defaultpublic saying to you, 
default“
defaultThe nurses on this ward were run off their 
defaultfeet and never had time to talk or
default breathe,
default” and that
default sort of thing. You would see that first and that is pretty important.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: I want
default to say in response that I hope we have created the impression here
default—
defaultbecause it is absolutely the case
default—
defaultthat we are with you. T
defaulthat is where we want to be, but,
default as Mark said earlier, we are an organisation that has emerged from a crisis. We have stabilised, we are making progress and we want to do the things you are saying
default—a
defaultbsolutely.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I bring you on to talk again about revalidati
defaulton and how you see that working?
default You are committed to a process of revalidation by the end of 2015, which is a year of some significance to Members of this House. Do you envisage that you will
default be able to
default implement revalidation without impacting on the political world?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes. I am confiden
defaultt that we can deliver the form—the model—
defaultthat council has a
defaultgreed to by the end of 2015
default. As I hope is clear, we are building on existing systems so we are using appraisal. I know that there is a view that appraisal is not consistent, that it is patchy, but that is not a reason not to do revalidation: it is a reason to do it.
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe have heard a very similar argument from the GMC. I want to probe what the concept of confirmation by a third party means in the context of your view of revalidation and how that is different from the report of the responsible officer.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIt can be given by a number of individuals in different positions. The confirmation is that that individual is up to date and fit to practise.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe confirming individual does not have to be a registrant.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThat is right.
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSo it can be the local solicitor or family and friends.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIt needs to be in the employment setting.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What is the definition? W
defaultho is an acceptable confirmer?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThat is som
defaultething 
defaultwe want to try and tease out during the early pilots.
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhat is the purpos
defaulte of the confirmation
default?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: T
defaulthat they have had an appraisal, that they have talked to the individual, that they have
default—
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat it is a formal appraisal process.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes, absolutely.
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIn which case, why would it not be the person who has done the nurse
default’
defaults appraisal?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThe expectation is that it will be the person who has done the appraisal
default,
default but we need to test this out because nurses and midwives work in a very diverse environment and we need to make sure that this is something that will wo
defaultrk for the vast majority of th
defaulte nurses and midwives on our register. We need to tease that out 
defaultwith
default the early adopters.
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf it is normally the appraiser, that individual is taking a significant responsibility, are they not, when they sign the certificate that says, 
default“
defaultI confirm this nurse has do
defaultne what they say they have done”
default? 
defaultJackie Smithdefault: Yes. We are suggesting 
defaultthat appraisal and revalidation is owned by that individ
defaultual—the person who is being 
defaultappraised. They are taking responsibility for ensuring, according to the guidance and the standards that we set, th
defaultat they have kept themselves up to 
defaultdate, that they are
default continuing to demonstrate 
defaultthey are fit to practise, and the person conducting that appraisal has the information to be able to say that is a suitable registrant to be on the NMC
default’
defaults register
default,
default and 
defaultthereafter
default we will conduct random audits.
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultHow much 
defaultof this has been road-tested
default?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: It will be road-
defaulttested through the review of the code, the review of our standards
default,
default and the early pilots. At the 
defaultmoment it has not been road-
defaulttested.
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am mindful that it took the GMC 10 years to get to a workable model. You are saying 
defaultyou are going to have
default a full process of revalidation
default,
default presumably starting over a rolling three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIndeed. We are not saying 
defaultthat 
defaultat the end of 2015 we will have revalidated 674,000 registrants, no.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYou said it will start by the end of 2015.
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOkay, fine. It starts, effectively, on 1 January 2016.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultOn 31 December 2015.
defaultChair:default Okay. 
defaultWe are not going to quibble.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI agree with the general proposition that there is a huge amount to do in order to get to that point and there will be a number of consultations. The first consultation exercise is now gearing up
default,
default and at every point some questions will be answered and mor
defaulte questions will be raised. T
defaulthe next phase of work will be designed to address those questions and take the whole project further on. Some people have criticised us for taking too long and some 
defaultpeople have criticised us 
defaultfor doing it too quickly. We think the end of 2015 is deliverable on the model that we have adopted. It is a 
default“
defaultno legislative change
default”
default model. It would not be possible if legislative change were a requirement.
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I
defaultt is no legislative change. The current law, you are saying, allows you to remove somebody from the register if you are not satisfied.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: Yes. At the renewal point, 
defaultthey would lapse.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultWe have a renewal process already. It just does not work very well.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWho pays the £1.50 per nurse?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: Sorry
default?
defaultChair:default 
defaultA witness has told us that the GMC revalidation process costs £6 per registrant
default,
default and your process is intended to cost £1.50. You do not recognise either of these numbers.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI have not come across that number myself.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultNo, I am sorry.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultIf the general question is who is going to pay, the costs fall on two parties. Essentially, they fall on the system and 
defaultthey fall 
defaulton the NMC. Part of the whole process of working up these proposals will allow us to be clearer and sharper about what both those costs are. We have made an allowance in our financial strategy for the initial costs to the NMC which are affordable within that envelope
default,
default and they are not very great. The more significant cost is likely to fall on the system, but given, as Jackie says, 
defaultthat 
defaultwe ha
defaultve come up with proposals that are essentially with the grain—
defaultwith the existing regime that good emplo
defaultyers will already be providing—we hope 
defaultthe additional costs will be acceptable. But clearly that is an issue. It is an issue for employers and it is an issue for the Government as we go forward, which is why we will be working very closely with the employers and, indeed, with the Government to identify what those costs are
default,
default to produce a fully worked
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default business case and to make sure it stacks up and is acceptable before we put final proposals to the council for endorsement.
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut you do not intend 
defaultthat 
defaultthere would be a cost on the registrant.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultNo. We have said that this will be within the current fee
default plans—
defaultI forget our exact words. This would be funded
default,
default and it will be funded essentially because there will be an additional cost to the NMC
default,
default but it will be funded as part of the savings and cost reductions that Jackie and her team are making at present and over the next few years. That is how we intend to fund quite a bit of the work that we are embarking on.
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI would like to change tack and ask you about some of the remarks that the Professional Standards Authority made about you. The PSA state that it is likely that different groups on your register present different types and levels of risk, but that your proposals 
default“lack a robust evidence base...
defaultaround risk.
default”
default How will your risk
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default targeting system work to identify nurses for early audit?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe can draw on existing data. 
defaultWe can draw on fitness-to-
defaultpractise data that we already have at our disposal. We can take account of high
default&#x2011;
defaultrisk settings. We can use the information and intelligence that we are gathering through visits and the work that we are doing with the CQC in England and
default the other systems regulators, s
defaulto we are no
defaultt starting from a zero base
default.
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultAr
defaulte you going to have some model—
defaultperhaps a com
defaultputer model—
defaultto assess risk on a points system?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe were not proposing a computer model, no. We are proposing to build on data that we already have at our disposal
default,
default and using the intelligence that we are gathering and taking account of practice settings. 
defaultT
defaulthat gives us a pretty good starting point. Clearly the risk model will develop and evolve once we roll out revalidation; it will change over time. But I think that is a pretty good starting point.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI have one other question. What safeguards can you introduce to stop this being perceived as discriminatory
default—
defaultfor example, if you are identifying all nurses of a certain age, or from a certain area? How do you avoid discrimination in assessing the risk
default? That is the key question.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI probably would go 
defaultback to my earlier answer
default. We need to look at the data that we already have available to us and identify from that where the highest risk groups are. It is not intended to be discriminatory, but it is intended to target areas of risk.
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultDo you think there is a danger that 
defaultyou might end up making policy in
default how you assess different groups
default?
default Rather than trying to follow guidelin
defaultes, is there not a danger 
defaultthat you might be tempted into policy decisions on risk with different groups?
defaultMark Addisondefault: What we are talking about 
defaultis 
defaultprobably 
defaultthe way in which the audi
defaultt process would be targeted. T
defaulthe commitment we 
defaulthave 
defaultmade is that there would be a random component to the audit and there would be a risk
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default component to the audit. 
defaultT
defaulthat is a fairly standard way of making sure that you cover the right territory with a sample audit of this sort. As we drew up the risk framework for that audit we would clearly need to be sure that it was 
defaultproperly 
defaultequality
default&#x2011;
defaultproofed
default and did not have any obvious
default discriminatory components
default. I am not sure that that would involve setting policy in some way. 
defaultT
defaulthat 
defaultdoes not strike
default me as a risk 
defaultwith 
defaultthe approach. 
defaultT
defaulthe bigger issues with the audit approach are
default,
default 
default“
defaultWill we have our risk framework sufficiently developed at the point of launch? Will we have been able to invest enough in it and have 
defaultwe 
defaultgot a clear enough idea of how the sample frame should be drawn?
default” Secondly, “H
defaultow big a sample should it be and how much will that cost?
default”
default A 
defaultlo
defaultt of the cost of this exercise for us will be driven by the size of the audit sample
default,
default 
defaultand the bigger the audit sample
default the more reliabl
defaulte and effective it will be. T
defaulthere will be a balancing act 
defaultthat
default the council has to undertake in order to determine what
default&#xa0;
defaultscale of audit to embark on.
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Y
defaultou will take advice to
default make sure that the sample 
defaultyou have is statistically sound.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultAbsolutely, yes, we must do that.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default Still on the point of re
defaultvalidation, the GMC has five
default&#x2011;
defaultyearly
default cycles of revalidation
default,
default and the point has been made by some nurses that it seems unduly onerous that they have to revalidate every three years.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThat is the renewal point.
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultBut 
defaultyou wanted to link it in;
default 
defaulti
defaultt is the renewal point. Do you think that, over time, if this becomes onerous you would shift to six
default&#x2011;
defaultyearly
default?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: W
defaulte would certainly want to evaluate the first phase of revalidation before we made any decisions on that, but I absolutely take the point that we would need a change to our legal framework to be able to do it differently
default,
default and we would hope that that would be part of the Law Commission Bill
default.
defaultChair:default Barbara wants
default to ask about fees.
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default It is 
defaultabout the level of the fees and whether it would be possible to allow phase
defaultd
default payments. We recommended that
default,
default and you understood 
defaultthat 
defaultit would be too costly 
defaultwhile you processed registrations manually, so will you be moving to an online process? We still feel that phased payments should be introduced
default,
default as people have been finding it tough.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes, I have two responses to that. We are moving to online services
default,
default which we hope to launch in April of next year for a small group initially. We do not want to launch online services for 674,000. 
defaultT
defaulthat 
defaultwill be one thing that
default I think 
defaultwill
default definitely improve customer service and make it easier for nurses and midwives. The second is that we have not completely ruled out phase
defaultd
default payments but it needs to form part of our ICT strategy, which will go to the council in November. Our intention is to replace the registration database in 2014. Once we do that and we have a new system in place, it will make it easier to look at phase
defaultd
default payments. We have not ruled it out completely. We will return to it.
defaultMark Addisondefault: I
defaultt
default will be a factor that we 
defaultwant to consider in the design of that longer
default-
default term ICT strategy.
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThat does not sound very positive. It is a recommendation from
default us.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultI know. It is simply that we are not in a position to do it within the current systems.
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIndeed, but the words you just used do not sound like you want to make it part of a new system. If you are replacing the database, surely you are going to have to decide about IT requirements
default, so you
default 
defaultcould
default say
default,
default 
default“
defaultWe can do it from the 
defaultpoint that we replace the databa
defaultse,
default”
default but what you said sounded a lot weaker than that.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultThere are added complications, one of which is that not a huge number of nurses and midwives pay by direct debit at the moment, so the percentage 
defaultfor 
defaulttake
default&#x2011;
defaultup is
default pretty low. It is around 
default20%. We would need to 
defaultdo 
defaultquite a bit of work to improve that first of all before we could get into a 
defaultsuitable position. I
defaultt is not that I am not enthusiastic. It is just that
default—
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou might find this will encourage them.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultIt may well do.
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default C
defaultan you give the Committee an assurance that the ICT system will be designed in a way that is compatible with this option?
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultYes. That was, I hope, the gist of my earlier remark
default: 
defaultone of the things that we will be building into the consideration of that forward design is your recommendation about phased payments.
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes. 
default“
defaultBuilding it into the consideration
default”
default might be building into a phase you do not
default—
default 
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI do not want to make a commitment that we will not embark on any IT strategy unless it has that capability because I do not know what I would be committing myself to. But I do take the message that it is a serious recommendation from you, that you would like us to think about it very carefully and only reject a system if it is absolutely impossible or dispr
defaultoportionately expensive to do. 
defaultI will take away 
defaultt
defaulthat message and convey 
defaultit 
defaultto the council when they look at the strategy in November.
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultBut surely
default—
defaultforgive me
default—
defaultthe smallest organisation to the largest can manage to collect their subs weekly, monthly or whatever. You could just nip down to your local organisation and ask them how they do it
default,
default because it seems that you cannot be in the 21st century and it 
defaultwould be
default too hard to take money 
defaultoff people in 12 monthly instal
defaultments
default,
default or whatever. If that is se
defaulten to be really difficult, 
defaulthow do you deal with the really difficult questions? It scares me when I hear stuff like that, honestly.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultI understand the point.
defaultChair:default Sarah wants
default to ask a final question
default, though
default I have a final question as well, I am afraid. 
defaultWe 
defaultare on 
defaultNo. 
default26.
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultWe have fast forwar
defaultded. I am sorry, Chair. I want
default to ask a question about the d
defaultraft legislation about language-
defaulttesting. Under current proposals, language assessments will only take place after applicants from the EU have actually been accepted on to the register, in other words not proactively assessed. How are you addressing this?
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultPerhaps I can say a word or two. We are as frustrated as everybody else about this. As you know, we would like to have been in a position to move more quickly
default,
default and the GMC is in a slightly different place. Perhaps I could just explain why. There are three fundamental issues that affect a regulator
default’
defaults ability to test for language, as
default I see it. One is the European d
defaultirecti
defaultve. The second is the way that d
defaultirective is transposed into UK law. The third is the legal framework that the regulator has. The GMC happened to have a legal framework 
defaultwhich
default has, I think, the 
default“
defaultlicence to practise
default”
default component to it
default,
default which allows them, with the right kind of signals from the Commission, if their legislation is tweaked,
default to move to be able to language-
defaulttest. We are not in that posit
defaultion. First of all, the current d
defaultirective is generally quite hostile. Second, the way it is transposed makes things difficult for us. Third, and most importantly, we do not have that distinction
default,
default so we cannot introduce a point in the process between registration
default and the right to practise that
default will allow us t
defaulto introduce a language test. That is the current position
default unless there is a willingness on the Government
default’s side
default to introduce leg
defaultislation that
default would advance us to the point where
default we could make that distinction.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat would be a very big thing to ask in advance of the Law Commission coming through and in advance of the tra
defaultnsposition of the new directive, which will help, 
defaultwhich i
defaults under negotiation in Brussels
default.
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultPerhaps 
defaultit
default would be helpful for
default the
default Committee to understand what you would like to see in place. If you were actually drafting a change to the legislation, where would you see that sitting? 
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultWe can let 
defaultyou 
defaulthave a detailed note if that would be helpful.
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default A 
defaultdraft amendment for us to put down to the Care Bill
default might be helpful
default.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultWe wi
defaultll take that away too. The new d
defaultirective explicitly 
defaultaddresses the issue of language-
defaultte
defaultsting, so it is much friendlier
default to the notion that there should be the capa
defaultcity for regulators to language-
defaulttest. 
defaultT
defaulthat is a big step forward
default. If the transposition of that d
defaultirective into UK law is managed correctly and if we achieve, either through the Law Commission or th
defaultrough the transposition of the d
defaultirective, a change to our legal framework 
defaultthat
default will allow us to make that distinction, then we can introduc
defaulte language-
defaulttesting, not asking employers to do it but actually ourselves making that decision, as the GMC are hoping
default to
default. 
defaultW
defaulte would welcome suppor
defaultt for the transposition of the directive in a way that
default fully involves us and makes sure 
defaultthat we are clear that the way it is put into UK law will help us to get to t
defaulthe result we want—t
defaulthat would be extremely helpful
default—and, s
defaultecondly, support for the change to our legal framework at that critical moment, which also allows us to make the change. 
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt would be very helpful to the Committee to know precisely what is required to be changed in all three of the headings you describe
default,
default and what the constraints are on the timetabl
defaulte. The Government has now moved—partly, I think
default we feel
default,
default because
default of the opinions expressed here—on language-
defaulttesting for doctors
default,
default and it is regrettable that we are in a position where we cannot do it for nurses as well.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultWe agree.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe can certainly submit that as a matter of urgency.
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultWe understand that the new legislation would take two years to come into force, so what would you recommend can be done to protect patients in the meantime?
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultWe 
defaultstill 
defaulturge employers to test language
default. That is what we continue to urge.
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default W
defaulthere someone has arrived and they recognise there is a problem, 
defaultyou urge them 
defaultto test at an early stage.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default T
defaulthe clear message should be to any employers who are not sure if they are able to do that
default—
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes, 
default“
defaultPlease, test language.
default”
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default W
defaulthere they have concerns
default,
default they can test and they should do
default so at the earliest opportunity.
defaultJackie Smithdefault: 
defaultYes, absolutely.
defaultMark Addisondefault: 
defaultIt is 
defaulta 
defaultsecond best, but it is all we have.
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default
