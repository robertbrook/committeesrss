defaultWritten evidence submitted by Transition BathdefaultThis is Transition Bath’s submission to the Environmental Audit Committee on the subject of the Housing Standards and Allowable solution consultations. A brief summary of our views largely focused on the impact on domestic energy use appears immediately below with more detail provided in what follows:
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel the outcome of the consultation has already been decided
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel consultation fails to assess the 60% reduction in CO2 emissions of a Code for Sustainable Homes (
defaultCfSH
default) 5 over a building regulations 2010 Part L home
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe consultation fails to assess the economic benefits to home occupiers and UK plc of the 32% reduction in gas and 41% reduction in electricity consumption of 
defaultCfSH
default 5 homes. Energy bills reduce from £910 to £578, and to £101/year if FITS are included – an 89% reduction. On a monetised basis the £6000 costs of the additional energy components of 
defaultCfSH
default 5 are easily offset by the £10,000 in energy savings, £18,000 if you include solar PV FITs
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EC Harris cost assessment of 
defaultCfSH
default 5 in the Housing Standards Review’s Impact Assessment is 80% too high; it uses expensive unnecessary solutions like Ground Source Heat Pumps
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe argument that more sustainable homes restricts house building is wrong and misleading:
default 
defaultCfSH
default 5 costs are only 2.8% of total building costs, Viability Studies suggests current sales prices justify the cost of additional sustainability measures in more than 50% of the UK – the current housing ‘boom’ has been driven by the improved availability of mortgage credit and more relaxed planning. This ‘boom’ has taken place even with the 
defaultCfSH
default requirements in place. The DCLG consultation fails to make this assessment while stating the lack of viability as reason for the disbandment of the energy component of 
defaultCfSH
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransition
default Bath supports the right of local authorities to specify higher energy standards in new domestic properties as long as they are proven viable by ‘Viability Studies’ and do not potentially reduce the amount of land being sold for development. We believe that this should continue as a transitional arrangement, for the energy component of 
defaultCfSH
default to continue until a full zero carbon standard is implemented i.e. most likely between 2016 and 2020.
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe concern with the current consultation is that higher standards are being dropped in favour of a 2016 standard which will be heavily watered down or very significantly delayed. We feel there is a continuing benefit in house builders getting experience of building to a higher standard and will make it more difficult to present the excuse in 2016 that they are not ready for the ‘zero carbon standard’ and that the technology is not ready. By dropping any higher standards between 2013 and 2016 the government runs the risks because of the way the planning system works for the house builders to continue building to the now 2013 Part L standard in 2025.
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that as a result of a reduction in overall costs and in particular solar PV costs of approximately a factor of 4 over the last 5 years it is now much simpler to justify the cost 
defaultbenefits of more sustainable homes. Our concern is that this consultation is more to do with politics, industry influence and less to do with rational economic decisions.
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would therefore ask that parliament and the Department of Communities and Local Government examine the economic case more carefully, assess whether 
defaultCfSH
default is actually having any impact on the availability of land on viable sites. We believe the outcome of a more rational analysis should recommend an extension of the current ability of Local Authorities to specify higher levels of sustainability until the 2016 Zero Carbon Standard is implemented.
defaultThe remainder of this submission provides more detail and evidence to back up the summary and conclusions
default made above
default.
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransition Bath: Sustainability Charity:default Transition Bath is a voluntary sustainability charity with around 1000 volunteers who have been working for the last 5 years to make Bath more sustainable. One of the focuses of its work is to reduce the energy consumption of both Bath’s heritage buildings (over 5000 listed buildings) and more recently its new builds. Through working with Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council (B&amp;NES) we have been able to justify through Viability Studies and updated cost analysis of the Code for Sustainable Homes (
defaultCfSH
default) a minimum of Code 5 for all future large new housing developments in Bath. Central government is currently requiring B&amp;NES to build 12,500 over the next year which will have a significant impact on what is a relatively small city.
default Unfortunately because the council’s Core Strategy has not been signed off by the planning inspectorate only about 10% are currently covered by the 
defaultCfSH
default 5 policy. 
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are dismayed that Don Foster who is our constituency Lib Dem MP has been the minister instrumental in bring these changes forward
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBut Bath’s Lib Dem council which has been instrumental in specifying higher standards in Bath
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe in local democracy, local solutions to local and national problems 
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel that if the majority of the community, or their elected representatives believe in higher local standards this should be allowed if this does not impact the viability of the community or in this case the ability of the area to build the 12,500 homes the government is requiring of it
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransition Bath has made significant attempts to make Bath more sustainable through a number of local projects; it is very difficult for a voluntary local group to maintain enthusiasm if it feels government is working against it most of the time
default3.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel that the government only believes in localism when it is convenient and not when they are lent on my national interests – in this case the big builders
default3.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel that the building industry could be more innovative, but unfortunately this is only likely to happen through regulation
default3.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsultation document lacks rigour:default 
defaultWe feel the consultation documentation is severally lacking in that it failed to assess the CO2 and economic impacts correctly and significant overstated the costs. It also failed to assess whether 
defaultCfSH
default actually has any impact on the availability of land and house building
default3.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGap between current defaultCfSHdefault standards and implementation of 2016 zero carbon standards, government’s poor record on delivering 2013 Part Ldefault:
default Our main concern is that there will be a significant gap between now and whenever the government’s 2016 Zero Carbon Homes standard. The government’s record on implementing higher standards recently does not have a good track record – the energy efficiency component of building regulations 2013 Part L was delivered late (Apr 2014 versus the original Apr 2013 intent) and in a very watered down state – a 6% uplift, whereas it was originally intended to be a half-way house the 100% zero carbon standard of 2016. Given this record and the removal of Local Authorities ability to specify these standards as part of this housing review we think there is a significant risk that for the next 5 to 10 years builders will be able to build homes in Bath to minimum building regulations and there is nothing the council or the local community can do about it. Given planning rules which allow builders to build to whatever the standards is at the time of planning application there is a risk builders will still be building to 2013 Part L in 2025.
defaultThe next three sections of this submission attempts to explain and quantify why economically 
defaultCfSH
default costs have little impact on the availability of land in much of the UK:
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main tenant of the building industries argument against Code for Sustainable homes is that I causes red tape and reduces the amount of land being made available for sale. Transition Bath largely disagrees with this view and thinks the argument is a red herring.
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur 3 main arguments are:
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe would like to deal with the issue of land values in more detail as it is critical to this discussion. Land values and the availability of land are typically 
defaultassessed
default via viability studies using methodology developed by the HCA and agreed with the major builders. The process involves assessing all the costs of developing a site and the potential sales values of the resultant properties, the difference between these values being the land value. The availability of land is then dependent on the calculated land value being greater than a benchmark hurdle rate.
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimplistically an average home might cost £90,000 to build, but additional overheads like S106 &amp; CIL agreements, affordable homes, site access costs, professional fees, 
defaultCfSH
default and developer profits is likely to increase this cost to perhaps £180,000. If the houses are sold for £300,000 then the land value is therefore the difference between the two i.e. £120,000. 
defaultIf the housing density is 30 dwellings per hectare (
defaultdph
default) the land value is 30 x £120K or £3.6 million/hectare. If this £3.6 million/hectare is above the price at which the government assumes land owners will sell – the benchmark land values, it is assumed that the project and its associated costs are ‘viable’. Currently benchmark land values are assumed to be about £250K/hectare for agricultural/
defaultgreenfield
default land and £850K/hectare for 
defaultbrownfield
default land depending on location. The figures vary little around the country but are much more consistent than the sales prices of homes which is the main determinant of whether a site is viable for sale. The other main factor is housing densities; greater housing densities justify higher land values. A rule of thumb, given average assumptions suggests an average sales value of between £200K and £250K is enough to justify the addition costs of 
defaultCfSH
default 5. The average UK house price is £242K which suggests about 50% of the UK would justify more sustainable development. This figure likely to be higher as the majority of the government’s proposed future housing development is in the high priced south east.
default5.3.

defaultTable 1: Costs of development of single house in an estate in Bath
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn this example the ‘land value’ of an individual average property is £142,103/hectare which at 35 dwellings per hectare works out at £4.9M/hectare well above the government’s benchmark values of £250K to £850K/hectare. The 
defaultCfSH
default 5 costs are only 2.8% of the total development cost of the site. The marginal addition build costs the site could bear are about £117,000 before the site becomes unviable, at this margin you could implement 
defaultCfSH
default 5 measures 12 times only on each property while maintaining viability.
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe therefore conclude that the additional 2.8% cost of 
defaultCfSH
default 5 will have no impact on the availability of land
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately the government’s review has not done this, but we feel it is a necessary part of a rational review. This section demonstrates the following:
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere have been 4 recent studies
default on the extra-over costs for the Code for Sustainable Homes:
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll of which have produced different costs, the reason for Transition Bath producing its own study was that we felt the Aug 2011 cost study used the wrong and outdated solar PV prices of £3,750/
defaultkWp
default compared with the current market of about £1200/
defaultkWp
default – this is the most significant cost of 
defaultCfSH
default and as a result we felt overstated the costs significantly. This analysis was a contributor to B&amp;NES council and 4 others commissioning their own independent study which was completed in September 2013.
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EC Harris study provides significantly higher costs (30% to 80%) than the AECOM/EE and Transition Bath studies. Transition Bath would argue that neither the Aug 2011 study nor the more recent EC Harris study for Housing Standard Review used cost effective solutions or even the right prices, and as such significantly over stated the costs and made strengthened the argument against more sustainable homes. We feel the government’s impact assessment on this basis is not fit for purpose

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnergy savings from building to

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnfortunately the Department of Communities and Local Government have failed to do this calculation in the Housing Standards Review. We feel it should have been an integral part of the impact assessment, and should have been assessed in from both the home occupier’s and UK plc’s perspective.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf you monetise this saving (20 years @ 3.5%) the benefit is £10,241 without FITS and £17,774 with FITS compared with the £6,028 capital costs of installing  the measures; on any economic basis it is clear higher levels of sustainability are economically beneficial

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government does allude to the potential that it might provide a cost and CO2 impact assessment in paragraph 71 and 72 of the consultation, but this appears only be after the consultation is complete and the decision made?
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe impact of making the Water, Secure by Design and Lifetime Homes components of defaultCfSHdefault optional has not been properly assessed: defaultThe
default defaultwording of the consultation suggests that it will be very difficult for Local Authorities to justify these components: For water it is the local water supplier who decides whether there is a need – which is unlikely as it would not be in their financial interests. The removal of Lifetime Homes will provide the disabled with significantly less choice of homes to live in.
default&#xa0;
defaultTransition Bath is a charity run by volunteers and has no paid staff. While a number of volunteers derive income from paid employment in the energy efficiency sector, as far as we know none derive income from the new build sector. As such the above views are not driven by personal financial interests. Our motivation is to make Bath more sustainable and to act on behalf of what we feel is the community’s view that homes should be built or retrofitted to the highest levels of sustainability and energy efficiency. This charity’s view is a long term one and our objective is to maximise the legacy we leave future generations.
