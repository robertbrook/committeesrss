"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted By Dr Norman Page (IPC0058)&#xa0;I am Norman J \nPage .\n I graduated from Oxford with a BA degree in Geology in 1957 and subsequently earned a PhD in Geology from the University of Illinois in 1961.\nMy professional career was spent in \nInternational Oil Exploration both as an employee of major corporations and from 1979 on as an independent consultant.\nMuch of the exploration geologist’s work consists of correlation in time and space of multiple streams of data time series of multiple va\nriables to elucidate the geological history of potential oil bearing basins and then making decisions under uncertainty .The fact that one’s forecasts will soon be tested \nby the expenditure of millions of dollars tends to concentrate the mind and force a f\nocus on empirical data rather than theoretical speculations\n \n.\nFollowing retirement in 2002 I have been able to pursue my scientific interest in Climate Science and have maintained a blog site  \nhttp://clim\natesense-norpag.blogspot.com\n since 2009\n&#xa0;\nModels and CO2&#xa0;\nThe CAGW meme is built on the outputs of climate models. Many of the modelers and IPCC\n&#xa0;\n and Met Office scientific \n&#xa0;\nchiefs had a background in weather forecasting In spite of\n&#xa0;\n the inability of the \nweather models to forecast more than about 10 days ahead, in an act of hubris, the modelers\n&#xa0;\nallowed\n&#xa0;\n themselves\n&#xa0;\nto believe, or at least proclaim, \n&#xa0;\nthat they knew enough about the physical processes and\n&#xa0;\nclimate driving factors\n&#xa0;\n involved to forecast global t\nemperatures for decades and centuries ahead\n \n.Indeed,\n&#xa0;\nmany establishment \n&#xa0;\nscientists\n&#xa0;\nappear to\n&#xa0;\nthink that\n&#xa0;\nhumanity \n&#xa0;\ncan dial up a desired global temperature by keeping CO2 within som\ne\n&#xa0;\nappropriate limit. This is\n nonsense!\nIn practice the modelers have known \nfor some time that their models have no skill in forecasting and have indeed said so in the\n WG1 reports.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC AR4 WG1\n&#xa0;\nscience section actually acknowledges this fact. Section IPCC A\nR4 WG1 8.6 deals with \nforcings\n,\n&#xa0;\nfeedbacks and climate sensitivity. The \nconclusions are in section 8.6.4 which deals with the reliability of the projections. It concludes:\n\"Moreover it is not yet clear which tests are critical for constraining the future projections, consequently a set of model metrics that might be used to na\nrrow the range of plausible climate change feedbacks and climate sensitivity has yet to be developed\"\nWhat could be clearer. The IPCC in 2007 said itself that we don't even know what metrics to put into the models to test their reliability\n.-\n i.e. we don't \nknow what future temperatures will be and we can't calculate the climate sensitivity to CO2.This also begs a further question of what\n&#xa0;\nerroneous \n&#xa0;\nassumptions (e.g. that CO2 is the main climate driver) went into the \"plausible\" models to be tested anyway.\n&#xa0;\nTh\nis means that\n&#xa0;\nthe successive SPM \n&#xa0;\nuncertainty estimates take no account of the structural uncertainties\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nin \n&#xa0;\nthe models and that almost the entire\n&#xa0;\nthe range of model outputs may well lay outside the range of the real world future climate variability. By th\ne time of the AR5 report\n the warming hiatus and the recent cooling show that \nthis is obviously the case\n.\nThe key\n factor in\n&#xa0;\nmaking CO2 emission \ncontrol policy is \nthe climate sensitivity to CO2. In \nthe \n AR5\n&#xa0;\n - WG1\n \n the IPCC is saying: (Section 9.7.3.3)\n\"The \nassessed literature suggests that the range of climate sensitivities and transient responses covered by CMIP3/5 cannot be narrowed significantly by constraining the models with observations of the mean climate and variability, consistent with the difficult\ny of constraining the cloud feedbacks from observations\n.\n \"\nIn plain English this means that they have no idea what the climate sensitivity is and tha\nt therefore that Governments \nlogically \n have\n no empirical scien\ntific basis for their economically destructi\nve climate and energy policies.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC\n climate models are incorrectly structured because they are based on three irrational and false assumptions. First that CO2 is the main climate \ndriver ,\nsecond that in calculating climate sensitivity the GHE due to wa\nter vapo\nr should be added to that of CO2\n as a \nfeed back\n effect and t\nhird that the GHE of water vapo\nr is always positive\n \n.As to the last point the feedbacks cannot be positive otherwise we wouldn't be here to talk about it .\nTemperature drives both CO2 and water vapor independently\n,.\n The whole CA\nGW - GHG scare is based on the obvious fallacy of putting the effect before the cause.\n \nAs a simple (not exact) analogy controlling CO2 levels to control temperature is like trying to lower the temperature of an electric hot plate under a boiling pan of wat\ner by capturing and sequestering the steam coming off the top\n \n.\n A corollary to this\n is that the whole idea of \na simple\n climate sensitivity to CO2 is nonsense and the sensitivity equation has no \nphysical meaning unless you already know what the natural cont\nrols on energy inputs are already i\n.\ne\n.\n the extent of the natural variability.\nFurthermore the \nmodelling\n approach is inherently of no value for predicting future temperature with any calculable certainty because of the difficulty of specifying the initial c\nonditions of a large number of variables with sufficient precision prior to multiple iterations. There is no way of knowing whether t\nhe outputs after the parameteriz\nation of the multiple inputs merely hide compensating errors in the system as a whole. \n&#xa0;\nIn summary the projections of the IPCC - Met office models and all the impact studies which derive from them are based on specifically structurally flawed and inherently useless models. They deserve&#xa0;no&#xa0;place in any serious discussion of future climate trends and represent an enormous waste of time and money. As a basis for public policy their forecasts are grossly in error&#xa0;and therefore worse than useless.&#xa0;The Way Ahead.A Simple Rational Approach to Climate Forecasting based on Common Sense and Quasi Repetitive -&#xa0;Quasi Cyclic Patterns.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow then can we predict the future of a constantly changing climate? A new fo\nrecasting paradigm is required.\nIt is important to note that it in order to make transparent and likely skillful forecasts it \n&#xa0;\nis not \nnecessary to understand or quantify \n&#xa0;\nthe interactions of the large number of interacting and\n&#xa0;\nquasi - independent physical processes and variables\n&#xa0;\nwhich produce the state of the climate system as a whole as represented by the temperature metric.\nBy identify\ning quasi periodic and quasi –repetitive patterns in the temperature and diver data\n,\n \nsimple ,transparent\n and likely reasonably skillful climate forecasts are possible .This method has been explained in a series of posts at\n \nhttp://climatesense-norpag.blogspot.com\n \nhere\n are the conclusions of the latest post\n“In earlier posts on\n&#xa0;\n at\n 4/02/13 and 1/22/13\nI have combined the PDO, ,Millennial cycle and neutron trends to estimate the timing and extent of the\n coming cooling in both the Northern Hemisphere \n&#xa0;\nand Globally.\nHere are the conclusions of those posts.\n1/22/13 (NH)1) The millennial peak is sharp\n&#xa0;\n - perhaps 18 years +/-. We have now had 16 years since 1997 with no net warming - and so might expect a\n sharp drop in a year or two - 2014/16 -with a net cooling by 2035 of about 0.35.Within that time frame however there could well be some exceptional \n&#xa0;\nyears with NH temperatures +/- 0.25 degrees colder than that.\n2)\n The cooling gradient might be \nfairly steep down to the \nOort\n minimum equivalent which would occur about 2100. (\nabout\n 1100 on Fig 5) \n(&#xa0;Fig 3 here)&#xa0;\nwith a total cooling in 2100 from the present estimated at\n&#xa0;\n about 1.2 +/- \n3) From 2100 on through the Wolf and \nSporer\n minima equivalents wit\nh intervening highs to the Maunder Minimum equivalent which could occur from about 2600 - 2700 a further net cooling of\n&#xa0;\n about 0.7 degrees could occur for a total drop of 1.9 +/- degrees\n4)The time frame for the significant\n&#xa0;\ncooling \n&#xa0;\nin\n&#xa0;\n 2014 - 16\n&#xa0;\n is stren\ngthened by recent developments already seen in solar activity. With a time lag of about 12 years between the solar driver proxy and climate we should see the effects of the sharp drop in the \nAp\n Index which took place in 2004/5 in 2016-17.\n4/02/13 \n(\n&#xa0;\nGlobal\n)\n1 Significant temperature drop\n&#xa0;\nat about\n&#xa0;\n2016-17\n&#xa0;\n2 Possible unusual cold snap 2021-22\n&#xa0;\n3 Built in cooling trend until\n&#xa0;\n at least 2024\n&#xa0;\n4 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2035 \n&#xa0;\n- 0.15\n&#xa0;\n5 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2100\n&#xa0;\n - 0.5\n&#xa0;\n6 \nGeneral Conclusion - by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed,\n&#xa0;\n7 By 2650\n&#xa0;\n earth could possibly be back to the depths of the little ice age.\n&#xa0;\n8 The effect of increasing CO2 emissions will be minor but \nbeneficial \n&#xa0;\n-\n they may sli\nghtly\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n ameliorate the forecast\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\ncooling and help maintain crop yields\n&#xa0;\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;9 Warning !!&#xa0; There are some signs in the Livingston and Penn Solar data that a sudden drop to the Maunder Minimum Little Ice Age temperatures could be imminent - with a much more rapid and economically disruptive&#xa0;cooling than that forecast above which may turn out to be a best case scenario.How confident should one be in these above predictions? The pattern method doesn't lend itself easily to statistical measures. However st\natistical calculations only provide an apparent rigor for the uninitiated and in relation to the IPCC climate models are entirely misleading because they make no allowance for the structural uncertainties in the model set \nup.This\n is where scientific judgme\nnt comes in - some people are better at pattern recognition and meaningful correlation than others. A past record of successful forecasting such as indicated above is a useful but not infallible measure. In this case I am reasonably sure - say 65/35 for ab\nout 20 years ahead. Beyond that certainty drops rapidly. I am sure, however, that it will prove closer to reality than anything put out by the IPCC, Met Office or the NASA group. In any case this is a Bayesian type forecast- in that it can easily be amende\nd on an ongoing basis as the Temperature and Solar data accumulate. \nIf there is not a 0.15 - 0.20.\n \ndrop\n in Global SSTs by 2018 -20 I would need to re-evaluate.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
