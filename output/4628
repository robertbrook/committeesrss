defaultThis would be alm
defaultost laughable if it weren’t so serious. The main problem is that schools have been incorrectly identified as the culprits in the disadvantage that children from areas of disadvantage suffer. And the one main saviour in the sorry state of these children’s l
defaultives: their local school, with their familiar and experienced teacher
defaults – this actual saviour has
default been accused and even found guilty of neglect and incompetence.

defaultI have attended nearly all
default defaultthe Leeds consultation meetings for academisation. And the process in every case was, in my opinion, corrupt and totally lacking in academic rigour. In particular the situation at South Leeds 
defaultHigh 
defaultSchool was one of the most dishonest
default. This newly made school had only just 
defaultrecovered from the merger of two very different schools [Merlyn Rees - very white ex-working class, and Matthew Murray, largely Asian], enduring at first some racial tensions

defaultAfter some rocky early 
defaultmoments, the Ofsted team in 200

defaultneeded

defaultThere is nothing educational about the creation of academies and the inevitable chains that follow. 
defaultThey seem only to serve the interests of private industry. Motivated by money, or power, or winning league tables
default,
default they have lost the original intention of education [from the Latin 
defaulteducere
default, to lead out], which is to consider the individual child, and his or her needs.

defaultNone at all.

defaultFirstly I would question who says they are failing, and sadly it seems someone with a vested interested in rubbishing the, keeping teachers in a state of fear, and someone looking for a school to steal
default [and I do mean “steal”].

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is an irony that 
defaultthe very process which was publicly heralded as intended as 
defaultcuring the so-called failing schools has so much damage. Advice from teaching unions and other professionals was of
defaultfered and ignored. The private sector was itching to get its hands on education, and the government was itching to appease big business.
