&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Preventing visual impairment can deliver substantial downstream cost savings which should be factored into the efficiency gains. These provide a better overall interface between the health care and social care, which will bring about longer-term improvements in efficiency, preventive care and reablement.    

[[[1. Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1 This document sets out the response of the Optical Confederation to the Health Select Committee inquiry into Public Expenditure on Health and Social Care. It builds upon written evidence submitted to the Committee on the same topic in September 2011.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2 The Optical Confederation represents the 12,000 optometrists, the 6,000 dispensing opticians and 7,000 optical businesses in the UK who provide high quality and accessible eye care services to the whole population. The Confederation is a coalition of the five optical representative bodies: the Association of British Dispensing Opticians (ABDO); the Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers (ACLM); the Association of Optometrists (AOP); the Federation of Manufacturing Opticians (FMO) and the Federation of Ophthalmic and Dispensing Opticians (FODO). As a Confederation, we work with others to improve eye health for the public good. The Optical Confederation welcomes this opportunity to submit comments to the inquiry on public expenditure, and would be willing to support the Health Select Committee in making equity and excellence in eye care a reality.&#xa0;

[[[Progress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care services.]]]&#xa0;2.1 The increase in demand for NHS eye care services requires careful planning by all health and social care professionals in order to slow, or even to halt, this rise. Some progress has been made with the establishment of Local Eye Health Networks (LEHNs) across all NHS England Local Areas. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2

[[[ ]]]The aim is that these LEHNs will bring together all local eye health stakeholders in a clinically-led, patient- and population-focussed model to achieve progress against the sight loss indicator locally. This will involve assessing local eye health needs, redesigning pathways as necessary in line with QIPP principles and maximising the deployment of resources across primary, secondary, social and voluntary sector care for health gain.&#xa0;2.3 As previously mentioned, eye care services can be a lead area for QIPP, freeing up resources in the NHS, and delivering quality improvements at low cost. A very noteworthy innovation in eye care is the development of the Commissioning Toolkit for Eye Care by the UK Vision Strategy. This toolkit highlights why eye care services should be prioritised, the potential for a small investment to deliver sizeable results, and provides guidance to support the commissioning of better eye care services across the NHS. Moreover, the recently formed Clinical Council for Eye Health Commissioning will also aim to offer united, evidence-based clinical advice and guidance to those commissioning and delivering eye health services in England on issues where national leadership is needed.&#xa0;2.4 The Clinical Council for Eye Health Commissioning plans to work in partnership with NHS England, to support the development of services to meet local needs and improve outcomes based on best evidence and in the most patient sensitive and cost-effective ways. The Clinical Council is now contributing to the development of NICE accredited commissioning guidance on cataract and glaucoma services. The Council will then move on to look at the best ways of improving the quality and efficiency of services for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy in line with indicator 4.12 of the Public Health Outcomes Framework.

[[[IT]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;3.1 In line with the NHS’s vision for referrals to be completely paperless by 2018, the interconnectivity of community optical, GP, Choose and Book and hospital eye service IT systems should be made a priority by government as it will enable rapid exchange of clinical, referral, financial and audit data. The Scottish Government is already making good progress towards this goal and, as a Confederation, we warmly welcomed NHS England’s announcement in June 2012 that they were in the early stages of developing a national specification for primary ophthalmic services (POS) claims and payments, an important first step towards greater connectivity in England and collecting outcomes data. We look forward to working with all relevant stakeholders to achieve integrated IT systems, as mentioned above, as their absence is a major obstacle to integrated eye care.&#xa0;

[[[Reports of particular financial pressures in the system, such as funding for General Practice, and for Accident and Emergency services]]]4.1 Urgent eye care is provided by GPs, optometrists, A&amp;E departments, minor injury units, eye casualty departments and rapid-access outpatient clinics. An urgent eye condition is any eye condition that is of recent onset and is distressing or is believed by the patient, carer or referring health professional to present an imminent threat to vision or general health. However many patients treated by the urgent eye care service have non-urgent conditions, particularly patients who self-refer to eye casualty. 4.2 Most hospital urgent eye care services report that they struggle to keep pace with demand. Demand for hospital eye emergency services is thought to be increasing. Evidence from London, shows that over a five year period up to 2011, demand at two major eye casualty units increased by seven and ten per cent year on year and eye emergencies are estimated to make up 1.46-6% of accident and emergency attendances. However, most urgent eye conditions are non-acute and relatively straightforward to treat. 4.3 To make services more accessible and reduce pressure on hospital eye casualty, a significant proportion of patients can be diagnosed and managed in a primary care instead by a healthcare professional with a slit lamp (which allows you to see the front and back of the eye in detail and is needed to diagnose most urgent eye conditions) and the skills and experience to use it. GPs do not usually have slit lamps or enough experience of using one, but community optometrists do and are well placed to promptly diagnose, triage and treat patients with urgent eye problems safely and efficiently.4.4 Other efficiencies could be made by nationwide adoption of a number of successful enhanced eye care services, namely in glaucoma referral refinement, management of stable glaucoma, and primary eyecare assessment in community optical practices.  These tried and tested schemes have delivered better patient outcomes, local cost savings, reduced waiting times and helped to deliver a local patient-centred service without increasing patient risk. Adopting these schemes has also freed up significant capacity in secondary eye care to focus on patients facing acute or chronic sight loss.

[[[Falls prevention]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1 The impacts of sight loss on older people are well documented, including the role uncorrected visual problems play in falls and performance of everyday tasks. The full financial cost of these falls to the NHS and social care has not been calculated, however it is conservatively estimated by the Royal National Institute of Blind People at £25 million per year.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; Epivision (2009) for RNIB Future Sight Loss UK (2) Tate et al (2005) The prevalence of visual impairment in the UK; A review of the literature www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/PublicWebsite/public_prevalencereport.doc Access Economics (2009) for RNIB Future Sight Loss UK (1)http://www.opticalconfederation.org.uk/downloads/consultations/OC%20Submission%20to%20HSC%20Inquiry%20into%20Public%20Expenditure.pdf  http://www.commissioningforeyecare.org.uk/ https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216162/Improving-outcomes-and-supporting-transparency-part-21.pdf, p.112-114.
