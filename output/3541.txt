[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance? &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives? 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan? &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Inclusion of other microbes]]]The growing number of effective antiviral drugs in use also illustrates this point. In many cases their development has been catalysed by the HIV pandemic, but these are finding application in the treatment of important persistent viral pathogens in addition to HIV, such as hepatitis C. New antivirals against influenza virus are also being used at the population level. This increasing and widespread use of antiviral drugs will inevitably be accompanied by the growing emergence of AMR in viruses (as already seen for HIV). Thus many of the proposals outlined in the strategy may be equally applied to responses to resistance in organisms besides bacteria, and these should be given appropriate weighting in the strategy’s objectives.  For brevity, we have not addressed each aspect of AMR (such as occurrences in virology, mycology and parasitology) in detail individually in this response, but would be willing to provide further information to the committee if requested.  &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;               The Department of Health (2013).
