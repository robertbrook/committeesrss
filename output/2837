[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from RAC Motoring Services (WRT 020)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]              [bold]B[bold]A[bold]CKGROUND[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The RAC is the UK’s most progressive motoring organisation and welcomes the 
[normal]opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport
[normal] Select Committee as part of its
[normal] review of the resilience of the UK’s transport networks during 
[normal]severely 
[normal]adverse winter weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The RAC represents m
[normal]ore than seven million members, 
[normal]providing
[normal] services for bot
[normal]h private and business motorists
[normal],
[normal] and is committed to making driving easier, safer, more affordable and more enjoyable for all road users.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We employ more than 1700 patrols providing roadside assistance in the most extreme weather conditions across the UK
[normal] and
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] have a good understanding of the impact of adverse weather on the road network. Throughout recent winters, RAC patrols have 
[normal]worked alongside the Highways Agency
[normal], the Police Service 
[normal]and other key stakeholders to 
[normal]maximise the safety
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] road
[normal] users
[normal] 
[normal]at risk in
[normal] 
[normal]treacherous conditions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D
[normal]uring 
[normal]periods of 
[normal]sudden snowfall
[normal], 
[normal]when roads 
[normal]can 
[normal]became
[normal] im
[normal]passable
[normal], and immediately afterwards, when roads remain treacherous because of compacted ice, t
[normal]he demand for 
[normal]roadside assistance 
[normal]increases dramatically. 
[normal]During the worst periods in recent winters, national demand has risen to levels
[normal] 
[normal]typically 
[normal]50
[normal]% 
[normal]greater than is normal for the time of year
[normal], 
[normal]with demand 
[normal]as much as 
[normal]100% greater than normal in the worst affected areas.
[normal]In response to the conditions
[normal], 
[normal]the 
[normal]RAC 
[normal]h
[normal]as 
[normal]increased the 
[normal]proportion
[normal] o
[normal]f 4x4 patrol vehicle 
[normal]on its fle
[normal]et progressively over the last three
[normal] years. This i
[normal]nvestment has primarily been in
[normal] 4x4 panel vans rather than specialist 4x4 vehicles. We have also issued snow sock
[normal]s
[normal] or snow chains 
[normal]for
[normal] all of our patrol
[normal] vehicles
[normal],
[normal] whereas historically we have only done so in areas where sever
[normal]e
[normal] winter weather was most common. 
[normal] We believe that many other large fleets have made similar investments to improve
[normal] their response to adverse weather
[normal].
[normal]Our comments a
[normal]re confined to the road network and RAC’s ability to respond to adverse weather.

[normal] 
[normal]which was 
[normal]authored by Brian Smith and 
[normal]publish
[normal]ed by the RAC Foundation
[normal] in May 
[normal]2013
[normal]. 
[normal]We also understand t
[normal]hat the Committee has received 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]submitted by 
[normal]the Foundation that summarises t
[normal]he main findings of the 
[normal]report.
[normal] RAC 
[normal]regards the report as 
[normal]fair and accurate and 
[normal]commend
[normal]s
[normal] it to the Committee. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of the 
[normal]research conducted
[normal] for
[normal] this report, RAC patrols provided feedback on their own experience delivering service during the period January to March 2013 when the worst of the 2012/13 winter conditions were experienced. Specifically:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The report also states: “
[normal]Within 
[normal]free text comments
[normal] 
[normal]that also made up the response, 
[normal]there were
[normal] 
[normal]several observations that drivers appeared not to have heeded weather warnings and had been caught out, or unprepared, and that many of the stranded vehicles were not suitable for driving in the 
[normal]extreme weather 
[normal]conditions. There were also concerns about p
[normal]oor driving and lack of experience/skills for the 
[normal]road 
[normal]conditions. There were a large number of comments about the number of potholes in all types of road, and the observation that they are particularly dangerous when it has snowed, because they cannot be 
[normal]seen.

[normal]GENERAL RESILIENCE OF THE ROAD NETWORK[bold]RAC believes that the ability of the Highways Agency and local authorities to respond to adverse weather and keep the roads operation
[normal]al in the most extreme weather 
[normal]has improved since 
[normal]2009/10. The recommendatio
[normal]ns of the Quarmby report have generally been implemented and 
[normal]have delivered the 
[normal]predicted
[normal] benefits
[normal]. Salt stocks have not run out. Major roads are generally treated in a timely way, but patrols report that the effectiveness with which local roads are kept p
[normal]assable still varies hugely from area to area depending on the priority given to this by local authorities. RAC patrols often have to attend customers on
[normal] minor rural
[normal] or residential roads so this does inhibit service delivery
[normal].
[normal]T
[normal]he Highways Agency 
[normal]has been s
[normal]uccessful in keeping
[normal] 
[normal]the strategic road network functioning
[normal]. The only exceptions have been geographically localised and in highly unusual 
[normal]circumstances
[normal].

[normal]FORECASTING OF ADVERSE WEATHER[bold]&#xa0;[bold]RAC is
[normal] best able to respond to adverse we
[normal]a
[normal]ther when 
[normal]the organisation 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]sufficient
[normal] wa
[normal]rning
[normal] to adjust resourcing levels
[normal]. Five
[normal]-day weather forecasts 
[normal]proved to be 
[normal]reasonably 
[normal]accurate and predicted the adverse weather in the 2012/13 winter. 
[normal]In contrast
[normal], 
[normal]16-
[normal]day forecasts were insufficiently accurate to justify commitment of ext
[normal]ra resource. 
[normal]Five
[normal] days provide
[normal]d
[normal] only limited opportunity to adjust working shifts and relocate patrols into areas where demand 
[normal]was
[normal] likely to be greatest.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] ability
[normal], therefore, 
[normal]to predict adverse weather a mini
[normal]mum of two
[normal] weeks ahead would significantly im
[normal]prove RAC’s ability to respond. We anticipate that other organisations 
[normal]facing similar challenges 
[normal]would benefit from improved longer term 
[normal]weather forecasting
[normal].

[normal]POTHOLES AND [bold]ROAD MAINTENANCE [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The formation of 
[normal]p
[normal]otholes 
[normal]has been accelerated by
[normal] three
[normal] successive
[normal] harsh winters
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]had a large
[normal] and sustained
[normal] 
[normal]impact on 
[normal]the state of our roads
[normal] across the country.
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]has resulted in added risk to the safety 
[normal]of 
[normal]motorists 
[normal]and their vehicles, 
[normal]particularly for cyclists. These risks are increased when pothol
[normal]es become invisible when roads are flooded or covered by snow. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]M
[normal]otorists regard
[normal] 
[normal]local road maintenance
[normal] as the top priority in transport
[normal] spending and this year there ha
[normal]ve
[normal] been 
[normal]numerous 
[normal]calls 
[normal]for local authorities to improve 
[normal]the speed and effectiveness of 
[normal]pothole repairs. The Department for Transport has provided valuable guidance on addres
[normal]sing the practical problems of p
[normal]otholes in the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Pro
[normal]gramme Report “Prevention is bet
[normal]ter than cur
[normal]e – Pothole Review” published i
[normal]n April 2012
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2013 the RAC’s Report on Motoring found that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This dissatisfaction 
[normal]is greatest
[normal] in 
[normal]rural areas 
[normal]where the 
[normal]quality
[normal] of local
[normal] 
[normal]roads appears to be getting much
[normal] 
[normal]worse
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]according to
[normal] 
[normal]87% of respondents. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The RAC 
[normal]has called on the 
[normal]Government to
[normal] 
[normal]ensure more of the 
[normal]£ 
[normal]motoring taxation
[normal] 
[normal]collected centrally by the Treasury
[normal], which totals in excess of £40 billion p.a., 
[normal] is
[normal] 
[normal]made 
[normal]available to
[normal] local authorities to fund the
[normal] 
[normal]maintenance of local roads.
[normal] RAC a
[normal]cknowledges that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government made additional funding available to address the problems of potholes
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]this has not had the desired outcomes and it seems likely that 
[normal]in some ca
[normal]ses 
[normal]this funding has been used to 
[normal]replace, rather than supplement,
[normal] funding from local budgets 
[normal]to address local roads maintenance
[normal]. Earlier
[normal] this
[normal] year
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]RAC 
[normal]called
[normal] on the Government to
[normal] 
[normal]carry out an 
[normal]audit 
[normal]of the
[normal] 
[normal]work required to 
[normal]bring 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]UK’s roads 
[normal]to a state 
[normal]that is fit for purpose and prioritise the funding required to achieve this objective over a realistic timescale.
