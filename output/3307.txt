[[[Re Draft Deregulation Bill – Clause 35]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for asking me to comment on the proposal  that is contained in clause 35 of the Draft Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;Clause 35 relates specifically to the Government's intention &#xa0;to remove the duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP following the abolition of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council and the merger of the Tribunals Service with HM Courts Service.&#xa0;In practical terms, I understand this will mean that the Senior President of the Tribunals &#xa0;will no longer have to prepare an annual report on the performance of DWP decision making as introduced under section 15A of the Social Security Act. &#xa0;Consequently, there will be limited transparency about the assessment of decision making in relation to key benefits such as the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). This is a vital issue for people with a range of fluctuating medical conditions, as well as those with mental health conditions. &#xa0;I am an honorary medical adviser to The ME Association but am also commenting in my capacity as a member of the Forward ME Group (a group of charities concerned with ME/CFS which is chaired by the Countess of Mar) and a member of the Fluctuating Conditions Group (FCG).  The FCG is a group of representatives from medical charities for people with fluctuating medical conditions.  The group has produced recommendations for changes to the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Our recommendations, along with those from a mental health group,  are now being compared to the current WCA by the DWP in an evidence based review.&#xa0;&#xa0;I am very concerned by and completely opposed to this proposal.  &#xa0;The reasons for doing so are set out below and I have included important supporting evidence from the three annual independent reviews of the WCA that have been carried out by Professor Malcolm Harrington. &#xa0;Information relating to the DWP decision making and appeal procedures that is contained in these reviews should certainly be brought to the attention of the committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Background]]]Individuals applying for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) have a right of appeal against decisions taken on behalf of the Secretary of State. This means that they are entitled to have the decision examined by a body that is independent of the Department and its decision-making structures. These appeals are carried out by the First-tier Tribunal of the Social Entitlement Chamber and administered by the Tribunals Service, an executive body of the Ministry of Justice. However, it is widely accepted by all concerned – claimants, patient support charities, the DWP, the Tribunal Service – that far too many people are taking their case to appeal.  The very high rate of success at appeal – somewhere around 40% of cases being heard – clearly indicates that there are major problems with the ESA decision making process.The failure to get so many decisions right first time, at the level of the DWP Decision Maker, has led to increased pressure on the First-tier and Tribunals Service. In practical terms this means that large amounts of professional time and public money are being wasted on reversing decisions that were not properly considered in the first place.  It also places a considerable amount of stress on many genuine claimants – which may then result in a significant deterioration in their health.The majority of DWP decisions that are overturned are because the Tribunal was able to obtain additional information that was not available to the DWP Decision Maker, through oral evidence elicited by the Tribunal, or through additional medical evidence brought along to the appeal.The following comments from Dr Jane Rayner, Chief Medical Member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal Service, are extremely relevant here and are recorded in the Minutes of the Forward ME Group meeting held on 26 January 2011:Dr Rayner said that she had met Professor Malcolm Harrington and she had told him that sometimes, when she read a report, she had an image of an individual in her mind but when they appeared before her the person bore no resemblance to the person portrayed in the report and that it was as if the report had been written by somebody completely different. She had also encountered cases where examining doctors had insisted that the claimant sign their medical report without having been allowed to see it.After being told that most people with chronic conditions want to concentrate on the things they are able to do and found it very hard to describe what they could not do, some of which they found embarrassing to describe, Dr Rayner said that people must leave the tribunals procedure with their dignity intact. They were exercising their right to an appeal and the tribunals system should act as a safety net for those who have been incorrectly assessed.Dr Rayner was asked whether the system was coping with its current workload, and whether it would cope in the future as claimants were migrated from incapacity benefit to employment and support allowance (ESA). Dr Rayner replied they were not currently coping which was why they have just appointed 200 new doctors. Their workload had increased. They used to work at 250,000 appeals a year. That had now risen to 500,000 appeals a year following the introduction of ESA.Minutes of Forward ME Group for 26/01/2011:http://www.forward-me.org.uk/26th%20january%202011.htmThe background information I have summarized so far partly explains why the DWP set up a series of independent annual reviews of the WCA – the first three being carried out by Professor Malcolm Harrington; the final two being carried out by Dr Paul Litchfield. Part of this process also involved two groups covering fluctuating medical conditions and mental health conditions being set up to produce recommendations as to how the WCA could be made more fair and effective – action which has now resulted in the Evidence Based Review that I have already referred to..To fully understand the complex background to these concerns about the entire decision making process the committee needs to consult the relevant chapters, along with the conclusions and recommendations relating to decision-making and appeals procedures, in the three annual reviews that have so far been prepared by Professor Harrington.  The most relevant sections are listed below:2010 Review:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-capability-assessment-independent-review-year-1Chapter 7: AppealsAnnex A: Recommendations 15 – 17 on Appeal Procedures2011 Review: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-capability-assessment-independent-review-year-2Chapter 6: Training – Appeals Judges and Medical Members, paras 16 - 222012 Review: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-capability-assessment-independent-review-year-3Chapter 2: Implementation of the year one and year two recommendations – The decision making process, paras 60 – 70 and The Appeals process, paras 71 – 76.Despite three reviews and a large number of recommendations for change there is still a great deal of work to be done in relation to improving the whole decision-making process and reducing the workload on the Tribunals. This involves both Decision Makers and the Tribunal Service – something that is made clear in the section covering ‘The appeals process’ in Professor Harrington’s 2012 review:

[[[The appeals process]]]71.The appeals process remains an area of considerable concern for the Review. The First-tier Tribunal President opines that this is outside the remit of the Review. The Review disagrees. Appeals are a fundamental part of the overall WCA process.72.The Review believes that two aspects need to be addressed with some urgency. Firstly, it is imperative that we get to the stage where Tribunal members are making their decisions based on the same evidence as the Decision Maker.73.Secondly, the Decision Maker Reasoning comes into play. The Review wrote to the Minister for Employment about this in May 2012 (Annex 2) indicating that not only should the Decision Maker Reasoning become the backbone of DWP’s case, but that if that detailed explanation is to be overturned by the Tribunal then they in turn must provide detailed justification for their decision. This would make the whole process more transparent and more accountable.74.To date, the only feedback secured from First-tier Tribunals (across all health and benefits appeals) has been, at long last, Judges indicating which one reason from a drop-down menu of one-liners is the basis for the Tribunal overturning the decision.75.This rudimentary form of feedback has taken much time and effort to achieve and it followed a recommendation to Ministers in February 2012 (Annex 2).The list of reasons available to Judges are:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent oral evidence; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent oral evidence in relation to physical factors; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent oral evidence in relation to mental factors; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent oral evidence in relation to both physical and mental factors; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Reached a different conclusion on substantially the same facts; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Reached different conclusion, having a regard to physical factors, on substantially the same facts; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Reached different conclusion, having a regard to mental factors, on substantially the same facts; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Reached different conclusion, having a regard to physical and mental factors, on substantially the same facts; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent documentary evidence supplied at the appeal; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent documentary evidence supplied at the appeal from a  Consultant; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent documentary evidence supplied at the appeal from a GP; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Cogent documentary evidence supplied at the appeal from a Healthcare Practitioner; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Decision Maker misapplied the law; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Medical/ Functional assessment report, relied on by Decision Maker,  contained significant error; and &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Tribunal did not provide a reason.  76. This feedback has been in place since July 2012. Whilst more detailed feedback is needed, analysis of this may at least be able to reveal trends and patterns which need addressing at both a national and individual Decision Maker level. To date the Review has not seen any analysis of the feedback, but this is something which DWP should closely monitor. Future Reviews may also wish to use this analysis, when available, to consider whether and where further reforms are needed.  However, in line with the information at Annex 2, I also recommend that:  DWP should continue to work with the First-tier Tribunal Service, encouraging them to, where appropriate, ensure robust and helpful feedback about reasons for decisions overturned by the First-tier Tribunal. &#xa0;&#xa0;The following Conclusions were also placed in the 2012 review:8. Significant further work also remains to increase the transparency of the assessment. Changes already implemented to ensure conclusions reached at the face-to-face assessment and in the decision making process are justified are helpful. However, most importantly, ensuring quality feedback from First-tier Tribunal Judges so both claimant and Decision Maker understand why the initial decision has been changed needs to be urgently addressed. 9.  It is essential that all relevant medical and allied evidence about a claimant is available to the DWP Decision Maker at the earliest possible stage in the assessment process. If this can be achieved then Tribunals will be based on Judges and Medical Members considering the same body of evidence as the Decision Maker did. 10.Future Independent Reviewers may have different views, but the main issues on which this Independent Reviewer believes the forthcoming year four and five Reviews need to focus attention (include):&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                              &#xa0;Improving feedback mechanisms throughout the whole WCA process, but most importantly those between First-tier Tribunal Judges and DWP Decision Makers. &#xa0;Finally, I will refer to a letter that was sent by Professor Harrington to Chris Grayling, Minister of State for Employment in February 2012, on the subject of communication  between Tribunals and DWP Decision Makers.  The content is self-explanatory and adds further emphasis to the need to continue this reporting from the Tribunal Service following the merger.______________________________________________

[[[Letter from Professor Harrington to Chris Grayling]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Rt. Hon. Chris Grayling MP Minister of State for Employment Department for Work and Pensions 4th floor Caxton House Tothill St London, SW1H 9NADear Chris,INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE WCA – ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION22 February 2012As you are aware, better communication between Tribunals and Decision Makers – particularly feedback from Tribunals about reasons for upheld appeals – was the one area in which I failed to make progress in my second independent review of the Work Capability Assessment.Shortly before Christmas I spoke at a meeting of the Upper-tier Tribunal Judges and I believe that the discussion which followed my presentation has provided a solution to this problem. The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 allow the Secretary of State the power to seek a written statement of reasons for overturn of a decision. This may provide the necessary route to achieve the feedback Decision Makers tell me they require.Whilst this facility already exists in legislation, I would like to make a first recommendation for year three that:In order to improve the quality of decision making the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions asks the Tribunal Service for timely feedback on reasons for upheld appeals.The ‘right first time’ principle of decision making will be key to improving the efficiency of the WCA. This recommendation is not intended to make Judges justify their decisions, but is rather to help improve the quality of decision making and reduce re-work in DWP Operations.I appreciate there are several ways in which this could be achieved:1  Decision Makers (acting for the Secretary of State) could ask for the reasons why their decision has been overturned in all cases, or could limit their requests to occasions where they believe the original decision was sound. The first option would enable DWP to gather statistical evidence on the reasons for upheld appeals (and subsequently improve their own performance, for example through the reconsideration process) but may prove burdensome in an administrative sense for both DWP and the Tribunals Service. The second option, whilst limiting the potential for organisation level improvements, would greatly benefit individual Decision Maker performance and development. 2  Information could be supplied by the Tribunal Service in several different ways. I believe the simplest solution would be to use a tick-box such as the one outlined in my second review. This would have the advantage of ensuring consistency in feedback. However, some Judges have told me they would be willing to provide a short (say 100 words) justification for their decision to uphold an appeal. This would be significantly more helpful on an individual level to Decision Makers.  Piloting or trialling this approach may be helpful in the first instance. This would enable both DWP and the Tribunal Service to explore further any practical and operational problems with the proposal.  I am acutely aware of the resource restrictions the Department is facing at present, but an ideal option may be for several pilots to test some the various options outlined above. These trials could focus on and determine the most time and cost efficient approach to gaining this essential information.  The addition of ‘timely’ in the recommendation is an important point. It is vital that if things are to improve Decision Makers should be provided with advice from the Tribunals Service soon after the appeal has been heard. This may strengthen the argument for using the summary one-liners outlined in my second review as this approach will take far less time for Judges to complete. I realise that making recommendations so soon after the publication of a review is unusual. However, given the importance of this issue I hope you will give this recommendation due consideration.If the Department accepts this recommendation I will also discuss it the First- tier Tribunals President. Whilst there may be some short-term difficulties for them with this approach, I believe that in the medium-term improving Decision Maker performance will increase the number of right first time decisions and reduce the overall number of appeals: this will in turn ease the burdens currently placed on the Tribunals Service.Best wishes,Professor Malcolm Harrington CBE&#xa0;_____________________________________________________&#xa0;I believe that I have provided compelling evidence to support a position where it is vital that there is  a continuing duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP following the abolition of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council and the merger of the Tribunals Service with HM Courts Service.My understanding is that Professor Harrington’s recommendation for the First Tier to report in detail on Appeal cases was accepted by both the Ministry of Justice and by the DWP.  So surely this position still stands and the role previously put on the Council therefore still stands?&#xa0;If I can be of any further assistance please let me knowYours sincerely&#xa0;Dr Charles ShepherdHon Medical AdviserME Association9 September 2013              &#xa0;&#xa0;
