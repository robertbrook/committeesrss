defaultis a registered charity and an Associate Parliamentary Group. Its charitable objective is “To protect human life through the promotion of transport safety for the public benefit”. Its aim is to advise and inform members of the House of Commons and of the H
defaultouse of Lords on air, rail and road safety issues. It brings together safety professionals and legislators to identify research-based solutions to transport safety problems having regard to cost, effectiveness, achievability and acceptability. 
defaultPACTS belie
defaultves the issue of safety at level crossings to be important and 
defaulttopical and 
defaultwelcomes th
defaulte Committee’s 
defaultinquiry
default. 
defaultWith some 
default7,500 to 8,000 
defaultlevel crossings
default in Great Britain, 
defaultlevel crossings
default represent the largest single risk of catastrophic train 
defaultaccident
default on Brit
defaultain's rail network. In addition, 
defaultdespite a generally good rail safety record, 
defaultthere are around 
defaultnine
default 
defaultpeople
default killed in
default level crossing accidents each year
default,
default mainly
default pedestrians and vehicle users
default. 
defaultThe inquiry is also is important because s
defaultafety at level crossin
defaultgs is a complex matter and requires coordinated action from Network Rail, 
defaultRSSB, 
defaultORR, TOCs, the highway authorities, the local police, British Transport Police and other agencies. The law governing level crossings is 
defaultseen as 
defaultoutdated and the Law Commission 
defaultis considering reform.

defaultl
default parties contribute and in a timely fashion.

defaultIn
default recent years, 
defaultparticularly since 200
default7, 
defaultroad accident fatalities have fallen sharply 
defaultin
default Great Britain. This raises expectation
defaults
default about 
defaultimprovements in safety 
defaultfor other modes.
defaultThe Office of Rail Regulation reports
default that Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% re
defaultduction in level crossing risk 
defaultbetween 
default2009
default 
defaultand 20
default14, as measured by its own model. Our understanding is that this has been achieved by a programme involving both level crossing closures and improved risk mitigation measures. ORR noted, however, that some of Network Rail’s level 
defaultcrossing risk assessments were poor and did not identify the best risk controls.
defaultThough the contribution made by level crossings to overall pedestrian, cyclist
default, horse-rider 
defaultand 
defaultmotor
default vehicle user safety risk is very small, it is striking that media/public 
defaultinterest in level crossing accidents is sometimes very much greater than in equivalent incidents not involving the railways.
defaultLevel crossings also present a risk to the safety of rail passengers and on-board rail staff, as the incident at Ufton Nervet in 20
default04 demonstrated
default: the train driver and
default five rail passengers died
default. 
defaultDespite this, rail travel is around 500 times safer than cycling or walking, and 30 times safer than using a car, when measured in terms of fatalities per 
defaultmillion 
defaultkilometre
defaults 
defaulttravelled.
default It is 
defaultimportant to consider relative safety levels across the transport modes and the overall cost-effectiveness of measures when deciding on safety investment
defaults
default. 
defaultIn PACTS’ view, 
defaultthere is no room for complacency about safety 
defaultat level crossings
default. New 
defaultequipment
default, improved management techniques and 
defaultinvestment make higher safety standards possible. And expectations of greater safety on the part of the public demand further improvements. The challenge for the railway is to deliver these 
defaultat a
defaultn
default 
defaultacceptable 
defaultprice
default,
default both 
defaultin terms of the capital costs involved and (often) reduced railway efficiency and convenience for road users. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRep
defaultlacing level crossings with 
defaultroad 
defaultbridges/underpasses has economic benefits for both local communities and the railway, but the predominant benefit is on the non-railway side. 
defaultUninterrupt
defaulted road-traffic flows and reduced delays are the principal benefits on
default the “road” side. Reduced maintenance 
defaultand staff 
defaultcosts and (marginally) increased railway capacity (by eliminating train-speed restrictions necessitated by level crossings) are the principal benefits to the railways. One of the challenges we face in improvi
defaultng level crossing safety is ensuring that those who benefit make an appropriate contribution to the costs of improvements. 
defaultThe option of simply eliminating level crossings – particularly where there are already convenient alternative routes over/under the
default railway – is frequently cost-effective but can be controversial. An example was reported recently:
defaultThe Aristotle Lane footpath level crossing in Oxford has been the subject of a determined resistance to the closure of the level crossing on safety grounds.
default Despite an alternative route via a nearby over-bridge, closure of the crossing was not secured through the public inquiry into the upgrading of the Oxford-Bicester railway. Now, because Network Rail and Chiltern Railways (the principal beneficiary of the 
defaultupgrade) continue to maintain that closure is necessary on safety grounds, one of those opposed to closure has submitted a planning application for an additional track across Aristotle Lane level crossing. This is to force the planners to face up to his po
defaultint of view that planning permission is required for the works proposed by Chiltern Railways and Network Rail.(Source: LXInfo.org 2 September 2013)
defaultDespite 
defaultsuch
default challenges, Network Rail is reported
default to have closed 700 level crossings since 2009, with 11
default7 c
defaultrossings closed in 2012/13. 
defaultPACTS believes that the established rights and reasonable needs of the public and business should be properly considered when closure of a level crossing is contemplated. Closure should not be seen 
defaultas an easy option. On the whole, however, the procedures currently seem to make closure a difficult 
defaultand protracted option and local authorities which 
defaultwould
default 
defaulttend
default to err on the side of safety with respect to roads, 
defaultmay oppose closure of level crossings. 
defaultLev
defaultel crossings vary in type and the risks associated with each location may also vary. As such, a variety of methods will be required to improve safety across the network. 
defaultAnnex 1 details the various types of level crossing in use.
default 
defaultSafety risk can be reduce
defaultd by “upgrading” the crossing type from, for example, an automatic open crossing to an automatic half-barrier crossing.
default 
defaultBut “upgrading” is not necessarily cost-effective. 
defaultIt
default can be expensive, and the expense disproportionate to the risk reduction achieved.
default Reducing the costs associated with upgrading by, for example, greater standardisation 
defaultand improved project management, 
defaultwould be helpful.
defaultThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch suggests that at some locations there may be comparatively inexpensive measures
default which could improve level crossing safety. Its 2012 Annual Report
default 
defaultidentified a range of local factors that might influence (i.e. have the potential to improve) the behaviour of crossing users. These include:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultlocal obstructions to the sighting of trains;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultenvironmental conditions such as traffic noise and visibility at night;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultgates left open at user-worked crossings;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultanxiety to cross the line to catch a train (station crossings);
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultvisibility of road traffic signals (e.g. impact of glare from sunlight); and
default•
default 
default              
defaultthe audibility of train horns.
default&#xa0;
defaultKnowing the specific local conditions, circumstances and user
default behaviour
default can be important. In this respect the appointment by Network Rail of dedicated level crossing managers is a welcome development. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork Rail 
defaultcontrols 
defaulta very large budget
default – almost £30bn for CP5
default. 
defaultHowever, it
default is under considerable pressure from the Government, ORR and others to deliver the requirements of Rail

default Investment 
defaultPlan
default while also improving efficiency. 
defaultSome 
default£6
default7m 
defaulthas 
defaultbeen allocated 
defaultsome for level 
defaultcrossing
default safety.
default Within the context of the CP5 settleme
defaultnt, given the number of fatalities each year and the potential for catastrophic failure, PACTS feels this level of investment in level crossing safety is about right. 
defaultThe mainline railway uses sophisticated models to understand the risks it manages and to
default prioritise risk reduction. 
defaultWe would urge the Government to bear in mind the relative levels of risk across the modes in determining policy and investment levels. 
defaultBecause most accidents at level crossings result from user behaviour (such as misjudgements, errors and wilful misuse) rather than technical or engineering failures, it is not self-evident that major expenditure on technical improvements will significantly
default reduce risk. 
defaultGetting a better understandi
defaultng of the reasons for user 
defaultbehaviour is essential. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch’s (RAIB’s) continuing investigations into level crossing accidents provide a good basis for action. RAIB’s Chief Inspector 
defaulthas observed
default that the RAIB has “
defaultmade repeated recommendations concerning realistic and rigorous assessment of the risks at individual crossings; understanding the local and human factors that may influence the risk to the users, and the implementation of 
defaultimprovements identified during risk assessments and inspections. Not all our recommendations require a long lead time or significant resource. I urge both Network Rail and RSSB, who are carrying out related research on crossings, to review the resources co
defaultmmitted to this work and wherever possible ensure that the individual elements of their programmes that will address these risks are completed at the very earliest opportunity.”
defaultThe 
defaultRSSB
default has a significant research programme, funded by the Department for Tr
defaultansport, into these issues.
default 
defaultResearch published in 2011 investigated the signs, signals, markings and other road design elements that best convey the information road users need when approaching public road level crossings. 
defaultThe second phase of this research
default will be published in May 2014. 
defaultCurrent research projects 
defaultinclude one addressing the signage provided at private level crossings and another addressing the causes of pedestrian accidents at level crossings and potential solutions
default.
default 
defaultWe believe it important 
defaultthat this research is expedited and translated into practical action as soon as practicable.
defaultNetwork Rail is reported to be on course to deliver a 25% reduction level crossi
defaultng risk between 2009 and 2014.
default 
defaultWe understand that the company is committed 
defaultto achieving further risk reduction
defaults
default 
defaultafter 2014.
default 
defaultIt is apparent that 
defaultNetwork Rail
default has increased its management focus on this issue and has allocated increased resources accordingly
default. 
defaultWith so many level crossings and the inherent risks asso
defaultciat
defaulted
default with
default many of them, the test will be whether Network Rail can sustain its focus and 
defaulteffective management. 
defaultLevel crossing risk is not only a matter for Network Rail and the communities near le
defaultvel crossings on the national network. There are level crossings on heritage and light railways that require a similarly robust approach to risk management.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have already drawn attention, in our response to question 1, to what the ORR’s annual health and safety report says about Network Rail’s management of level crossing risk. T
defaulthe report includes few details of the means by which the Regulator reached its views, and it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about either the extent or effectiveness of its regulatory actions.
defaultThe ORR’s policy in respect of level crossings is se
defaultt out in its Railway Safety Publication 7
default. The policy says that 
defaultORR seeks to influence duty holders and others to reduce risk at Britain’s level crossings through means ranging from advice to formal enforcement action. ORR checks that preventive and 
defaultprotective measures are implemented. The ORR says that risk control should, where practicable, be achieved through eliminating level crossings in favour of bridges, underpasses or diversions. Where elimination is not possible, ORR aims to ensure that duty 
defaultholders reduce risk so far as is reasonably practicable
default. 
defaultThe ORR acknowledges its role in providing clear advice and enforcing relevant legislation – including that which relates to level crossings. The ORR exercises the powers of the Secretary of State 
defaultfor Transport in making level crossing orders under the Level Crossings Act 1983. 
defaultThe ORR takes the view that it is neither effective nor efficient for rail companies 
defaultalone 
defaultto be responsible for managing safety at level crossings. 
defaultIt
default say
defaults
default that decisions a
defaultbout level crossings should involve rail companies, traffic authorities and other relevant organisations as early on as possible. Relevant authorities should recognise the wider benefits that safety improvements at level crossings (for example, replacing t
defaulthem with bridges) can bring about, particularly for road users. If wider benefits can be achieved, the appropriate funding bodies should agree on how the costs of making safety improvements will be met. 
defaultThe ORR is also committed to helping people understa
defaultnd the importance of the safe use of level crossings. The guidance ‘Using Level Crossings Safely’ is available on ORR’s website. 
defaultWe are unaware of any 
defaultspecific 
defaultrecent statement of Government policy in respect of level crossing
default safety. It is not mentioned,
default for example, in the March 2013 Command Paper “Reforming our Railways”. W
defaulte note that the Government’s high-level output specification (HLOS) for 2014-19 allocates £67m for level crossing improvements and closures
default.
default 
defaultThough little in the context of overall Go
defaultvernment expenditure on railways, we believe it significant that 
defaultlevel crossings have been singled out for investment.
defaultThis issue has been investigated jointly by the Law Commission and the S
defaultcottish Law Commission. 
defaultThey published a
default consultation paper, containin
defaultg proposals for law reform, 
defaultin July 2010.
defaultThe provisional proposals put forward in the consultation paper represented the Commissions’ initial view about how the law should be reformed
default.
default 
defaultThe two
default Commission
defaults
default then approved the instruction of Parliamentary Counsel to prepare a draft Bill and Regulations under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, to give effect to their proposals.
defaultAccording to the Law Commission’s website, Parliamentary
default Counsel have drafted a Bill and Regulations, and the Commissions are in the final stages of drafting a report which contains detailed recommendations, together with explanatory notes for the Bill and Regulations, an analysis of the consultation responses 
defaultreceived and an economic impact assessment.
defaultOur expectation is that the Law Commissions’ report will recommend sweeping away
default and/or updating
default much, if not all, of the existing legislation governing level crossings. We hope that the revised legislative approach will encourage greater collaboration between rail and road authorities in managing level crossing risk. We are, though, concerned at the
default time that has elapsed since the Law Commissions’ consultation exercise, and trust that their final report will emerge very soon.
defaultNetwork Rail has done much to publicise the risks 
defaultassociated with level crossings.
default 
defaultIn addition to television advertisements, they have provided educational resources for use in both primary and secondary schools, and are currently running a campaign aimed at young people.
default 
defaultWe understand that analysis of N
defaultetwork Rail’s television campaigns showed that they were successful in increasing public awareness of the issue.
default 
defaultAssessing the effectiveness of such campaigns
default is much harder.
default 
defaultWe know of no clear evidence on the extent to which increased public awareness of
default a safety issue results in changed behaviour or improved safety.
default 
defaultWe suggest that the Network Rail work with the road safety professionals in DfT, including the THINK! team, in local authorities, the emergency services and elsewhere, who have experience of
default road user safety campaigns. Many of the messages and techniques relevant to level crossing safety will be applicable to road safety. These other authorities must share the responsibility for level crossing safety, even if the expenditure comes from Networ
defaultk Rail. 
defaultThe mechanisms by which Network Rail, and other railway operators, become aware of land-use changes in the vicinity of level crossings need to be robust. Planning authorities need to recognise circumstances where new developments might increase pe
defaultdestrian, cycle or road vehicle use of level crossings, and take steps to alert the railway companies involved.
