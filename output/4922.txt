[[[THE POLAND-UK PROTOCOL]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“It will be clear the UK Protocol does not in any way constitute an ‘opt-out’ in the sense of trying to disapply certain rights to UK citizens.  That would be neither necessary nor desirable given that the UK fully accepts the rights reaffirmed in the Charter.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“Although the Protocol is in terms that are specific to the United Kingdom and Poland, it does no more than set out some of the implications of the way in which EU law gives effect to the Charter.  So every proposition in the Charter, although it only refers to the United Kingdom and Poland, is equally true for every other Member State.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;As such, the Protocol may be not only of comfort but of practical use to any party seeking to avoid an expansive interpretation of the Charter. &#xa0;

[[[COMPETENCE CREEP?]]]&#xa0;        

[[[Application to national rules]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“the rubric, ‘implementing Union law’, is to be interpreted broadly and, in effect, means whenever a member state is acting ‘within the material scope of EU law’”.&#xa0;It is well established that a State acts within the scope of EU law, in particular, when availing itself of one of the permitted derogations from freedoms such as the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services.  There have been pre-Charter cases in which the general principle of fundamental rights was given a remarkably wide application under that doctrine.&#xa0;&#xa0;“the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter must .. be complied with where national legislation falls within the scope of European Union law”,&#xa0;noting at para 23 that the provisions of the Charter “are not to extend in any way the competences of the European Union as defined in the Treaties” and that the Charter “does not extend the field of application of European Union law beyond the powers of the European Union or establish any new power or task for the European Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties”.  The United Kingdom did not intervene in the case, as it could have done had it wished to join the Commission and five other Member States in contesting the application of the Charter.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Title IV rights]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“In particular and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.”&#xa0;

[[[CONCLUSION]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014                                          &#xa0;&#xa0;               The Charter of Fundamental Rights: History and Prospects in post-Lisbon Europe http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1953619                [2012] 1 WLR 3333, paras 26-28.               UKEAT/0401/12/GE, 4 October 2013.               Case 63/83, [1984] ECR 2689.               The duty of national courts to set aside even national primary legislation that contravenes EU Treaty law or the general principles of law has been clear for longer still: see, e.g., Case 106/77 Simmenthal [1978] ECR 629, which inspired the Factortame (Spanish Fishermen) litigation in the late 1980s.               “Mr. Blair’s final appearance on the European stage produced a clear negotiating success as Britain won a legally-binding opt-out from the controversial charter”: Daily Mail, 23 June 2007; “EU chiefs have agreed to give Britain an opt-out on the Charter of Fundamental Rights”: News of the World, 24 June 2007.                Prof. Catherine Barnard (Trinity College Cambridge), “The ‘Opt-Out’ for the UK and Poland from the Charter of Fundamental Rights: Triumph of Rhetoric over Reality”?, EUI conference, Florence, April 2010.               House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, Report of 27 November 2007, paras 30-31.               “The Charter of Fundamental Rights”, speech to BIICL, 15 January 2008.               “The Charter of Fundamental Rights” (2010) 4 EHRLR 349-359 at 355.               Joined Cases C-411/10 and C-493/10 NS and others v SSHD, 21 December 2011, para 119.  The Government had argued to the contrary in the High Court, but wisely conceded the point on appeal and before the ECJ.               R (AB) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 3453 (Admin), paras 9-16.  Mostyn J’s misapprehension seems to have been widely shared (though not by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice) in the House of Commons debate of 19 November 2013, Hansard cols 1087-1094.               Prof. Barnard, fn 7 above.               At para 119.               Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano, Opinion of 30 September 2010, para 172.  Sharpston AG’s suggestion, that the application of EU fundamental rights should be dependent solely on the existence of exclusive or shared EU competence, whether or not exercised, was not taken up by the Court.                RFU v Consolidated Information Services Ltd. [2012] UKSC 55, para 28.               Notably Case C-60/00 Carpenter [2002] ECR I-6279, in which it was held that the deportation of a third-country national had to comply with EU fundamental rights because of its incidental effect on occasional cross-frontier service provision by the deportee’s husband.                Judgment of 26 February 2013,                Sweden, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.               The Federal Constitutional Court laid down a marker by indicating (at least in the press release accompanying its judgment) that it will interpret the judgment as limited to VAT: Press Release 31/2013 of 24 April 2013.
