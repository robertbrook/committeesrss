[normal]As far as it is I'm concerned it's an equal playing field. Women get just the same opportunities as men and are treated just the same - it's up to them - if they're good they'll get on but at the moment there aren't enough good women.

[normal]If you give (women) a task they will do it …you say … I think we should do this, or there’s a problem and we’re going to tr

[normal] I don’t see how I can stay when I feel like I’m being held back but I don’t know where to go.
