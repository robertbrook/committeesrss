default&#xa0;
defaultThe Torbay Line Rail Users Group is a cross-party group who have been working for more than ten years to improve rail services to and from To
defaultrbay for long distance, regional and local travel.  Torbay is a unitary authority of three towns, Torquay, Paignton and Brixham.  It is
default the second largest conurbation
default west of Bristol, 
defaultwith a resident
default and increasing 
default population of 135,000,  
defaultsecond only to P
defaultlym
defaultouth and larger than Exeter.  It is one o
defaultf
default the most important tourist resorts in Britain with outstanding cultural resources.  It has
default well over 
defaultone million staying visitors and 
defaultthree
default million day visitors each year.    The most important industry is tour
defaultism.  For a conurbation
default of 
default this size, the inadequacy of its rail services make it an isolated community, isolated from neighbouring towns and areas;  the 
defaultlack
default of 
default many 
defaultevening and Sunday bus services make most areas of the conurbation isolated.

defaultTorbay’s Industries, Businesses and Services

default 1. Tourism is Torbay’s biggest industry contributing roug
defaulth
defaultly one third of the income and one third of the employment in the area.  This industry depends 
defaulton 
defaultgood rail services.   Existing services are not adequate for the number of passengers and there are not enough direct trains.
default  Passengers do not like changing trains as the results of surveys both by Passenger Focus and by
default the
default Torbay Line Rail 
defaultUsers Group
default 
default(TLRUG) have shown.     Services should run daily, Mondays to Sundays, throughout the year

default.  Torbay is a large urban area
default where there is much activity and much more planned, some of which is already 
defaultpartially implemented
default.   The urban area is however effectively isolated by the inadequacy the existing public transport on which visitors as well as residents depend

default Newton Abbot
default, Plymo
defaultuth, Gunnislake, Exeter St Davids, Exeter Central, Exmouth, Crediton

defaultday
default 
defaultor evening visits – in short for
default education, employment, 
defaultbusiness, leisure 
defaultand a wide range of cultural and other activities
default. 
default 
defaultIn practice, only visits to Newton Abbot and to some extent Exeter fall within this category.  
default9.  This is not the result of a sh
defaultortage of trains, but of their timing, the lack of direct trains, good connections and of frequent trains in the evenings, al
defaultthough there are often more trains on summer Saturdays. 
default   
defaultTorbay
default is

defaultother areas
default and they are isolated from Torbay
default, a
default serious disadvantage for Torbay’s tourist trade.
default10.
default  
defaultAll trains from Paignton, the end of the line in Torbay, must pass through Newton Abbot, whatever their further destination.  Of the 30 trains that depart from Paignton on Mondays to Fridays, two leave
default at 15 minutes past the hour, eight leave at 15
default 
defaultminutes past plus or minus five minutes; another four leave plus or minus ten minutes – which could involve a wait of 20 minutes.  The gaps between trains are very erratic: eight are of 50 to 59 minutes, and 
defaultanother six of 40 to 49 minutes.  These big gaps are unpredictable.  The timetable is so erratic that would-be passengers are effectively discouraged from using the trains.
default              
default11
default.  Long distance trains 
defaultto
default London Paddington
default and to Manchester, 
defaultthe Midlands and North of England are slotted erratically in between the erratic local trains.  
defaultP
defaultassengers to 
defaultor from 
defaultsuch destinations 
defaultare likely to check train times in advance.
default12
default.  Trains 
defaultbetween
default Torbay 
defaultand
default Plymouth are wanted and needed.  Sixty four p
defaulter cent of respondents to a
default small survey or poll run by
default TLRUG gave this as their most desired improvement.  There are no direct trains between Torbay and Plymouth and connections are few.
default  A
defaultny journey between Torbay and Plymouth 
defaulttakes 15 minutes between Pa
defaultignton and  Newton Abbot and 40 minutes between  Newton Abbot and Plymouth
default.  
defaultT
defaulthe timetable
defaults
default for Mondays to Fridays
default show that ‘
defaultc
defaultonnections’  between -3 or -1 minute (the onward train departs 3 minutes or one minute before the train from Torbay arrive
defaults
default)  or
default one minute (catch-it-if-you-run-fast)  and a wait of up to 44 minutes.  
defaultNine
default connections involve waits of 
default10 minutes or less
default and eight waits of 1
default1
default - 2
default0
default minutes
default;  waits of 20 minutes can add 40 minutes to a return journey, a considerable addition to a 
defaultdaily commute
default.  All the rest are longer.   Woe betide  the commuter who takes the 8.23 from Paignton arriving at Newton Abbot at 8.39; the next train to Plymouth arrives at 9.57, a wait of  1 hour and 18 minutes, the more galling because the previous train
default leaves Newton Abbot at 8.35, four minutes earlier.   There are other gaps in the timetable
default when there are no sensible connections.  Connections between Plymouth and Torbay
default 
defaultand on Saturdays and Sundays show similar patterns and are of  very limited value t
defaulto those making either regular or occasional journeys.
default1
default3
default.  
defaultThere are 
default30 trains 
defaultbetween 
default Torbay/Paignton 
defaultand 
default Newton Abbot, 
defaultand
default 
default42 between Newton Abbot and  Plymouth
default on Mondays to Fridays
default.  Similar difficulties exist on Saturdays and Sundays.  Surely someth
defaulting better can be arranged.  This capricious timetable drives would-be passengers of
defaultf
default 
default 
defaultthe trains.    A first step
default c
defaultould 
defaultbe to issue a pocket  timetable showing what reasonable connections were available.  This would show up the gaps and
default 
default assist the develo
defaultpment of a regular half-hourly service throug
defaulthout the day in  
defaulteach
default direc
defaulttion
default.
default1
default4
default.
default  In  view of these difficulties, it is hardly surprising that of the 658 Torbay residents who commute to Plymouth
default for their work
default, only 23 do so by train
default;  518 travel by car,
default 27 as passengers in a car
default and 26 by bus;
default the bus takes two hours, as against a possible 55 minutes by train if only there were a direct train.
default  
defaultOf the 487 who commute from Plymouth to Torbay, only three do so by train; 
default 
default376 commute by car, 23 as passenger
defaults,  six by bus and 
defaulteight
default by motorcycle.
default15.  Trains to Gunnislake
default (the Tamar Valley line)
default depart from Plymouth every two hours usually at 54 minutes past the hour.  In view of the increase
default of 45% 
default in the 
defaultnumber of passengers since 2006, 
default a more frequent se
defaultrvice 
defaultsh
defaultould be considered.  
default  
default 1
default6
default.
default  Of the 30 trains from Paignton, 29 go to
default Newton Abbot,
default then
default Exeter St Davids, the
default 
default station for c
defaulthanging
default for other destinations 
default 
defaultand  
default for 
defaultthe
default University
default.  The 16  local trains stop at every station between Paignton and
default Exmouth and take about one hour to go from Paignton to Exeter St Davids.  Eight long distance trains go from Paignton to Exeter St Davids and then to London
default or 
defaultManchester, 
defaultthe Midlands 
defaultor the
default North
default.
default  Only the local trains go to Exeter Central,
default  the neares
defaultt for offices,  shopping and the many cultural resources of the city.
default              
default17
default.
default  Exmouth enjoys a half-hourly service to Exeter Central and Exeter St Davids.  This is made up of the roughly hourly service from Paignton 
default to Exmouth 
defaultand the hourly direct service 
defaultfrom Barnstaple (the Tarka line)
default to  Exmouth
default.  
defaultTorbay
default has twice the population of Exmouth and Barnstaple put together.  Surely Paignton should have at least a h
defaultalf-hourly local service to the centre of Exeter.  Both the Exmouth and the Barnstaple lines are
default 
defaultvery successful and extremely well used.  Figures given by First Great Western
default showed that journeys on the Exmouth (Avocet) line numbered 1.4million in 2012 and had increased by 10% and on the Barnstaple line by 78% since 2006.  A more frequent service f
defaultrom Barnstaple could help fill the gaps in the timetable between Paignton  and Exeter St Davids and between Torbay and Plymouth.
default1
default8
default. 
default  If additional trains from Barnstaple ran to Paignton, they could give 
defaulta half-hourly service between Paignton and  Exeter 
defaultSt Davids, filling gaps in the timetable,  give 
defaultconnectivity 
defaultand direct services between Torbay and Crediton and the other stations on the Barnstaple line
default.  
default1
default9
default.  Passenger
defaults
default 
default to Honiton and 
default the 
default stations
default on the way
default – Exeter Central, Pinhoe, Whimple, Feniton -
default from Exeter St Davids 
default must
default 
defaultchange  platforms for the hourly service, alternately fast trains, journey time  24 minutes, or slow train
default,
default 31 minutes stopping at every station.  This 
defaultis part of the line
default to London 
defaultWaterloo and needs doubling  
defaultthroughout
default 
defaultits
default length.  This service 
defaultused to run
default to Paignton
default, but was stopped at Exeter St Davids in December 2009
default.  
default  It should 
defaultbe re-instated
default to Paignton
default.  
defaultIf it were, more gaps in the services to Torbay would be filled
default.
default20
default. 
default 
defaultThere are three direct trains from London Paddington.  The DfT helpfully suggested at one stage in the preparation for the cancelled bid for the Great Western franchise that a lunch-time IEP should be extended 
defaultto Paignton.  This should certainly be implem
defaultented and would provide four trains conveniently spaced through the day.
default21
default.  
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultonly
default direct train from the north of England to Paignton
default runs on Saturdays 
default.  This is a serious disadvantage for business travellers and tourists.  We wish to suggest that on 
defaultMonday
defaults
default to Friday
defaults and Sundays
default,
default the
default 
default0
default6.06 from Edinburgh 
defaultshould be diverted from 
defaultPlymouth
default to Paignton.  
defaultT
defaulthe 06.06
default.
default makes several 
defaultcalls
default before arriving
default 
defaultat Exeter at 13.44, Newton Abbot at 14.04, Totnes at 14.14
default and Plymouth at 14.46
default 
default.  
defaultPassengers
default 
defaultfor Torbay
default change at Newton Abbot and arrive 
defaultin 
defaultPaignton at 15.00
default.  
defaultIf this train w
defaultere
default diverted to Paignton passengers would arrive Paignton at about 14.24
default,
default 
default 35 minutes earlier.  
defaultPassengers for Plymouth could change at Exeter
default on Newton Abbot 
defaultfor a First Great Wester
defaultn service 
defaultarriving at
default Plymouth at 15.00
default,
default 14 minutes later than they otherwise would have done.  
defaultOn the return , the 
defaulttrain departs
default from 
default Plymouth at 15.24
default,
default calling at Newton Abbot at 16.01,
default  
defaultA
default local service leav
defaultes 
default Plymouth at 15.08 arriving 
defaultat 
defaultNewton Abbot
default at 15.52
default.  
default 
defaultIf the
default Crosscountry
default train w
defaultere
default diverted to Paignton it could leave Paignton about 15.40
default/15.45 
default arriving
default at
default Newton Abbot at 16.01. 
defaultand continuing 
default as
default currently
default scheduled to Leeds.
default  
defaultDiverting this train would provide a conveniently timed train providing direct service between the North East, Yorkshire and Torbay. 
default  This change would provide a service comparable to that on Saturdays.
default22.  Coaches between Torbay and London run daily but
default take six hours, nearly twice the time taken by the train
default.  There is also one coach daily 
defaultbetween
default Paignton 
defaultand
default Newcastle, Bradford/Leeds and Rugby respectively.
default23
default.  
defaultIf t
defaulthe line 
defaultwer
defaulte extended from Paignton to Goodrington
default it would
default serve developments at Long Park/White Rock on the western side of Paignton.  These include housing
default  (16,000-20,000 people)
default, the development and work of the South Devon College and its Energy Centre, business developments and also better connectivity with 
defaultBrixham.  Access to this side of Paignton is difficult along congested roads with heavy traffic and many pedestrians.
default24.  
defaultThe 
defaultH
defaulteritage 
defaultline 
defaultruns 
defaultfrom Paignton to Kingswear and the ferry to Dartmouth, another outstanding
default  
defaulttown attract
defaulting
default 
default many visitors, wi
defaultth stations serving residential areas along its line.  The company runs excellent heritage trips for leisure visitors chiefly in the spring, summer and early autumn months and a few at bank holidays.

default.  We believe 
defaultthat
default 
default if commuter trai
defaultns could run on 
defaulttheir tracks
default,
default 
default students
default would be able
default to reach the South Devon College easily and commuters get to their jobs.  Commuting journeys outside the times used by the 
defaultH
defaulteritage railway would not interfere with the latter’s use of the tracks, but would provide a v
defaultery valuable service to many people.  Such a development could provide better connectivity to Kingsbridge
default,

default, which are without stations and tracks.

defaultBetween

default27.  
defaultO
defaultther services
default run 
defaultless frequently
default and
default rarely or  
defaultnot at all in the evenings or on Sundays.  This means that for those living in 
defaultmost of Torbay
default,  no public tr
defaultansport is available for evening or Sunda
defaulty activities;  these residents 
defaultand visitors are 
defaultisolated and 
defaultdependent on paying for taxis or cadging lifts
default - 
default which can be embarrassing for both parties.
default28.  
defaultAccess to and from other parts of the county are diffic
defaultult and normally depend on making connections at Exeter, Plymouth
default, or another town.    Some services do not run every day, for example from a village to a town for a shopping expedition, so of no use to someone wishing to visit a village or a friend or rel
defaultative there.  Some services run only one to four trips daily,
default excluding evenings and Sundays,
default so making possible difficulties in making return trips for whatever purpose, whether work, education, for hospital visits 
defaultor similar reasons or
default 
default visit
defaults to
default friends
default or relatives.  These difficulties arise both for those coming to Torbay and for those going from Torbay.
default  It can be impossible to make a daytime return visit, still more to make an evening visit. 
default&#xa0;
defaultResilience
default              
default29.  
defaultFor
default resilience, not only is the Teign Valley line or an equivalent required, but also the re-establishment of the former rout
defaulte via Okehampton – Tavistock – Plymouth.  A first stage would be the re-establishment of a regular daily service between Exeter and Ok
defaultehampton, particularly useful as a result of the recent closure of  several businesses and consequent increase in unemployment in Okehampton.  The line from Tavistock to Bere Alston and Plymouth is already 
defaultwell advanced
default.  This leaves only the gap between O
defaultkehampton and Tavistock to be re-established.  
default              
default30.  In view of the increasing number of rail passengers and of older people who are less likely to drive, and of the need to reduce emissions from vehicles 
defaultto meet the Government’s targets for climate chang
defaulte,
default  provision should be made by regulation, or if necessary by legislation, to safeguard 
defaultthe track of 
defaultformer rail lines, so that they remain avail
defaultable 
defaultto be brought back into use.
