"&#xa0;\nThe 4 Parishes BOATs Joint Committee – Written evidence&#xa0;\nWe would like to propose the following:\n&#xa0;\n1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognized as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restrict Byways.\n&#xa0;\nIn support of this statement are three photographs showing how recreational motorised vehicles have made the route so pitted and rutted that the recreational drivers deface a dry stone-wall by placing the top coping stones into the bottom of the ruts.  Taken on BOAT No 38, NY95NW. 93.6 x 56.2\n&#xa0;\n2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.\n&#xa0;\nLastly we support the formal submissions made by GLEAM, by GLPG, by PDGLA and by YDGLA.\n&#xa0;\n2 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
