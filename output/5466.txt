[[[SELECT COMMITTEE MEETING MONDAY 20]]]

[[[TH]]]

[[[ JANUARY 2014]]]&#xa0;I saw the select committee interview on Monday 20th January of the minister Stephen Williams MP and Bob Ledsome his senior civil servant.&#xa0;I heard the minister say that where work is carried out by less than skilled people the Qualified Supervisor (QS) goes along at the end of the job and inspects and test the work and “signs it off”. It would appear that Mr Blackman thinks this also from what he said, along with other members of the select committee. &#xa0;For the information of the committee and for the avoidance of doubt I can say with absolute certainty that is NOT CORRECT. There is no requirement for the QS to visit the premises and inspect and test the work regardless of who the work was done by. The only requirement is for the QS to review the paperwork (the Electrical Installation Certificate) and to countersign it.&#xa0; The QS in medium and large companies often sits in an office and rarely goes to site. In addition the QS only has to have a minimal technical qualification to do this. I cannot understand why the committee has not already been told this. At best I think the minister was badly briefed and based his answer on an assumption.&#xa0;The lack of a specific requirement for the installation to be inspected and tested by a 

[[[qualified]]] competent person before being put in to service is a fundamental flaw in the Part P scheme. The QS scheme has no merit.&#xa0;The committee has also heard an awful lot about the requirement for the QS to meet the requirements of the Minimum Technical Competence in the EAS document. This is only for new QSs and the EAS document has built in loop holes for persons lacking a Level 3 qualification to Inspect and Test to be exempted. In addition there is no requirement for all those persons who are already QSs, a lot of who are “5 day wonders”, to upgrade to the new technical standards. Perhaps Certshure and NAPIT could be asked how many of their approved companies have QSs with a Level 3 qualification in Inspecting and Testing out of the total number of QSs they have registered.&#xa0;The Electrical Safety Council say on their web site, “The ESC strongly recommends that, wherever you live, you use a registered electrician to do any electrical installation work that you need&#xa0;“.Perhaps they could be asked when are they going to put those fine words in to action and deliver a scheme to the public through the companies they own, or are in partnership with. &#xa0;You already have written evidence from me so you will already have my brief CV.&#xa0;23 January 2014&#xa0;
