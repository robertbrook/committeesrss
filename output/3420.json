"&#xa0;\nOil &amp; Gas UK – Written evidence&#xa0;Oil &amp; Gas UK’s comment on draft Deregulation Bill&#xa0;IntroductionOil &amp; Gas UK is the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the United Kingdom, with more than \n390\n member companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, supplie\nrs, law firms and consultants.\nWe welcome th\nis\n opportunity to \nrespond to the Deregulation Bill that has been drafted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses\n.\nAs a trade association for the UK’s offshore oil and gas industry, our \ncomments address Clause 28 of the Deregulation Bill and reflect the views of our members.\n&#xa0;Summary of key pointsOur members did not take issue with the principle behind the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Act and no concerns were expressed about Model Clauses being implemented in a “document to be published by the Secretary of State” as opposed to regulations. However, the below comments were made:\n&#xa0;Questions&#xa0;&#xa0;Oil &amp; Gas UK positionWhilst there is not necessarily a concern about Model Clauses being implemented in a “document to be published by the Secretary of State” as opposed to regulations, the Bill is unclear as to the process by which Model Clauses will be introduced and scrutinised in future. Members were keen to understand, in particular, what ability the industry will have to comment on any proposed amendments or new editions before they are published and come into effect.\nIt was proposed that a period of consultation should be required.  The process to be followed for any document published outside of the regulations would need to be given due consideration and developed.\nAnother concern was whether such a process could tend towards individual licences having individually negotiated terms (the Bill seems to leave this possibility open although it is assumed this is not the intent).  The view of Oil &amp; Gas UK is that this should not be the case on grounds of lack of transparency and administrative complexity and should be expressly addressed in the legislation.\nBelow is a summary of the opinions of our members.\n&#xa0;Member OneWe do not see any reason why model clauses should continue to be issued in regulation form only, particularly now that the applicable model clauses are set out in full within each licence and the regulation is not required as a point of reference.   Therefore, we do not have an issue with the principle behind the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Act. \nHowever, we do believe that the current proposals are too vague as no further information is given on what form the model clauses will take if not set out in regulation and what the new process will be for issuing such model clauses. It may be appropriate for the process to be governed by legislation even if the model clauses themselves are not.  If the process is to be contained in legislation, this could also be effected by an amendment to the Petroleum Act introduced by the Deregulation Bill.\nWe would therefore recommend that the change should not be introduced in the Deregulation Bill unless and until the new process for introducing model clauses other than by regulation has been agreed.  The issues should be considered at the same time – it does not seem appropriate to make the suggested change now and consider the details of what form the model clauses will take and the new process for agreeing them at a later stage. \nTo summarise, we believe that the industry should not support this amendment without more detailed proposals also being made as to new form of model clauses and the process for agreeing such model clauses going forward.  If it is the case that the Government already has proposals on these issues, those proposals should be shared with industry as soon as possible.\nWe have a further concern as to the volume of model clauses that this could lead to and how often the model clauses will be amended.  It would be preferable to maintain a good level of uniformity across licences.  If the Secretary of State is able to issue model clauses out with regulation, will this lead to a larger volume of model clauses being used at any one time?\nThis should also be considered alongside the process for issuing new model clauses and restrictions on how often new model clauses can be introduced by the Secretary of State may be required.  It may be appropriate for there to be one or more sets of model clauses issued for each Licensing Round. The proposed model clauses for that Licensing Round could then be released at the same time as the Licensing Round is announced (e.g. one set of model clauses per type of licence).\n&#xa0;\nMember twoWe\n agree with your assessment that it is unclear as to how model clauses will be introduced / scrutinised and that industry should have the ability to comment on proposed amendments.  The wording does also appear to leave it open for individual licence terms to be negotiated, which \nwe\n agree should not be the case.\n&#xa0;\nMember threeOverall, there is a benefit to speed up the legislative process and thereby allow Secretary of State published documents as opposed to \nregulations\n. However, it is important to have clarity and transparency around the process concerning a simplified process on Model Clause which with the draft Bill is difficult to foresee, both concerning possibility to influence by the industry and how such clauses could be applied individually.\n&#xa0;\nMember four (\nwith suggested \namendment\n to the Clause\n)\n&#xa0;\nWe agree that some period of consultation is required. We are not sure what legal obligation exists for consultation about regulations (and suspect it’s part of the Contracting Out and Deregulation Act). In any event, we have suggested an amendment to s4(2)(B) - see above - to ensure that there will be no reduction in the level of consultation.\nWe also agree that DECC is unlikely to agree different clauses for different licences. Apart from the points you make, DECC will be concerned to treat applicants equally for fear of JR.\n&#xa0;\n“Model clauses in petroleum licences: procedural simplification(1) Section 4 of the Petroleum Act 1998 (which makes further provision about licences under Part 1 of that Act to search and bore for and get petroleum) is amended as follows.\n&#xa0;\n(2) In subsection (1), omit paragraph (e) (which requires the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations model clauses which, unless modified or excluded in a particular case, must be incorporated into licences granted under Part 1 of that Act).\n&#xa0;\n(3) In subsection (2), after “made” insert “under subsection (1)”.\n&#xa0;\n(4) After subsection (2) insert.\n&#xa0;\n“(2A) The Secretary of State must prescribe model clauses which, unless he thinks fit to modify or exclude them in any particular case, shall be incorporated in a licence granted under this Part.\n&#xa0;\n(2B) The duty under subsection (2A) may be discharged by.\n&#xa0;\n(a) prescribing model clauses by regulations; or\n(b) \nprescribing model clauses in a document published by the Secretary of State (following such consultation as would be required for regulations made under (a));&#xa0;\nand, in either case, different model clauses may be prescribed for different kinds of licence.\n&#xa0;\n(2C) Where the duty under subsection (2A) is at any time discharged by prescribing model clauses by regulations, the Secretary of State may subsequently discharge the duty by prescribing model clauses in a document (and the same applies vice versa).”\n&#xa0;\n(5) In subsection (3), for “such regulations” substitute “regulations under this Section”.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOil &amp; Gas UK\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n       November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
