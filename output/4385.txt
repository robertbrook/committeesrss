&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Bond Disability and Development group (DDG)&#xa0;Executive Summary1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is a critical moment for disability inclusion in development. The post-2015 process offers the opportunity to build a shared vision of development based on the principle that no intervention should be judged successful if it does not include and empower disabled women, men, girls and boys of all ages and ethnicities – and to make a reality of that vision by ensuring that disability is explicitly included as a core issue within the post-2015 global development framework.&#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We congratulate the UK government for playing a crucial role in getting disability on the post-2015 agenda, and we call on DFID to seize the moment, and to lead the way in disability inclusion. As a major actor in global development, DFID has the responsibility and the potential to take a leadership role in this area&#xa0;1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UK INGOs represented by DDG are united in our vision of what needs to be done, drawing on a broad range of experience and evidence of what works, and making specific recommendations for action to achieve disability inclusion in all aspects of DFID’s work.&#xa0;1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We call on DFID to make a public, 

[[[high level commitment]]] to include disabled people equitably in its work. In order to fulfill this commitment, we recommend the following action:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Build disability in to DFID’s strategic frameworks&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Appoint a Disability Champion&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Develop planning and accountability systems which promote disability inclusion&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Invest in learning and evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Promote the voice and participation of disabled people&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Bond Disability and Development Group (DDG) brings together UK-based mainstream and disability-specific organisations to ensure that disabled people’s concerns are addressed at the highest level. The member organisations of DDG represent a large body of experience based on direct work with disabled people and the disability movement in developing countries, as well as advocacy and policy engagement with service providers and policymakers. DDG is therefore able to draw on a broad and deep understanding of the barriers faced by disabled people of all ages, the links between disability and poverty, and the importance of including disability issues within the development process. &#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission represents a synthesis of the key messages emerging from DDG member organisations’ individual submissions to the IDSC, and we indicate where these can be referenced for greater detail on specific issues.  3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a growing understanding that development interventions will fail to reach the poorest unless disability issues and disabled people are included: Disability is increasingly recognised as a core development issue, not just because disabled people make up 15% of all populations, but because of the close links between disability, poverty, and exclusion (WHO/World Bank 2011, Mitra et al 2012), and evidence that the exclusion of disabled people from labour markets has a negative impact on economies in poorer countries (Buckup, ILO Report 2009).&#xa0;3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disability needs to be understood primarily as a social and human rights issue: It is the combination of discrimination with social and environmental barriers which excludes and marginalises disabled people, and which traps a disproportionate number in poverty (WHO/World Bank 2011). &#xa0;3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disabled people do not represent a homogenous group – disability is one of many intersecting factors (including age, gender, ethnicity etc.)  which combine to intensify social inequalities and marginalisation. And disability also interacts with other issues to influence development outcomes; for example, conflict and violence can create disability, while disability increases vulnerability in such contexts (HI submission). &#xa0;3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disability inclusion is about improving the quality rather than the quantity of UK aid and development programmes: An investment in disability inclusion represents value for money. For disability inclusion to be effective, political commitment needs to be supported with an investment of resources: AusAID spent £9.5m on disability in 2012/13 and has dedicated a further £10.6m for 2013/14. Mainstreaming disability from the start of a programme represents the best value for money e.g. by incorporating inclusive design in new infrastructure, and USAID has found that most modifications to ensure the inclusion of disabled people in mainstream projects can often be implemented without additional costs (USAID website 1.12.13.). 4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disability is finally emerging as a core issue within the international development debate, as reflected in the recent High Level Panel and Secretary General’s reports on the post-2015 Development Framework. These documents call for a transformative shift which ‘leaves no one behind’, they highlight the importance of disaggregating indicators to support this, and state that ‘no target should be considered met unless met for all social groups, including people with disabilities’.&#xa0;4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, these gains will not be secured until the final framework is agreed - continued pressure and vigilance will be needed to ensure that disability inclusion remains explicit and does not get lost or subsumed into general statements about ‘marginalised groups’ at the last moment. &#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK government has a duty in international law, under Article 32 of the UNCRPD, to ensure that all international cooperation including development programmes, is ‘inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities.’&#xa0;5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID has a good track record on its analysis of the importance of disability inclusion and was one of the first bilateral agencies to recognise the central importance of disability to development in its 2000 paper on Disability, Poverty and Development. This was followed in 2007 with the How to Note on Working on Disability in Country Programmes and various guidance notes on disability related issues. However this analysis and guidance is not well known within DFID, and has not translated into systematic inclusion practice across all programmes. &#xa0;5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is currently no DFID policy or strategy on disability, and there is no obligation for DFID programmes to demonstrate or monitor the inclusion of disabled people in their work, e.g. through the disaggregation of data by disability. As a result we do not even know whether disabled people benefit equitably from DFID’s aid and development programmes. However, DDG members’ experience and evidence of the barriers which exclude disabled people from all areas of life would suggest that, without targeted action to ensure inclusion, it is most probable that disabled people are not currently benefitting equitably within mainstream programmes. We do know that disability is not adequately reflected within strategic documents in other areas, such as the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls, and DFID’s work also lacks a focus on different needs across the life course and this has implications for disabled people’s inclusion, given the links between disability and ageing. &#xa0;5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID and UK parliamentarians have played a crucially important role in getting disability on the post-2015 agenda, and key individuals within DFID are currently championing disability inclusion, leading to positive initiatives such as the recent announcement that all schools built with DFID funding will be required to be physically accessible, including WASH services, and the commitment to work with partners globally to improve data and evidence. However, the institutional structures and systems are not in place to ensure that this current interest is embedded at all levels or sustained as individuals move on. &#xa0;6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Individual submissions are being made from DDG members and other allied UK INGOs, and these represent a rich source of evidence and experience relating to different aspects of disability inclusion in development, as summarised below. Each of these submissions makes recommendations relating to specific issues, and all have contributed to, and endorse, the overarching recommendations in this paper. &#xa0;6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HelpAge International, Age International and Alzheimer’s Disease International emphasise the need for a 

[[[lifecycle]]] approach to disability inclusion, and for specific attention to the barriers facing 

[[[older disabled people]]] in a context where global populations are ageing (Ageing in the 21st Century) and the number of older people with care needs is set to treble by 2050, with an increasing proportion in poorer countries (World Alzheimer Report 2013).&#xa0;6.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Submissions from Plan UK and AbleChildAfrica emphasise the importance of tackling the discrimination faced by disabled

[[[ children]]] and developing initiatives which address their developmental needs and promote their inclusion in mainstream service provision in order to avoid the negative cycle of exclusion and poverty. Leonard Cheshire Disability (LCD)’s experience demonstrates the value of initiatives which make 

[[[young disabled people]]] agents of their own change within development programmes. The value of joined-up, holistic approaches to 

[[[early childhood development]]] is illustrated by Sense, while approaches which tackle 

[[[violence]]] against disabled children are demonstrated by Plan UK.  Special attention is needed to achieve the inclusion of children with

[[[ intellectual disabilities ]]]or with

[[[ severe or complex disabilities: ]]]Sense International underlines the importance of working with stakeholders to develop specialist knowledge on developing communication, social, mobility and practical skills.&#xa0;6.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The importance of access to 

[[[education ]]]which responds to the needs of disabled children is crucial: Submissions from Plan UK, AbleChildAfrica, Global Campaign for Education (GCE)/ RESULTS UK, and Handicap International (HI) provide insights into this challenge, recognizing DFID’s efforts in this area, and analysing why these good intentions are not always translated into good practice on the ground. &#xa0;6.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  The double and sometimes triple discrimination faced by 

[[[disabled women/ older women and girls]]] is evidenced in the GADN Gender and Disability Working Group’s submission, which finds that gender focused policies and programmes often neglect the disability dimension, thereby further marginalising disabled women and girls.&#xa0;6.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HI and Sightsavers’ work emphasises the importance of access to 

[[[health]]] services including 

[[[rehabilitation]]] which is often perceived as a ‘luxury’ and woefully limited despite the transformative impact it can have on the lives of disabled people and their families. STOPAIDS provides evidence on the specific vulnerability of disabled people, and in particular disabled women and girls, to 

[[[HIV/AIDs]]], and the barriers they face to accessing information and support. &#xa0;6.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; WaterAid highlights how lack of accessible 

[[[WASH]]] (water, sanitation and hygiene) can impact on disabled people, particularly disabled women and girls for whom accessing WASH facilities can present additional challenges and vulnerability, and provides evidence of effective, low cost approaches to ensuring that disabled people are included in WASH programmes. &#xa0;6.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ADD International’s experience of working in alliance with disability rights movements emphasises the importance of disabled people’s 

[[[empowerment and participation]]] in development processes – not simply as beneficiaries, but as agents of their own development – and of the value of bringing the voice of disabled people into policymaking, governance and accountability processes by identifying and removing the barriers which exclude them. &#xa0;6.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Sense International and The Leprosy Mission England &amp; Wales highlight the value of initiatives which tackle 

[[[social stigma ]]]in tackling the isolation and exclusion of disabled people, particularly the most excluded (albinism, deafblind, intellectual disability etc.), including through participation in mainstream programmes which builds understanding between disabled and non-disabled people. &#xa0;6.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Motivation’s work evidences the importance of adherence to international guidelines on 

[[[assistive devices]]] in enabling disabled people to access services (health and education) and to participate in social and economic activities: Without inputs which support mobility and communication, disabled people are unable to benefit equitably from development interventions and remain ‘left behind’.&#xa0;6.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  The importance of 

[[[livelihoods]]] to disabled people's empowerment - social as well as economic&#xa0;– is reflected in CBM’s submission which highlights the importance of inclusive practice in mainstream credit &amp; savings programmes, as well as inclusive employment policy and practice supported by legal frameworks. &#xa0;6.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recent research finds that only 1% of international humanitarian aid is dedicated to disabled or older people, while evidence from the crisis in Syria shows that the barriers faced by disabled and older people often mean that they are effectively excluded from 

[[[humanitarian responses]]] (HI/HAI). HI recognises the steps taken by DFID’s humanitarian team to improve age/disability inclusion (e.g. included in 2011 Humanitarian Policy) but calls for this to be consolidated through more systematic approaches. &#xa0;6.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The importance and challenges of generating the 

[[[data and evidence]]] on which effective programmes must be based is demonstrated through submissions from the International Centre for Evidence in&#xa0; Disability (ICED)/ London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The collective evidence and recommendations put forward by INGOs working on diverse but related issues highlight the following key approaches to effective disability inclusion: &#xa0;7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Strategic approaches to ensure sustainability]]]: Disability inclusion needs to be built in to the culture and systems of mainstream organisations at all levels. The ‘Development for All’ strategy in AusAid, for example, has been effective in achieving good practice and positive impact for disabled people (Development for All Strategy Mid-Term Review 2012) &#xa0;7.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Twin-track approaches:]]] Efforts to ensure that mainstream development is 

[[[disability-inclusive]]] (e.g. education programmes that include disabled boys and girls) need to be supported by 

[[[disability-specific]]] inputs (e.g. accessible schools/ outreach with disabled children and families). &#xa0;

[[[7.4.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Locate disability within the equity debate]]]: Disability must be understood in the context of multiple and intersecting factors which contribute to exclusion and disadvantage. We need to ensure that disability is embedded, but not overlooked, within the wider equity discourse.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Participation of disabled people: ]]]Policy and programme development must draw on the lived experience of disabled people and promote their participation as agents of change. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Reasonable accommodation/ Positive Action:]]] Ensuring accessibility of mainstream programmes e.g. through inclusive design and modifications, assistive inputs, and removal of physical, communication and attitudinal barriers. Breaking negative cycles of exclusion and discrimination by creating opportunities for disabled people to participate in the workforce. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Evidence based programming: ]]]Disaggregation of data by disability alongside other factors (gender, age, ethnicity, geographic location); qualitative and quantitative evidence on exclusion/barriers to inclusion; learning from what works; and listening to the voices of disabled people through all these processes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Access to specialist skills and knowledge:]]] Programme staff and other stakeholders need access to advice, peer support and learning, information and resources on inclusive approaches. &#xa0;8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Seize the moment and reclaim a leading role:]]] As one of the world’s largest and most influential development actors, the UK and DFID should

[[[ aim to excel and provide leadership ]]]on all core humanitarian and development issues – including disability. It must do this by developing and demonstrating

[[[ good practice, within sustainable systems and structures ]]]which adhere to international law and guidelines on disability, ageing, gender, children and other related issues, and make a reality of the ‘leave no one behind’ agenda. &#xa0;8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Make a commitment to disability inclusion at the highest level:]]] In order to support the explicit inclusion of disability issues in the post-2015 framework, and to ensure that this is not lost at the 11th hour, DFID should maintain the momentum by making 

[[[a public pledge to include disabled people equitably]]] in its work. We recommend that this pledge is made during 2014, in order to maximise the potential for influencing the post-2015 framework to be explicitly inclusive of disability. The pledge should be realistic, specific, phased and timebound (e.g. begin by achieving inclusion in one or more bilateral aid programme or sector by 2016), and supported by the following action to ensure it is achieved:&#xa0;8.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Build disability in to DFID’s strategic frameworks]]]:  Develop a 

[[[Strategic Vision for Disabled People]]] and a 

[[[Disability Theory of Change]]], drawing on experience from existing approaches to gender within DFID’s work. These instruments should reflect the intersecting nature of diverse factors which contribute to the exclusion of disabled people of all ages, but they must also identify the specific measures needed to ensure disabled people are included. In order to maximise the impact of this strategic vision and TOC, we call for DFID to develop an overarching 

[[[Equity and Inclusion Strategy]]] which brings together the different factors which impact on equity, such as disability, age, gender etc. This approach to equity and inclusion should be reflected through 

[[[revisions to DFID’s Business Plan]]]. &#xa0;8.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Appoint a Disability Champion:]]] The practical application of the above strategic frameworks will have greatest impact if it is driven forward by key individuals. We recommend the appointment of a 

[[[Disability]]]

[[[ Champion ]]]at senior level (this post in USAID is appointed by the president), linked to identified ‘

[[[lead’ staff in country offices]]]. These posts, which need not be new appointments, will require training, guidance and resources to fulfil their role. In order to provide advice on disability inclusion, 

[[[Social Development Advisors]]] must have sufficient training and technical background, including knowledge of the disability sector and key organisations for referral. &#xa0;8.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Develop planning and accountability systems which promote disability inclusion:]]] Specific changes need to be made to the processes for approving and reporting on funding for DFID country programmes, humanitarian response, and CSO partners. This should include a requirement to 

[[[disaggregate data]]] (by disability, age gender and other factors), and mechanisms to ensure disability is included at the planning stage (e.g. similar to the 2010 Bilateral Aid Review which asked country offices to state how their interventions would impact on women and girls). &#xa0;8.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Invest in learning and evidence:]]] DFID should exercise political leadership and invest resources in developing work with bilateral/ multilateral organisations and CSOs to improve the generation and uptake of: 

[[[disability data]]]; 

[[[qualitative and ]]]

[[[quantitiative]]]

[[[ evidence]]] on the barriers to inclusion; and evidence of effective approaches to inclusion. All of these initiatives should be based on the 

[[[lived experience]]] of disabled people, promoting their voice and participation in learning and policy development processes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Promote the voice and participation of disabled people:]]] Initiatives are needed to promote the active participation of disabled stakeholders in planning, implementation and accountability processes at all levels.  DFID should aim to model good practice in this area e.g. through inclusive design, accessible information and systems, and positive action to 

[[[bring more disabled people]]] of all ages and of different gender into 

[[[DFID's workforce]]] in delivery and decisionmaking roles. We recommend that DFID starts this process by including disabled people in developing the Strategic Vision for Disabled People/ Disability TOC.&#xa0;December 2013                                                                                    1 In this submission ‘disabled people’ refers to disabled people of all ages, ethnicities and locations, and of both genders. The term reflects the terminology of the UK disability rights movement, but we recognise that in different contexts ‘people with disabilities’ is used, while the UNCRPD refers to ‘persons with disabilities’.
