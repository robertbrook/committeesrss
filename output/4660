default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn

defaulta 
defaultwhite paper
default, 
defaultTrust Assurance and Safety – The Regulation defaultof Health Professionals in the 21st Centurydefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultChapter 7 addressed the issue of 
defaultNew roles and emerging professionsdefault:  In particular it stated:
default&#xa0;
default7.2  
defaultThe Government is planning to introduce statutory regulation for
default 
defaultapplied psychologists, healthcare 
defaultscientists, psychotherapists and
default 
defaultcounsellors and other psychological therapists. These are the priorities
default 
defaultfor the introduction of statutory regulation, because their practice is well
default 
defaultestablished and widespread in the delivery of services, and what they do 
defaultcarries
default 
defaultsignificant risk to patients and the public if poorly done. Further work is needed
default 
defaulton these areas and the Government intends to continue with it.
default&#xa0;
default7.3 
default 
defaultThere are other professions, currently unregulated, that aspire to statutory
default 
defaultregulation. Some ha
defaultve developed over time but have not yet been regulated,
default 
defaultsuch as play therapists; others have been recently established in response to
default 
defaultdeveloping Government policy, such as health trainers. We have established a
default 
defaultworking group chaired by Professor Mike Pitti
defaultlo to look at the practicalities of
default 
defaultregulation of acupuncturists, herbal medicine practitioners and traditional
default 
defaultChinese medicine practitioners. We are awaiting the working group’s report
default 
defaultand in the light of that we will consider next steps for the way forw
defaultard.
default&#xa0;
default7.4 
default 
defaultIn Scotland, the regulation of these new professions is a matter for the
default 
defaultDevolved Administration.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe white paper then addressed
default other groups including 
defaultof anaesthesia practitioner
default and
default surgical care 
defaultp
defaultractitioner
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultOn 16
default February 2011, the Government published a 
defaultcommand paper
default, 
defaultEnabling Excellencedefault defaultAutonomy and Accountability for Healthcare Workers, Social Workers and Social Care Workersdefault, which set out the 
defaultcoalition government
default's pol
defaulticy on professional regulation.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default11 Rather than a single statutory approach regardless of local needs and local approaches, quality assured voluntary registration will provide greater flexibility and give the public and local employers greater control and responsibility for how they assur
defaulte themselves about the quality of staff. For the overwhelming majority of occupational and professional groups which are not currently subject to statutory regulation and which are generally not considered to present a high level of risk to the public, but
default where recommendations that regulation should be introduced have been made (including those groups recommended by the HPC for statutory regulation in the past, but not yet registered), the assumption will be that assured voluntary registration would be the
default preferred option
default&#xa0;
default4.12 The extension of statutory regulation to currently unregulated professional or occupational groups, such as some groups in the healthcare science workforce, will only be considered where there is a compelling case on the basis of a 
defaultpublic safety risk and where assured voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk.
default&#xa0;
default4.13 The exception to this is practitioners of herbal medicine, including Chinese herbal medicine. Under European law, manufactured medicines place
defaultd on the market require a suitable product licence, and from April 2011 this also applies to manufactured herbal medicines. However, Member States have the power to operate national arrangements permitting appropriately authorised healthcare professionals 
defaultto commission an unlicensed medicine to meet a patient's special needs and the UK already does so for doctors and certain other appropriately regulated prescribers. While there is evidence of public health risk where unlicensed herbal medicines are supplie
defaultd by unskilled practitioners, the impact on practitioners and on consumer choice of preventing the supply of all such herbal medicines would be disproportionate. We therefore propose to introduce regulation for these practitioners by the HPC, to ensure tha
defaultt the public are able to access these products if they should choose to do so and to provide improved assurance of the competence of
default practitioners. The focus of regulation will be solely on minimising risk to the public.
default&#xa0;
default6.11 In chapter 4, we set out our 
defaultproposals to put in place a system of assured voluntary registration for professionals and occupational groups which are currently not subject to statutory professional regulation. It is our view that this model should apply to the adult social care 
defaultworkfo
defaultrce and we will explore scope for the HPC to establish a voluntary register of social care workers by 2013. We envisage that in future local authority commissioners would be able to give preference to adult social care providers using workers on voluntary 
defaultregisters and that this could be a factor taken into account in the CQC's proposals for an excellence scheme which it will be consulting on.
default&#xa0;
defaultHerbal practitionersdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has proposed that we regulate herbal practitioners and non-medical public health specialists on a 
defaultstatutory
default basis.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe late Professor Michael Pittilo published his Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Stat
defaultutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practiced in the UK in 2008.  It concluded: “We are firmly of the view that, in the interest of public safety, statutory 
defaultregulation should now proceed with all possible speed” (p.10).  The Government published a public consultation in 2009.  On February 16 2011, the Secretary of State for Health, announced that the Government would introduce statutory regulation, and that th
defaultis would be in place by April 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default9 
defaultJuly 2013, in a Westminster Hall
default debate on herbal medicine, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Health announced the intention to set up a working group.  The first meeting of the Herbal Practitioners an
defaultd Medi
defaultcines Working Group is scheduled
default to meet in early 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultNon-medical pdefaultublic health specialistsdefault&#xa0;defaultOn 23
defaultrd
default January 2012 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of State for Health
default announced plans to ensure that non-medically qualified public health specialists are appropriately regulated. 
default 
defaultThe planned regulation of this group by the HCPC was confirmed in the Department of Health’s 
default‘Transforming Public Health’
default bulletin. 
default 
defaultThe regulation of this group was previously the subject of a Department of Health 
defaultreview
default and also featured in the recommendations of the 
defaultNHS Future Forum's second report
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic health specialists from non-medical backgrounds (not medicine, not dentistry) are voluntary registered at the moment with the UK Public Health Register (UKPHR). The Government has announced their statutory regulation in recognition that specialists 
defaultfrom medical and dental backgrounds are required to register with a statutory regulator (the GMC and GDC), but those from other backgrounds are not. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have been working with the Department of Health on their project to deliver this policy. 
defaultOur
default understanding is that the Department of Health currently intends to legislate in this parliament to regulate this group (as part of wider reforms arising from the Law Commissions' review of the regulators' legislation), with a register opening in autumn/ 
defaultwinter 2015. However, these timescales are out of our control and may change. 
default&#xa0;
defaultYou can find more information about the background here:

default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the moment, there are not any other professions / groups that it has been suggested we should regulate in the future (above those mentioned in our submission).
