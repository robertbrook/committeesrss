"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Vincent Nolan (HSR 009)\n&#xa0;\n1. The last \nindependent\n enquiry into \nBritain\n’ railway system was the 2006 \nEddington\n Committee. Its findings were adopted by the then \nLabour\n Gov\nernment in its 2007 White \nPaper;\n \nthey did not include High Speed Ra\nil\n&#xa0;\n2. In 2009, a government reshuffle produced a U-turn in railway policy: HS2 Ltd. was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dept, for Transport (\nDfT\n). This \norganisational\n change effectively changed the role \nof \nDfT\n from objective evaluation of all transport options to a cheer leader for HS2. \n&#xa0;\n3. The strategic case\n for HS2\n has never been subjected to independent evaluation. Recent revelations by Ministers at the time (Alistair Darling, Peter \nMandelson\n and part\nicularly Rail Minister John Harris\n)\n suggest that HS2 was adopted primarily for electoral reasons, with little more than a ‘back of an envelope’ evaluation. The \nDfT’s\n evaluations have been those of an advocate not an objective assessor.\n&#xa0;\n4. When the project\n has been submitted to independent scrutiny by bodies like the Public Accounts Committee, National Audit Office and the Major Projects Authority, it has been found to be seriously flawed. The TSC itself in its 2011 Report produced a list of recommendations\n to HS2 Ltd. which have been largely ignored. Independent analysis from such diverse bodies as the New Economics Foundation, the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Institute of Directors have condemned the project, as have serious media commen\nt\nators suc\nh\n \nas the Economist, Telegraph Guardian etc. Public opinion is now firmly opposed to it.\n&#xa0;\n5. The Coalition Agreement included an intention to build a high speed rail network \nas part of our plans for a low carbon economy. \nThe TSC\n \nconcluded \npreviously \nthat cl\naims for reduced carbon emissions from HS2 “did not stand up to scrutiny”\n.\n HS2 is opposed by the Green Party. In fact HS2 will significantly \nincrease\n carbon emissions because of its ultra high speed specification requiring higher energy use and the transfe\nr of passengers from conventional rail services. It also encourages a vast increase in long distance travel\n, when a low-carbon strategy would discourage travel (as with the \nDfT’s\n work from home campaign).\n&#xa0;\n6.\n HS2 is diverting resources from investment in 2\n1st century technology in \nfavour\n of (\nsoupe\nd\n-up) 19th century technology. \nFor example, we urgently need a\n&#xa0;\nnational\n&#xa0;\nhigh -speed \nfibre\n-optic broadband network; we need to support transport developments like electric cars, particularly Google's driverless car \nexperiment. In 20 years time, when HS2 is scheduled to be completed, technology will have transformed the way we do business, as it has in the last 20 years. The Government's forecasts of passenger numbers \n(300,000 a day!) \ntake no account of the impact of \nnew technology.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nThe successful bullet trains in \nJapan\n and \nFrance\n were innovations of the 60s and 70s. We are 50 years behind and the world has changed. More recent investments in HSR in countries like \nSpain\n have brought no economic benefits and have co\nmpounded their debt \nproblems. HS2 will have similar effects here\n.\n And the construction costs per \nkm.of\n HS2 are \n10 times those of European high speed railways\n&#xa0;\n8. The Government is addressing HS2 as a delivery problem, analogous to delivering the Olympics. \nIt is a false analogy. \nWhen a bid for the Olympics is selected, the bidder has no option but to deliver what they have promised; it is a commitment to the world sporting community. It does not matter how flawed the rationale behind the bid or how dubious t\nhe cost estimates were. The successful bidder has to ‘do what it takes’ to deliver to specification and on time, even if the costs increase fourfold beyond the original estimate, the Armed Services have to be called in when the private contractor fails to \nrecruit the stewards required and immigration controls have to be relaxed to cope with the inflow of visitors. Anything goes, “whatever it takes”. But this is a most unsuitable model for HS2. The issue with HS2 is whether it is the best solution to the pro\nblems it purports to solve (which shift as the rationale for each one proves to be unfounded) and whether it provides good value for money compared with the range of alternative infrastructure investments it could be spent on. \n&#xa0;\n9. I urge the TSC to call f\nor an independent, objective and thorough\n \nexamination of\n UK transport strategy to determine whether High Speed Rail, and in particular HS2, is the most economic way of meeting Britain’s future transport needs.\n There is a real danger that the Government will rush into an irrevocable commitment to a bad investment, which (like the aircraft carriers) will prove too expensive to cancel when we \nrealise\n we do not need it.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
