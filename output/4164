defaultFiona defaultPhilpottdefault [FBB0065]default&#xa0;defaultThe Future of the BBCdefaultWhat should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?default&#xa0;defaultThe BBC 
defaultshould represent the very best in British 
defaultbroadcasting providing access to a wealth of knowledge, education and entertainment. The BBC achieves this very successfully at the moment and will hopefully continue to do so in the future
default&#xa0;
defaultComing from the arts and heritage sector, 
defaultwe believe 
defaultthe BBC
default shou
defaultld help provide access to the arts 
defaultfor
default the widest possible public. It should help cultural organisations make their collections accessible to people via imaginative programming.
default The BBC has already shown how it can take some of the finest music performances
default and
default theatrical productions into our homes, experiences which for some would be prohibitively expensive. More of this should happen so that people across the country realise th
defaultere is fabulous talent in all parties of the 
defaultUK
default, not just 
defaultLondon
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith headquarters in 
defaultLondon
default, Salford and 
defaultGlasgow
default the BBC is in a strong position to make a difference regionally so that access to arts and culture can be shared across the country.
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic
default service broadcasting should provide for quality programming which would not be made on commercial channels. There should be a mix of popular programming and those which target smaller, niche audiences. 
defaultThe BBC is good at sharing different voices and opini
defaultons, not just those of the critics and professionals, and should continue to do so to ensure that viewers continue to feel part of the BBC. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAbove all standards in news and documentaries must be maintained; with the BBC retaining its role as provider of i
defaultn-depth, reliable and well-researched content.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow well has the BBC performed…?default&#xa0;
defaultThe move to 
defaultSalford
default has resulted in a tangible difference in terms of regional arts coverage. Among national media outlets, the BBC is outperforming many others in its attemp
defaultt to break down the traditional London-centric bias.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is still much more to be achieved. BBC Salford has started to develop strong relationships with some of the leading cultural organisations in the North - this approach is welcomed and should be bu
defaultilt upon. The museums and galleries across the 
defaultUK
default house the most amazing treasures from across the world - collections which could be made far more accessible through the medium of television and radio.  
default&#xa0;
defaultShould the BBC’s output and services be provided tdefaulto any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC 
defaultshould be truly national in remit, covering stories from around the country and giving equal weight to issues/stories from the regions as well as the capital. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC is in a class all of its own in terms of children’s television and should continue to expand this. There could well be advantages in developing commercial partnerships with public and private sector partners so that the characters and stories broug
defaultht to life on television can be translated into exhibitions (look at the success of the Harry Potter experience) which tour the country and potentially generate new income streams which can be shared between partners through ticket sales and merchandise. T
defaulthere is a 
defaultlarge 
defaultmarket for such attractions in Europe, the 
defaultFar East
default, the Middle East &amp; China
default&#xa0;
defaultMaybe there are opportunities for further collaboration between the BBC and different publicly funded organisations. The BBC might consider working more closely w
defaultith the NHS for example to tailor programmes for those who suffer from conditions like dementia.
default&#xa0;
defaultWdefaulthat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?defaultThe BBC is full of some of the most 
defaultcreative and technical talent which exists in the 
defaultUK
default today
default. It would be madness for the BBC not to channel this into developing new 
defaultways of delivering and distributing content
default. It is the technological development which is 
defaultincredibly 
defaultimportant in terms of w
defaultidening access as it is the language of the next generation.
defaultMaybe in this area and others, the BBC has a role to play in training and mentoring, sharing its knowledge and experience with others in the region.
