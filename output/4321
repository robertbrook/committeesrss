defaultThis document sets out Waitrose’s 
defaultresponse to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry into a carrier bag charge for England.

default1.0default              defaultIntroductiondefault1.1
default              
defaultWaitrose 
defaultwelcomes the opportunity to 
defaultrespon
defaultd 
defaultto the 
defaultEnvironmental Audit Committee’s inquiry 
defaultinto 
defaultthe sustainability of measures to reduce the use of plastic shopping bags.
default  The views represented are the views of Waitrose supermarkets, 
defaulta division
default of the John Lewis Partnership.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWaitrose believes that a 5p charge on single use bags will reduce bag consumption as consumers begin to change their behaviour as a result of having to pay for every bag.
default  
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultSince the introduction of charging in Wales in October 2011, Waitrose has seen a reduction of 76 per cent of single use bags.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultProviding a free, more sustainable bag is likely to lead to increased usage, which could reverse falls in consumption as consumers begin to fall back into old habits. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.0default              defaultbackgrounddefault2.1
default              
defaultOur understanding is that 
defaultthe existing types of biodegradable and 
defaultoxo
default degradable 
defaultbags 
defaultwould not be exempt from the charge. Currently, only paper would be exempt and as WRAP have reported, whilst coming from a renewable source, paper requires significantly more energy to manufacture and transport than plastics and also have limited 
defaultreuseability
default. 
default2.2
default              
defaultWe also understand that industry has been tasked with identifying a new type of biodegradable material that overcomes the main issues already identified namely: contamination of recycling stream, confusing consumers and the potential impact on existing consumer behaviour.  
defaultOur 
defaultresponse is therefore based on the knowledge currently available.

default.1
default              
defaultSince charging in Wales was introduced
default on ALL SINGLE USE BAGS
default in October 2011, Waitrose has seen a reduction of 76 
defaultper cent
default of single use 
defaultbags.  This supports the wider report produced by WRAP earlier this summer
default (UK Voluntary Carrier Bag Monitoring – WRAP July 2013)
default.
default&#xa0;

default.2
default              
defaultWe believe a 5p charge on single use bags will reduce bag consumption as consumers start to change their behaviour as a result of having to pay for every bag.
default&#xa0;

default.3
default              
defaultIf there was a free bag available with more ‘sustainable’ credentials, the likely increase in usage could reverse falls in consumption as consumers began to fall back into old habits.

default&#xa0;
defaultbenefits for biodiversity and the environmentdefault3
default.4
default              
defaultThe main problem associated with single use bags is the generation of litter.
default3
default.5
default              
defaultAccording to WRAP’s research, we know the majority of households (65%) 
defaultreuse
default their single use bags as bin liners. This would infer that the bags are either sent to landfill or for incineration and thus energy recovery.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultSome consumers will recycle their bags, we offer recycling facilities in our shops, we then reuse the plastic as part of our closed loop initiatives.  
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultBy imposing a charge on ALL single use bags, we know from evidence in Wales this results in a significant reduction of bags in circulation, therefore a charge on ALL bags would contribute towards a reduction in litter.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultA charging exemption on biodegradable and degradable bags would result in 
defaultan increase in bag consumption.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThese would still end up in either landfill or incineration as consumers will continue to use them as bin liners. Biodegradable bags (paper/natural materials) are not designed to degrade in anaerobic landfill conditions and could release methane under such conditions.
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultBiodegradable and degradable bags should not enter the recycling stream as they contaminate the recycled content and therefore are not suitable for recycling.
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default              
defaultThe only benefit of a biodegradable bag therefore, is with regards to litter, however existing types of bio (plastic) bags still take years to decompose. We need to be changing behaviour not condoning the discarding of bags into the environment with the hope they will break down before they cause damage to marine life or unsightly litter. 
default4default.0default              defaultthe impact on the use of biodegradable bags and the impact on plastics recyclingdefault4
default.1
default              
defaultRecent 
defaultcustomer research showed there is poor understanding of what biodegradable really means. When asked if consumers wanted a free biodegradable
default,
default the majority said yes, however when asked how they would dispose of the bags the majority confirmed they would continue to reuse 
defaultthem 
defaultas bin liners. When asked if they knew the impact on the environment could 
defaultbe detrimental, the
default 
defaultmajority went on to say they would prefer to pay 5p for a bag that could be recycled.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultA 
defaultbiodegradable bag should break
default 
defaultdown more quickly. If these types of bags enter the recycling stream they will compromise the quality of the 
defaultrecyclant
default. We have established an effective closed loop process with our plastics company. There would need to be a new process to ensure bags were segregated to reduce contamination however it is likely that recycling rates would be affected.

default5
default.1
default              
defaultWith the potential introduction of a free biodegradable bag, we would need to consider the impact on our existing range of reusable bags. We would withdraw the existing ‘recycled and recyclable’
default 
defaultplastic bag as consumers would be unlikely to 
defaultpay a

defaultcharge if

default6default.0default              defaultthe relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed levy rather than a possible complete ban on lightweight plastic bagsdefault6
default.1
default              
defaultThe proposed levy exempts biodegradable bags. By offering a free bag
default,
default it would continue to encourage a ‘use once’ mentality as there would 
defaultbe 
defaultlittle incentive to remember to reuse bags. Consumers would also view the bag as a more sustainable solution to plastic, despite it not being suitable for recycling nor would it change consumers’ behaviour 
defaultregarding 
defaultdisposal.
default6
default.2
default              
defaultFrom WRAP’s own report and LCA data, all bags should be reused as many times as possible. Biodegradable bags especially paper bags have very limited reuse opportunities.
default&#xa0;
default7default.0default              defaultthe rationale for excluding particular types of retailer from the levy schemedefault7
default.1
default              
defaultIf the rationale for the plastic bag charge
default 
defaultis environmental, then its aim should be to change consumer behaviour and to encourage the reuse of bags as many times as possible.  This would not be achieved if some retailers were exempt.
default7
default.2
default              
defaultExcluding some retailers would send out conflicting messages to consumers and could therefore affect the potential benefits from the charge in other areas.
default&#xa0;
default8default.0default              defaultthe lessons to be learnt from other countries’ experiences in this areadefault8
default.1
default              
default              
defaultIn Wales, consumers have adapted to the charge and reusing bags is commonplace as in Europe. 
default9default.0default              defaultAny social or economic impacts of the proposed bag levy, for example on affordability for particular households or businessesdefault9
default.1
default              
defaultThere would be an enormous loss of potential funds available to charities as a result of the exemption of biodegradable bags.  In Wales, the proceeds from the 5p charge go towards social and environmental good causes. With the potential volumes available, charities stand to lose considerable funds as few retailers w
defaultould offer a plastic bag for 5p.
default 
default M
defaultost retailers will want to be as competitive as possible and therefore most will offer a free bio
defaultdegradable
default bag. If a charge was imposed on all single use bags as in Wales, the proceeds could be redirected into research and development to improve kerbside recycling/on the go recycling where the main problem lies.
