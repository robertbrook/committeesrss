"VEP 0015\nWritten Submission by the Electoral Management Board for Scotland VEP 0015&#xa0;INTRODUCTION&#xa0;This paper provides a set of responses from the Electoral Management Board for Scotland to a series of questions posed by Joint Committee on the draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill.  These answers are made by the Convener of the EMB, on the basis of consultation with the Board members an advisers which includes representation from the major professional associations responsible for the delivery of elections in Scotland: solace (Scotland), SOLAR, AEA (Scotland and Northern Ireland Branch) and the Scottish Assessors’ Association.\n&#xa0;\nTHE ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR SCOTLAND &#xa0;The Electoral Management Board for Scotland (EMB) was created by the Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Act 2011, which gave the Board “the general function of co-ordinating the administration of local government elections in Scotland.”  This involves two specific roles:  \n&#xa0;\n(a) assisting local authorities and other persons in carrying out their functions in relation to local government elections; and -\n(b) promoting best practice in local government elections by providing information, advice or training (or otherwise)\n&#xa0;\nThe Board is composed of 8 members, 5 of whom are Returning Officers (or their Deputes) and 3 of whom are Electoral Registration Officers.  These are appointed by a Convener who is in turn appointed by Scottish Ministers, through a process of open competition.  Advisors from the professional associations working in electoral administration, SOLAR and the AEA, also attend the Board meetings.  The Electoral Commission, the Scottish Government, Scotland Office and COSLA also have representatives at Board meetings acting as official advisors to provide support and advice.\n&#xa0;\nThe EMB’s prime focus is ensuring that the interests of the voter are kept at the centre of all elections planning and administration.  The Board makes much use of the close community of electoral professionals in Scotland to operate by consensus wherever possible.  However, the Convener also has the power to issue directions to Returning Officers and Electoral Registration Officers in relation to their duties around local government elections.  \n&#xa0;\nThe local government elections of May 2012 were undertaken with the oversight and coordination of the EMB.  Overall this was a set of elections which were well-run and in which the elector can have full confidence in the results.  There were none of the issues that were faced in 2007 around ballot paper printing or the eCounting systems.  Feedback from all stakeholders indicated that the EMB played a major role in ensuring that this successful outcome was achieved.  The same stakeholders have expressed their appreciation of the work of the EMB and look for its support and coordination to be maintained and developed in future electoral events.\nGENERAL COMMENT&#xa0;The EMB represents those respo\nnsible for delivering elections in line with the relevant legislation.  As such we do not intend to comment on the more philosophical issues associated with the franchise or the historic approach to it being withheld from prisoners for example due to the concept of civic death.  Rather in this paper a number of comments are offered on the \npractical issues that may arise in the consideration of the extension of the franchise to prisoners.\nOnly those questions on which it is appropriate for us to offer a response have been addressed.\n&#xa0;\nTHE DRAFT BILL&#xa0;\nThe Joint Committee is particularly interested in receiving evidence on the three options for changes to the law set out in the draft bill. They are:&#xa0;a. Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more in prison from voting.b.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disqualifying prisoners sentenced more than 6 months in prison from voting.c.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disqualifying all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting – a restatement of the existing ban.&#xa0; &#xa0;Please state your opinion on all or any of these options giving clear reasons as to why you, or your organisation, hold that particular view.&#xa0; The Joint Committee would also welcome evidence on whether approaches beyond these options should also be considered.&#xa0;EMB comment&#xa0;\nWe have no preference for whether prisoners should be disenfranchised or not, or which term of imprisonment is most appropriate as a default\n&#xa0;\n It is however important that clear notification is given to the ERO when the prisoner is sentenced and then again when the prisoner is released. It is very common for a prisoner to be sentenced for a certain period of time and only serve a portion of that time. The sentence for instance could be greater than 4 years but the time served could be much less than the 4 years.\n&#xa0;\nADDITIONAL QUESTIONS &#xa0;The Joint Committee would also be grateful to receive evidence on the following specific questions. It is not necessary to address every question. &#xa0;EMB commentIt should be noted that not all prisoners are denied the right to vote. Remand prisoners can vote and convicted prisoners can vote if they are imprisoned for default of another punishment. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?&#xa0; 3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?&#xa0;EMB commentThis is not \nknown. There have as yet been no financial claims made against Scottish EROs\n. However there is a risk that a challenge to the legality of an election register could be made by a convicted prisoner. If such a challenge is successfully made just before an election it could result in the \ncostly \ndelay of that election.\n&#xa0;\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is sentence length a legally robust basis on which to retain an entitlement to vote?&#xa0;EMB commentIf only some serving prisoners are able to register any option is preferred that allows the Court to make a considered decision based on the particular facts of the case, the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the convicted person to be taken into account.  \n&#xa0;\nThis follows the guidance given by Judge Caflisch\n (7c; Hirst v UK 2005)\n “The legislation in question must provide that disenfranchisement, as a complementary punishment, is a matter to be decided by the judge, not the executive.”\n&#xa0;\nThe\n concern\n of EROs\n is that by not following this guidance we may be no further forward in terms of Human Rights challenges to the register.\n&#xa0;\nAs stated above the length of sentence given\n and the amount of time served c\nan vary dramatically. Any change to the legislation need\ns\n to be very explicit.\n&#xa0;\n6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What would be the likely legal consequences, both domestically and internationally of:&#xa0;a) keeping the law as it is? b) passing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?c) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Would giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?&#xa0;EMB commentThe \nElectoral \nCommission has no direct role in registering voters. \n \nPerhaps what is being asked \nhere \nis the effect on Electoral Registration Officers\n (EROs)\n? \n&#xa0;\nIf so \nagain we have no preference for which default system is in place. In \npractical terms, however, it would be preferable that the prisoner’s local ERO receives notification from the prison that the person has now been disenfranchised for a specified time or until released from detention whichever is earlier. The alternative to this is that the ERO will have to remain constantly aware or be informed of court proceedings (not necessarily local courts) and remove convicted electors based on legislative rules.  \n&#xa0;\nCurrently \nEROs\n are not always informed that a person is now disenfranchised and we rely on normal canvass procedures to identify that someone is no longer resident at an address because they are in prison. Once we know this at present the person is removed from the register.  \nIf only some convicted prisoners are disenfranchised, w\nithout information from some source such as the prison authorities or the sentencing court we would be unable to distinguish whether a prisoner was disenfranchised or not.\n&#xa0;\n8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies? &#xa0;EMB commentAs prisons may be relatively large populations in a particular local government ward it would seem sensible to spread that population among a wider area by restriction to previous, or next intended address and only in exceptional circumstances allowing local connection to the prison. However, particularly for longer term prisoners of 2 or more years, the connection with a previous address may become quite tenuous and should perhaps be treated in the same way as overseas voters.  Allowing “local connection” to a future address will also involve a change to the legislation defining local connection and care should be taken to avoid giving rise to a series of competing residences for prisoners. Even if it does not raise the possibility of multiple registrations, this could potentially allow a prisoner to choose where to register. \n&#xa0;\nAllowing registration only at a prison address will mean that the prisoner will always be recorded as having been at that address in that year. This would appear to conflict with the rehabilitation principles of prisoner registration. The requirement to disclose a conviction may have expired but the person’s name could still be found at a prison address by those entitled to use the registers. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;ADDITIONAL COMMENTSEMB commentCurrently \nal\nthough disenfranchised, a prisoner may stand for election \nto Parliament \nif convicted for less than a year\n (Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1981)\n. If prisoner enfranchisement is introduced for more than a year there may be consequential need to amend the right to stand for Parliament and to donate to political parties.  \n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n1&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
