[[[Written evidence submitted by HM Government]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Summary:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Government welcomes the Committee’s examination of this important issue. We recognise the significant challenges that the banking sector in Northern Ireland faces, and we are determined to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to help to boost bank lending to businesses. &#xa0;The framework the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive set out in our Building a Prosperous and United Community document, announced on 14 June, sets out initiatives in this area and outlines an ongoing mechanism for addressing banking and access to finance issues in Northern Ireland. The Government’s evidence below covers each of the seven topics highlighted by the Committee. &#xa0;&#xa0;(i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The structure and governance of banks in ]]]

[[[Northern Ireland]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;There are clearly significant differences in the banking structure in Northern Ireland compared to Great Britain (GB). Of the four main banks – Ulster, First Trust, Bank of Ireland and Danske – three are not UK-owned. First Trust (as part of Allied Irish Banks) and Bank of Ireland are headquartered in Dublin, whilst Danske is Danish-owned. Some large GB banks such as HSBC and Barclays only have a comparatively small presence in Northern Ireland. The strong link between the banking system in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland presents particular challenges, given the difficulties faced by the Irish economy in recent years. &#xa0;The Chancellor has made clear that the link between our financial systems, which is most pronounced in Northern Ireland, was a strong factor in the Government’s decision to provide a bilateral loan to the Republic of Ireland.  &#xa0;The UK signed an agreement for a bilateral loan of £3.2 billion in December 2010, as part of an €67.5 billion international financial assistance package for Ireland. The Government expects the loan to be repaid in full and with interest.  Sweden and Denmark have also provided bilateral loans to Ireland. &#xa0;The loan is disbursed in eight tranches of £403 million, subject to the completion of quarterly programme reviews. The first seven tranches have been disbursed to date.&#xa0;The conditions of the bilateral loan also made clear that the funding was subject to the Irish Government not amending its restructuring plan in a way that would have a material adverse financial impact on the UK operations of Anglo Irish bank, Allied Irish Banks or the Bank of Ireland.  As the Chancellor said when the Loans to Ireland Act was debated in the House of Commons, providing the bilateral loan has enabled the Government to be part of discussions about the restructuring plan and its impact on the UK subsidiaries of banks which have significant presence in Northern Ireland.The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is one of a number of initiatives taken by the Irish Government to address the crisis in Irish banking. NAMA was formally established on 21 December 2009. Five institutions (and their subsidiaries) applied to join the NAMA scheme and were designated as participating institutions in February 2010: Allied Irish Banks; Bank of Ireland; Anglo Irish Bank; Irish Nationwide Building Society; and EBS Building Society.The first phase of NAMA’s operation involved the acquisition and transfer of over €71 billion in loan assets involving 850 debtors and more than 11,000 individual loans collateralised by 16,000 individual properties. Approximately two-thirds of the assets backing those loans are located in Ireland and most of the remainder is located in the UK with smaller concentrations in the US and throughout continental Europe.On the proposal of the Irish Minister for Finance, NAMA set up a Northern Ireland Advisory Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Board in relation to strategy for Northern Ireland assets. Approximately 3 per cent of NAMAs property profile is located in Northern Ireland; 36 per cent Dublin; 18 per cent Rest of Ireland; 21 per cent London; 12 per cent Rest of GB; and 10 per cent Rest of World.Its portfolio in NI is worth €1.3 billion or 4 per cent of its total acquisition value of €31.8billion. Approximately 70 per cent of its NI portfolio is completed property and income producing. By the end of March 2013, asset sales approved stood at £86.6 million. By the same time, it had approved £123 million in new advances to NI debtors. NAMAs stated approach has been to encourage a phased and orderly realisation of its assets in Northern Ireland.&#xa0;

[[[The possible break]]]

[[[-]]]

[[[up of RBS/Ulster Bank]]] &#xa0;The Government recognises that RBS, including Ulster Bank, remains weighed down by too many poor assets. The Chancellor announced in his Mansion House speech on 19 June that the Treasury would be examining the case for breaking RBS up and establishing a Bad Bank.&#xa0;The Government welcomed the input of the Northern Ireland Executive on the future of RBS, conveyed through its former and current finance ministers, Sammy Wilson and Simon Hamilton. The views of the Northern Ireland business community were also considered following on from representations by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.&#xa0;On 1 November 2013, RBS announced that it was committing to a new direction for the bank, in order for it to restructure and boost the British and Irish economies. RBS will create an internal bad bank and £9 billion of Ulster Bank assets will be transferred into this new structure.&#xa0;The Chancellor recently stated that the Government, RBS and the Bank of England are all in agreement on the direction that RBS is heading. RBS will focus on its core UK business. It will sell off more of its overseas operations and continue to reduce its investment bank, so it has more capital to support lending to the UK economy. RBS has also committed to becoming the best small business bank in the UK. &#xa0;RBS’s operations in Northern Ireland through Ulster Bank, which also operates in Ireland, remain an important part of RBS’s core operations and the new direction the bank has announced. However, a sustainable operating model needs to be found for it so that it can play its full part in delivering support to both economies. To achieve this, RBS has announced that Ulster Bank will be part of its full business review, reporting in February 2014, with the aim of identifying a long term viable and sustainable business model.&#xa0;It is in the UK’s interest that Ireland has a successful economy and a stable banking system. It is therefore important that Ulster Bank is in a position to support the economy in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, through new lending and generating new business.&#xa0;RBS's 1st November announcement is a positive step in this direction since it will see Ulster Bank remain as an important part of the RBS group, with its balance sheet strengthened by the transfer of problem assets to the internal bad bank. Developing a sustainable business model for Ulster Bank which is capable of&#xa0;supporting its cost base may involve some difficult decisions following the forthcoming review, but should ultimately leave Ulster Bank as a stronger bank better able to support lending to business.&#xa0;&#xa0;(iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;               

[[[The position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]]] &#xa0;The Government has received a number of representations on the question of employees of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which was liquidated by the Irish Government on 7 February 2013.&#xa0;We fully acknowledge the concerns of those UK based employees who face redundancy as a result of this process. As a result of the representations received, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has discussed this issue with the Irish Government. However, whilst the Government is able to pursue requests for clarification, it is important to note that the decision to liquidate the IBRC and the effect this had on employment contracts is a matter for the Irish Government. The Government does not have any jurisdiction in relation to the role currently being played by the Special Liquidators. &#xa0;&#xa0;(iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;               

[[[Access]]]

[[[ to finance, particularly for Small and Medium Enterprises]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;The Government recognises that access to finance remains a significant challenge for SMEs in Northern Ireland, as it does across the UK. The Northern Ireland Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s Economic Advisory Group (EAG) produced a detailed report on access to finance in Northern Ireland.&#xa0;The report included the following conclusions:&#xa0;&#xa0;The measures set out in our Building a Prosperous and United Community package provide a comprehensive framework within which the Government intends to co-ordinate its efforts to boost lending to businesses in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;&#xa0;(v)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[       ]]]

[[[Lack of effectiveness of national initiatives to help aid economic recovery]]]&#xa0;UK wide lending schemes set-up by the Government play an important role in providing credit to businesses and individuals in Northern Ireland. Ulster Bank has announced that it has approved nearly £80 million of loans through the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), helping over 500 businesses in Northern Ireland. FLS has enabled Ulster Bank to establish a new Funding for Lending deal, under which customers will not be charged an arrangement fee for any new loans drawn under the scheme.  &#xa0;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme (EFG) has provided 195 loans amounting to £27.66 million in Northern Ireland since May 2010. In addition to these national schemes, the Northern Ireland Executive has its own £100 million ‘Access to Finance Strategy’, which incorporates a number of smaller schemes designed to boost lending. &#xa0;However, the Government accepts that UK wide schemes to boost lending have not always been as effective in Northern Ireland as they have been elsewhere in the UK. The take-up of EFG is lower in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK. The framework we set out in Building a Prosperous and United Community is intended to provide a mechanism to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring and evaluation of national schemes to ensure that they work more effectively in Northern Ireland in future.&#xa0;The package also makes specific proposals on improving existing schemes to increase their impact in Northern Ireland. We have fulfilled our commitment in the package to extend the Start-up Loans scheme to Northern Ireland. Delivery partners for this scheme have been agreed and the first Start-up Loans have already been made to young entrepreneurs with seven loans approved to the value of £30,000 by the end of October 2013. The package includes a commitment to work to ensure that Northern Ireland benefits from a pilot extension to the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme, aimed at addressing loan affordability. We have also committed to continuing to work with the remaining banks to encourage their participation in the Funding for Lending Scheme. &#xa0;It is important to note that improving the effectiveness of these schemes cannot be achieved by the Government alone. We would welcome the Committee’s analysis of how banks in Northern Ireland are promoting, marketing and championing schemes such as EFG, and the extent to which the remaining banks are proactively seeking to address any issues holding them back from joining the Funding for Lending Scheme. &#xa0;&#xa0;(vi)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ of availability of detailed regional lending data]]]&#xa0;The lack of availability of lending data in Northern Ireland presents significant challenges for policy makers. The current position is that the Northern Ireland Executive’s Department for Finance and Personnel (DfP) and the Economic Advisory Group (EAG) receive aggregate lending data privately from the British Bankers Association (BBA). This information is provided on a confidential basis and is not published. &#xa0;The Government welcomes the Committee’s examination of this issue and intends to work closely with the BBA, banks, and the Northern Ireland Executive to address it. Our objective as far as possible would be to ensure parity in the availability of lending data across the UK, including in Northern Ireland. The Government recently announced that, from next year, businesses in GB will be able to see where banks are lending in the country, down to postcode level. The data will be published by the BBA and Council for Mortgage Lenders on a quarterly basis. The first dataset will cover seven major lenders in GB but we have already made clear that we expect more lenders to sign up to publishing their data in future.&#xa0;The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has been working with the Northern Ireland Executive to seek to persuade banks to provide better data on lending in Northern Ireland. On 11 September 2013 she and Finance Minister, Simon Hamilton, met representatives of the British Bankers' Association to explain their concerns on this issue.&#xa0;&#xa0;(vii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;           

[[[Access to banking in rural communities]]]&#xa0;It is essential that local communities have access to suitable and affordable banking services. The Government wants to see greater competition in the banking sector, with more banks challenging the large incumbents. If communities or entrepreneurs want to set up a bank, either to serve their local community or to compete nationally, and can do this responsibly, Government or regulators should not be an obstacle to this.&#xa0;That is why the Government asked the previous financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to review the process for authorising new banks, as well the regulatory requirements placed on new and smaller banks. The FSA published the report on this work in March 2013, and brought forward significant improvements to make it easier for new banks to enter the market and compete. These changes have been put into effect by the new financial services regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and should have a real impact on competition. &#xa0;The Government also believes that Post Offices also have a crucial role to play in ensuring rural communities can access banking services.  In 2010, the Government published its Post Office policy statement ‘Securing the Post Office network in the digital age’, which sets out our commitment to maintain a geographically comprehensive Post Office network with at least 11,500 branches.  Of these, 484 are in Northern Ireland.  The Government is providing £1.34 billion to maintain and modernise the post office network across the UK and to ensure that it continues to meet the Government access-criteria that see, for example, 93 per cent of the population within one mile of a post office branch.&#xa0;Some 95 per cent of UK current account customers can access their cash at post office counters.  This includes the accounts of Bank of Ireland, First Trust, Ulster, and Danske.  The Post Office network is larger than that of all the high street banks combined, and this service provides vital access to cash for many communities that no longer have a high street bank branch. &#xa0;November 2013Page 1 of 8
