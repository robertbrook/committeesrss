defaultThis evidence is submitted on behalf of the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee.  In response to the questions posed by the Commons Select committee about women in STEM careers
default, 
defaultacademic staff in the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee collected and summarised

defaultWhy
default do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder
default?
default&#xa0;
defaultA common theme reported by young women researchers is that they experience multiple everyday assumptions (about them) and inequalities that have the cumulative effect of m
defaultaking them feel that they didn't/don’t 'fit'. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPeople can be more-or-less vulnerable to these effects, depending on their age, experience, and what else is happening in their lives. 
default&#xa0;
defaultScience is perceived as a risky career with limited job security. 
default&#xa0;
default Wome
defaultn appear to be more risk averse. 
defaultSome women report that the financial reward is not sufficient for the commitment required.
defaultThe cultural attitudes in Science are often cited as a problem. This includes for example, the aggressively competitive nature of t
defaulthe business and the constant competition for funding and or publication of data in high impact journals.  Success in academia requires long hours of work in the laboratory, international recognition of research requires academics to travel to international
default meetings. These demands are not always compatible with a good work life balance and this is more of a concern to women.    
defaultCollegiality is not supported or encouraged by any of the current academic assessment criteria e.g. REF. 
defaultThis may relate to the cur
defaultrent system of how research output and thus someone’s value is measured.  
defaultWomen do not want to be seen as (too) competitive or aggressive. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe difficulty of raising a family while building this career is often reported as appearing insurmountable.  Howe
defaultver, childcare issues can be solved by ‘throwing money’ at the situation.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? 
defaultAnecdotally, the types of choices we see are teaching, media/communication industry, charity work, childcare.  It 
defaultis noticeable that most editors
default of science journals are 
defaultfemale as are the majority of staff in funding councils and charities like CR-UK, AICR,
default Wellcome Trust, etc.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in differ
defaultent employment sectors?
defaultWe are losing highly trained people whose skills are lost to the scientific community.  This loss of diversity in creativity, thinking patterns, specialty talent, etc. maybe detrimental to our ability to generate the best solutions 
defaultto the world’s problems.
defaultThere may be a benefit to having scientifically trained people move into other sectors – this could improve rigour of thought and practice and improve evidence-based decision-making and general scientific literacy of the 
defaultpopulation.  However, a move into other sectors should be the choice of an individual, and not be perceived
default as a 
defaultnecessity.  If mostly women make such alternate choice, these other sectors will also start to suffer from lack of diversity. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat should uni
defaultversities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice
default?
defaultMore overt mentoring and support for women academics at all career level needs to be provided.
defaultUniversities should provide more targeted career advice to undergraduate students that emphasizes the career opportunities for women in academia.
defaultUniversities should prioritize funding schemes to support women at key stages of their career. For many academ
defaultics a critical point comes at child-bearing ages – postdoc level.  
defaultA number of options can help here: 
defaultUniversities need to ensure that lea
defaultders and managers fully understand equality and diversity as it relates to gender issues.  For example University could have mandatory training programs.
defaultUniversities need to ensure that there is 
defaulttransparency and clarity about what is expected at all caree
defaultr levels. Clarity about why decisions were made, is important. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt makes a huge difference when decisions are accompanied by explanations, particularly when the decisions have unpleasant consequences. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are many good examples of good practise that ar
defaulte evaluated and collated by the Athena SWAN scheme.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
defaultThe government should provide ring fenced funding to support University initiatives aimed at facilitating the careers of women academics.  For example, hiring technicians to support the research activities of female academics on maternity leave. 
defaultThe gover
defaultnment should invest in social science research to identify why females in STEM subjects make career choices to leave academia.  This will inform about appropriate interventions.
defaultThe government should consider education in a minimum of two science subjects 
defaultcompulsory for all pupils until age 16.  This would increase the pool of women entering into STEM subjects.
