[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee[bold] (WSC036)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This evidence is submitted on behalf of the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee.  In response to the questions posed by the Commons Select committee about women in STEM careers
[normal], 
[normal]academic staff in the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee collected and summarised
[normal] 
[normal]comments/ideas
[normal] from 
[normal]professors, postdocs and students.  There are no connections to lobbying groups or financial interests to declare in this context.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why
[normal] do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder
[normal]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A common theme reported by young women researchers is that they experience multiple everyday assumptions (about them) and inequalities that have the cumulative effect of m
[normal]aking them feel that they didn't/don’t 'fit'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]People can be more-or-less vulnerable to these effects, depending on their age, experience, and what else is happening in their lives. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Science is perceived as a risky career with limited job security. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Wome
[normal]n appear to be more risk averse. 
[normal]Some women report that the financial reward is not sufficient for the commitment required.
[normal]The cultural attitudes in Science are often cited as a problem. This includes for example, the aggressively competitive nature of t
[normal]he business and the constant competition for funding and or publication of data in high impact journals.  Success in academia requires long hours of work in the laboratory, international recognition of research requires academics to travel to international
[normal] meetings. These demands are not always compatible with a good work life balance and this is more of a concern to women.    
[normal]Collegiality is not supported or encouraged by any of the current academic assessment criteria e.g. REF. 
[normal]This may relate to the cur
[normal]rent system of how research output and thus someone’s value is measured.  
[normal]Women do not want to be seen as (too) competitive or aggressive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The difficulty of raising a family while building this career is often reported as appearing insurmountable.  Howe
[normal]ver, childcare issues can be solved by ‘throwing money’ at the situation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? 
[normal]Anecdotally, the types of choices we see are teaching, media/communication industry, charity work, childcare.  It 
[normal]is noticeable that most editors
[normal] of science journals are 
[normal]female as are the majority of staff in funding councils and charities like CR-UK, AICR,
[normal] Wellcome Trust, etc.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in differ
[normal]ent employment sectors?
[normal]We are losing highly trained people whose skills are lost to the scientific community.  This loss of diversity in creativity, thinking patterns, specialty talent, etc. maybe detrimental to our ability to generate the best solutions 
[normal]to the world’s problems.
[normal]There may be a benefit to having scientifically trained people move into other sectors – this could improve rigour of thought and practice and improve evidence-based decision-making and general scientific literacy of the 
[normal]population.  However, a move into other sectors should be the choice of an individual, and not be perceived
[normal] as a 
[normal]necessity.  If mostly women make such alternate choice, these other sectors will also start to suffer from lack of diversity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should uni
[normal]versities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice
[normal]?
[normal]More overt mentoring and support for women academics at all career level needs to be provided.
[normal]Universities should provide more targeted career advice to undergraduate students that emphasizes the career opportunities for women in academia.
[normal]Universities should prioritize funding schemes to support women at key stages of their career. For many academ
[normal]ics a critical point comes at child-bearing ages – postdoc level.  
[normal]A number of options can help here: 
[normal]Universities need to ensure that lea
[normal]ders and managers fully understand equality and diversity as it relates to gender issues.  For example University could have mandatory training programs.
[normal]Universities need to ensure that there is 
[normal]transparency and clarity about what is expected at all caree
[normal]r levels. Clarity about why decisions were made, is important. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It makes a huge difference when decisions are accompanied by explanations, particularly when the decisions have unpleasant consequences. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are many good examples of good practise that ar
[normal]e evaluated and collated by the Athena SWAN scheme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
[normal]The government should provide ring fenced funding to support University initiatives aimed at facilitating the careers of women academics.  For example, hiring technicians to support the research activities of female academics on maternity leave. 
[normal]The gover
[normal]nment should invest in social science research to identify why females in STEM subjects make career choices to leave academia.  This will inform about appropriate interventions.
[normal]The government should consider education in a minimum of two science subjects 
[normal]compulsory for all pupils until age 16.  This would increase the pool of women entering into STEM subjects.
