"Written evidence from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the Local Government Association (LTC 26)&#xa0;Background &#xa0;ADASS&#xa0;The\n Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) represents Directors of Adult Social Services in Local Authorities in England. As well as having statutory responsibilities for the commissioning and provision of social care, ADASS members often also share a number of responsibilities for the commissioning and provision of housing, leisure, library, culture, arts, community services and increasingly, Children’s Social Care within their Councils.\nLGAThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.\n \nWe work with and on behalf of our membership to promote support and improve local government. The 422 authorities that make up the LGA cover every part\n of England and Wales. Together, \nthey represent over 50 million people.\n \nThey include county councils, metropolitan district councils, English unitary authorities, London boroughs, shire district councils and Welsh unitary authorities, along with fire authorities, police authorities, national park authorities and passenger transport authorities.\n \nResponses:The scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectivenessThere are \nstrong and \nwidely acknowledged arguments for dis\ninvest\ning\n from acute\n services\n and reinvest\ning into community settings. H\nowever\n,\n a number of barriers restrict these opportunities\n. T\nhe\n financial models of Payment by Results and the tar\niff\n \ns\nystem, which reward\n acute activity\n, actually incentivise hospital trusts to maximise service take-up.\n \nMore fundamentally, it is beginning to be accepted that there are too many hospitals now, particularly those based on the traditional District General Hospital model, given the developments in primary, community and social care.\n \nThe challenges to resolving this are considerable; simply downsizing a hospital’s activity in order to reduce acute funding is rarely an option, as issues of clinical safety and the required staffing levels for accreditat\nion of services rapidly emerge\n. The real alternatives of reconfiguration and changing the roles of local groups of hospitals have always proved immensely difficult to engineer against public resistance.\n \nThese barriers are further hei\nghtened by significant budget pr\nessures within the whole system, limiting the opportuni\nty to switch funding \nor develop community based facilities in advance of reducing acute demand.\nOne way forward would be to create a tariff system for acute care which included the full end-to-end care pathway, pre-admission and post discharge, in order to incentivise a more holistic approach to clinical commissioning and service development.\nSupporting this,\n reforms of health and social care are pushing for greater integration, placing a stronger emphasis on prevention and early intervention and promoting a system-wide focus on improved outcomes for the individual set with an individual and local \ncommunity asset based approach\n.\n \nThe emphasis over the past period has been on speedier discharge, but as set out above th\nis needs to shift to prevent un\nnecessary admissions, sign posting people to other services, plus providing a range of “off the shelf” services which would poten\ntially support people to avoid unnecessary admissions\n to in-patient care i.e.\n 24/7 access to \nt\nele\nhealthcare\n, homecare, \nrespite \netc.\n without requiring in depth and bureaucratic assessments.\n \nThe Community Budget areas have shown us that this will require a joined up approach to leadership and shared cultures across the health and care system as well as sharing of individual data records so that people can be tracked and supported across the system. \nIn addition to improved tariff and incentive mechanisms, local areas will need to take a joint approach to the use of resources and develop joine\nd up commissioning arrangements\n and to make sure that resources are shifted from acute to preventative and community based services. Health and Wellbeing Boards\n (HWBs)\n, as the body with statutory responsibility to promote integration, will be crucial in holding the system together locally, promoting joined up working and enabling the best use of resources locally.\nThe LGA strongly supports this issue being addressed. It also features strongly in emerging Health and Wellbeing Boards’ priorities. We recognise too the political impact for council\nlors, MPs, Scrutiny and \nHealthw\natch\n partners.\nThe readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the communitySocial c\nare and the NHS have been working closely over a long period of ti\nme and there\n are \nmany examples of integrated commu\nnity based services and support\n. \nThese models and variations can readily be ada\npted to suit the management of long term c\nonditions. \nThe current reform\ns \nare helping to accelerate the pace and scale \nof these approaches with the Health and Wellbeing Boards being a new element in\n bringing local partners\n together to address local need. T\nhe shift\n of Public Health responsibilities\n to councils alongside the development of an integrated Outcomes Framework are catalysts to making community based integrated approaches the norm\n.\n \nADASS\n and the LGA are\n \ncurrently working closely with five\n other national partners (NH\nS England / DH /PHE / Monitor\n/ ADCS) through an Integrated Care Working Group (ICWG) to support the acceleration of the pace and scale of integrated community based preventative and early intervention services and support. This work is reporting directly to the Care Ser\nvices Minister\n and the\n partnership is considered a significant step\n.\nEqually, the development of Personal Health Budgets for all those with Continuing Healthcare funding provides an opportunity for personal budgets to be developed jointly with social care, pooling resources based on an individual need, which potentially could\n lead to the development of more\n clinical support, which may be more appropriate, deliver better outcomes and at reduced cost – arguably this is already happening in many areas. The real benefits will come by extending this approach beyond CHC e.g. mental health needs and support provi\nded by local community groups or \nthird sector\n organisations\n rather than medically led psychiatric services.\n \nOne of th\ne key messages for the NHS and social c\nare working together to support\n \nthose with long-term conditions\n is that integrated services must be designed from the bottom up, des\nigned around integrated health and\n social care personal support plans and the pathways of people through a local health and social care system.\nIt is not sufficient to develop joint services based purely upon organisational, managerial or structural integration.\n \nThere needs to be a holistic and whole-system approach.\nSuccessful and sustainable re-design requires the full engagement of front-line staff, managers, people who use services and their \ncarers\n.\n \nThere also has to be\n cultural change across organisations, facilitating multi-disciplinary\n working.\nThe practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditionsThe ICWG is set\nting a \"Common Purpose Framework\n\" (CPF) to describe the barriers to integration and establish national and local enablers to overcome these barriers. This will in\nclude commissioning guidance.\n \nADASS\n is working with the Kings Fund to produce gu\nidance for H\nealth and \nW\nellbeing \nB\noard\ns\n in integrating commissioning activity\n.\n \nADASS is \nalso \nsupporting and promoting a leadership \nprogramme to help Directors in their role in\n taking forward integration of commissioning and service provision.\n \nArguably much of the work already being p\nrogressed with Personalisation and \nT\nhink \nL\nocal \nA\nct \nP\nersonal(TLAP)\n promotes an approach which moves away the “professional gift” model – diagnosis and labels, to service u\nsers determining their needs and\n priorities, based on th\ne outcomes they want to achieve\n and arrangin\ng the support that they require\n and how it is \nprovi\nded.\nThere\n are many \nmajor national, regional or local third sector organisations \nworking with people with long term conditions and they\n will no doubt make their own submissions.\n \nParticularly at national level, they can be a valuable source of research into service integration, improved outcomes and examples of best practice from across the country.\nThe numbers of people dying in hospital has continued to rise whilst a number of surveys indicate that, given a choice, a large majority of people would choose to be cared for at home. Recent research by the Nuffield Trust reaffirmed the inter-relation of health and\n social care at the end of life\n and the need to provide a holistic approach focused around the individual and their needs and wishes. Social services have access to and make best use of local intelligence (health and social care data sets) to focus on the design and delivery of end of life care improvements in all sectors.\n \nEngagement with the emerging clinical consortia, comm\nissioning support organisations\n and health providers across acute and primary care settings, local hospices and local authorities is well developed to ensure the effective pooling of resources to facilitate the commissio\nning and design of new services\n with a clear understanding of the shared service improvement agenda.\nFinally, however, as noted above, the real-life experience of staff, patients and carers is \nan essential element of service re-designs\n and commissioners must access this experience as much as possible.\nThe ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditionsADASS\n and the LGA\n \nhave\n the longest history o\nf promoting person\nalisation within the public sec\ntor, which consid\ners \"outcomes\" over treatment, conditions and models of service\n.\n \nThis is reflected in the three outco\nmes for the NHS, Public Health and\n Adult Social Care, which can guide providers.\n \nPersonalisation i\ns being complemented by outcome-\nbased commissioning and more recently by the development of payment by results. These are driving\n a person centred approach.\nBoth the LGA and ADASS have supported National Voices and ‘Think Local Act Per\nsonal’ in the development of a n\narrative for integrated care an support, driven by patients and service users, that will help commissioners and providers to understand and respond to the needs of real people.\nThe ability to treat patients as people first is critically dependent upon the quality, skills and stability of the health and social care workforce.\n \nIn respect of supporting peopl\ne with long term conditions\n in the community, there is a great deal of guidance available for staff involved in personal care of any kind.\n \nOne example would be the ‘Common Care Principles for Self-Care’ developed by Skills for Health and Skills for Care, supported by ADASS through the Workforce Development Network.\n \nAlongside the Workforce Dev\nelopment S\ntrategies of the Department of Health and Skills for Care, ADASS has prompted the development of integrated workforce strategies at a local level (initially known as Integrated Local Area Workforce Strategies).\n \nMinimisation of staff turnover, as one example of a benefit, promotes continuity of carers on teams of carers for people, which in turn promotes greater dignity in the care arrangements.\nTaking a truly person centred approach to LTCs means c\nhanging the paradigm, so that people who use services are\n given more control of co-ordination and \nare expected and helped to take\n more\n responsibility for\n \nself-management\n. Coordinate My Care for end of life care seems a good example and has led to real shifts in practice and better outcomes. Alongside this, there are some real opportunities to use technology to help manage LTCs more effectively. This includes some of the “diagnostics” in telehealth but also some simple ways of being able to communicate regularly an\nd frequently with people who use services\n. The infrastructure of telecare has a lot to offer here. \nT\nhe concept of “pathways” can be as much of a hindrance\n as a \nhelp.\n B\ny definition many\n people who use\n of \nadult social care\n have several conditions, so then flooding them with specialists each with their \nown pathway to follow just makes life more complicated.\n \nADASS\n and the LGA\n would suggest that\n, we keep the core benefit of a “pathway” which is consistent and evidence based \ndecision making but have health and \nsupport plans much more based on the person. \nFinally it\n is important to \nrecognize the psychological aspects of these \n(l\nong term) \nconditions and to ensure that a support plan takes account of this: depression for example is a major determinant of how an out of hospital support plan works.\nObesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addressedThe movement of Public Health\n to local councils alongside \nthe \nadult social care\n focus upon wellbeing is creating the right conditions to bring the totality of local resources to bear upon hea\nlth inequalities and its\n causes. DASSs\n and Lead Members\n have generally a broad portfolio of servi\nces (often including leisure, housing and others) to draw upon and deal with \nthese challenges\n, particularly around prevention and social inclusion.\nSocial care services can support the reduction of obesity by always having regard to good nutritional advice and the benefits of any level of physical exercise or activity in both care planning and in service delivery.\n \nAwareness of nutritional\n issues is particularly important\n where a person may have some degree of restricted mobility.\n \nTraining in these areas for personal support planners would be beneficial, as would acce\nss for people with LTC\ns to local health p\nromotion services.\n \nThere have also been many examples across the country of councils working with the former Primary Care Trusts to develop ‘Leisure Centre Prescription Schemes’, and tackling obesity should be a shared prevention priority between councils and Clinical Commissioning Groups.\nObesity certainly features in Joint Strategic Needs Assessments, and is likely to be \na priority in the Joint Health and\n Wellbeing Strategies which have been developed.\n \nThese will in future be supported\n and monitored by the HWBs\n.\nCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditionsThere are multiple examples within social care where personalisation and use of personal budgets has led to a significant change both in improving the outcomes people are achie\nving, changes in the services and \nsupport they are accessing and the positive impact it has had upon their perc\neptions and experience. T\nhe Personal Budget Outcome Evaluation Tool (POET)\n survey \n2011 \nand associated report\n (\nattached in a link at the end of this submission\n) provides\n significant evidence ba\nsed on individuals’ experiences and\n examples.\nBest practice in end of life care within local authority services includes working with a wide range of stake holders such as hospices local colleges, social care providers including care homes, extra care schemes, domiciliary providers and supported living establishments.\n \nThese networks have allowed commissioners to develop innovative approaches and interventions to support a range of service user groups. The recent publication of the National End of Life \nprogramme ‘Sharing\n successf\nul strategies for implementing s\nupporting people to live and die well\n’\n highlights good\n \npractice across England demonstrates how effective integration can be to support people with long term conditions and in particular those people nearing the end of their life.\nThere is a 30 year tradition of multi-disciplinary working in the\n Community Mental Health Teams and\n Community Learning Disability Teams developed initially to support the closures of long-st\nay hospitals from the late 1970\ns, early 1980\ns and beyond.\n \nMuch of the learn\ning from these\n team\ns\n, in terms of differing professional cultures, the need for joint training, addressing different assessment systems and processes, is still relevant today in developing integrated working.\nIn general terms, there are many current examples of integrated working, which\n will include services for people with LTC’s.\n \nTorbay has often been cited for i\nts integrated community health and\n social care services, and North East Lincolnshire re\nmained the only ‘Care Trust Plu\ns’ in the county, with adult social care services delivered within the NHS on behalf of the council.\n \nIn Greenwich, the Royal Borough has developed award-winning integrated services with the community health services of the \nOxleas\n Foundation Trust.\n \nThese are based on a single point of access, a joint emergency response, integrated hospital discharge teams, community asses\nsment and rehabilitation teams and\n intermediate care at home teams.\n \nIn respect of long-term conditions, there is clear evidence of improved quality of life, with reductions in emergency admissions and outpatient appointments (as well as significant financial gains).\nThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demandThe ADASS\n Budget survey shows 3% demograph\nic pressures (about £400m pa ), with\n se\nrvices being stretched,\n \nwith fewer\n people receiving services but a\nt higher cost and intensity. \nThis points\n to an urgency to consider a whole system approach facilitating switching resources from acute to p\nrimary preventative services. \nUnlike when the NHS was set up 65 years ago, now more than half of GP appointments\n and two-thirds of outpatient Accident and \nE\nmergency\n visits are for people with long-term illnesses and conditions.\nThis group, many of whom are older people, are now responsible for 70% of the total health and care budget, over £70bn every year and that number is growing.\n \nEqually, when \ndiscussing the\n aging population we naturally concentrate on the older age group, but there are also si\nmilar issues with substantial \ngrowth in younger people with significant disabilities living much longer, which is fantastic, but presents equally significant challenges in the support they require.\nA major element of the growing demand for services to older people is the increased prevalence of dementia.\n \nThis need and the necessary response \nare\n comprehensively covered in the National Dementia Strategy, to which ADASS\n and LGA\n contributed.\n \nIt is clear\n that the progression of dementia can be slowed\n and early diagnosis magnifies the benefits of any subsequent interventio\nn.\n \nThe\n \nNational Dementia Strategy takes a social model of disability: so “living well” does not really rely over much on health ser\nvices and \nrecognis\nes\n the importance of housing, technology, combating stigma,\n dementia friendly communities,\n \nasking the wider community what it can do\n. Another proposal would be to involve the Design Council in innovation.\nFinally\n, there\n is a need to recognise increases in demand\n for services for people who suffer strokes, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.\n Timely and expert treatment can increase longevity, limit disability and promote quality of life.\nThe interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditionsThe correlations between lo\nng-term and various aspects of mental h\nealth, particularly depressive illnesses are well-known.\n \nThis can lead to a self-perpetrating set of interactions such as social withdrawal and reduced mobility, self-neglect, poor nutrition or increasing problems with smoking, drugs or alcohol.\nThe interaction of mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions is well evidenced and reflected in the mental health strategy ' \nNo health without mental health'. \nPoor mental health has a negative impact on \npeople’s\n long term health care needs and it is estimated that people with long term conditions \nare 2\n-3 times more likely to experience mental health problems than the general population. \nEvidence suggests that there is a strong negative impact on recovery and management of long term conditions for those people who also have mental health needs. This manifests itself in longer periods of time spent in hospital, poor outcomes and lower quality of life. If mental health problems are left untreated, this will also impact negatively on people's ability to self-manage their long term condition (such as diabetes) with people lacking the motivation and ability to do this. \nWhat is \nneeded is\n strong collaboration be\ntween primary and mental health\n \ncare \nwith services wrapped around the person rather than conditions. ADASS has worked with the Royal College of Psychiatrists to produce a position paper calling for pooled personal budgets alongside int\negrated assessments across NHS and\n social care, and integrated support plans.\n \nIdeally this could support both the mental health and physical health needs of individuals. \nThe extent to which patients are being offered personalised services (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes) I\nn\n many respects, the introduction of the Independent Living Fund (ILF) in 1988 could be seen as a major early milestone in the development of a personalised approach to supporting disabled people.\n \nWell ahead of the community care reforms, the introduction of Direct Payments and a commitment to universal availability of personal budgets, the ILF allowed people to create their own personalised care arrangements using direct purchasing power.\n \nThe ILF has contributed to major developments such as the support for employment of Personal Assistants, and the role of user-led organisations in advocating for, supporting and providing local services.\nThe personal budgets approach is ideal \nfor support for people with LTC\ns, allowing greater choice and control of care arrangements.\n \nLong-term condition\ns were a natural focus for the\n piloting of Personal Health Budgets.\nIt is arguable that the recent review of ILF has concluded that given the progress of personalisation and prevalence of personal budgets in adult social care, IL\nF Funding should transfer to LA\ns to\n be\n managed in a single \napproach\n based around the individual. Arguably this\n would also provide LA\ns the opportunity to review and revise the allocation of such resources based on need\n.\nAttached to this response is a\n link to\n the 2011 National Personal Budget Survey published by TLAP. \nhttp://www.thinklocalactpersonal.org.uk/_library/Resources/Personalisation/Personalisation_advice/2011/POET_surveys_June_2011_-_EMBARGOED.pdf\nThe 2012 version will be published at the end of May. Below is an excerpt from the executive summary for the 2012 National Personal Budget Survey:\n“\nThere is an increasing body of evidence across health and social care that personal budgets have the potential to improve social care and well-being outcomes, for people with long term conditions. This was the clear conclusion of the Personal Health Budgets pilot independent evaluation published in late 2012 and is consistently demonstrated in social care by councils using the Personal Budgets Outcomes Evaluation tool (POET). It will be important to take personal budgets forward across health and social care as a key element of the integration agenda in support of people with long term conditions\"\n. \nMay 2013 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
