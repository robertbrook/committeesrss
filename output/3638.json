"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n  Nancy Neville (HSR 021)\n&#xa0;\nWe are in danger of making a serious public policy misjudgment on the issue of HS2 for the following reasons\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government has not set out the objectives that the \nHS2 scheme is meant to address;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government ar\nguments in favour of HS2 are ex \npost facto rationalisation of a project approved for other reasons\n and\n not made public;\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe cost-benefit methodology is flawed. It embeds the status quo (pre-eminence of Lo\nndon) where \none\n of the government’s ad hoc arguments claim\ns\n to want to change this, ie the north-south divide\n&#xa0;\nGOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES\nAt various different times the public has been told that HS2 is good for various different\n things.  First there was \nthe lar\nge infrastructure project to spend us out of recession. Next there was the wasted value of time on trains followed by overcrowding \non the line \nand finally the healing of the north-south divide in income and property \ninequality\n.\n&#xa0;\nBy not specifying what this\n project is meant to achieve, \nand of course it is acceptable to have several reasons if they are all genuine, \nthe case both for and against has been unclear and targeted to special interests.  Without knowing what we are trying to achieve, how can we know \nwhether HS2 will achieve them?  This is different from doing a cost-benefit analysis.  This is about identifying public good and finding a way in which to achieve it.\nFar from being able to make a trade-off b\netween country-wide benefits versus\n damage to th\ne environment, inefficient spending and a brain drain to London\n we do not know what the benefits are and why HS2 has been chosen as the spending project of the moment. T\nhe opposition knows exactly what the cost will be.  In fact, the only proper costing ha\ns been on the side of the opposition to HS2.  Given this, it would be rash to move any further ahead with the project at this stage.\n&#xa0;\nEX-POST FACTO RATIONALISATION\nIn a \nfrank\n statement\n to the FT in September\n, Peter Mandelson made clear that the project as \nput forward by the previous government was an idea arrived at when \nsearching\n for big infrastructural projects that would help to spend us out of recession.  As one of the industries most hard hit was construction, this lined up nicely and was put forward w\nithout any further specification or costing.  It is unclear why the present government picked up the idea \nwhen times changed and the objectives (or \nat least the government’s defenc\ne) changed\n. Several new ‘reasons’ were put forward. The time-savings argumen\nt needs no rebuttal, it was \nembarrassing to hear it put forward and refutes itself on any reflection.\n&#xa0;\nWhat of the argument that \nHS2 would\n reduce crowding on the line?  I would need to know first, what of the other three lines cut from London to Birmingham\n (via Reading, from Marylebone and along the M1 corridor).  We are told a new line needs to be cut in order to be straight.  Why is straight necessary to relieve overcrowding? Why does it need to be high speed to reduce overcrowding? How does the cost of H\nS2 compare to putting longer trains on the line, running more trains, using all three existing routes in to Birmingham efficiently.\n&#xa0;\nThe most objectionable \nrationale\n in favour is the one that it will heal the north-south divide. It is interesting that at t\nhe same time the British government is claiming that rail investment from London to the north will regenerate the north, the mayor of Paris is proposing rail to grande Paris in order to benefit Paris, ie bringing more workers in to the city and away from t\nhe (nearby) regions. Also, the Shinkansen i\nn Japan has aided development at\n the two terminals \nTokyo and Nagasaki \nbut economic activity in between has reduced significantly.\n Clearly a better model is needed to understand the changes in behavioural patterns \nas a result of the change in both high-speed rail\n.  Further analysis would be needed to model behaviour given\n the reduction (in HS2’s own forecast) of local trains.\n Would local communities be hurt, would people use their cars more in consequence, would we \nneed to subsidise fuel because we have forced people to travel by car etc.\n&#xa0;\nTHE PROBLEM WITH COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS\nThe cost-benefit analysis is a flawed methodology and this becomes most apparent when considering the ‘benefits’ to the north argument. \n&#xa0;\nIt is not always possible in a public policy project to align the costs and the benefits but if they do align then the project is most easily supported.  \nHS2 could do this\n:  build the high-speed link from the north to the north.  Why not a high-speed link (if that is what you want) from Birmingham to Liverpool and Newcastle or Edinburgh and Glasgow?  If this were done then the same people who bear the cost of the line throu\ngh disruption due to construction, environmental damage, etc would also get the most benefit through connectivity.  \nThere may also be synergies that would allow companies to work with other companies in the region and to bypass London.  \nI do not know if th\nis is a good idea but I know that the costs and benefits fall more nearly on the same population. It may\n be worth exploring as mitigation of the north-south inequality.\n It at least removes one major objection that the benefits, if they exist, go to London \nand terminal cities and the costs are borne in areas of outstanding natural beauty in the Chilterns, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, f\nor an\ny\n infras\ntructural project of this size in the UK \nit requires the nume\nrical advantages of London\n to be positiv\ne\n: \nit needs to be\nnefit London to tip the benefit-to-\ncost balance.  \nLondon has the numbers of people, the value of land, the proportion of GDP to attribute to a project to\n make it appear worthwhile. \n \nIT HAS TO BENEFIT LONDON\n.  In this case\n, if London does n\not benefit then even if it makes sense for the north conceptually, cost-benefit analysis will not be sufficiently positive.  Cost-benefit analysis cannot be used for projects which attempt to change the status-quo. \nThis will always be the \ncase with cost-be\nnefit analysis:\n It reinforces the position you are in now\n and cannot be used to justify a new order\n. \nHow do you benefit the regions when you\n need the project to benefit Lo\nndon to make it work out?  This is the flaw. The government claims to want to benefi\nt regions but to make the project show a positive benefit it needs to benefit London and the argument is circular and cannot do what the government claims.\n&#xa0;\nOf course, if this is not an objective of the project, and if the status quo is not to be changed, \nthen my objection to cost-benefit analysis does not apply.  We do not know the objectives of the project, the government has not put them forward. First, the government must make clear what problems it is trying to solve with 50 billion pounds.\n&#xa0;\nI hold a B\natchelor’s degree\n in mathemati\ncs from Dartmouth College and a\n \nMaster of P\nublic \nP\nolicy from Harvard University.  \nI have spent years both in my education and work applying cost-benefit analysis and decision trees to projects primarily in energy policy and th\ne environment in the UK, Europe and the US. I feel I have had sufficient experience to comment here on the difficulties of using cost-benefit analysis.  I believe that HS2 as it is currently configured is poor public policy and much needs to be done before\n a proper decision can be made.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
