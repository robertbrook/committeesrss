defaultPlantlife is the organisation that is speaking up for our wild flowers, plants and fungi. From the open spaces of our nature reserves to the corridors of government, we’re here to raise their profile, to celebrate their beauty, and to protect their future. Wild flowers and plants play a fundamental role for wildlife, and their colour and character light up our landscapes. But without our help, this priceless natural heri
defaulttage is in danger of being lost, with non-native 
defaultinvasive species 
defaultposing a major threat
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultPlantlife welcome
defaults
default the opportunity to send a written response to the 
defaultEnvironmental Audit Committee's inquiry on Invasive Species
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlantlife has produced a publication of 
default'non-native invasive species to avoid'
default which includes species not currently on 
defaultSchedule 9 of
default 
defaultthe Wildlife and Countryside
default 
defaultAct
default that we believe should be. This was based on the 
defaultHorizon-scanning for invasive non
default-native plants in Great Britain
default 
defaultrepor
defaultt
default, whether species are currently available on the market, and the nature of how a species spreads in the wild. This publication gives an indication of the plant species Plantlife believes are of most concern and where listing on Schedule 9, or another mechanism, is an appropriate action to take.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlantlife support the
default UK’s position on 
defaultremoving
default the cap on the number of species to be included on the EU list,
default as Plantlife strongly believes the list should represent and address the scale of the environmental issue. Capping the list of IAS at 50 when there are at least 1200 across Europe will not make a strong enough impact on this growing problem and one that is causing significant harm to biodiversity. Plantlife 
defaultsupport the
default Wildlife and Countryside Link position
default 
defaultof producing
default one regularly reviewed species list, composed of two components, which is directly incorporated within the Regulation, albeit ‘empty’ in the first instance. Part 
defaultO
defaultne should be composed of species which are alien to the EU
default as a whole
default, and for which measures apply to all Member States with no opt out on basic legislative measures (e.g. bans). Part 
defaultT
defaultwo should be populated by species which are native 
defaultwithin
default parts of the EU but invasive 
defaultin
default other parts. For th
defaulte
defaultse 
defaultlatter 
defaultspecies, the list should contain an indication of the Member States/regions where the species is non-native, and the Regulation should apply in those areas only. Member States where the species is native can legitimately decide to trade or otherwise use the species, but may need to adopt measures to prevent the species from being transported by human agency elsewhere.

defaultPlantlife
default 
defaultalso 
defaultsupport the
default Wildlife and Countryside Link position
default that a regional approach 
defaultw
defaultould be better achieved through enhanced cooperation between 
defaultaffected 
defaultMember States through Risk Assessments and a spatially literate action plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlantlife's primary concern is to prioritise action on those non-native invasive species having a detrimental impacts on wild plants in 
defaultImportant Plant Areas
default and so our criteria of highest weighting is biodiversity.

default,
default can
default be found on the Plantlife website. B
defaultiodiversity, human health and economic considerations
default are all important criteria however, the weighting of their importance will mainly depend on the nature of a species and the nature of its impacts.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlantlife fully support the precautionary principle approach and submit that it 
defaultmust be enshrined within 
defaultboth national and international
default legislation. Those who intentionally or recklessly allow known 
defaultnon-native invasive species of concern
default to become established or invade should contribute to the action 
defaultnecessary to remedy the problem
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe balance between the different strands (
defaultdetection, prevention, containment/adaptation or eradication
default)default 
defaultwill need a case by case response and will need to be proportionate to the problem. Different species with different traits need different approaches. In addition, whether a species is already present in the country, if it is widespread or in a few locations, or whether it has the potential to arrive will determine which of these strands is the priority for that species. For example, it may be that total eradication should be prioritised for sites of particular conservation / wildlife value such as Important Plant Areas, SSSIs, SAC, SPA, National Parks etc. However, eradication on the national or even regional scale may not be an option. While early detection and prevention into the country is the ideal, both from an environmental and economic perspective, and should be the priority for potentially invasive non native species; it may also be necessary to prioritise the prevention and spread of some species that are already present within the country from getting into another catchment, or into sites of conservation importance. Similarly, some species may only be in a few locations so a national eradication plan can be the priority.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlantlife support the approach of listing the harmful species to tackle as on an EU scale listing safe species would be too complicated when there are many different biogeography regions to consider
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn place of trying to identify areas of conflict Plantlife suggest identifying the environmental obligations that would be complimented and achieved through tackling invasive non native species such as the Water Framework Directive, Target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Target 10 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and  biodiversity duty under the 
defaultNatural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act
default and the 
defaultNature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004
default.
defaultPlantlife fully supports Member States being able to 
defaultadopt more stringent measures as and when they see fit,
default and thus support the UK position on that. The EU IAS Regulation should not (and seemingly does not) prohibit Member States from taking further action. 
defaultWithin the UK, the devolved administrations have different legislative approaches to non nati
defaultve invasive species and the GB 
defaultInvasive Strategy and EU IAS Regulation must continue to allow for flexibility in approach.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction and spread of non-native invasive species is directly comparable to that of some plant disease pathways, and those associated with trade are 
defaultagreed to be 
defaultbest tackled through legislation and regulation.  Trade partners often express the need for a statutory framework against which 
defaultthey can
default make clear business decisions and 
defaultwhich can
default drive forward the development of new markets.

defaultEngland and Wales 
defaultcould learn from the Scottish experience
default with respect to
default:
default 
default8.1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIssuing an order to require specified individuals (whether by type of person or individual identity) to notify the competent authority of the presence of specified invasive non-native species. 
default&#xa0;
default8.1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIssuing 
defaultspecies control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 should be adopted by a new legal regime. The introduction of statutory backing, such as Species Control Orders, for specific bodies should enable them to take reasonable action to control, contain or eradicate invasive species outside of their native range, including on privately owned land where landowners are not taking adequate action to prevent their spread.
default8.1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsuring the precautionary 
defaultapproach to the release of non-native species 
defaultis adhered to
default: it is currently illegal only to plant/cause to grow in the wild those invasive non-native plants which are listed on Schedule 9 Part
default II.
