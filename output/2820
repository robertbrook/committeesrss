[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our responses to the questions in the Call for Evidence are set out below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How [bold]resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]M.A.G airports have taken steps to ensure that, as far as possible, flights can continue operating safely during periods of snowfall. 
[normal]All M.A.G
[normal] airports ha
[normal]ve a comprehensive Winter Operations Plan, 
[normal]which comes into effect on 1 November 
[normal]following consultation with airfield tenants. The plan explains what preparations have been made to deal with extreme winter weather, and sets out roles and responsibilities.
[normal] 
[normal]It also 
[normal]includes a detailed set of crisis management plans in the event of severe disruption
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Stansted Airport’s plan is subject to rigorous testing programmes, including summer desktop exercise run jointly with airlines, handling agents and operational t
[normal]eams. A Terminal Welfare Plan, also operated in conjunction with airlines, sets out roles and responsibilities for passenger information, provisions, facilities and hotels and rebooking.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Winter Operations Plan is reviewed annually and
[normal] improvements added based on lessons learned
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]the Terminal team at Manchester have carried out additional work this year to make the passenger welfare element more robust. This included working with procurement colleagues to look at how to sec
[normal]ure additional supplies at short notice; working with Manchester City Council to pool resources; reviewing communications, such as use of passenger information screens; and working closely with retail colleagues to ensure the availability of food, drink an
[normal]d essentials.
[normal] 
[normal]Our terminal and operations teams also draw on best practice from other European airports.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Work is 
[normal]also 
[normal]underway at Manchester to explore how to ensure the safety and well-being of colleagues, but looking at how they can get into work, e.g. 
[normal]advance booking of hotels for operation critical colleagues and call out groups for those living close by.
[normal]What lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10? What practical changes have been made to ensure the UK [bold]is now better equipped to deal with severe weather?[bold]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]M.A.G airports have invested substantially in snow clearing equipment since the severe 2009-10 winter (see below for details). Lessons learned included increased supplies of and storage areas for road sal
[normal]t and de-icer; improvements to crisis management systems and changes to weather forecasting information, to allow for more accurate forecasting.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite extensive preparation and investment
[normal], constant snowfall remains a significant challenge. Just 3mm of snow on the ground sees airfield operations slow down and constant snowfall makes any clearing operation 
[normal]prolonged and challenging
[normal].
[normal] Manchester Airport has invested in equipment to monitor the
[normal] ground temperature (snow will melt if the ground is warmer than freezing) which means that 
[normal]appropriate airfield anti
[normal]-icing 
[normal]action
[normal] can be 
[normal]undertaken
[normal] 
[normal]in a timely and efficient manner, thus preserving operational continuity.
[normal]How well prepared are the Governm[bold]ent, local authorities and transport providers for adverse winter weather? What more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?[bold]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have observed that during periods of bad weather improvements do appear to have been made to procedures for major roads
[normal] (motorways and trunk roads) to keep them clear, though some problems continue on A and B roads, impacting on airport colleagues getting to and from work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]East Midlands Airport
[normal] is a member of the LRF Severe Weather Group which coordinates the response to inclement weather 
[normal]across the County. 
[normal]All main roads leading to 
[normal]Bournemouth
[normal] Airport 
[normal]a
[normal]re gritted and maintained by 
[normal]the C
[normal]ounty Council and 
[normal]details of the various routes covered are
[normal] available on their website
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At Stansted, all private roads and car parks within the airport boundary are gritted, maintained and managed by Stansted Airport Limited, all other primary and secondary roads are managed by Essex County Council and in the cas
[normal]e of the M11, the Highways Agency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Stansted Airport works in partnership with Local Authorities, Government Agencies and surface access providers through the airport’s Transport Forum to ensure all necessary steps are taken to prepare for and manage incid
[normal]ences of inclement weather. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Manchester Airport has a good working relationship with Manchester City Council, who are responsible for gritting the main access roads to the site. Onsite roads
[normal] and pavements are looked after by Manchester Airport’s landside 
[normal]team, who pre-treat the area in advance of anticipated snowfall.
