defaultPreamble 
defaultAs the committee may be aware there have been 
defaulta number of 
defaultempirical and qualitative studies on 
defaultthe subject matter of collaboration and savings potential pan public sector
default. The common 
defaultconclusions 
defaultare often
default the recognition of
default variability 
defaultin potential 
defaultacross expenditure categories, the relative ‘starting positions’ across local government and
default the willingness/fitness
default for purpose of collaboration in a range of circumstances
default all impacting the assessment
default. 
defaultESPO believes that as well as the typical understanding of the term ‘savings’  as an improved price point via collaboration, it is important to recognise the broader, sometimes hidden costs. These include the cost of undertaking procurement itself, the value of enhanced management information to guide strategic decision making and the cost avoidance that is associated with costs of poor procurement.
defaultAs a result of this complex context 
defaultESPO deliberately does not make a ‘savings promise’ 
defaultsuch as a return for every pound spent through its procurement solutions. I
defaultnstead 
defaultthe demonstration of value is in positive 
defaultengage
defaultment 
defaultwith local government
default to
default understand opportunity and act as a delivery 
defaultagent for realising it. The case study below is an example of this approach which has delivered a saving of circa 4% on a major area of LG expenditure.
defaultCase Study: A National Framework for Temporary Staff (MSTAR) defaultBackground
defaultIn
default April 2011
default 
defaultan
default 
defaultESPO led 
defaultPro5 framework 
defaultagreement for the supply chain management for the provision of t
defaultemporary 
default(agency) labour
default was 
defaultestablished 
defaultby ESPO a
defaults a replacement for a previous localised contract. The contract was let to cover a four year period.
defaultOne of the drivers was that t
defaulthe Local Government Professional Services Group (LGPSG) had been tasked with exploring best practices and identifying and establishing procurement solutions
default in this market
default. The LGPSG identified the need for a national framework for temporary staffing to be established by local government for local government. 
defaultPro5
default were asked to run such a procurement exercise and through consultation with our Pro5 partners, ESPO agreed to lead the
default procurement
default exercise.
defaultThe key drivers for establishing the new framework were
default:
defaultThe Department for Education (DfE) w
defaultas
default also exploring the potential for reducing significant spend in
default the Education staffing arena. 
defaultSchools had similar pressures to local government and the wider public sector in facing budget cuts, whilst being expected to deliver services; coupled with the essential requirement to ensure 
defaultthe 
defaultsafeguarding of children.  The DfE was very keen to join this collaborative process and wished to include its requirements into the overall solution.  
defaultAn exte
defaultnsive procurement project followed with
default emphasis on aspects which were identified as being key: project management, collaboration/consultation, and communication. The project was completed over a period of 12 months and a framework established with 11 suppliers covering 6 lots offering neutral and master vendor solutions. The framework 
defaultis 
defaultknown as MSTAR (Managed Services for Temporary Agency Resources).
defaultESPO has established and continues to undertake a robust framework management programme. Regular supplier and customer engagement activities are carried out and management information is captured and presented to stakeholders on a quarterly basis via e-mail newsletters and the Local Government Association Knowledge Hub.
defaultSavings
defaultUnder the MSTAR framework there is a wide selection of management information received from suppliers. This covers the core elements relating to contract spend and savings achieved
default as a result of paying lower agency margins
default, and also the finer details ranging from invoice accuracy to hours process
defaulted
default against each job category. The 
defaultdata reuirement
default arose from the initial MSTAR tender, where ESPO engaged with 
defaultits
default stakeholders to establish what information would be useful and required by the parties. 
defaultM
defaultanagement information is received from suppliers on a quarterly basis, against the financial year, and ESPO then collate and analyse this
default information by way of contract 
defaultmanagement.
default 
defaultBased on the management information received, the collective spend across all customers is 
defaultalready 
default£434.8mdefault and the collective savings are 
default£19.9mdefault. This information covers the life of the framework to date (April 2011 to October 2013).

defaultTestimonials:
default“Bracknell Forest are pleased to have achieved savings of approx
defaultimately
default 14% during quarter four of the 2012/13 financial year under the MSTAR framework, as a result of reduced margins and process efficiencies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe MSTAR framework gave the Council an alternative approach to the sourcing and procurement of Agency Workers.
default&#xa0;
default Our Managed Service Provider has worked hard to aggregate spend 
defaultand
default to ensure that the supply chain meets all of the Councils requirements, and this has been achieved through hard work on both the Council and suppliers side during implementation, as alternative suppliers had to be sourced in the absence of agreements in place with many of our historical suppliers.
default&#xa0;
defaultUsing the MSP’s web based system has improved the reporting information available 
defaultand
default has given the Council much greater confidence in meeting AWR requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe hope that the contract continues to perform and deliver year on year savings by offering 
defaulta consistent and reliable approach to the hire of temporary agency workers.”
defaultClaire Garton from Bracknell Forest Councildefault“MSTAR has consistently generated savings for Gloucestershire County Council, with current indications being around 16% over £750,000 per quarter, in addition to promoting regional / national benchmarking and continuous service improvement.
default&#xa0;defaultAs an example of national collaboration the framework delivered by ESPO should be regarded as the ultimate blue print.
default&#xa0;
default The contract is flexible enough to encompass user requirements on a national scale but focussed enough to deliver significant savings.
default&#xa0;
default ESPO spent considerable time and resource ensuring they really listened to their Local Authority customers in setting up this framework and this has certainly paid dividends.”
defaultClaire Smart from Gloucestershire County Councildefault&#xa0;defaultConcluding Comments
defaultESPO has many case study examples of multiple benefits being derived as a result of collaborative procurement. These can stem from aggregated volume, aggregation of ‘know how’ and market experience cross sector, an ability to be able invest the required time and effort in pre-market engagement that lead to the running of well-conceived procurement processes. ESPO’s cost recovery in this case study is between 1p and 2p in the hourly rate. This represents as little as 0.0015% to 0.003% (based on a worker receiving the national minimum wage).
defaultESPO has not concluded that an absence of mandating or unwillingness of local government to collaborate is acting as a barrier to the non-achievement of latent savings that would stem from collaboration. Indeed ESPO is itself the result of a successful collaboration over three decades between seven local government authorities. Collaboration is commonly viewed as one of a number of tools and on the whole is a sensibly utilised tool.
defaultGovernment figures are sometimes criticised as being ‘optimistic’ in the scale of cashable savings directly attributed to just collaboration;
default however, they undoubtedly provide an indicative understanding of the potential.
