"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission from AIC &#xa0;&#xa0;SummaryAIC represents the UK agricultural supply industry, companies involved in the \nmanufacture and \nsupply of inputs\n and advice\n to producers and the purchase of combinable crops from farms.\n  \nAIC’s membership \nconsists predominantly of SME’s.\n&#xa0;\nIn submitting evidence to the Committee’s 2009 enquiry, \nAIC h\ne\nld the view that \n“… \nthe UK food system is robust and in the primary chain has worked hard together in recent years to develop independently audited and accredit\ned assurance schemes which have supported a robust system but which have also added transparency.  AIC believes therefore that the industry is well placed to respond to the challenges which will arise in the next 40 years.\n”  Our view today has not changed \nand the systems we referred to in 2009 remain in place and have been developed and refined since.\n&#xa0;\nThere have however been some significant changes to the landscape since 2009, not least the \ndetermination made at EU level to base its decision making process on the assessment of hazard, rather than risk.  This has, and will \ncontinue \nover the coming years, \nto \nremove a large number of active ingredients from the EU marketplace and therefore \ngiv\ne \nthe EU agricultural industry\n considerable difficulties in meeting the requirements for food security which the EFRA Committee, and others, might wish to see.\n&#xa0;\nOne of the major concerns which AIC has, looking forward to some of the targets being discussed o\nver the next 30-40 years, is the focus they place on the need for increased production.  Whilst it is imperative that we look forward in that way, and recognise the importance technology will play in that, there is currently a lack of focus on the challeng\nes which are placed in the way of the industry accessing technologies.  At a more fundamental level the impact of the hazard to risk issue, raised earlier, \nmeans that industry is also not able to retain existing technology.  AIC is, with the support of oth\ner bodies in the agricultural sector, just embarking on project to determine the cumulative impact of threats faced by UK agriculture in the near future whilst at the same time evaluating the opportunities and access to them.  Part of this work has to be a\n fundamental re-evaluation of the legislative decision making processes within the EU system which places a robust scientific assessment at the heart of determining the introduction of new technologies into the EU farming structure.\n&#xa0;\nAgain as in 2009, \nAIC \nwould place the industry’s access to technology at the heart of future strategy.  \nIt remains a central point that use of \ntechnologies will be dependent on consumer acceptance \nand we welcome the recognition, through the Agri-Tech Strategy, of the need to lo\nok at \naccess to technology a\nlongside\n a functioning and properly funded agricultural science base.  \nWhere progress still needs to be made is in the recognition by government of\n the role played in transferring science knowledge into practical on-farm applications\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubmission&#xa0;\nAIC is the UK’s leading representational body for the agricultural supply industry.  Representing companies involved in the manufacture and supply of ferti\nli\ns\ners and animal feeds, the purchase and marketing of combinable crops and the supply of seeds, agrochemicals and feed materials to UK farmers.  AIC represents both private and farmer controlled businesses.  The annual turnover of member businesses is app\nroximately £7.\n5\n billion.\n&#xa0;\nSpecific Questions\n&#xa0;\nHow best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficientlyWe very much welcome the Committee’s recognition that issues such as food security are improved through the efficient us\ne of resource rather than talking about a reduction in resource use – which may well be counter-productive from a security point of view.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst much of the answer lies in the quality of information and advice obtained by individual producers, there is a \nrole for legislation to play \nin terms of the flexibility it can offer.  Whilst we support the development at EU level of a framework in which people can operate, there should be a continuing role for interpretation at a national \nlevel which provides a degr\nee of flexibility in how best legislation can be used to deliver a desired outcome.  We have seen an example in the UK, where ironically the lack of flexibility comes from the devolution legislation than from the EU, which does not allow the application of\n less mobile plant nutrients (eg. potassium and potash) at certain times of the year because these nutrients come in a form which contains a small amount of nitrogen  - which is itself restricted in closed periods.   A pragmatic approach allows the applica\ntion as it delivers the most sensible outcome and recognises the lack of a negative impact of nitrogen at the levels involved.  A strict interpretation however prohibits the right result being achieved in order to stay within the letter, rather than the sp\nirit, of the law.\n&#xa0;\nOne of the concerns \nto have\n been highlighted by a number of commentators recently is the gap in performance between those producers at the top of the table and those \nfurther down.  Whilst there are many who believe the solution to this is simply to throw more money at projects which demonstrate particular advances, this approach misunderstands the \nmotives of the prospective audience, the farmer.\n  Interpretation of rese\narch advances, packaging of such into actions that can be taken onto farm and the knowledge transfer involved in seeing a change in farmer \nactivity/ best practice all requires individual knowledge of the farm, the aspirations and motivation of the farmer a\nnd therefore the most appropriate way in which changes can be made.  This is particularly important in relation to those farmers who are more reluctant than others to attend events.  Knowledge transfer is therefore critical to the efficient use of resource\n and requires practical, rather than just theoretical, knowledge of its on-farm application.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing itAIC is not sufficiently qualified to answer this question other than to suggest that with\nin the primary agriculture and food chain, which includes to the point of first processing (eg. flour miller, animal feed manufacturer etc.), the industry operates on very low margins, usually considerably below the 5% figure recently quoted in the area of\n power generation and supply.  This results in a competitive marketplace and ensures the costs of raw materials entering \nthe food manufacturing chain represent an efficient supply chain.\nOur greater concern from the perspective of food security is how that\n cost of production might alter in the coming years.  AIC is embarking on a study over the next 12-18 months to look at the cumulative costs which the production industry is facing, both in terms of restrictions on access to new technologies and loss of ex\nisting technologies/ products.  This will impact not only our ability to produce agricultural product at a cost which is competitive in a world market but also our ability to meet the increased production aspirations which governments and others have ident\nified as the consequence of the growing population and the need for ‘sustainable intensification’.\n&#xa0;\nWe remain happy to provide the Committee with more details of the rationale behind this work as appropriate. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food securityIn the UK food security is inextricably linked to global production, demand and supply, and must be considered in this broader context. As such, the UK already experiences shocks to its food system. For example, \nthe price spikes of 2008 and a 5.2 per cent rise in the average UK food bill between July 2010 and July 2011\n. \nWhen we think about the sustainability, safety and resilience of UK food imports, we must consider challenges which range from those with a local \nor UK national focus to more wide-ranging European and global issues. These are points highlighted by the Global Food Security Programme (2012).\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability can contribute to increased resilienceOver the past 20 years in the combinable crops supply chain as an example, there has been a marked increase in the level of activity that the chain has taken collectively.  We would cite the Cereal Liaison Group, facilitated by the HGCA, as a very \ngood example of how the chain has worked effectively to deal with issues within the chain and support activities that have helped to improve co-ordination of issues within the chain and, thereby, the expected resilience of the chain.  We are aware of other\n initiatives in other chains where the different parts of the chain are increasingly working together to identify future issues\n.  We believe the Committee should encourage more of this sort of activity using existing and established representative bodies a\nt both farming and trade level as a conduit through which information can be shared with a much wider group of players than would be the case \nwith centrally tendered government initiatives which do little other than reach a fraction of the intended audienc\ne.\n&#xa0;Whether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security, strategies and planningAs highlighted in the Foresight Report (2011) changing climatic conditions present risks to food production including impacts on crop growth and livestock performance, the availability of water and the functioning of ecosystem services. \nChanging climate ma\ny also lead to changes in the distribution and/or severity of pests and diseases, as well as impacting pollinator number\ns\n. \nIncreasing climate and environment related disruptions will affect UK food supply in terms of price, choice and availability. \nTherefo\nre it is vital that climate change risks are incorporated in food security policy.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new marketsNot comprehensive, but these would include\n:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Ways of increasing self sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantageAs demonstrated by Defra stat’s over the years t\nhe UK\n’s self-sufficiency has consistently declined \nfrom \nalmost 80% in 1984 to around 60% in 2010. W\ne currently import around £37.6bn of food and drink\n which demonstrates that the UK is becoming increasingly dependent on food imports and, at the same time, is one of the few developed countries with a population \nthat is expected to expand significantly over the next few decades.\n&#xa0;\n     \n              \n              \n              \nTrends in self-sufficiency (Defra, 2010) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhere is significant potential for the UK to produce more food products. \nThis, \nhowever, is largely dependent on the right \npolicy \nframework and market signals, as well as the provision of\n an environment in which farm\ners are confident to invest in, to enable the\n entire food chain to grow. \nInitial findings from the \nAIC \nproject\n \n, assessing the threats and opportunities in food productio\nn in the UK and \nacross \nthe EU\n, s\nuggest\ns\n that hazard based approaches to \nlegislative frameworks are\n impeding our ability to produce food in the UK – which is at odds with the current \nUK \nGovernment’s \nfocus on growing the economy. \nCite an example….\n&#xa0;\nThere is \nconsumer appetite for more home-grown food\n products\n. For example, a One Poll (2013) survey revealed that 78% of shoppers believe supermarkets should stock more British Food, whilst 42% revealed that recent \nissues around food provenance \nmeans that are more \nlikely to purchase traceable food produced on British farms. \nWith appropriate legislation the agricultural industry would have increased access to \ntechnologies to produce more \nfood in the UK and meet the challenge of sustainable intensification. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
