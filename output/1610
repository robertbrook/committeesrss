[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Glass and Glazing Federation (HOT29)[bold]The GGF is the main representative organisation for companies involved in all aspects of the manufacture of flat glass and products and services for all types of glazing, in commercial and dom
[normal]estic sectors. The GGF has approximately 500 members of all sizes who can be found in over 1,500 business locations throughout the UK.
[normal]Question 1: [bold]Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?[bold]A key part of reducing heat demand 
[normal]is ensuring that there is less 
[normal]heat 
[normal]waste
[normal].  This is best achieved by increasing energy efficiency, particularly in 
[normal]the UK’s
[normal] building
[normal] 
[normal]stock
[normal] which is currently a significant contributor to carbon loss and heat waste. A
[normal]round 
[normal]one
[normal] third
[normal] of the heat produced by 
[normal]a central heating system is 
[normal]rapidly lost through 
[normal]a building’s 
[normal]roof, walls, doors, windows and floors
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]according to the Energy Saving Trust, 
[normal]25% 
[normal]of
[normal] heat from a building escapes through non ene
[normal]rgy efficient windows and doors
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]GGF 
[normal]acknowledges 
[normal]that the Government has made positive steps towards addressing the 
[normal]need to increase the
[normal] energy efficiency
[normal] of the UK’s housing stock in order to reduce heat waste
[normal], we believe that there is still much that should be done. 
[normal]The GGF is supportive of the Govern
[normal]ment’s introduction of the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation
[normal] (ECO)
[normal], as part of the UK’s efforts to reduce heat energy demand.
[normal] 
[normal]However
[normal], despite the benefits of the scheme, 
[normal]the recent figures published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change
[normal] have revealed that there has been a slow uptake. 
[normal] 
[normal]The GGF believes that the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment must do more to incentivise uptake of the Green Dea
[normal]l
[normal] and ECO
[normal] in order to reduce waste
[normal], reduce heat energy demand
[normal] and meet the UK’s carbon targets
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]A number of Green D
[normal]eal trials have 
[normal]revealed 
[normal]that windows are popular with consumers
[normal]. For example, a
[normal] 
[normal]trial by Gentoo revealed that double glazing 
[normal]was very popular with customers
[normal] who
[normal] reported that windows offered extra benefits to other measures, which therefore made them mor
[normal]e likely to install double glazing rather than any other measure. Participants in the trial reported feeling an extra sense of warmth and security and noted the importance of double glazing in blocking out excess sound. 
[normal] Windows can also play an important 
[normal]role in encouraging consumers to install further measures in their homes, thereby helping to encourage a consumer to 
[normal]adopt a “whole house” approach
[normal]. 
[normal] For example, there is much interaction between solid wall insulation (SWI) and windows, as to undertake SW
[normal]I work correctly the windows should be replaced or the existing windows removed and reinstalled on wider projection sills and possibly external linings. The GGF has found that 
[normal]householders
[normal] 
[normal]are often disinterested in solid wall insulation however, as recent
[normal] Green Deal trials have demonstrated, they are attracted to the idea of new windows and doors.  
[normal]Given the popularity of windows with consumers, the GGF believes that more must be done to make windows a more attractive proposition under the Green Deal as t
[normal]his could result in more consumers improving their windows and installing other measures at the same time. As such, alt
[normal]hough the GGF 
[normal]is supportive of the 
[normal]steps taken by the Government to improve energy efficiency and reduce heat waste, we believe that 
[normal]furt
[normal]her incentives must be introduced to encourage take up of the 
[normal]Green Deal and 
[normal]ECO 
[normal]and would support the introduction of
[normal] such schemes as
[normal] 
[normal]variable rates of stamp duty and council tax based on the energy efficiency of a property as an incentive to Green Deal u
[normal]ptake.
[normal]  
[normal]In addition, t
[normal]he GGF 
[normal]believes that DECC has made positive steps towards correcting an 
[normal]ECO
[normal] Statutory Instrument 
[normal](SI) 
[normal]which 
[normal]to date has had a significant effect in dis
[normal]-
[normal]incentivising consumers from installing windows under the ECO.  On the 24
[normal]th
[normal] July 
[normal]2013, DECC published a consultation document which seeks views on 
[normal]allow
[normal]ing
[normal] energy suppliers to count a higher carbon saving score towards their targets for delivering replacement window units compared to under the existing rule.
[normal] 
[normal]  It is vital that this change to the existing SI be made in order to
[normal] encourage more window installation
[normal]s
[normal] under ECO which, give
[normal]n
[normal] the popularity of windows and the focus on a whole house approach, could lead to increased uptake of further energy e
[normal]fficiency 
[normal]measures in the home, resulting in a
[normal] further
[normal] reduction of heat energy demand. 
[normal]Question 2: [bold]What progress is the government making on reducing the demand for heat?[bold]Although the government has made some progress on addressing the UK’s need to make its buildi
[normal]ng stock much more energy efficient, the GGF believes that more must be done to 
[normal]incentivise 
[normal]householders and commercial property owners to increase the ene
[normal]rgy efficiency of their properties
[normal].  As mentioned above, the Government has a vital role to play in i
[normal]ncentivising this uptake in order for the UK to make real progress towards meeting its carbon targets.
