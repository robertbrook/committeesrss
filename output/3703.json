"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Supplementary written evidence from 51m (HSR 035)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;51m \nis offering this supplementary submission to \nthe Transport Select Committee \nfor their hearing on 26 November.  It adds further information for \nQuestion\n 5 \n(north-south divide and growth) \nand 6 \n(track record on infrastructure delivery) \nin the original submission\n.  \n51m \nhopes \nthat \nthis additional material will be useful to \nthe Select Committee members\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5)  How will HS2 bridge the north-south divide and drive growth?&#xa0;\n51m understands that to truly narrow the north-south divide requires significant growth and job creation in the north that not only matches but surpasses that experienced in the south.  HS2 Ltd has done nothing to date to narrow that divide \nwith more than 98% of jobs created in London, and the remaining 1.3% in Birmingham.  Of the 557 jobs at HS2 Ltd, 550 are based in London and just \nseven\n in Birmingham.\n&#xa0;\nThe figures were disclosed by Transport Minister Robert Goodwill, in response to a quest\nion from Perry Barr MP Khalid Mahmood.  Mr Mahmood commented that these figures were “absolutely disgraceful” and that the \n“The government needs to get its act together. Rather than blaming everyone else for not supporting it, they need to ensure the jobs \nare distributed across the country and particularly in Birmingham and Manchester.”\n&#xa0;\nThe Government’s appointment of Sir David Higgins to replicate the success of the Olympics is also a concern to 51m, since one legacy aspect that is rarely shared is the f\nurther widening of the north-south divide.  A BBC report\n \nidentified that the economic benefits of the Games were far from fairly distributed with a large \ngeographic disparity across the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\nGovernment figures state that £2.5\n \nb\nillio\nn of addition\nal foreign\n direct investment has\n been secured since the Games, \nleading to the creation of \n31,000 new jobs.\n  London \nand the south-east of England \ngained \nnearly 15,000 additional jobs, \nbut only \nseven were created in the North East.\n  Both examples seem to further reinf\norce John Tomaney’s research, that the biggest winner from HS2 will be London and the south-east.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6)  What is our track record in infrastructure delivery?&#xa0;\nGovernment claims that HS2 will be built on time and within budget are also worthy of detailed \nscrutiny.  The consultants and engineers employed by HS2 Ltd are already £11 million over budget\n and with Royal Assent given to the Paving Bill, what assurances can Sir \nDavid Higgins, the Department for Transport, or the Secretary of State give that the p\nroject will be completed at a cost of no more than £50 billion?  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\n51m recognises that the country needs \ninvestment in infrastructure, but \ncontinues to believe\n \nthere are better projects that can be delivered quickly, at less cost, and with \nbetter returns.\n  It is not against growth and jobs but believes in a more balanced\n investment strategy, where every part of the country reap\ns\n the rewards.  \n&#xa0;\n51m trusts that this \nsupplementary \nsubmission will help \nfurther \ninform the Select Committee and wo\nuld be happy \nto provide any further information in support of its case. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/hs2-firm-employs-550-london-6297636\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/24981550\n \nhttp://www.building.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=5063220\n"
