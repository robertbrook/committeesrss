Th\nis\n should incorporate spending decisions on all elements of publicly funded research including infrastructure\n. This will help provide certainty for future funding decisions by both commercial and non\n-commercial funders. Medical research in particular is a long-term endeavour that requires sustained and stable funding in order for basic research to be translated into technologies that benefit patients. It can take decades for medical research to develo\np into treatments, much longer than the 4-5 year spending review periods that Government currently adopts. The Committee should investigate the merits of such a plan and advise on \npossible content and \na suitable length.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION 2: Committee inquiry into the distribution of the current science budgetThe academic and charitable sector welcomed the Government’s announcements of a flat cash settlement in the 2013 spending review. How money is allocated within the science ring fence will be of pa\nrticular interest to the sector\n,\n including how the outcome of the research councils’ triennial review affects the settlement. \n Investigating\n how to effectively allocate the science budget could be a potentially useful inquiry for the science and technology\n committee.\n&#xa0;Comments on the NAO report\nThe following section contrasts the findings of the NAO report with Cancer Research UK’s ex\nperience of funding UK research.\n&#xa0;Diversity of funding\n“\nWholly independent and self-sufficient medical research initiatives are rare. Arguably all research activity depends, to a greater \nor lesser extent, on other parts of the total medical research “ecology” in the UK, and in many cases, internationally. \nFor example, universities conducting charity-funded projects also receive infrastructure support from the public sector through QR and t\nhe CRSF.”\n&#xa0;\nCASE STUDY: STRATIFIED MEDICINE&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION 3 Committee inquiry on diversity of fundingThe NAO report highlights the importance of the Not\n-f\nor\n-\nProfit sector in the UK research environment. \nWe know that the diversity of funding is a unique element to the UK and brings about signifi\ncant advantages.\n \nThe Committee may wish to consider an inquiry into the relationship between Government, industry and Not\n-f\nor\n-\nProfits for the R&amp;D in the UK and whether there are any additional measures that Government could be taking to ensure that \ncollaboration takes place and that Not\n–f\nor\n-\nProfits can invest their money most effectively.  \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION 4: Committee inquiry on higher education R&amp;D spendingThe NAO report outlines the real term\ns\n decrease in public sector spending in research in Hi\ngher Education Institutes. The committee could consider reviewing the impact of \nGovernment\n investment in higher education R&amp;D and look at the possible outcomes for increasing or decreasing investment in these areas\n, especially the knock on effects for inve\nstment by commercial and non-commercial entities\n.\n&#xa0;\nRegional Spending\nEuropean Framework Funding\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n Department \nof Business, Innovation and Skills,  Leverage from public funding of science and research, March 2013 p.5\n Cancer Research UK, \nWorking together: the impact of medical research investment on the health and wealth of the \nnation\n \nhttp://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/cr_109616.pdf\n \n National\n Audit Office, \nResearch and Development funding for science and technology\n,p.21\n Office for \nHealth Economics, Exploring the Interdependency between Public and Charitable Medical Research, \nhttp://www.ohe.org/publications/article/exploring-the-interdependency-between-public-and-charitable-medical-research-6.cfm\n \n Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, Leverage from\n public funding of science and research, March 2013 p.5\n \nDepartment of Business, Innovation and Skills,\n \n, Leverage from public funding of science and research, March 2013\n National Audit Office, \nResearch and Development funding for science and technology\n, p.21\n"
