"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nThis evidence is submitted on \na corporate basis by Equality Challenge Unit\n (ECU)\n. \nECU i\ns a charity which works to further and support equality and diversity for staff and students in higher education across all four nations of the UK, and in colleges in Scotland. ECU receives its core \nfunding from \nUniversities UK, GuildHE, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, the Scottish Funding Council and the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.\n \n&#xa0;\nAthena SWAN CharterOne of ECU’s core activities is the Athena SWAN Charter. \nFounded in 2005, the Athena SWAN Charter is a scheme that recognises excellence in science, engineering\n, \ntechnology\n, mathematics and medicine (STEMM\n) employment\n for women in higher education.\n \nThe \nCharter receives addition\nal\n funding from the Royal Society, the Biochemical Society, the Department of Health and the Scottish Funding Council.\nAny university or research institute embedded within a university that is committed to the advancement of the ca\nreers of women \nin STEMM \ncan become a member of the Charter, accepting and promoting the six Charter principles:\nThere are currently \n91\n members of the Charter. Once Charter signatories, universities and their S\nTEMM \ndepartments are encouraged to submit for Athena SWAN Charter recognition awards at Bronze, Silver or Gold level.\nThe Charter recognises the commitment of universities and university departments to reduce the\n \ndecline in the numbers \nof women in \nS\nTEMM\n ac\nademic careers \nfurther up the career ladder, and \nretain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers\n.\nThis response is based on ECU’s work, in particular the experience of working with universities on Athena SWAN.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAppraisals – e.g. regular appraisals carried out and career development discussed\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiversity and unconscious bias training – e.g. training provided for all staff involved in recruitment and promotion decisions\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransparency of procedures and processes – e.g. individuals selected for posts or given more senior responsibilities through a fair and clear process\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommittee structures and balance of representation – e.g. women at least proportionally represented and not restricted to the least influential committees\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDepartmental openness and inclusivity – e.g. all staff invited to a weekly coffee morning, at which senior staff are accessible\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDepartmental roles and responsibilities – e.g. less desirable tasks assigned fairly and transparently \n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVisibility of women – e.g. care taken to ensure that the images around the university are not male-dominated, and a good balance amongst invited speakers\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nValuing staff contribution – e.g. achievements of men and women equally valued, and \nteaching, research and pastoral \nactivities all \nrecognised \nand rewarded\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorkload allocation – e.g. all staff workloads modelled and analysed transparently to make sure individuals are not overburdened, such as with administration\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInduction and training – e.g. all staff given a comprehensive induction and may be assigned a mentor, with the opportunity to express a preference about that person’s identity.\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData collection (so the university/department knows what it must act on and can prioritise)\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInduction, networking and mentoring (see the ECU report Mentoring: progressing women's careers in higher education\n)\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSkills development\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAppraisal and performance management\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusion and communication (e.g. consulting staff systematically and utilising or setting up an early career researcher forum)\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParental leave.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe Department of Health (who contributed £199,700 to Charter development in 2012, after deciding to link funding for NIHR Biomedical Research Centres and Biomedical Research Units to a requirement that the academic partner has achieves a Silver Athena SWAN award)\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch Councils UK (who recommend participation in schemes such as Athena SWAN)\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Royal Society of Edinburgh (whose Tapping all our Talents report recommends that the Scottish Government should expect university STEMM departments to achieve the minimum standards for an Athena SWAN Silver award or equivalent, amongst other recommendations that are applicable across the UK)\n=\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe London Mathematical Society (who’s recently launched \nGood Practise Scheme dovetails with the Charter)\n.\nThis groundswell of support indicates that now is a very apposite time to capitalise on this.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Athena SWAN Gold department award application form,
