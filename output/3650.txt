[[[on ]]]

[[[data that is either misleading or has been omitted ]]]

[[[by Ministers, HS2 Ltd and the Department of Transport ]]]

[[[in an attempt to hide the risks and flaws in the HS2 project]]]

[[[KPMG report]]]A simple analysis in a paper by Transport Watch UK demonstrates how absurd the KPMG figure of £15bn is.(Source: Transport watch UK: HS2 WIDER ECONOMIC BENEFITS LAUGHED OUT OF COURT November 2013 )http://www.transport-watch.co.uk/hs2-wider-economic-benefits-laughed-out-court-november-2013

[[[Analysis of new trips created by HS2]]]91,000               new trips per day attributed to HS2               (Source HS2: 24% of 380,000 Re Economic case for HS2)300              days pa= 27 million trips pa&#xa0;£15bn economic benefit pa re KPMG£15bn / 27x106 = 

[[[£549 per single trip or £1,099 for each round trip]]]

[[[HS2 spend profile v Crossrail]]]I have heard Ministers, MPs and until recently the HS2 web site, equate HS2 to the spend on Crossrail.  The graph below demonstrates how utterly false and misleading that comparison is.  The DfT only fund 40% of Crossrail  with a peak of £1.2bn and total contribution of £5.2bn (60% is paid by London businesses and other sources ) while the spend on HS2 has a peak of £5bn pa for several years and a total of £50bn,

[[[spend on classic rail]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[ENHANCEMENTS]]]Ministers and the DfT attempt to compare HS2 costs with the total ‘investment’ in the rail network.  The large majority of the investment in the rail network is routine maintenance and renewals not enhancing the network.  The spend on enhancements for the whole of the network is around £2bn pa while the spend on HS2 would for several years be £4bn or more.  Hence a more accurate statement is that HS2 will take 2/3 of the budget available to improve the network!&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Source:              Full strategic business plan for England and Waleshttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/publications/strategic-business-plan-for-cp5/&#xa0;

[[[Capacity]]]

[[[ released ]]]

[[[for Freight]]]How much extra capacity for freight on classic lines is actually released by HS2?Nothing till at least 2026!Then, from the 2013 strategic case, in 2033 it assumes the number of fast line paths used by passenger trains reduces from 13 to 12 leaving the capacity from 

[[[ONE]]] fast passenger path available per hour.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Source for this analysis is the Beleben blog link below:http://beleben.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/hs2-and-classic-capacity-part-four-2/&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Passenger Growth]]]

[[[ on WCML]]](a) HS2 will 

[[[NOT]]]

[[[ ]]]relieve crowding over the whole of the rail network, so why do HS2 and the DfT persist in giving data for the whole network 

[[[when they have the data relating to the specific routes ie WCML that will be affected?]]]Is passenger growth going to continue on the WCML?

[[[(b) Virgin ]]]

[[[Trains Key statistics]]]In 2012/13 Virgin Trains passenger growth was only 0.66% (ORR data) and has been falling rapidly for several years!&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[(c) ]]]

[[[ORR data for the long distance ]]]

[[[rail ]]]

[[[travel]]]

[[[ ]]]The ORR data for the long distance rail travel for the whole network shows a marked downwards trend since the peaks of 2007.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[(d) Technology wedge]]]Technology takes time to gain a hold and then  make a wide impact on the existing market.  This can be seen with the lag between the start of significant use of the internet for communications and its impact on letter volumes&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Video conferencing is only really just taking hold now.  As businesses strive to make a profit in an ever more competitive global market place, using increasingly reliable video conferencing will become the norm and expensive, time consuming long distance business travel will have to be very carefully justified.&#xa0;

[[[(e) Decline in ]]]

[[[trip rates]]]There has been a steady decline in trip rates for the last fifteen years.  This may be partly due to technology but whatever the cause, has this been included in the HS2 demand models?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[(f) Travel rates for the elderly]]]The UK population is undoubtedly growing but it is also aging! Older people travel less and less by rail and do not want to may premium peak fares on ultra-fast trains!&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
