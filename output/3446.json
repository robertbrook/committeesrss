"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence given by Dr. William Gaze , University of Exeter Medical School (AMR0042)Summary\nBiography\nI am an active researcher in the field of AMR, now working at the University of Exeter Medical School. My specific focus is on selection for and dissemination of AMR in farmed and natural environments. I received a NERC discipline hopping award in 2006 whilst at the University of Warwick to work in Prof. Peter Hawkey’s lab at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham for a year to gain insights into the clinical microbiology of AMR complementing existing environmental microbiological expertise. I was asked to contribute to a recent POST Note on antibiotics in the environment as I am currently involved in research with AstraZeneca looking at selection for AMR by antibiotic pollutants in aquatic systems.\nEvidence\nU\nnpublis\nhed data marked with an asterisk on page 2 illustrates the potential significance of environmental transmission of AMR bacteria.\nActions\nI\n would like to see more emphasis given to improving our understanding of AMR at a molecular genetic level, and recognition of the pivotal role that the natural environment plays in the wider picture of increasing AMR.\n1. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem which is exemplified by increases in infections caused by AMR Gram-negative opportunist pathogens such as \nE. coli \nand \nKlebsiella \nspecies. “During the past 10 years, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae have become a substantial challenge to infection control. It has been suggested by clinicians that the effectiveness of antibiotics is in such rapid decline that, depending on the pathogen concerned, their future utility can be measured in decades or even years. Unless the rise in antibiotic resistance can be reversed, we can expect to see a substantial rise in incurable infection and fatality in both developed and developing regions. Antibiotic resistance develops through complex interactions, with resistance arising by de-novo mutation under clinical antibiotic selection or frequently by acquisition of mobile genes that have evolved over time in bacteria in the environment”\n1\n \n2. Much is known regarding the role of infection control and antibiotic prescribing behaviour in the spread of AMR bacteria. However, the complex interactions of pharmaceutical residues in human and farm animal waste which are discharged to the environment along with AMR bacteria where \nthey mix with a vast reservoir of environmental bacteria is poorly understood\n1\n. It is well known that some clinically important resistance mechanisms have emerged from environmental bacteria, but it is not known if the transfer of AMR genes occurred in farm animals, in the natural environment or in humans. \nA large proportion of oral antibiotics used in clinical and veterinary medicine are discharged in an active form to the environment. Recent research shows that selection for antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria occurs at much lower concentrations of antibiotics than was previously thought, in fact similar to concentrations of antibiotic residues found in the environment\n2\n. A further alarming consequence of selection for AMR at environmental antibiotic concentrations is that adaptations that confer resistance at low antibiotic concentrations must by definition exert a low fitness cost on the bacterium\n2\n. This means that in the absence of antibiotic selection they will not be outcompeted by more fit, susceptible, bacteria and AMR will therefore be maintained over long time periods or indefinitely. Conversely, hospital acquired methicillin resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus\n (HA-MRSA) strains which are predominantly found in hospitals where antibiotic selection is high are rapidly outcompeted by susceptible \nStaphylococcus aureus \nin the absence of antibiotic selection precisely because the fitness cost of maintaining resistance in the HA-MRSA strains is very high. \nWe also know that there is a vast reservoir of novel AMR genes in environmental bacteria. My own research with collaborators at the University of Warwick suggests that waste management practices such as sewage sludge addition to soil and waste water treatment plant discharge to rivers increases the abundance of these genes. However, there is still very little data on whether AMR genes are spreading between bacteria as a result of environmental pollution, how AMR persists over time in environmental bacterial populations, what the risk of human exposure to AMR bacteria is through environmental transmission routes and what the contribution of environmental transmission has in the overall burden of resistant infections seen in the clinic.\nPreliminary estimates underway in my lab, of human exposure to third generation cephalosporin resistant \nE. coli\n and other enteric bacteria in recreational bathing waters suggests that there may be over &gt;500,000 exposures per year in England and Wales. This is based on AMR data from approx. 100 Environment Agency bathing water samples and has been extrapolated to the EA bathing water bacterial contamination data for England and Wales. Also it is worth noting that this is just for AMR to one class of antibiotics so total exposure to AMR bacteria will be higher. We don’t know the clinical significance of this exposure in terms of human colonisation and infection at the moment. These are the next steps which need to be studied in more detail. However, it is evident that environmental transmission may be significant.\nFurther areas of research which may prove crucial include improving our understanding of indirect or co-selection for AMR\n3\n. We know that biocides and detergents can exert indirect selection by selecting for biocide resistance genes which are situated on the same mobile bits of DNA which carry antibiotic resistance genes. This has been highlighted as an emerging health issue by the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)\n4\n.\n3. More needs to be done to tackle the rate that new mechanisms of AMR emerge as well as investment in new antibiotics, and alternative approaches to treating AMR infections. \n4. It is arguable that none of our interventions have had any real impact on the spread of AMR other than in localised situations for key AMR bacteria, eg. MRSA in hospitals. The problem of AMR requires a holistic approach focusing on hospitals, community carriage in humans, agriculture and the natural environment. Concentrating on key AMR bacteria once they have become a problem, treats the symptoms of a much wider problem and is essentially reactive. We need a proactive \napproach that considers all drivers of AMR, not just clinical use of antibiotics and infection control in hospitals, important as both these drivers are. \n5. Global co-ordination is required as the drivers of AMR are global, added to the fact that bacteria are mobilised round the world by international travel and international trade. Actions required include public funding of antibiotic discovery, much tighter regulation of antibiotic use in farming and much more work on reducing environmental pollution that may select for AMR. Clearly these are huge tasks and further evidence may be needed before action can be taken. This is a hugely complex problem as it is as much about microbial genetics and environmental complexity as it is about human behaviour. \n6. Strengths of the AMR strategy include the emphasis on use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine as well as in human medicine, however the impacts of environmental pollution on AMR and the necessity to understand fundamental questions relating to selection for resistance is absent. \nThere are factual errors eg. \nSection 2.3 of the 5 year plan “The initial emergence of resistance is random, arising by mutations (errors as DNA is copied in bacterial replication) or gene exchange among bacteria. The use of antibiotics then favours the spread of those bacteria that have become resistant”.\nIn fact we now know that some antibiotics themselves can increase mutation rates and \npromote gene transfer. This is also true of other pollutants including a recent paper in PNAS showing that nanoparticles can induce AMR gene transfer\n5\n. The more we learn about bacterial evolution, the more complex we find it is. If we don’t know how bacteria react to pharmaceuticals and personal care products which are now present in the natural environment at unprecedented levels we will have great difficulty, anticipating and mitigating the problem of AMR.\n&#xa0;1.
