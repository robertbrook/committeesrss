"              \n              \nLPG 05Written submission from Weight Watchers (LPG 05)&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Weight Watchers welcomes the Communities and Local Government Committee’s \ni\nnquiry into \nl\nocal\n government procurement, given local government’s new public health responsibilities.  B\nased on\n our extensive \nexperience of \nthe \nprocurement and provision of publicly funded lifestyle \nweigh\nt\n management services for NHS patients, we hope the following points will be helpful to the Committee.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWeight Watchers has concerns over future \nl\nocal \ngovernment\n procurement of lifestyle weight management services. Over the last \neight\n years \nwe \nha\nve\n encountered numerous examples of poor procurement practice related to the commissioning of\n publicly funded\n lifestyle weight management services for \noverweight and obese individuals. \nFor example, many commissioners:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDo not understand the reality of weight management. It is a lifelong struggle for the obese, many of whom have a complex range of health, social and economic problems.  This strugg\nle is not fully solved through\n \ntime-limited \nintervention\ns\n.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack knowledge of the scientific literature on the effectiveness of weight management services. They do not understand what the \nscientific \nevidence base indicates in terms of effectiveness. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDo not use the evidence base to identify best potential providers\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSet unrealistic weight loss outcomes\n and contract KPIs\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRefuse to engage in pre-tender dialogue, which militates against flexibility and the capability of providers to tailor services to meet the specific needs of target groups.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBundle services together for individuals with very different weight loss needs\n, for example seeking one provider to deliver a range of services for adults and children\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDo not ask for evidence of d\nelivery from providers who over-\npromise\n to secure contracts\n&#xa0;\nIn short\n,\n there is a lot wrong with the procurement processes connected to commissioning lifesty\nle weight management services. \n Moving the responsibility for procurement of these services to \nl\nocal \ngovernment\n provides an \nexcellent \nopportunity to facilitate the real change required\n to make sure that people get the best possible service which delivers the best possible outcomes in the most cost effective way.  \n&#xa0;\nWhilst we have seen many examples of poor practices, there are also examples of high quality, person centred practices; commissioners, groups and working parties who seek to drive up the quality of procurement in lifestyle weight management services. Harnessing the expertise, knowledge and recommendations from these will be important. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;There is now good evidence that for overweight and obese p\neople, referral to Weight Watchers\n is \nsignificantly \nmore effective and costs the taxpayer less (Jolly et al, 2011; Jebb et al, 2011; Fuller et al, 2012) than \nthe \nusual care that \nprimary care in the NHS is\n able to provide. \n \nYet few commissioners seem to refer to this evidence and \nprocure \non this basis. \n S\nervices\n for individuals\n \nprovided by NHS based health professionals \noften remain the preferred \nand more costly \noption.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAround 60% of adults are overweight and obese.  \nThey need support to lose\n weight to prevent the massive burden of obesity linked conditions such as \ntype 2 \ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Providing lifestyle weight management services for these people makes good economic sense and to date, Primary Care Trusts have \nworked to mak\ne a range of services available for those with unhealthy weights.  However, there has been massive variation in the service\ns\n patients can access through primary care, and the reality has been a \npostcode lottery.  The responsibility for public health and the procurement of lifestyle weight management services has now moved to local government.  These services will be funded through the £2.7 billion public health budget devolved (and theoretically ring-fenced) to local government.  However, anecdotal evidence from Weight Watchers’ public health contacts, who have moved from the NHS \nin\nto local government, suggests that there has been a loss of skills, knowledge, experience and expertise in \nweight management\n service\ns\n commissioning – and specifically lifestyle behavioural change interventions.  It remains unclear who will commission these vital services\n, at present it seems that local government are rationalising their procurement professionals; losing highly skilled public health commissioners in favour for more generic profiles that handle a wide portfolio.  \n \n&#xa0;\nT\nhere is a \nvery real danger that the procurement of lifestyle weight management services \nwill fall through the gap between local government and Clinical Commissioning Groups\n (CCGs)\n.\n These services, that support people who are already overweight or obese, should be a fundamental part of a comprehensive healthy weight approach in local areas, one that spans prevention and clinical treatment. Early indications from our national view are that local government will largely focus on prevention measures and the NHS will only focus on complex and morbid obesity services that provide weight loss surgery. Behavioural change interventions for individuals, that support people to learn how to change their lifestyles, eating and activity to manage their weight, are at risk of being completely lost in this new procurement landscape. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWeight Watchers is an example of an evidence\n-\nbased programme which helps peop\nle lose weight and keep it off.  \nYet most of the clinical and public health guidance linked to behavioural change weight control interventions seem\ns\n to encourage commissioners to \ndesign, produce, pilot\n and\n refine\n new interventions rather than using \nthose that are already \ntried and tested.\n \n It takes huge resource\ns\n and \na lot \nof taxpayers’ money to develop\n a publicly funded \nweight managem\nent\n program\nme \nthat work\ns, is people-\ncentred a\nnd \nachieve\ns\n th\ne best \noutcomes. \n \nSurely in an environment where \nl\nocal \ngovernment \nk\nnows \nthat \nit\n need\ns\n to me\net huge cost and efficiency savings, on\ne\n \nof the main ways \nit \ncan do this is through procurement processes and specifically procuring \n‘\noff the peg\n’\n services which ha\nve \na \nproven \nt\nr\nack record of effectiveness. \n \nRe-inventing the wheel waste\ns\n money.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the absence of a national strategy on procurement of \nlifestyle weight management\n services, the organisations responsible for \nl\nocal \ngovernment\n procurement should work collaboratively with providers to facilitate \nthe \nreal change required to shape \nl\nocal \ngovernment \nprocurement going forward. Local \ngovernment \nprocurement in the future needs to be mutually ben\neficial to all parties involved: \n \nto l\nocal \ngovernment\n with regard to \nvalue for money and \nmeeting savings targets\n,\n and \nto \nsuppliers in their ability to do more worthwhile business\n. P\nresently there is no evidence of such collaboration over \nweight management\n services\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Despite NICE guidance recommending that ‘healthcare agencies should recommend to patients, or consider endorsing, self-help, commercial and community weight management programmes if they follow best practice\n’\n,  over the last \neight\n years Weight Watchers has fought for acceptance as an effective referral route for overweight and obese NHS patients.\n \n   \n&#xa0;\nThe previous Government’s obesity strategy, ‘Healthy Weight: Healthy Lives’, promoted partnerships as an essential element to solve the “obesity epidemic”.  Yet this rhetoric seldom became a reality.  In addition there was limited recognition of providers such as Weight Watchers within local obesity strategies or within local obesity care pathways drawn up by PCTs.  Historically Weight Watchers has encountered commercial prejudices (i.e. not being perceived as offering as high a quality service as NHS providers) within NHS commissioning circles where protectionism of public sector providers is often rife.\n \n It is hoped that now \nl\nocal \ngovernment is \nresponsible for procurement of these services, there will be a sea change in attitudes to providers who have good quality data underpinning the effectiveness of the services they offer and who meet NICE best practice standards. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWeight Watchers applauds the overall emphasis in the Health and Social Care Bill that it will be outcomes that matter, not targets or activity alone, with government pledging an end to the production line approach to delivering services.  As such, providers will be paid according to their performance.  However, this principle needs careful application to weight management services.  Helping people lose weight is complex, often requiring behavioural intervention, backed up by regular and lifelong support and review.  Losing weight requires great effort and patients often describe the weight loss journey as ‘an endless battle’ (DH 2010).  Research suggests that high relapse and dropout rates are common in weight loss treatment studies – ranging from 10 – 80% (Inelman et al, 2005). For example, in the Counterweight study where weight management interventions were mediated by practice nurses (2004) retention was 22.5% at 12 months.  There is a danger that if payment by results is insensitively applied to weight management service providers, then only \npeople \nwith lower BMIs (25 – 30 kg/m²) and less complex health and socioeconomic needs will be accepted \nas eligible by commissioners \nand this will cause inequalities of access\n. \n \nInsensitive p\nayment by results \nKPIs \nin \nthe weight management arena could\n discriminate against larger p\neople\n with complex health problems. The solution is to set realistic \nKPIs \nspecific to different types of \nweight management interventions, informed by the evidence-base of what’s healthy and what’s possible \n(e.g. drug treatments, group support, one to one with a practice\n nurse, very low calorie diets). \nThese very specific\n KPIs should be grounded \nin what the research indicates is achievable and should form the basis for any ‘payment by results’ scheme. It is unfortunate but discussions that we have had with commissioners so far regarding this issue have indicated that their desired results are certainly not based on the evidence of what is achievable for a specific intervention, \noften seeming being ‘\nplucked out of the air\n’\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWeight Watchers has provided a consistent voice on the significant policy and strategy changes brought about by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. \n It\n \ni\ns the only commercial weight management provider \no\nn the Government’s expert ‘National Ambition Review Group for Obesity’.\n \n It has been invited to give evidence \nto\n numerous parliamentary inquiries and been an active member of \nthe \nD\nepartment of \nH\nealth\n’s obesity commissioning task force, which issue\nd\n best practice guidance on commissioning \ntier 2 lifestyle weigh\nt\n \nmanagement services in May 2013\n (DH, 2013)\n. \n \nThis guidance \nsets out\n a template specification for such services and realistic outcomes for interventions. \n It should be \nthe\n reference point for local government procurement of lifestyle weight management services.\n&#xa0;\nOver the la\nst eight\n years Weight Wa\ntchers has developed its health\ncare services. It:\n&#xa0;\nOver the last decade Weight Watchers has made significant investment in research to evaluate the efficacy of its methods, and the effectiveness of its Referral Scheme.  \nA recently completed randomised controlled trial (Jebb et al 201\n1\n) conducted across 3 countries (England, Germany and Australia) revealed that patients referred to Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight (-4.02kg) at one year compared to those who received standard care within primary care (-1.59kg). Of those who completed, patients referred to Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight (-6.87kg) at one year compared to those who received standard care within primary care (-3.17kg). 61% of Weight Watchers patients vs. 32% of standard care patients lost ≥ 5% baseline weight. Dropout rates were also higher in the primary care group (50%) compared to the Weight Watchers group (41%). This \nindependent research shows that when healthcare agencies and the \nindependent \nsector work in collaboration, changes\n in health behaviours\n that result in weight loss outcomes can be significant.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2009 Weight Watchers commissioned the independent Foresight team to project the economic consequences of larger scale referral to Weight Watchers.  The authors calculated that if just 4% of the adult population (bearing in mind that currently 60% are overweight or obese, this is an extremely conservative analysis) were referred for a 12 session course of Weight Watchers and this resulted in an average BMI drop of 1.5 u\nnits (which is what is generally\n achieved if people complete the course), then this, if maintained over their lifetime, would result in direct healthcare cost savings of  £1,860 per person, and society saving £9 billion up to 2080 (Brown and McPherson, 2009).\n&#xa0;\nTo support weight maintenance, once any Weight Watchers member reaches a healthy weight, they can attend Weight Watchers meetings free of charge for the rest of their lives. If the member came to Weight Watchers via \na local government, public health procured scheme \nthey would be entitled to the same lifetime support – at zero cost to the public purse. \n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
