"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Gender and Development Network (GADN)&#xa0;\nThe Gender and Development Network (GADN) \nis a diverse, effective and inclusive membership network made up of leading UK-based non-governmental \norganisations’\n (NGO) staff, practitioners, consultants and academics working on gender, development and women’s rights issues. \nGADN enables members to share information and expertise, lobby government and international bodies on gender and development issues, and provide expert advice and comment on policies and projects. Our members work in partnership with development and advocacy \norganisations\n throughout the world. \n“While disabled sons can be tolerated and often married, disabled daughters are merely a drain…permanent family members with no hope of future marriage or social mobility. It is quite usual for a disabled woman to be hidden by her family”.\n&#xa0;1.              Summary1.1 \n              \nBiases against gender and disability combine to form some of the most severe forms of \nmarginalisation\n and discrimination. However, they are often treated as separate issues. This double discrimination excludes disabled women and girls from accessing education, health care, employment and economic resources while exposing them to heightened rates of violence and abuse.\n1.2 \n              \nDisabled women and girls are slipping through the cracks in development work in the UK and internationally. \nA successful DFID approach to gender and disability must mainstream the two issues across its structures, policies, and programmes within an overarching commitment to disability-inclusive development. This includes collecting gender disaggregated data, including disabled women and their perspectives, supporting empowerment of and leadership by disabled women, evaluating assumptions about feasibility, and monitoring progress.&#xa0;2.               Importance of Gender and Disability2.1 \n              \nApproximately 300 million of the world’s women and girls have an intellectual, mental, sensory or physical disability that leads to double discrimination and exclusion based on their gender and disability.\n \n This may be further exacerbated by age, race, ethnicity or geography. \n2.2 \n              \nThe World Health Survey estimates that female prevalence of disability is as great as 60% higher than that for males worldwide\n.\n Women are more likely to become disabled throughout the course of their lives and are more likely to be sicker, poorer and more isolated than disabled men or women without disabilities worldwide.\n2.3 \n              \nThe disparities that they face include significantly less access to education, health care and employment than disabled men or women without disabilities.\n They are at \ngreater risk of being abused. And, they are under-represented in political and decision-making processes.\n \n2.4 \n              \nHowever, the issue of gender and disability is one that often falls between the cracks. Gender–neutral policy frameworks have failed to sufficiently protect disabled women. While the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has a general recommendation on disabled women the issue is largely neglected in monitoring of the treaty. Recommendations have been made for the need for the European Commission to incorporate a focus on the intersection between gender and disability in its Disability High Level Group.\n And, disabled women are \nmarginalised\n within both women’s and disability movements and disability focused development.\n&#xa0;3.               Gender and Disability as a Core Development Issue3.1 \n              \nWhile disabled women face discrimination worldwide their lives are even further curtailed and restricted in developing countries.\n \n3.2 \n              \nUp to 75% of disabled women live in the developing world\n and poor communities. While being caused by disability, disability can also contribute to poverty due to the additional expenses it can entail as well as \nmarginalisation\n and lack of opportunities.\n And yet, barriers and discriminatory practices often limit disabled women and girls’ participation in development \nprogrammes\n.\n3.3 \n              \nWhen combined, gender and disability lead to some of the most severe forms of social and economic \nmarginalisation\n that undermine the attainment of basic development. Additionally, care for the disabled places additional burdens on women and girl’s time taking away from economic activities and educational pursuits.\n3.4 \n              \nUN analysis of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) concludes that 'the poorest and most discriminated against on the basis of gender, age, disability, ethnicity or otherwise have often been the most disadvantaged'.\n3.5 \n              \nA review of many of the core development issues in the MDGs highlights the extent to which addressing gender and disability can help lead to attainment of development and reinforces that they are core development issues. For instance, to meet MDG targets on gender equality, education and employment, they must take into account \nthat a small portion of disabled women are literate and that among the disabled, men are twice as likely to have jobs as women.\n3.6 \n              \nTo properly address the double or treble discrimination faced by disabled women and girls the Post 2015 development agenda and national policy frameworks must place them within the context of a full range of rights across an individual’s life and address gender and disability in a cohesive way.\n3.7 \n              \nFurthermore, it is critical that these frameworks incorporate the experiences of disabled women and include their full participation in the design and negotiation processes.\n&#xa0;4.               Gender, Disability and DFID’s Vision for Women and Girls4.1 \n              \nDFID \nsectoral\n strategies that are of particular pertinence to disabled women and girls largely fail to mention them. At the same time, addressing gender and disability will allow DFID to more comprehensively set targets for its vision for women and girls as well as \nsectoral\n initiatives on education, violence, maternal health and access to economic resources.\n4.2              Education4.2.1 \n              \nAccording to Plan UK, disabled children on average are ten times less likely to attend school\n and disabled girls in particular face challenges accessing education.\n Controversial figures estimate that only 1% of disabled girls are educated\n but also highlight the need for research and gender disaggregated data.\n4.2\n.2 \n              \nAmong the most significant barriers are biases based on gender and disability. Lack of access to transport as well as schools not being designed to accommodate those with disabilities also pose challenges.\n4.2\n.3 \n              \nGirls with disabilities, and particularly those with multiple disabilities, are also at higher risk of harassment at school, discouraging parents from educating them. Research from the US and in Mexico, Latin America and Australia indicate that harassment and sexual harassment at school creates educational barriers for disabled girls.\n \n4.2\n.4 \n              \nThe quality of education for girls with disability can also be compromised by bias against them, distractions and bullying at school. One woman in Bangladesh describes the challenges her 13 year-old grand-daughter faced:\n“Children used to tease and beat [my grand-daughter]. She couldn’t concentrate on the class work for long ... In school her classmates disturbed her in every \nway… Everyone is worried about her future. After all, she is a girl and how will she survive?”\n4.2\n.5 \n              \nWith this in mind, the DFID 2010-20145 education strategy and the DFID guidance note on education for children with disabilities should be revised to better highlight the linkages between gender and disability and mention the special needs of disabled girls and overlapping discrimination that may prevent them from accessing education.\n&#xa0;4.3              Reproductive/ Maternal Health4.3\n.1 \n              \nDisabled women and adolescents are as likely as others to be sexually active yet they are given significantly less information and often have decisions made for them.\n  Disabled women also experience forced \nsterilisation\n, forced abortion and forced marriage.\n They are also exposed to high levels of sexual exploitation and rape. However, they have far less access to medical interventions.\n 4.3\n.2 \n              \nInterviews with disabled women highlight a number of barriers to reproductive health care services including facilities and equipment that are not accessible, limited contraception options or information, insensitivity of health care providers to disabled women and lack of \nspecialised\n knowledge about how to provide care for them.\n Access to reproductive health care is so restricted that some disabled women avoid regular gynecologic visit all together.\n4.3\n.3 \n              \nLittle is known about disabled women’s maternal health needs, but since they are among the poorest it is believed that they have less access to care. Research in Nepal suggests that they are also less likely to access care due to a lack of information or embarrassment about pregnancies due to biases against them\n or the fact that higher levels of exposure to rape may have led to pregnancies.\n4.3\n.4 \n              \nA deaf Nepali woman describes such discrimination:\n“When I went (to the health facility) for an antenatal check up, the (health workers) scolded me, saying: ‘why are you pregnant again…?’ ”\n4.3\n.5 \n              \nHowever, many disabled women, particularly with intellectual disabilities, do not have the opportunity to make maternity care choices. Since they are often involuntarily sterilized \nSterilisation\n is used for women far more so than for disabled men.\n A study in Orissa, India, found that 6% of women with disabilities had been forcibly \nsterilised\n.\n4.3\n.6 \n              \nReproductive and maternal health makes up only a portion of disabled women’s unmet health needs. They receive far less care across the board due to cost, limitations in transportation, dependence on others to access treatment and underlying \ndiscrimination.\n \nThe lack of women health care professionals also presents barriers to care in some countries like Afghanistan.\n4.3\n.7 \n              \nThe UK’s Framework for Results for Improving Reproductive, Maternal and Newborn Health in the Developing World points out that many poor women are disabled because of childbirth or insufficient maternal health care. It only briefly mentions disabled women with respect to ensuring that certain groups of women don’t get left behind. However, given the severity and prevalence of the discrimination and the significant gap in services it is important that DFID bring this into greater focus in maternal and reproductive health as well as health care more broadly.\n&#xa0;4.4               Violence4.4\n.1 \n              \nDisabled women and girls experience particularly high levels of violence. One study showed that over half of disabled women experienced emotional abuse compared to 32.5% of other women; a quarter reported physical abuse compared to 11.4% and 5.7% reported sexual abuse by family compared to 1.1%. There were also high reports of controlling behavior including having to seek permission to receive health care\n.\n \nIt is known that disabled women experience higher levels of exposure to violence than disabled men, however research is needed to find out prevalence rates.\n4.4\n.2 \n              \nOther studies show even more shocking figures. In a study in India, almost all of the disabled women and girls were beaten at home and 25% of those with intellectual disabilities had been raped.\n4.4\n.3 \n              \nDisabled women and girls are often targeted for violence because they are perceived as asexual, sick and powerless and they are not given tools such as sex education to identify abuse. Additionally, when they report violence their claims are not seen as credible. \n4.4\n.4 \n              \nIrene, a woman in Northern Uganda, reported that she was raped by a neighbor and that her husband had occasionally beaten her. Because of her severe limitations to move and communicate she had not been able to report the incidents\n.\n  \nPhysical, financial and emotional dependence on partners as well as fear of stigmas of being alone also keep many disabled women in abusive relationships.\n4.4\n.5 \n              \nFear of potential abuse also limits the movement of women and girls with disabilities, confirmed by accounts from women like\n the mother of Sharon, a deaf girl living in a refugee camp in Uganda.\n4.4\n.6 \n              \nViolence against women in general is a critical issue and one for which DFID contracted an important series of guidance notes.\n However these briefings only mention disability and gender in a sentence or two that includes disabled women among a laundry list. For instance, the second guidance note mentions designing \nprogrammes\n to “meet the needs of women of different ages, marital status, disability, social class, \nrace/ethnicity, sexual orientation and other identities”. Given the staggering incidence of violence against disabled women this issue must be more specifically addressed by DFID in its overarching frameworks and strategies.\n&#xa0;4.5               Economic Empowerment4.5\n.1 \n              \nEconomic empowerment is a critical issue for disabled women and girls given the degree to which they are impoverished and have their life options restricted as a result. This is not to mention the extent to which financial dependence exposes them to violence and abuse.\n4.5\n.2 \n              \nMen with disabilities are almost twice as likely to have jobs than disabled women. In the US almost 42% of men compared to 24% of women are employed. Women are also only paid 56% of the earning of full-time employed men.\n4.5\n.3 \n              \nThere are even far fewer opportunities for disabled women in the developing world with only 3% of disabled women registered in employment in Ghana, 0.3% in India and 19% in the Philippines.\n4.5\n.4 \n              \nAdditionally, disabled women have far less access to economic and social protection \nprogrammes\n that are often offered through the \nlabour\n force. This includes supplemental security income, disability insurance, workers’ compensation and vocational rehabilitation. When they do access employment assistance \nprogrammes\n they receive significantly lower levels of benefits than disabled men. And yet, despite a greater need for public assistance they receive far fewer funds from public income support \nprogrammes\n.\n4.5\n.5 \n              \nFor instance, government livelihoods \nprogrammes\n in Uganda require members to form groups of 15-25 people, from which disabled women are often excluded. When they were able to join, they were expelled once the group received the grant because they were believed to not be able to fully participate.\n4.5\n.6 \n              \nWomen also face significant challenges in setting up their own businesses. A lack of assets makes it particularly difficult to access financial resources. Many financial service providers have also wrongly perceived disabled people to be high risks for loans, which combined with gender bias in financial services disadvantages disabled women even further.\n4.5\n.7 \n              \nMicro-finance \nprogrammes\n, which have traditionally been an important economic empowerment tool given how many women work in the informal sector, have also been difficult for disabled women to access according to anecdotal evidence. Some microfinance \nprogrammes\n have been set up by disability NGOs, but research is needed on their effectiveness.\n4.5\n.8 \n              \nDespite\n significant research that shows that disabled women and girls are among the world’s most economically disadvantaged the issue is not reflected in a 2012 DFID review aimed at compiling evidence for providing economic assets to women and girls. \nThe project is part of a larger pilot aimed at building capacity for evidence informed policy-making. DFID expert meetings and parliamentary presentations on economic empowerment of women and girls also appear to have left out this critical issue on multiple occasions.\n              \n5.               Seize the Moment-- Raise the Bar5.1 \n              \nDFID should seize the moment and lead the way internationally in overhauling its policies and \nprogrammes\n to create a structure that does not allow women with disabilities to fall between the cracks.\n5.2 \n              \nThis IDSC inquiry, which challenges DFID to critically review its policies and practices relating to disability inclusion, along with DFID’s dedication to women and girls places the UK in a unique position to raise the effectiveness of its own development work. It is also a window of opportunity for the UK to set an example for others across Europe and internationally to raise the ba\nr for disabled women and girls.\n5.3 \n              \nThe last review of DFID’s disability-focused projects, carried out a decade ago, showed that gender and disability were entirely absent from the agenda with not a single project specifically addressing the needs of disabled women out of 24 projects across 23 countries.\n5.4 \n              \nDisability experts have pointed out that the UK government had once “led the world on disability-inclusive development”, introducing the concept of the twin-track approach of including disability as an issue to mainstream across \nprogrammes\n as well as focusing specific efforts on disabled people. However, they point out that the issue has had “a low profile” recently and countries like the US and Australia have taken the lead.\n Regardless, gender and disability remains an issue that has not received enough attention worldwide. \n&#xa0;6.               Putting Gender and Disability- Inclusive Structures in Place6.1 \n              \nDFID must put in place structures that ensure that gender and disability are cross-cutting throughout its work. For this to take place DFID must first make a high-level commitment to ensuring that its work is disability inclusive—requiring inclusive practices linked to funding and that there is a strategy with relevant structures and processes. As it relates to gender this means DFID should: \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nRousso\n, \nHarilyn\n. 2003.
