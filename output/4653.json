"&#xa0;\nAFS0069&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Devon County Council&#xa0;\nQ1.  The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes;&#xa0;\nIn Devon the academy programme has not \nyet \nseen an overall transformation in\n outcomes for student outcomes. For example, of the 20 secondary schools that have converted to become academies, seven saw a decline in GCSE performance in 2013 against an overall rise in performance across the county. However there are examples of except\nional increases in performance in academies.\n&#xa0;\n Ilfracombe College reported a 24% increase in 5+ A-\nC grades including English and M\naths in 2013 compared to 2012\n.  Their \nconversion \nwas \nin May 2013\n just weeks before the examinations\n.\n&#xa0;\n There is little evidence \nin this authority that academisation has brought about any swifter progress in narrowing gaps in performance.\n&#xa0;\nLocal authorities have had their powers of intervention in academy schools removed. They have also lost funding when schools converted. However authorities retain responsibilities for \nboth \nthe \neducational outcomes and \nwelfare of all children in their local\nity particularly the most vulnerable. Devon has developed an academy protocol that sets out how it will relate to academy schoo\nls and resolve any difficulties but this protocol is yet to be fully tested with regard to challenging underperformance.\n&#xa0;\nOfsted \nhave made it clear in their framework for inspecting LA school improvement services that LAs should continue to support, monitor and challenge all schools. Devon continues to do so but the arrangements for challenging academy schools judged to Require Impr\novement by Ofsted are still being developed in practice. The Local Authority is aware that it can report any concerns it has regarding the performance of academies to the Secretary of State.\n&#xa0;\n Devon hopes to continue to retain sufficiently positive relation\nships with academy schools\n so\n that it \ndoes not need to resort to this \nbut the differing roles of the DfE and the Local Authority needs to be better defined in relation to \nunderperforming academies.\n&#xa0;\nQ2.  The process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors;&#xa0;\nDevon has a \ngood\n \nworking relationship with the O\nffice of Schools Commissioner\n regarding underperforming schools. \nIf a school is deemed to need rapid improvement and a structural so\nlution is necessary then the LA and DFE have worked \ntogether to \nmove the school to\n becoming an academy with a sponsor. \n We\n have al\nso worked together on identifying\n an appropriate sponsor.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q3.&#xa0; The role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands; &#xa0;There have been no failing academies in D\nevon so far. T\nhe capacity of the Secretary of State to monitor chal\nlenge and support all academy schools in difficulty \nmay be \ninsufficient \nwithout reference to\n a range of \nlocal \nschool improvement solutions\n.  T\nhe proposed Regional Commissioners will not have\n a\n detailed local knowledge or \nbe accountable to the local communi\nty.\n  The proposed Board of\n Academy Head\nteacher\ns will \nnot reflect the\n full\n diversit\ny of successful partnerships or\n outstanding \nschool \nleaders within Devon.  \n&#xa0;\nQ4.&#xa0;&#xa0;The functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level;&#xa0;\nLocal Authorities retain over 200 statu\ntory responsibilities for children regardless of the settings they attend.  Ofsted have also laid out clear and robust expectations of how Local Authorities need to fulfil their responsibilities for securing school improvement.  There should be no tension \nbetween a \ndiverse, \nself improving school system and the inv\nolvement of a Local Authority\n securing the best possible outcome\ns for all children in every setting\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ5.&#xa0;&#xa0;What role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;\nThere is often a lack of clarity around the roles and responsibilities and\n diffe\nrent levels of governance within\n complex multi-academy models.  This can lead to a reduction in accountabilities.  The differing legal respo\nnsibilities of\n governors, charity t\nrustees \nand company directors require\n strengthening and \ngreater \nclarity.\n&#xa0;\nQ6.  The appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply;&#xa0; and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole;&#xa0;\nSmaller Primary Schools\n would\n more easily embrace academy status if part of a group but this would drive greater economies and efficiencies if based on a federation infrastructure, \n(one governing body, one budget and usually one executive headteacher).\n  \nHeadteachers and governor\ns \nare now more aware of the increased responsibility and workload which\n in their view\n often can outweigh any benefits.\n&#xa0;\nQ7.  &#xa0;What alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools; The purpose of becoming a sponsored academy is to promote rapid improvement in an underperforming school;&#xa0;\nThe objective is a better deal for the children rather than the academy conversion. If there was another convincing and credible local solution that can bring about such a transformation then it should be considered.\n&#xa0;\n \nFor example, an outstanding school ma\ny provide the necessary support to bring about the change required without the need to resort to a change in status. In Devon we have a number of examples of federations and management partnerships that have resulted in swift school \nimprovement \nbut this ha\ns been due to the exceptional leaders and not the\n \norganisational structure.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013              \n"
