default&#xa0;defaultThe Deregulation Bill – Rights of Waydefault&#xa0;defaultAshover
default Parish Council holds its next meeting on 17 September 2013, which will be too late to submit comments, as a corporate body, before the deadline of 16 September 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, as Clerk, and having consulted with the Chairman, I feel it necessary to place on record this Council’s previous action in seeking to prevent BOATs being awarded on lanes within the parish, by attending a Public Enquiry and participating in a subsequent Appeal relating to Ralph Lane at Marsh Green, 
defaultAshover
default.  On appeal this lane was designated a BOAT and is an unsealed lane frequently used by Trail Riders on Motorbikes, causing damage to the environment and the lane.
default&#xa0;
defaultI list below the current situation relating to claims on rights of way within the parish:-
default&#xa0;
defaultA total of 12 applications have been submitted to Derbyshire County Council under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to add non-classified highways, bridleways and footpaths to the Definitive Map and Statement as a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT).  
defaultAshover
default Parish Council has lodged strong objections to each application received for consultation.  Application locations (and decisions made to date by DCC) are shown below:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.  Non-classified highway at 
defaultNuttingfield
default Farm, 
defaultLittlemoor
default - BOAT rejected and an Order made and advertised adding it to the definitive map as a bridleway – no objections were received and this route has now been confirmed as a bridleway.
default&#xa0;
default3. Footpath 
default146 
defaultHolestone
default Gate Rd
default to 
defaultOverton Rd
default - BOAT rejected and footpath status to remain.
default&#xa0;
default4. Bridleway 140 Vernon Lane, 
defaultKelstedge
default - BOAT rejected and Bridleway status to remain.
default&#xa0;
default5. Non-classified highway at Marsh Green – An Order adding it to the definitive map as a BOAT has been confirmed.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI trust the above information indicates 
defaultAshover
default Parish Council’s resistance to BOAT claims, and the need for legislation to protect these lanes, together with a right of appeal against any highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order.
