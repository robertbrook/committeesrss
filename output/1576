[normal]Ashover[bold] Parish Council – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Deregulation Bill – Rights of Way[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Ashover
[normal] Parish Council holds its next meeting on 17 September 2013, which will be too late to submit comments, as a corporate body, before the deadline of 16 September 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, as Clerk, and having consulted with the Chairman, I feel it necessary to place on record this Council’s previous action in seeking to prevent BOATs being awarded on lanes within the parish, by attending a Public Enquiry and participating in a subsequent Appeal relating to Ralph Lane at Marsh Green, 
[normal]Ashover
[normal].  On appeal this lane was designated a BOAT and is an unsealed lane frequently used by Trail Riders on Motorbikes, causing damage to the environment and the lane.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I list below the current situation relating to claims on rights of way within the parish:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A total of 12 applications have been submitted to Derbyshire County Council under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to add non-classified highways, bridleways and footpaths to the Definitive Map and Statement as a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT).  
[normal]Ashover
[normal] Parish Council has lodged strong objections to each application received for consultation.  Application locations (and decisions made to date by DCC) are shown below:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  Non-classified highway at 
[normal]Nuttingfield
[normal] Farm, 
[normal]Littlemoor
[normal] - BOAT rejected and an Order made and advertised adding it to the definitive map as a bridleway – no objections were received and this route has now been confirmed as a bridleway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Footpath 
[normal]146 
[normal]Holestone
[normal] Gate Rd
[normal] to 
[normal]Overton Rd
[normal] - BOAT rejected and footpath status to remain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Bridleway 140 Vernon Lane, 
[normal]Kelstedge
[normal] - BOAT rejected and Bridleway status to remain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Non-classified highway at Marsh Green – An Order adding it to the definitive map as a BOAT has been confirmed.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I trust the above information indicates 
[normal]Ashover
[normal] Parish Council’s resistance to BOAT claims, and the need for legislation to protect these lanes, together with a right of appeal against any highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order.
