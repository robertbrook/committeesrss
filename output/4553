defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?default&#xa0;
defaultI
default have written a paper entitled ‘No consensus on consensus’
default 
defaultthat argues that
default 
defaultthe
default scientific consensus seeking process used by the IPCC has had the unintended consequence of introducing biases into the both the science and related decision making processes.
default 
defaultC
defaultognitive biases in the context of an institutionalized consensus building process have arguably resulted in the consensus becoming increasingly confirmed in a self-reinforcing way
default, to the detriment of the scientific process
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile the IPCC’s consensus approach acknowledges uncertainties, defenders of the IPCC consensus have expended considerable efforts in the 
default‘
defaultboundary work
default’
default of distinguishing those qualified to contribute to the climate change c
defaultonsensus from those who are not
default.  These efforts have 
defaultattempted to characterize
default 
defaultthose that disagree with the IPCC consensus
default as 
defaultsmall in number
default, extreme
default, and scientifically suspect
default. 
default 
defaultThese efforts create temptations to make illegitimate attacks on scientists whose views do not align with 
defaultthe consensus, and to dismiss any disagreement as p
defaultolitically motivated ‘denialism
default’
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA
default large number of climate scientists disagree with the views portrayed by IPCC; many of these scientists are included in desmogblog’s list
default of almost 300 climate change 
defaultdeniers (my name is included on this list).  A reflection of disagreement with the ‘consensus’ is a recent survey
default of the professional members of the American Meteorological Society
default that found

defaultHow effective is AR5 and the summary for poldefaulticymakers in defaultconveyingdefault&#xa0;defaultwhat is meant by defaultuncertainty in scientific termsdefault? default&#xa0;defaultI have been raising concerns
default 
defaultsinc
defaulte 2003 about how uncertainty surrounding climate change is evaluated and communicated. The IPCC’s efforts to consider uncertainty focus primarily on communicating uncertainty, rather than on characterizing and exploring uncertainty in a way that would be u
defaultseful for risk managers and resource managers and the institutions that fund science. 
defaultIn a series of three papers
default 
defaultI
default have argued that the characterization of uncertainty by the IPCC is inadequate and leads to overconfidence in the conclusions, particularly with regards to the IPCC statement on attribution. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnthropogenic climate change is a proposed theory whose basic 
defaultmechanism is well understood, but whose magnitude is highly uncertain owing to feedback processes. We know that climate changes naturally on decadal to century time scales, but we do not have explanations for observed 
defaulthistorical and paleo climate variation
defaults, including the warming from 1910-1940 and the mid 20
defaultth
default century cooling. The competition for the theory of anthropogenic climate change is our recognized ignorance about what we don’t know about natural climate variability. 
defaultThe IPCC’s failure to adequatel
defaulty characterize uncertainty arises from neglecting to consider indeterminacy and ignorance in their assessments of confidence.

default&#xa0;defaultDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?default&#xa0;defaultThe recently released 
defaultIPCC AR5
default 
defaultSummary for Policy Makers (SPM)
default 
defaultof the 
defaultIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5
defaultth
default Assessment Report makes the following statement:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThere is 
defaultvery high confidence 
defaultthat climate models reproduce the observed large-scale patterns and multi-decadal trends in surface temperature, 
defaultespecially since the mid-20th century
default. (AR5 SPM, p 9)
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPCC’s own analysis seems to belie this
default statement, as evidenced by Figure 11.25 
defaultAR5
default. 
defaultThis figure shows that climate models have significantly over-predicted the warming effect of CO2 since 1990, a
default period during which CO2 increased from 335 to over 400 parts per million.  The most recent climate model simulations used in the AR5 indicate 
defaultthat the warming stagnation since 1998 is no longer consistent with model projections even at the 2% confidence l
defaultevel
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUncertainties in climate models and their simulations are associated with incomplete
default understanding of the climate system, inadequacies of numerical solutions employed in computer models, uncertainty in model parameters and parameterizations
default of unresolved processes
default, and also unce
defaultrtainty in initial conditions. 
defaultModel outcome uncertainty, also referred to as prediction error,
default arises from the propagation of the aforementioned uncertainti
defaultes through the model simulation
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPCC AR5 has placed 
defaulthigh confidence on the simulations of climate models, in spite of the fact that climate models have significantly overpredicted the warming for the past two decades.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the globdefaultal surface temperature record?default&#xa0;defaultBased upon early (leaked) drafts of the AR5, the IPCC did not even mention 
defaultthis hiatus
default. Apparently the IPCC was pressured by reviewers and its policy maker constituency to address this stagnation specifically.  Here is the r
defaultelevant text from the final version of the AR5 Summary for Policy Makers:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultModels do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10
default 
default–15 years.
default” 
default(SPM AR5
default)
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThere is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial degree caused by unpredictable climate variability, with possible contributions from inadequacies in the solar, volcanic, and aerosol forcings used by the m
defaultodels and, in some models, from too strong a response to increasing greenhouse-gas forcing.
default”  (SPM AR5)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe failure of the IPCC to predict this stagnation in warming is raising serious questions about whether climate models are over sensitive to increasin
defaultg greenhouse gases. The IPCC’s dismissal of the stagnation as being associated with unpredictable climate variability raises the question as to what extent the warming between 1975 and 2000 can also be explained by unpredictable climate variability.

defaultIs defaultthe IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientdefaultific knowledge? Or has it focusdefaulted on providing a justification for political commitment?default&#xa0;defaultI am increasingly concerned that both the climate change problem and its solution have been vastly oversim
defaultplified. I am concerned that the consensus seeking process used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has introduced biases and acted to skew the science
default in the direction of self-confirmation
default.
default 
default My research on understanding the dynamics of
default uncertainty at the climate science-policy interface has led me to question
default whether these dynamics are operating in a manner that is healthy for 
defaulteither 
defaultthe science 
defaultor the policy process
default, acting to hyper-politicize both.
default 
defaultI see a growing
default gap between what sci
defaultence is currently 
defaultproviding
default in terms of information about 
defaultclimate variability and change 
defaultand the information desired by decision makers
default.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultIn the 1990’s, the U.S. and other nations
default embarked on a path to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change 
defaultby 
defaultstabilization of the concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases
default, which was codified by the 1992 
defaultUN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
default treaty
default. The IPCC scientific assessments play a primary role in legitimizing national and international po
defaultlicies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
default 
defaultThis objective has led to the IPCC assessments being framed around identifying anthropogenic influences on climate, 
defaultdangerous 
defaultenvironmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and stabilization o
defaultf CO
default2
default c
defaultoncentrations in the atmosphere.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the time of establishment of the UNFCCC, there was as yet no clear signal of anthropogenic warming in the observations, as per the IPCC First Assessment Report (FAR) in 1990.
default It wasn’t until the IPCC’s Second Ass
defaultessment Report in 1995 that a 
default‘discernible’
default human influence on global climate was identified. The scientific support for the UNFCCC treaty was not based on observations, but rather on our theoretical understanding of the greenhouse effect and simulations f
defaultrom global climate models. 
defaultBy 2006/2007, 
defaultclimate change had soared to the top of the international political agenda
default,
default as a result of Hurricane Katrina, Al Gore’s 
defaultAn Inconvenient Truth
default, publication of the IPCC AR4 in 2007, and award of the Nobel Peace Prize 
defaultto Al Gore and the IPCC.  There was a consensus that the science was settled, and that it clearly demanded radical policy and governmental action to substantially cut CO2 emissions.
default&#xa0;
defaultNow, at the time of release of the AR5 in 2013,
default we find ourselves between 
defaultthe metaphorical
default rock and a hard place with regards to climate science and policy:
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd finally:
default&#xa0;
defaultHow and why did we land between a rock and a hard place on the climate change i
defaultssue?  There are probably many contributing reasons, but the most fundamental and profound reason is arguably that both the problem and solution were vastly oversimplified back in 1990. This framing was locked in by a self-reinforcing consensus-seeking app
defaultroach to the science and a ‘speaking consensus to power’ approach for decision making 
defaultthat pointed to only one possible course of policy action – radical emissions reductions. 
defaultThe climate community has worked for more than 20 years to establish a 
defaultscientifi
defaultc 
defaultconsensus
default on anthropogenic climate change. However, the ongoing scientific consensus seeking process has had the unintended consequence of oversimplifying both the problem and its solution and hyper-politicizing both, introducing biases into the both the
default science and related decision making processes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe framing of the 
defaultclimate change 
defaultproblem by the UNFCCC/IPCC and the early articulation of a preferred policy option by the UNFCCC has
default arguably
default marginalized research on broader issues surrounding climate change, and resulted i
defaultn
default an overconfident assessment of the importance of greenhouse gases in future climate change, and stifled the development of a broader range of policy options.
default 
defaultThe result of
default this simplified framing of a wicked problem is that we lack the kinds of information to more broadly understand climate change and societal vulnerability.
