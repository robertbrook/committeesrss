defaultI am increasingly concerned about the continual increase in off-roading by bikes and 4x4s, plus quadbikes
default 
defaultnot only in the National Parks but right across the county, and the failure of present
default 
defaultgovernment legislation to deal with it and would like to recommend that further clauses affecting
default 
defaultrights of way should be added to the present legislation to enable the wide spread problem to be
default 
defaultdealt with in a more positive manner.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe damage and disruption caused by this activity is severely against the basic ethos of National
default 
defaultParks and life in the countryside 
defaultand is not something which shou
defaultld have to be tolerated by
default 
defaultresidents of communities affected 24 hours a day; it reduces peoples quality of life which is
default 
defaultdefinitely not taken into account by these people on bikes and 4x4s, also quads.

defaulte on the Chatsworth Estate, a single
default 
defaults
defaulttreet in the village, 'High Street', 
defaultprovides
default access
default 
defaultfor these offroaders to and from Bradley Lane, they are aggressive, arrogant and abusive, and
default 
defaultusually drive in a very dangerous manner doing wheelies etc up and down high street. It is
default 
defaultimpossible to remonstrate with them in anyway because what they are doing is supposed to be
default 
defaultlegal.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor a great number of years, Pilsl
defaulte
defaulty Village and also villages in the area which are too numerous to
default 
defaultmention have been complaining and campaigning to all local authorities to no avail also we have
default 
defaultformed action groups.
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year on 4, 5, 6
default December 2012 I attended a public i
defaultnquiry meeting on Bradley Lane held over the
default 
defaultthree 
defaultfull days
default in Bradley Village Hall.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe meeting was conducted by a 
defaultInspector
default called Mr Mark 
defaultY
defaultates, the meeting was well attended by the
default 
defaultreps o

default 
defaultI
defaultn 
defaultmy opinion
default Mr 
defaultY
defaultates conducted the
default 
defaultmeeting in a fair and professional manner
default. The same applies to the following site meeting up and down Bradley Lane. Pilsley residents were very pleased to hear his eventual decision to redesignate Bradley Lane to bridleway status.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever the off roaders have appealed against his decision putting the bridleway status in doubt. Also it seems we are to get another Public 
defaultInquiry
default Meeting.  Also the ongoing expense to public taxpayers must be tremendous considering the build up and the conduct of such meetings.
default&#xa0;
defaultA few years ago when Bradley Lane was becoming very rutted and muddy the County Council estimate to repair it was £75,000 plus £5,000 for them to maintain it. It has since been repaired but the off roaders are now destroying the new surface so that it will need repairing yet again. If more positive legislation was in place to restrict or ban this activity hundreds of thousands of pounds of valuable public money could be saved in road repairs, public meetings and endless hours of office work.  Therefore I think it most important that members of the Committee advising the Deregulation Bill understand the scale of off roading in the Peak District and elsewhere and the problems and distress it is causing and would like them to 
defaultconsider whatever additions to the Bill are necessary to eliviate the problems and improve the quality of life for communities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI enclose photos of off road bikers using Bradley Lane also the extent of damage to the original damage by 4x4s, bikers and quad bikes. The lane became impassable for any other users.
default&#xa0;
defaultI also enclose photos and report of a family vehicle accidently going down Bradley Lane in the dark. The vehicle contained a young mother and two young children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the photos were taken Bradley Lane has been repaired at Great Expense to taxpayers. The off roaders, bikers, 4x4 quads etc. are continuing to use lane and are damaging the new surface which means it will eventually need repairing yet again.
