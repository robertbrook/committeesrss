[normal]Written evidence from

[normal] [PCC Progress 15]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]The role of 
[normal]Police and Crime P
[normal]anels in holding their commissioners to account:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]PCC
[normal] in 
[normal]County X has demonstrated a
[normal] low level of commitment
[normal],
[normal] in practice, to 
[normal]equal opportunities
[normal].  For example: recruiting staff to his
[normal]/her
[normal] office without any regard to equally opportunities recruitment and selection processes, thus setting a very poor example as a senior public servant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Also a
[normal]warding grants under the 
[normal]Local P
[normal]olicing 
[normal]F
[normal]und: The 
[normal]PCC
[normal] gave a 
[normal]significant grant to one local group to
[normal] before eve
[normal]n launching the application process
[normal].  Many local organisat
[normal]ions were then refused awards on
[normal] the basis that there was insufficient funding. It is difficult to avoid the appearance of favouritism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It
[normal] does not appear that the Police and C
[normal]rime Panel are able to hold the C
[normal]ommissioner to account in areas of equal opportunities and fairness.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. The role of C
[normal]ommissione
[normal]rs in budget and precept setting:  A
[normal]gain the
[normal] admini
[normal]stration of the Local Policing Fund where
[normal] a 
[normal]significant grant
[normal] was given out to one organisation before others where even able to access th
[normal]e application form.  This gives rise to concerns around the C
[normal]ommissioner’s attitude to the budget.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Effectiveness of C
[normal]ommissioners in promoting local policing priorities:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There has been some consultation in 
[normal]our area 
[normal]around the 
[normal]PCC
[normal]’s priorities.  However, the major consultation meeting was extremely disappointing for those participating.  Whereas significant dissent was expressed at the consultation meeting, the notes suggested a much greater agreement with the 
[normal]PCC
[normal]’s plans.  Further, consultation with the third sector has looked very
[normal] much like a fait accompli.  It was very clear to everyone present
[normal] that the 
[normal]PCC
[normal] has decided what the priorities are and it is difficult to avoid the appearance that the consultation 
[normal]is merely a case of “going through th
[normal]e motions.”  For instance, the C
[normal]ommissioner
[normal]’s office had
[normal] undertake
[normal]n
[normal] a “mapping exercise” of all the third sector agencies involved with crime and crime reduction work.  At the consultation meeting this 
[normal]map was produced but it did not
[normal] include any of the
[normal] county hate crime partnerships – despite the fact that 
[normal]these are voluntary sector led p
[normal]artnerships receiving significa
[normal]nt funding from the respective Crime Reduction Partnerships and the County C
[normal]ouncil.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]PCC
[normal] has made it clear that he
[normal]/she
[normal] fully supports the notion of a sing
[normal]le gateway for victims
[normal] his
[normal]/her
[normal] consultation
[normal] with the voluntary sector appears mostly to
[normal] focus on how this may operate, not on the more fundamental questions of whether it is desirable or necessary.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please note we do not feel able to identify the County as we are an organisation who will be seeking funds from the 
[normal]PCC
[normal] and fear that if he/she knows we have criticised him/her
[normal] 
[normal]in this consultation this might af
[normal]fect his/her funding decisions.
