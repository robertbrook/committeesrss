If the prisoner does not want any legal assistance the hearing proceeds. However, if the prisoner requests legal advice, the adjudicating governor will consider each of the following criteria (resulting from the case of R v \nHome Secretary\n \nex parte \nTarrant) and record their reasons for either refusing or allowing representation or a friend: \n the seriousness of the charge/potential penalty; \n a substantive point of law being in question; \n the prisoner being unable to present their own case; \n potential procedural difficulties; \n urgency being required; or \n reasons of fairness to prisoners and staff. \n&#xa0;\nIf the adjudicating governor allows the request they will adjourn the hearing for a reasonable time to allow the prisoner to telephone or write to a solicitor.\n \n \n"
