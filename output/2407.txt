[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;‘…the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law’. &#xa0;&#xa0;Children’s special and dependent status creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights.  So States need to give particular attention to ensuring that there are effective, child-sensitive procedures available to children and their representatives.  These should include the provision of child-friendly information, advice, advocacy, including support for self-advocacy, and access to independent complaints procedures

[[[&#xa0;]]]September 2013&#xa0;4&#xa0; The Children’s Commissioner’s remit includes all children under 18 in England and young adults aged 18-20 who are care leavers or have a learning disability. She also has a duty to speak on behalf of all children in the UK on non-devolved issues which include immigration, for the whole of the UK, and youth justice, for England and Wales.  At para 24, emphasis added. CRC, Report on the forty-third session, September 2006, Day of General Discussion, Recommendations, paras. 34 to 36 and 38. Tower Hamlets Safeguarding Children Board, August 2013, Serious Case Review Executive Summary: Services provided for Child F June 2004 – January 2012. See Family Law Bar Association, Transforming Legal Aid consultation response. See Office of the Children’s Commissioner (2012), They never give up on you,  p97ff; and Office of the Children’s Commissioner (2013), Always Someone Else’s Problem, pp33 and 39 re schools’ awareness of and application of the legal requirements. The recent Administrative Court decision of R (Yiyu Chen and others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department CO/1119/2013, concerning the circumstances in which force may be used against children being removed from the United Kingdom, and in which the Children’s Commissioner intervened, is  just one example of an important children’s rights case that would, we believe, have failed the residence test as currently proposed.
