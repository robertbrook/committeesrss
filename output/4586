[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sense International 
[normal](SI) is an international development NGO that supports deafblind
[normal] people and their families in countries where extreme poverty exists – 
[normal]India
[normal], 
[normal]Bangladesh
[normal], 
[normal]Kenya
[normal], 
[normal]Uganda
[normal], 
[normal]Tanzania
[normal], 
[normal]Peru
[normal] and 
[normal]Romania
[normal]. 
[normal]By working closely with families and professionals we supp
[normal]ort deafblind people to develop vital communication and life skills
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SI works in active partnership with local organisations and governments to
[normal] deliver appropriate educational, health and vocational services for deafblind people
[normal].
[normal] SI supports local disability and parent groups by offering them the training, backing and financial support needed to advocate for their needs and provide mutual support. Together we aim to spread the word about deafblindness and campaign for deafblind pe
[normal]ople’s needs to be formally 
[normal]recognised
[normal] and met.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a member of the Bond DDG, we are supporting the disability sector wide recommendations made in that submission and so have only included more specific recommendations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Governments need a 
[normal]N[bold]ational [bold]Disability Strategy[bold] for the inclusion of people with disabilities, including a 
[normal]National Council of Disabled People[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Multi-disciplinary [bold]working[bold].  As part of this strategy there needs to be a single inter-departmental pathway whi
[normal]ch deals with and coordinates the identification, assessment and treatment across all the governmental ministries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Small scale Civil Society work[bold] can provide innovative models for inclusive development.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]People with complex needs such as deafblindness 
[normal]are harder to reach than people with other disabilities and so are not benefitting from much of the work that DFID is doing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Stigma [bold]and lack of understanding is standing in the way of deafblind people being identified which means that they are isolated and not benefitting from progress being made in development.  This needs to be addressed with national awareness programmes and trainin
[normal]g of teachers, 
[normal]health workers
[normal] and other professionals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Teachers, health workers and others need 
[normal]training[bold] in order to understand how to include deafblind people in mainstream services.  The 
[normal]specialist knowledge[bold] 
[normal]of organisations like SI and its partners is
[normal] needed to provide this training and to support deafblind people to develop the communication and mobility skills they need to be part of their families and communities.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Participation[bold] of disabled people is a key element in the development of policy and pr
[normal]actice around disability.  Deafblind people and their families are struggling to participate due to a lack of understanding of their needs, such as the provision of interpreters
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Deafblindness is a combination of 
[normal]sight
[normal] 
[normal]and[bold] 
[normal]hearing
[normal] impairments. Some people are completely deaf and blind, but most have a little sight and/or hearing they can use. 
[normal]As a consequence they are unable to
[normal];
[normal] communicate with their parents and the o
[normal]utside world
[normal];
[normal] move around independently
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]and access
[normal] 
[normal]information and services
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Deafblind
[normal]ness is a spectrum and
[normal] people 
[normal]vary enormously in the levels of their disability. 
[normal] At one extreme of the spectrum 
[normal]individual
[normal]s
[normal] have 
[normal]cognitive and physical disabilities in addition to
[normal] hearing and vision loss
[normal] and at the other 
[normal]people have hearing and vision loss
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Whether deafblindness is congenital or acquired influences an individual
[normal]’
[normal]s communication methods and how they identify themselves. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]e are talking about a
[normal] highly diverse
[normal] group
[normal] of people
[normal]. 
[normal]However, they 
[normal]have 
[normal]in common the fact that they are a 
[normal]marginalised
[normal] group 
[normal]with 
[normal]distinctive 
[normal]complex needs. 
[normal]From the social model there are specific barriers that prevent this 
[normal]particularly
[normal] marginalised group from accessing services.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We estimate
[normal] there are 
[normal]at least 2.85 million 
[normal]deafblind people amongst the 1 billion people with disabilities globally
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Society should
[normal] 
[normal]not just be based on what people can add economically, but instead reflect 
[normal]the
[normal] diversity of 
[normal]a population 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] equal rights and opportunities.  There is a drive 
[normal]within development 
[normal]to make this happen by mainstreaming disability but a
[normal]t present very few d
[normal]eafblind
[normal] people are being reached
[normal].
[normal]  This is due to a number of different factors which we discuss below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Stigma[bold] 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]People with complex needs and their families often face stigma within their communities. 
[normal]Equally, t
[normal]hey are often ostracised by their families and have 
[normal]little or 
[normal]no relationship with society. This impedes identification by authorities and inclusion in society
[normal],
[normal] ultimately preventing access to the services, materials and r
[normal]ights individuals need to live.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]K
[normal]evin
[normal] is deafblind
[normal], his
[normal] 
[normal]mother said “Kevin was unable to walk, talk and see for a long time”. She continued, “We were isolated, 
[normal]stigmatised
[normal] and hated by our 
[normal]neighbours
[normal] just because of our son’s condition.  Some 
[normal]neighbours
[normal] laughed at his strange disability, others stood in wonder at it.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“My husband fled when he realised that Jematia was deaf and blind, and claimed that I had brought curses to his family.  My mother-in-law was also threatening to kill me because of giving
[normal] birth to such a child in their family.”  Eunice 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Identification[bold] [bold]- 
[normal]Identification of people with disabilities is hard enough but identification of people with complex disabilities is even harder. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The census is one way to identify the number of disabled 
[normal]people in a country and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics
[normal] has been formulating questions over the last ten years or so that many countries include within their census’.  However, social stigma prevents many families bringing forward people wit
[normal]h deafblindness for the census.  In addition to this, trainings for staff carrying out the census in complex disabilities are needed in order to facilitate their identification of this group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This has much wider implications for inclusion and DFID’s work.
[normal]  Issues of shame, embarrassment and fear prevent participation.  How people view deafblindness needs to change. If this doesn’t occur take up rates for any programme or project will never increase/reach target.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Communication[bold] [bold]- 
[normal]Deafblind individuals have limited communication methods. 
[normal] They may use
[normal];
[normal] speech with the assistance of a hearing aid
[normal] and lipreading
[normal];
[normal] or they may use sign language (possibly manually
[normal],
[normal] within a 
[normal]small visual frame
[normal] or simplified
[normal])
[normal];
[normal] or they may use objects
[normal] to un
[normal]derstand what is happening
[normal].  This means that i
[normal]t is much harder for them
[normal] to communicate their needs, access their
[normal] rights or advocate for change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Mobility[bold] [bold]- 
[normal]Deafblind people also face difficulties with mobility
[normal].  This can cause difficulties 
[normal]both 
[normal]in familiar environments such as their own 
[normal]homes
[normal] and 
[normal]communities and moving to unfamiliar environments as may be necessary to go to school or work
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Access to Information[bold] [bold]- 
[normal]Communication and mobility problems combine to make access to information difficult
[normal] for deafblind people
[normal].  This means that there may be government programmes and benefits that they would 
[normal]be eligible for but which they know nothing about.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The barriers discussed above need to be addressed for development to be inclusive of 
[normal]people with d
[normal]eafblindness
[normal].  This section 
[normal]includes 
[normal]some of the solutions that can be put in place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Awareness campaigns[bold] - 
[normal]To develop an integrated
[normal],
[normal] bilateral approach
[normal], DFID can work with national governments on awareness programmes to create greater underst
[normal]anding of these groups 
[normal]and combat discrimination and stigma.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]or example in the late 1990’s the 
[normal]UK
[normal] government ran a campaign about ‘See the person, not the disability’ featuring different disabled people and their lives.  The aim was to show that disabled
[normal] people are like anyone else, wanting friends, family, education, employment etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This campaign was obviously planned specifically for the 
[normal]UK
[normal] context but the concept could be adapted for different countries.
[normal]  Lessons could also be learnt from the campaigns to address stigma and disc
[normal]rimination as a result of HIV/Aids
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Participation[bold] [bold]- 
[normal]Involvement of disabled people needs to be a key element of developing policy and practice for people with disabilities. It mak
[normal]es governments and NGOs accountable to the people they serve, ensures transparency and ensures the sustainability of 
[normal]policy and practices.  Deafblind people face more obstacles to participation than any other group of people, due to the profound communicat
[normal]ion barriers they face.  
[normal]The
[normal]refore, the
[normal] input of deafblind people can ensure no-one is left 
[normal]behind;
[normal] there are a number of different strands that need to be taken into account to achieve this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Firstly, deafblind individuals 
[normal]who 
[normal]are able to contribute to t
[normal]hese processes 
[normal]should have the opportunity to
[normal] be
[normal] included. SI 
[normal]has supported the creation of
[normal] 
[normal]National 
[normal]Associations 
[normal]of Deafblind People 
[normal]in several of 
[normal]the
[normal] countries
[normal] where it works
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SI India is working with an Adult Deafblind Forum. It aims 
[normal]to provide training and support deafblind adults to understand their rights and advocate for change.  The group is very reliant on interpreters and support workers to enable communication amongst the 
[normal]members
[normal] but they are able to provide mutual support and 
[normal]advocate for change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Secondly, amongst deafblind people who can contribute to the development of policy and practice there is an urgent need for role models to inspire young people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]ith the support of SI Peru 
[normal]Ms 
[normal]Minaya
[normal] Magally
[normal] took part in a lead
[normal]ership course in 2006 and started working for SI Peru in 2007. In 2012 Minaya was hired by 
[normal]the National Council for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities,
[normal] CONADIS as a "Deafblind Specialist". 
[normal]Her role
[normal] is to develop trainings in the field of deafblin
[normal]dness, deafblind people rights and communication systems to public officials
[normal]. 
[normal]CONADIS has become the first public institution in the country to hire a person with deafblindness and Minaya acts a role model for deafblind young people in 
[normal]Peru
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Thirdly, 
[normal]the 
[normal]training 
[normal]and provision 
[normal]of interpreters
[normal].  Without interpreters with the appropriate skills to support them, many deafblind people are not able to take part in groups and forums.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2010, as a result of campaigning by SI Peru a law was introduced, recog
[normal]ni
[normal]s
[normal]ing deafblindness as a unique disability.  The law gave deafblind people the right to guide interpreters to meet their communication and mobility needs.  In 2011 regulations were approved to set up an interpreter guide service and a register of these in
[normal]terpreters.  These regulations are now starting to be implemented.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]"Interpreters play a key role in helping deafblind people understand the world around them and participate fully in society. Without the support of a qualified interpreter many deafblind p
[normal]eople would struggle to participate in a 
[normal]conversation or group activities. Having this support allows a deafblind person to connect with others and feel part of a group." Kate Fitch, deputy head of public policy at deafblind charity Sense
[normal] in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Fourthly
[normal], it is important to involve parents or close family members as many children and adults with complex disabilities find it hard to be able to contribute to these processes themselves. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]I Kenya supported the 
[normal]Parents of Deafblind Persons
[normal]’
[normal] Organisation
[normal] to 
[normal]work with
[normal] the Kenya National Association of Parents
[normal],
[normal] in order to jointly lobby the government to increase provision for deafblind education
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] The 
[normal]parents
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]organisations met with
[normal] the Ministry of Education 
[normal]and
[normal] the government committed to add
[normal]itional teachers 
[normal]f
[normal]o
[normal]r
[normal] deafblind units and to recommending amendments to the 
[normal]E
[normal]ducation 
[normal]B
[normal]ill of 2012 to include deafblindness. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Specialist knowledge[bold] - [bold]Achieving 
[normal]mainstreaming 
[normal]for children and adults with complex disabilities requires the input of specialist 
[normal]knowledge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C
[normal]ommunity workers who have this specialist knowledge are able to work with deafblind people, their families and communities to develop communication methods and independence skills. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In schools teaching assistants are needed to work with 
[normal]deafblind children and make inclusion possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]his specialist knowledge include
[normal]s
[normal] an understanding of how to develop the communication and social skills; orientation and mobility skills; daily living skills; literacy, numeracy and vocational skills and t
[normal]he perceptional awareness ne
[normal]cessary
[normal] to achieve a level of independence.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Families and communities need to 
[normal]be included in this process 
[normal]to enable
[normal] an understanding of how a person can contribute to family and community life.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Assistive Devices[bold] - [bold]To allow deafblind people a voice and 
[normal]enable
[normal] them access
[normal] to
[normal] their rights they need assistance with communication
[normal] and mobility
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] This 
[normal]may 
[normal]involve t
[normal]he provision of assistive devices such as hearing
[normal] aids, canes and wheelchairs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Training for mainstream staff[bold] [bold]- [bold]Teachers, health workers and others need training in order to understand how to include deafblind people in 
[normal]mainstream services.  The specialist knowledge of organisations like SI and its partners is needed to provide this training.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Small scale Civil So[bold]ciety work [bold]can provide i
[normal]nnovative models for inclusive d
[normal]evelopment. Funding civil society programmes is only a small part of what DFID does but it is an important way of developing models that demonstrate to the community, the rest of civil society and the
[normal] government what is possible.  These model programmes act as evidence for effective ways to achieve inclusive development.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]Bangladesh
[normal], with
[normal] 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]assistance,
[normal] SI 
[normal]has a 
[normal]programme that is implemented by our partner CDD.  This programme has established 
[normal]a
[normal] National Resource Centre on deafblindness 
[normal]in Dhaka,
[normal] which is 
[normal]the first of its kind in 
[normal]Bangladesh
[normal]. NRC
[normal] partners with 16 development organizations from 16 districts and has reached about 800 deafblind people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] hub and spoke model
[normal] has emerged as an impo
[normal]rtant space offering information, training opportunities, referral services and counselling on deafblindness. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NRC has initiated a series of advocacy interventions aimed at the government and other parts of the development sector, including 
[normal]the 
[normal]media.
[normal] These interventions have aimed to facilitate the recognition of deafblindness as a unique
[normal] disability
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]This was achieved in the inclusion of deafblindness 
[normal](with a definition) 
[normal]as one of the eleven categories of disability in the Rights &amp; Protection of Pers
[normal]ons with Disabilities Act 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Single inter-departmental pathways[bold] - [bold]Individuals with complex needs require support
[normal] from multiple sectors of government (
[normal]education, health
[normal], labour). 
[normal]T
[normal]here needs to be a single inter-departmental pathway which deals with and
[normal] coordinates the identification, assessment and treatment across all the governmental ministries.
[normal] 
[normal]A multi disciplinary team, that includes parents, 
[normal]will improve the quality of services 
[normal]and
[normal] enhance th
[normal]e sustainability of programmes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This pathway 
[normal]could
[normal] be specific to the issue
[normal], such as
[normal] 
[normal]Early Childhood Development
[normal] for children and a 
[normal]Vocational Pathway
[normal] for adults which
[normal] would involve the Ministr
[normal]y of Education (
[normal]vocational training from 16-18
[normal])
[normal] and the Ministry of Labour 
[normal](
[normal]help individuals with complex needs 
[normal]find a niche in the market
[normal])
[normal]. This would help individuals migrate from school voca
[normal]tional work to the marketplace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Policy Architecture[bold] - [bold]Evidence from other sectors, such as HIV/Aids
[normal], suggests that the establishment of a National Council of 
[normal]p
[normal]eople
[normal] affected
[normal],
[normal] combined with 
[normal]political leadership and resources 
[normal]can result in
[normal] transformational change for disabled people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.9.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Once established, a
[normal] 
[normal]National Council of Disabled People[bold] s
[normal]upports
[normal] the drawing up of a 
[normal]multi-sectoral national 
[normal]disability strategy
[normal]. 
[normal]To be effective,
[normal] the council requires
[normal] the political leadership, resources and accountability to people with disabilities to influence policy and practice across the government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.9.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Evidence suggests that when located within the office 
[normal]of the 
[normal]Prime Minister or President 
[normal]is es
[normal]sential to ensure that the Council is effective.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.9.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of 
[normal]national inclusive education programmes
[normal] governments need to provide training to 
[normal]mainstream 
[normal]teachers
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]an appropriate curriculum; 
[normal]appropriate assistive devices
[normal];
[normal] teaching assistants to support children in the classroom
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]to include families and communities
[normal] in the process
[normal] and to ensure there is a focus on the individual needs of the child
[normal].

[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID contributes to the Disability Rights Fund and other organisations that support disabled peoples’ organisations (DPOs), as part of its commitment to 
[normal]mainstreaming disability and enabling 
[normal]the participation of disabled people themselves.  
[normal]Whilst we recog
[normal]nise the important work this enables, it is
[normal] an insufficient response to 
[normal]reach highly excluded groups such as deafblind people.  
[normal]Deafblind peoples’ associations or groups need interpreters to enable them to take part in meetings and other advocacy work.  Th
[normal]e lack of available interpreters and the cost of funding those interpreters make it very difficult for deafblind people to either apply for funding for their own groups
[normal] or take part in general DPOs.

[normal] for the inclusion of people with disabilities, including a

[normal].  As part of its bilateral work, DFID is in a good position to work with national governments on this plan.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Teachers, health workers and others need 
[normal]training
[normal] in order to understand how to include deafblind people in mainstream services.  The 
[normal]specialist knowledge
[normal] 
[normal]of organisations like SI and its partners 
[normal]is needed 
[normal]to provide this training and 
[normal]to support deafblind
[normal] people to develop the communication and mobility skills they need to be part of their families and communities.

[normal]Participation
[normal] of disabled people 
[normal]is
[normal] a key element in the development of policy and practice around disability.  Deafblind people and their fam
[normal]ilies are struggling to participate due to a lack of understanding of their needs, such as the provision of interpreters
[normal].

[normal]The term deafblind is used throughout this paper to refer to 
[normal]people who are both deafblind and multi-sensory impaired.  Whilst we acknowledge the different medical categories for this group, they share very similar societal obstacles that inhibit or prevent access and inclusion.
