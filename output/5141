Written evidence from the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association [TOB11]
defaultExecutive Summarydefault3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe illicit trade in tobacco products has been a serious problem for the UK for 20 years, one brought about by high levels of taxation in this country. Advice given to the then Chancellor in 1999 following an independent evaluation of the problem of tobacco smuggling by Martin Taylor, on which the Government’s 
defaultTackling Tobacco Smuggling
default strategy was largely based, makes this clear. The report
default states; “The principal cause of the smuggling, of course, is the high level of duty in the UK”. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe tobacco industry is an important contributor to the UK economy, directly and indirectly supporting over 70,000 jobs, as well as delivering over £12 billion to HM Treasury in excise and VAT in 2012/13 alone. However, latest Government estimates show that up to £2.9
default billion was lost in 2010/11 to the illicit market and this has wide implications for businesses throughout the supply chain, as well as the impact that illicit trade has on society as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe TMA’s approach to tackling illicit trade is primarily through communications, awareness raising and developing strategic partnerships. At a national level, we
default work with 
defaultTMA members
default to raise awareness through the media, campaign on refreshing Government approaches to tackling the illicit trade and work with key stakeholders such as HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) in developing AIT strategies. At a devolved and regional level we are working with stakeholders to ensure a greater understanding of the issues and by working together we are able to 
defaultdeliver
default 
defaultmedia and/or enforcement led 
defaultcampaigns to address illicit activity
default. At a local level we provide support for campaigns such as the Real Deal
default – a campaign for fake free markets, work with the Police and Trading Standards to raise local awareness and are actively driving intelligence to the appropriate authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have 
defaultaddress
defaulted
default the individual points raised in the consultation
default and
default provided examples of the work that the tobacco industry is undertaking in partnership with law enforcement. 
default&#xa0;defaultTMA response to the Home Office Select Committee questionsdefault&#xa0;defaultWhy the number of arrests, prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have fallen over the past three years;default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe National Audit Office (NAO) Report
default on progress in tackling tobacco smuggling indicates that the level of prosecutions against organised crime groups fell in the period 2012/13, yet, despite the fall in prosecutions, revenue loss protection increased, which is welcome.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHMRC figures
default indicate that prosecutions for the evasion of duty increased sharply in 2012/13. In addition to criminal prosecutions, HMRC appear to be using civil penalties (wrongdoing penalties) and we support their use as a deterrent.  
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2010 Spending Review (SR) allocated additional funding to tackle fraud
default and we acknowledged that this would take time to filter through, as well as the training period involved for new criminal investigators. We understood that the funds allocated through SR 2010 were unlikely to have taken effect until 2012/13.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe TMA works in partnership with Trading Standards as supporters of the 
defaultReal Deal
default campaign for fake-free markets and on many local initiatives. We are disappointed that the work to prevent and tackle illicit tobacco is sometimes compromised by individual and/or regional Trading Standards Authorities
default forces that decline to work 
defaultin partnership with the TMA citing public health concerns, rather than prioritising actual enforcement activities. The recent launch of the Local Government Declaration on Tobacco Control (see Annex)
default includes the following commitment:  
default“Protect our tobacco control work from the commercial and vested interests of the tobacco industry by not accepting any partnerships, payments, gifts and services, monetary or in kind or research funding offered by the tobacco industry to officials or employees.” 
defaultWhilst several councils have signed up to this pledge, it sends confusing messages when Trading Standards are in frequent contact with the tobacco manufacturers on issues relating to smuggling. Ultimately, tackling tobacco smuggling cuts across a number of government departments and therefore it is particularly important that they work together. If one department chooses not to work with the TMA or TMA members it may undermine the efforts of other enforcement bodies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13;default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDue to the nature of the fraud we believe that it is difficult to estimate the size and scale of future seizures, as well as when and where the seizures might take place. The NAO report indicates that seizure levels have remained broadly consistent in recent years, which suggests that a significant quantity of illicit tobacco continues to be seized. However, appropriate resources should be available to send a clear message to criminals intending to smuggle into the UK that illicit products are likely to be seized and will be pursued by the appropriate authorities.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring a recent visit to the Coventry Postal Hub we learned that successful seizures of counterfeit tobacco products 
default(up to 50 tonnes of hand rolling tobacco a month – equivalent to 2x 40ft lorries a day) 
defaulthas led to a significant reduction in activity at Coventry; however, this is likely to have been displaced to other entry points. Given ongoing concerns over departmental budgets, we would stress that resources should be available to Border Force to counter new threats as they emerge. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate.default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough the current maximum penalties appear to be appropriate, we recommend a greater application at the lowest level to deter criminals who appear to be ‘
defaultgetting away with it’
default and who threaten the viability of legitimate retailers. Applying stiff penalties at the lowest level is extremely important in dissuading shopkeepers who may be tempted to engage in illicit activity in this difficult economic climate. Well 
defaultpublicised enforcement activity helps to maintain the flow of intelligence to 
defaultthe authorities
default, as it provides the reassurance that something is being done. We acknowledge that there are legal issues with HMRC providing direct feedback to intelligence sources, and we are working with HMRC and organisations such as the Tobacco Retailers’ Alliance (TRA) to ensure successful enforcement action is appropriately publicised. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHMRC could mirror the approach taken by the Police in providing greater transparency with regards criminal cases, for example
default,
default highlighting how many cases are ongoing, how are they being taken forward and success rates. This again would provide greater reassurance to stakeholders of the work that is being undertaken by HMRC. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRetailers face a number of regulations with significant penalties
default.
default 
defaultU
defaultnder the display ban regulations, fines of up to £5,000 can be imposed for non-compliance
default, which is greater than some fines for selling illicit tobacco products
default. Therefore, a shopkeeper may face a greater sanction for leaving the tobacco display open in between selling to adult customers than a criminal selling tobacco products from the back of a car. 
defaultWhilst there appears to be comparatively modest sanctions f
defaultor some forms of illicit activity, it is extremely important that these penalties are still imposed, especially when compared to a fine that a legitimate retailer may face for an administrative error. 
defaultThe similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect on each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency operations in Northern Ireland.default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBoth the UK and the Republic of Ireland impose high rates of taxation on tobacco products. 
defaultDuring
default the 1990s, the duty escalator in combination with the Single Market led to a dramatic increase in tobacco smuggling and cross border shopping. Tobacco smuggling peaked in 2000/01, when up to 69% of hand rolling tobacco and 24% of cigarettes were estimated by HMRC to be illicit. 
defaultIn 2001, the duty escalator was removed
default, and supported by the Tackling Tobacco Smuggling 
defaults
defaulttrategy led to a gradual reduction in smuggling. 
defaultIn response to 
defaultthe economic crisis, the Government re-introduced the duty escalator in 2010 and as a result non-UK duty paid 
default(NUKDP) 
defaulttobacco is rising
default. The experience in Ireland mirrors the UK, when substantial tax increases imposed in the 2000s led to the acceleration in tobacco smuggling. The Irish Government elected to freeze tobacco duty rates during 2009
default and 2010 and as a result non-Irish duty paid (NIDP) levels began to fall
default. More recently, the 
defaultGovernment has imposed significant duty increases on tobacco products and the level of NIDP is rising again. 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMuch like the UK, Irish customs have seized significant quantities of illicit products,
default both counterfeit and genuine non-domestic products such as illicit whites. Industry empty pack surveys indicate that a significant portion of 
defaultNUKDP
default is comprised of product originating in comparatively low price EU member states, similar to what has been seen in Ireland.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland plays a vital role in addressing issues such as the illicit trade in tobacco and the movement of illicit goods through the border area.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK; anddefault20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultStandardised packaging lowers the barrier to entry for criminal gangs who trade in illicit and counterfeit products and would lead to an increase in illicit activity in Ireland. Ireland is a comparatively small market, yet criminal networks have sought to target it, as evidenced by a number of high profile seizures
default involving products specifically produced for the Irish market. It is difficult to say at this stage what impact standardised packaging in Ireland may have on the UK, but past experience shows that illicit products destined for Ireland have crossed over into Northern Ireland and Scotland, especially in areas where there is an established demand for cheaper illicit tobacco products.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt should be noted that Mike 
defaultNorgrove
default, 
defaultDirector, Excise, Customs, Stamps and Money, HMRC,
default told the Northern Ireland Committee, that with regards to plain packaging: 
default“
defaultthe obvious danger from our point of view is that the ability to detect counterfeit or illicit material would be made more difficult by a system where there was no difference between one packet and another
default”
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor more information on the TMA member companies’ views on standardised (or plain) packaging, including in relation to the potential for such measures to exacerbate the issue of illicit trade, please see their respective submissions to the 2012 consultation.
defaultThe relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity.default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe understand that tobacco smuggling is increasingly linked to organised crime, driven by the high profits and relatively low penalties in relation to other forms of smuggling. The links are highlighted by organisations such as Europol
default, the World Customs Organisation
default, but, more specifically the links to paramilitary activity have been identified by the Organised Crime Task Force
default.
defaultTackling illicit tradedefault24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe following examples demonstrate how the TMA and member companies are working with governments and authorities to tackle tobacco smuggling and counterfeiting. 
defaultThe FCTC Illicit Trade Protocoldefault25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe TMA’s member companies have consistently supported the development of the Illicit Trade Protocol (ITP) and encourage the government to undertake consultations with all relevant stakeholders on its implementation. 
defaultThe scope of the ITP is very broad; it contains measures in the areas of: licensing, due diligence, tracking and tracing, financial controls, record keeping, duty free sales, internet sales, free zones, offences and sanctions, and international cooperation. Many of the controls proposed in the ITP may already exist in the UK. But, due to the transnational nature of the illicit trade in tobacco products, the UK still experiences a high level of illicit trade. Therefore, the ITP must be applied consistently across all signatory countries.
defaultOLAF Agreementsdefault26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe EU is fully aware of the risks posed by the different tax levels applied across the Member States. The Directive setting out the tax rules for tobacco products states
default:
default “A certain degree of convergence between the tax levels applied in the Member States would help to reduce fraud and smuggling within the Union”.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe TMA’s member companies have all signed individual 
defaultagreements with
default the EU 
defaultto jointly combat the illicit trade in tobacco
default. The agreements cover general co-operation between the member companies and the Anti-Fraud Office of the European Community (OLAF). The agreements strengthen cooperation in a number of areas and include funding by the member companies over a number of years to support anti-illicit trade initiatives
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government has described these agreements as being: 
default“
defaultan important step forward in the fight against tobacco smuggling. Signing them sends a clear and consistent signal that we are working in step with the EU, other member states and tobacco manufacturers to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products.”
default. 
defaultMemoranda of Understanding (defaultMoUsdefault) and Supply Chain Legislationdefault29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the cornerstones of the UK Government’s Tackling Tobacco Smuggling strategy and the fight against tobacco smuggling is the Memoranda of Understanding (
defaultMoU
default) between the TMA’s member companies and HMRC. The first 
defaultMoU
default was signed in April 2002 with a revised, common 
defaultMoU
default signed in March 2006.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0; 
default“
defaultMoUs
default between HMRC and the UK tobacco manufacturers have been an important element of the strategy, and have played a crucial role in restricting the availability of genuine cigarettes to smugglers.” 
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultMoU
default creates a comprehensive framework for co-operation aimed at combating the smuggling of both genuine and counterfeit tobacco products into the UK as well as seeking to deter all aspects of the illicit trade in tobacco products. 
defaultThe TMA member companies have been working with HMRC in developing a revised 
defaultMoU
default and this will be officially signed on 5 September 2013. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWorking in partnership default32.

default with the UK tobacco manufacturers and the TMA with the aim of proactively developing an improved and shared understanding of the illicit market in the UK.  
default&#xa0;
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe overarching A-IT JWG, which formalises long-standing interactions between HMRC and the Industry, provides an open forum for the Tobacco Industry and HMRC experts to meet bi-annually to share insight and experience, examine issues, and explore opportunities for the industry and/or HMRC to tackle 
defaultthe illicit market and emerging threats. defaultThe 
defaultA-IT JWG
default supports and complements the Memoranda of Understanding between HMRC and the tobacco manufacturers and/or the EU Co-operation agreements.  
default&#xa0;
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOther work streams identified include intelligence sharing and communications, with a communications framework already in place that sets out that the TMA, Philip Morris UK &amp; HMRC will jointly work together to develop more effective marketing and communications around illicit tobacco.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe TMA are also working on a number of partnership projects to tackle illicit trade, incorporating stakeholders such as the Police, Trading Standards, the Intellectual Property Office, and other rights holders. 
defaultCodentify®default default36.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultCodentify®
default technology has been developed by the four major tobacco companies
default to 
defaultenable law enforcement and other officials to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit products. 
defaultThe 
defaultCodentify® 
defaulttechnological solution can also deliver, tracking and tracing and digital tax verification.  Full implementation of 
defaultCodentify®
default in the UK is expected in late 2014/early 2015. It is fully compliant with the provisions contained in the FCTC Anti-illicit Trade Protocol. The revised EU Tobacco Products Directive contains provisions that would undermine the use of 
defaultCodentify®
default and we have strongly recommended that these provisions are not taken forward by the Commission. Further details on 
defaultCodentify® are 
defaultavailable in the Annex. 
defaultCovert Markings default37.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSince 1st October 2007 all cigarettes manufactured for the UK market by our member companies and Philip Morris International carry covert technology to allow the easy identification
default by law enforcement officers
default of genuine/counterfeit product in the retail network. This was extended to hand rolling tobacco from 1st October 2008. The anti-counterfeiting (reader) device used to detect illicit counterfeit product is being used across the UK by HMRC and Trading Standards Officers. 
defaultConclusiondefault38.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe illicit trade in tobacco products continues to cost HM Treasury £ billions in lost revenues but there are encouraging signs from HMRC that the increase in 
defaultenforcement activity is delivering more prosecutions. The TMA welcomes a more open approach by HMRC to ensure stakeholders throughout the supply chain are aware of the work that is being done. A greater deterrent is required at the local level to ensure that perceived small scale illicit activity is not tolerated. 
default&#xa0;
default39.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe TMA’s member companies work extensively with a number of enforcement agencies in the UK and across the world to tackle the illicit trade. The manufacturers have been at the forefront in developing technological solutions which provide greater supply chain security as well as delivering the means for enforcement agencies to detect illicit products.
default&#xa0;
default40.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith increasingly higher levels of tobacco taxation and prevailing economic conditions, the ability to tackle illicit trade effectively is made much more difficult, as consumers are increasingly incentivised by above inflation excise increases to seek 
defaultNUKDP
default products. By adopting a more measured approach to tobacco taxation, the Government would address head on the key driver of the illicit trade in tobacco products.

defaultDigital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) with the aim to promote cost effective industry standards and supporting technology solutions to tackle illicit trade. The 
defaultCodentify® 
defaulttechnological solution can deliver product authentication, tracking and tracing and digital tax verification. 
defaultCodentify® product authentication enables law enforcement and other officials to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit products. The system uses unique alphanumeric codes so there will be no need for dedicated scanning devices or specialist training.

defaultodentify® track and trace will enable stakeholders to monitor and secure the distribution of products worldwide. A unique code is securely applied directly onto every packaging unit.
defaultAs products move along the supply chain between different trading partners, the unique codes are scanned, creating a complete record of its journey history.
defaultThese unique codes, together with Codentify® track and trace data exchange and reporting formats, are based on international standards. This enables all stakeholders throughout the supply chain to use standard equipment and processes to track and trace product movements within and across national borders.
defaultCodentify® track and trace enables law enforcement authorities to retrieve information about the product, its manufacture, distribution and legal status, including products in transit. 
defaultCodentify® track and trace provides law enforcement authorities with the visibility needed to accurately identify national and international illicit trade patterns and assist criminal investigations.
defaultCodentify® digital tax verification enables governments to protect tax revenues by strengthening recovery capabilities and reducing opportunities for evasion.
defaultLicensed manufacturers apply to government for permission to produce online via a secure internet connection. On approval, production can begin under real-time government control. A unique, secure code is applied onto every packaging unit. Once printed, these codes are counted and encrypted production information is immediately and securely communicated to government. Using this information enables governments to accurately calculate and reconcile due taxes. 
defaultCodentify® track and trace will enable stakeholders to monitor and secure the distribution of products worldwide and is fully compliant with the provisions contained in the FCTC Anti-illicit Trade Protocol.
