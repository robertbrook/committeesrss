[[[Sean Barnett, Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;Comment: I have been a walker of Pennine, Lakedistrict, Peak District and North Yorkshire for many years. I am dismayed that English Law does not currently allow local councills and even National Parks to protect quiet and ancient countryside from recreational vehicles using Green lanes as race tracks. I would urge the Degregulation Bill to support the protection of green lanes - please see the attacehed document from the Dales Green Lanes group that I support.

[[[ACTION STATIONS! - An opportunity we cannot afford to miss has arisen, and we must all act fast.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The government is assembling what is called the ‘Deregulation Bill’.  As the name implies, the bill is designed to eliminate red-tape, along with unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy. &#xa0;What has this got to do with green lanes in the Dales?  One of the ways in which Parliament works is to permit the inclusion of all sorts of bits of legislation within very broadly-conceived Acts.  The forthcoming Deregulation Bill presents an opportunity for us to persuade Parliament to include a couple of clauses which, if enacted, would put paid to the whole wretched business of recreational motor vehicles on green lanes.  Just think of it: green lanes safe, for ever, from the damage and nuisance inflicted by 4x4s and motorbikes.  YDGLA could order the champagne, have a party, and wind itself up, leaving us all to get on with the rest of our lives.&#xa0;That’s the dream: making it a reality will not be a stroll in the park. Even if we, in collaboration with all the other green lane groups around the country, can persuade Parliament to consider the inclusion of our proposals in their bill, there will be hours and hours of wrangling over the precise terms of the clauses.  And let us not kid ourselves into believing that 4x4 and motorbike users will realise that their game is up.  Many vehicle users recognise that, in the long term, their cause is doomed, but they will hang on for as long as they can, trying to obstruct any legislation that jeopardises their activities.&#xa0;

[[[Our proposals:  ]]]We are proposing two things, and need your support for them.&#xa0;1  The first is based on two crucial distinctions.  One is the distinction between ‘sealed’ and ‘unsealed’ ways.  Green lanes are substantially ‘unsealed’ – ie they are not ‘sealed’ with tarmac or concrete.  The other distinction is between, on one hand, ‘the ordinary roads network’  - ie the sealed, tarmacadamed motor roads that we all need and take for granted – and, on the other, the unsealed tracks  - the green lanes - that thread through the countryside.  Using these distinctions, which are both founded in highway law and its official interpretations, we are proposing that:&#xa0;

[[[All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]BOATs and UCRs are the categories that comprise Dales green lanes.  Restricted Byways have rights of way for pedestrians, horses, horse-drawn carriages, pedal-cyclists and motor vehicles needed for access to premises (eg farm vehicles, fire engines), but not for recreational motors.&#xa0;2  Our second proposal seeks to remedy a serious problem with the procedures for imposing Traffic Regulation Orders – the legal mechanisms whereby non-essential motors are prohibited from green lanes.  At present, no matter how cogent and popular a request from the public to the local authority for the imposition of a TRO may be, the Authority can turn down the request flat.  There are no grounds for appeal.  (You will recall YDGLA’s campaign for a permanent TRO on Deadman’s Hill, in Nidderdale.  North Yorkshire County Council chose not to impose a permanent TRO, deciding instead to impose only a temporary TRO on just part of the route.  This temporary order is due to expire shortly.)  We propose that: &#xa0;

[[[When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. ]]]

[[[What now?  ]]]Make your views known to the Parliamentary committee scrutinising the Deregulation Bill in one of two ways.1.  By letter, to 

[[[Ms Christine Salmon Percival, Clerk of the Legislation Office, House of Lords, SW1A OPW.]]]2   Online: Google ‘

[[[Deregulation Bill]]]’ and follow links to 

[[[‘Have your say on the draft deregulation bill’.]]]Whichever you choose, it is perfectly understandable that you are unlikely to have assimilated every detail of the bill.  But you will be able to supply the committee with first-hand accounts - including pictures, if you have them - of the damage and environmental degradation that you have witnessed, and will be able to show that the two proposals set out above, re-worked into your own personal testimony, will end the blight of recreational vehicles on green lanes.  Lastly, say that you expressly support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and – of course – your very own Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).  Each of these organisations will be making far more detailed submissions than can be expected of individual members of the public, and it’s perfectly reasonable to hitch your own personal testimony to theirs.&#xa0;

[[[As we have indicated, this campaign will certainly not be a pushover.  It will require every ounce of our collective lobbying power.  But we cannot allow this opportunity to pass us by.  It won’t come again for years.  Get writing, and pass this letter on to any organisation to which you belong and which might make a formal submission of its own.]]]
