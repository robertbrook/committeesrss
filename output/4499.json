"&#xa0;\nAFS0025Written evidence submitted by Mrs J Woodruff&#xa0;\nDear Sir / Madam\nThank you for this opportunity to contribute to the select committee inquiry.  I hope that you will find a parent’s perspective useful when considering the \nissues affecting academies and free schools.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSome of the issues on which views were sought are addressed in more detail below. \n“The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes.”What should actually be done to narrow the gap?  \nAs discussed previously there are some actions that merely play lip-service to narrowing the gap rather than having a material impact.   \nUseful partnerships \nare likely to involve sharing experience and resources. \nSharing experienceAgain, the forces that put schools in competition with each other may not result in maximisi\nng co-operation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
