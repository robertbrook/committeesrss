[[[Broad costs of the project ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Political resistance to co-operation among many political groups.              The continuous confiscation of land and building settlements which makes the position as Palestinians more difficult to collaborate. Rocket and other attacks on the Israelis can also have a negative impact.&#xa0;Lack of adequate resources.&#xa0;Lack of systematic technical support from a third party to make the process less politicised.&#xa0;Inadequate technical expertise on the Palestinian side especially in dealing with trauma, clinical supervision, monitoring and evaluation of community based interventions.&#xa0;The lapse of time between joint plans and the availability of funding.&#xa0;Difficulty in implementing such projects in Gaza because of the difficulty in traveling to Gaza from West bank and the radical position of Hamas to not allow any joint collaboration.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
