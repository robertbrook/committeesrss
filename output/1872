defaultI would like the Committee to take into account the dangers of online pornography to children and young people, especially in negatively affecting them mentally and emotionally.
defaultMy research into eugenics and population has
default found a significant overlap between the
defaultse
default movements and the campaign for ‘value-free’ sex education;  
defaultboth movements have
default historical links with the pornography industry. 
defaultThe aim of the pornography industry is to maximise profits by turning people into se
defaultx addicts, searching for sexual material on a regular basis, often of a
defaultn increasingly
default extreme nature. 
defaultEventually they may seek more extreme ‘thrills’ by acting out what they have seen online: two r
defaultecent cases of rape and murder of young girls, April 
defaultJones 
defaultand Tia Sharpe, have featured the use of pornography by men unknown to police.
defaultThere is also evidence that young boys are themselves becoming child 
defaultmolestors
default, acting out the pornographic scenarios they have seen online.
defaultPornography dehumanises women and ch
defaultildren, depicting them as sex toys to be used at will, often in a brutal manner; even those women who participate willingly do not remain psychologically unharmed. It also dehumanises the viewers of pornography, reducing them to their sexual appetites, and
default encourag
defaulting
default them to believe that there is a ‘right to sex’.
defaultEven without these extreme negative outcomes, we must face the prospect of a society where the younger generations ha
defaultve
default learned to view other people through the distorted prism of 
defaulta perverted
default sex
defaultual desire; the history of pornography shows that lust swiftly turns to cruelty, thus we must tackle this problem of easily accessible online pornography if we do not wish society to be composed increasingly of uncaring sociopaths who care chiefly about th
defaulteir own sexual appetites.
