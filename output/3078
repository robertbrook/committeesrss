[normal]Written evidence from RAC[bold] Motoring Services[bold] (SRN 040)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]BACKGROUND[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The RAC is the UKâ€™s most progre
[normal]ssive motoring organisation, r
[normal]e
[normal]presenting
[normal] more than seven million members, providing services for both private and business motorists, and is committed to making driving easier, safer, more affordable and more enjoyable 
[normal]for all road users. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We employ more than 1700 patrols providing roadside ass
[normal]istance across the entire 
[normal]UK 
[normal]road network and through this 
[normal]we 
[normal]have significant insight into 
[normal]how the road networks are managed
[normal] and maintained
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is little doubt that 
[normal]significant 
[normal]challenges 
[normal]lie ahead 
[normal]for those responsible both for 
[normal]strategic 
[normal]and local ro
[normal]ads 
[normal]with 
[normal]congestion
[normal] 
[normal]set to grow as a consequence of 
[normal]growth return
[normal]ing
[normal] to the economy. This is compounded by the current condition of the roads which have degenerated as a consequence of several harsh winters and a lack of investment 
[normal]in 
[normal]maintenance 
[normal]and 
[normal]also 
[normal]the longer term need to reduce the environmental impact of road transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We, therefore, welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport Select Committee as part of its review of the Strategic Road Network following the publication of its Ac
[normal]tion for Roads command paper.
