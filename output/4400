[normal]DIS 15[bold]W[bold]ritten evidence submitted by the National Association of [bold]Service Providers in Physical Rehabilitation[bold]Executive summary  : [bold]1.NASPIR[bold]  and its role in  disability in Nepal[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]National Association of Service Providers in Nepal (
[normal]NASPIR) was established in 2010 in Kathmandu. It
[normal] is a non-profitable, non-politi
[normal]cal umbrella organization of Nepali
[normal] service providers involved in
[normal] the provision of 
[normal] physical rehabilitation
[normal] services
[normal]. 
[normal]NASPIR members represent 12 among the main 
[normal] service providers in the country
[normal],  from all 5 development regions of Nepal. The m
[normal]embers under this association a
[normal]re
[normal] represent
[normal]ed

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Vision
[normal]:
[normal] the vision of NASPIR 
[normal]is improved access to quality and equitable  rehabilitation services for the people of Nepal.
[normal]Strategy
[normal]: 
[normal]In order to strengthen the rehabilitation  sector
[normal] 
[normal], 
[normal]NASPIR 
[normal]advocates for  a bigger institutional engagement from the government of Nepal, promotes research and data collection on disability, and facilitates knowledge transfer  among rehabilitation providers on technical and organizational aspects ( quality assurance process, capacity building of staff).
[normal]NASPIR works in cooperation with the government of Nepal and international organizations working in the field of disability and physical rehabilitation .
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The availability of rehabilitation services is very recent in Nepal. Ten years ago there was no capacity to deliver specific services to persons with disabilities; however, there were several  local non-profit organizations supporting  the most marginalized groups in their  communities, such as underserved and poor groups, certain castes, and persons with disabilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thanks to the support of international agencies, those local 
[normal]organisations
[normal] that are now represented by NASPIR could develop specific capacities and infrastructures 
[normal]such as workshops for prosthesis and orthotics, but also developed community based rehabilitation (CBR) 
[normal]programmes
[normal] to reach out the most remote communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Those organizations and NASPIR  today continue  advocating for an inclusive society, where barriers in access to mainstream services are eliminated and specific services are available to any person in need. Thanks to its  mandate and the experience gained  in different regions of the country , NASPIR  is able  to contribute to the debate on disability and provide concrete  recommendations for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in low-income settings to the government of the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold] 2.[bold]T[bold]he role of rehabilitation as a pre-requisite for inclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As
[normal] highlighted in the 
[normal]WHO and World Bank World Report on Disability (2010), persons 
[normal] with disabilities
[normal] 
[normal]face widespread barriers in accessing services (health, education, employment, transport as well as information). These include inadequate policies and standards, negative attitudes, lack of service provision, inadequate funding, lack of accessibility, inadequate information and communication and lack of participation in decisions that directly affect their lives.
[normal] The link between poverty and disability has also been underlined: persons 
[normal] with disabilities have worse hea
[normal]lth and socioeconomic outcomes  than persons without disabilities. The more disadvantaged are usually the more severely impaired, who have very low mobility and very poor access to information and participation in decision making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rehabilitation 
[normal]is 
[normal]a 
[normal]set of measures that 
[normal] 
[normal]assist individuals who experience
[normal],
[normal] or are likely to experience
[normal],
[normal] disability to achieve and maintain optimal functioning in interaction with their environment.
[normal] 
[normal]Rehabilitation is a process tailored on the person, it requires a multi-disciplinary approach which usually  includes both specialized, center-based services and community-based services.
[normal]By improving 
[normal] mobility
[normal] through devices and exercise, p
[normal]romoting function
[normal], removing environmental barriers and i
[normal]ncreasing confidence 
[normal]and
[normal] self esteem
[normal], physical rehabilitation is  often a pre-requisite for inclusion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Physical rehabilitation, like other specific services such as vocational trainings and support services, can play an important role not only in finding personalized 
[normal]solutions, 
[normal]but also –if continuum  is present with other kinds of services- intervene early and reduce com 
[normal]. Habilitation and rehabilitation services  are among the services that should be available with no barriers to persons with disabilities (UNCRPD, art 20 and 26).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.[bold]Evidence on disability and rehabilitation needs[bold] in Nepal.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Nepal, which has a population of nearly 30 million people, went through a 10-year civil war in which some 15,000 people were killed and many others were injured and disabled. This led to an increased need for rehabilitation services, a need that was aggravated by the reduced capacity of the health system to meet normal health needs. However, conflict is not the only factor that influences the need for physical rehabilitation services, but also growing and ageing populations, increasing prevalence of chronic conditions (such as stroke and diabetes), road traffic accidents, etc., as well as other causes often related to poverty and malnutrition. According to 
[normal]WHO 
[normal]estimates , a country with a population of Nepal’s size could have some 450,000 persons who could need different types of rehabilitation (including physical rehabilitation), and some 150,000 persons (0.5 % of the population) could need a prosthesis or 
[normal]orthosis
[normal]. 
[normal]. To cover the total need 
[normal]for
[normal] prostheses and 
[normal]o
[normal]rthoses
[normal], approximately 50,000 individuals could need 
[normal]assistance 
[normal] every year.
[normal] 
[normal]At present, however, only a small portion (probably less than 4 % per year) of those persons who could potentially need prosthetic and orthotic rehabilitation, benefit from such services in Nepal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even though the country ratified the UNCRPD in 2010, little progress has been 
[normal]made
[normal] in defining a comprehensive s
[normal]trategy on disability including all relevant sectors 
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Rehabilitation falls u
[normal]nder Ministry of Social Welfare, and 
[normal] disabili
[normal]ty remains an object of charity. R
[normal]ehabilitation must be further integrated into the health system for better early detection (safe motherhood), stimulation (early childhood), screening, referral, community based care, 
[normal]and 
[normal]basic rehabi
[normal]litation services at the primary health care level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 12 physical rehabilitation centers (PRCs) gathered under NASPIR are today the major providers of services in the country. W
[normal]ithout them, very few persons would have access to such services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The main objectives today are to make these services more
[normal] equitable[bold] and 
[normal]accessible  [bold], in order to reach the most vulnerable groups of the population, but also to make them more autonomous from external support and move  towards a 
[normal]sustainable[bold] system of services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Good pract
[normal]ices for improved accessibility: service models
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is widely acknowledged that unmet needs are huge and coverage is not sufficient. Several strategies are utilized by the PRCs in the country in order to increase accessibility of services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]links with CBR programs.[bold] Community Disability Workers (CDWs) assure detection and follow up of cases that need specific services at the PRCs. This is important not only because  CDWs are in the community and can easily get access to local decision makers and peer networks for support; but also because they ensure long term follow up for cases that usually are complex . 
[normal]One of the limits of CBR services is the fact that despite being officially integrated into the scope of the Ministry of Social Welfare and some  funds being allocated, programs are not comprehensive and focus only on certain components ( livelihood, rather than empowerment) with limited 
[normal]inpact
[normal] on the inclusion of persons with disabilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]Mobile teams[bold]: this  is a widespread model in Nepal given the proportion of isolated communities and the limited number of health facilities. Rehabilitation mobile camps are organized periodically by PRCs and allow the provision of rehabilitation services in areas that are highly underserved. Along the years, several modifications have been made to increase the quality and the effectiveness of such a service model. 
[normal]It has been noticed that mobile camps serve the  double purpose of both providing specific services but also raising awareness among the community and the health system of the need for  such services. In some cases, it led certain communities at the district level to make clear demands for physiotherapy services at the local hospital, with technical back up of the PRCs for the most complex cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Good practices for improved sustainability
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Development of a  
[normal]R[bold]ehabilitation [bold]M[bold]anagement [bold]S[bold]ystem[bold] (RMS)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]RMS is a systematic approach to the evaluation and planning 
[normal]of 
[normal]physical rehabilitation facilities in core management areas identified through literature review: service users, service outputs, internal management, staff, finances
[normal]. RMS
[normal]  includes the evaluation of  quality assurance mechanisms against international standards
[normal] . It was introduced in 2012 to  5 PRCs 
[normal] which were  exposed to it for the first time. 
[normal]Thanks to a participatory analysis by the staff of PRCs, areas of weakness were identified and steps were taken to improve certain standards. 
[normal]However, dimensions such as human resources management  and professional performance 
[normal]are 
[normal]highly depend
[normal]ent
[normal] on environmental /national arrangements ( policies and laws on staff, academic requirements for professionals, training capacities ) that are currently far 
[normal]from being
[normal] defined and endorsed on a large scale. In other words, RMS is contributing to the improvement of  local partners’ governance mechanism
[normal]s
[normal] -includ
[normal]ing
[normal] quality control- by introducing for the first time a sustainable instrument, yet structural weaknesses at the national level currently represent a barrier for  a more comprehensive regulation of services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Technical sustainability:[bold] 
[normal]Individual  staff assessments are regularly done by senior
[normal]  rehabilitation staff ( one physiotherapist 
[normal]and one 
[normal]specialist in 
[normal]P
[normal]rosthetics and Orthotics
[normal])
[normal]. These are 
[normal] rigorous evaluations of clinical and professional skills 
[normal]against 
[normal]a common check list of knowledge, skills and attitudes based on job profiles 
[normal].
[normal]Once the evaluations are done, an individualized plan is designed to address the weaknesses and respond to the demand of the staff themselves. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are limitations in this approach of course, since professional regulation, accreditation and continuous professional development mechanisms are not in place in Nepal, except for 
[normal]PTs
[normal] to some extent. It is also important to mention that policies on human resources for the rehabilitation sector don’t exist in the country. 
[normal]It is important to remember that  even  at the global level, shared standards and guidelines of reference  for the sector are missing
[normal],
[normal] and only recently WHO urged the development of such guidelines and established an action plan for  the production of evidence and recommendations  based on the 6 blocks of health system strengthening. This should allow rehabilitation stakeholders worldwide to 
[normal]answer to questions such as: 
[normal]what are the requirements of a rehabilitation service? Which standards
[normal] should be used
[normal]? W
[normal]hat
[normal] means and w
[normal]hat
[normal] resources are needed to respond to the disability burden in  each country ?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Financial sustainability[bold]Physical rehabilitation centers  receive funds from international donors, and only  limited funding   from the government. The latter is on a medium term-basis, not on comprehensive budgeting strategies.
[normal]Another source of funding   is the mobilization of local resources ( Ministry of Local Development) based on quotas for marginalized groups , but this funding is  of course limited. Attempts to develop  cost-recovery systems are  in place  and are  based on vulnerability criteria of clients (with vulnerable people  eligible for free services) , but  this only partially covers  the costs of PRCs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NASPIR is advocating at the central level to increase engagement of the government in allocating resources for  PRCs. However, this will require several intermediate steps such as a more detailed analysis of health and rehabilitation needs ( still unclear) , long-term planning for human resources, and the development of links between those centers and the health system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]Reccommendations for action[bold] 
[normal]Given the burden of disease in the country, rehabilitation should be considered among public health strategies to reduce such burden and improve the quality of life of people.
[normal]In practice, this would mean having a 
[normal]health system strengthening approach [bold]: provide training to all health staff on disability; increase referral systems; carefully plan to train and deploy human resources for rehabilitation  according to the health priorities.
[normal]The overall aim should be to have a 
[normal]sector development approach[bold] with long term plans .
