[[[Written evidence submitted by St Mungo’s]]]St Mungo’s has been opening doors for homeless people since 1969. We currently run over 100 projects, providing accommodation for more than 1,700 people every night and helping thousands more who are rough sleeping or at risk of homelessness. St Mungo’s delivers a range of residential services from emergency shelters to semi-independent flats, as well as non-residential health, education and employment services. We also prevent homelessness through our housing advice programmes. &#xa0;St Mungo’s services are based on a recovery approach and we aim to work in partnership with clients in a personalised, effective way. Our clients often have complex problems that cause, or are caused by, homelessness; we deliver holistic support to help people rebuild their lives.

[[[people homeless]]]

[[[, especially in London. ]]]2.2.&#xa0; in April 2011 the Government introduced caps on the maximum amount of LHA, the type of housing benefit that people living in private rented accommodation claim. Since these caps were introduced, official statistics show a dramatic rise in the number of people who have become homeless after losing private rented accommodation. There has been a 78 per cent increase in the number of people becoming homeless due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy, the most common type of private tenancy, when the first quarter of 2013 is compared to the first quarter of 2011. 2.3.&#xa0; Caps to LHA are likely to be partly responsible for this increase. Few landlords are lowering rents as the amount of housing benefit that their tenants can claim is capped. Department for Work and Pensions research shows that 37 per cent of private landlords in London have taken action to evict tenants or not renew tenancies when there is a shortfall between LHA and rent, while just 6 per would consider lowering rent for a current tenant. DWP research also that landlords and housing advisors believe that the changes to LHA are behind increases in homelessness.2.4.&#xa0; In August 2012 Hackney Citizens Advice found that just nine per cent of rental properties on the market in Hackney were within LHA limits for self contained accommodation. Ninety per cent of properties within these limits were owned by landlords unwilling to accept LHA claimants. Therefore only one per cent of rental properties in Hackney were available to LHA claimants.&#xa0;2.5.&#xa0; The annual cap of a one per cent increase to the LHA cap that will take effect from April 2014 will further reduce the number of rental properties available in London with LHA levels, as rents look certain to rise by more than one per cent a year. The Government could mitigate this widening affordability gap through targeting LHA affordability funding at areas in London. 2.6.&#xa0; If people cannot find affordable rented accommodation then there is usually no other type of accommodation that they can rent or buy. Some people may choose to move areas with cheaper housing available. Others may try to remain within living distance of their work, family, friends or services that they rely on such as schools and medical care. These people may sofa surf or squat, or end up rough sleeping and/or presenting themselves as homeless to their local authority. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0; In St Mungo’s experience an ever greater proportion of the accommodation which is available within LHA rates is in poor condition. Tenants often move into these properties as they feel they have no choice but do so, hoping that repairs and maintenance work will be completed by the landlord. Living in a poor quality property can often impact on tenant’s health and leads to an increased risk of homelessness.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1.&#xa0; The introduction of the LHA caps has made it more difficult for St Mungo’s clients to move out of our projects and into private rented housing, especially in London. In the last two years there has been a steep decline in the number of our clients who have moved on from our projects into social housing. Over the same period the number of clients moving into private rented housing has ceased to grow.4.2.&#xa0; We are concerned that this will mean an increasing number of our clients will be stuck in supported accommodation despite being ready to live independently. This is likely to cause our hostels to ‘silt up’, meaning we cannot provide beds people who are sleeping rough.&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0; As landlords raise rent to levels not met by LHA, more people who have been homeless but have since moved into private rented housing will have to move at the end of a tenancy. When homeless they may have been assisted to move into private housing by a local authority or other service through contribution towards the deposit and rent advance. However, this assistance is usually non transferable, meaning that at the end of the initial tenancy the person has no financial assistance to secure a new home. This leads to an increased risk of repeat homelessness.

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.&#xa0; There is considerable uncertainty around the immediate and long term effects of welfare reform on the funding of supported accommodation. The Government consulted on the future of housing benefit and supported accommodation in 2011, but has yet to produce a response to the submissions it received. 6.2.&#xa0; In the meantime the Government has committed to retain current arrangements for meeting the housing costs of benefit claimants living in supported ‘exempt’ accommodation, i.e. housing benefit will be administered by local authorities and paid directly to the landlord. However, the legal definition of ‘exempt’ accommodation does not cover all supported accommodation. It is likely that there are high support projects homelessness projects which may not meet the definition.6.3.&#xa0; People staying in supported accommodation that falls outside the definition (non exempt supported accommodation) will have support for their housing costs limited by the overall benefit cap. This will make it difficult to meet the cost of running projects designed for people with very high housing needs.  It is also unclear how people in these projects will be able to claim any support whatsoever through Universal Credit for housing costs for stays in non exempt supported accommodation lasting less than a month.6.4.&#xa0; St Mungo’s understand that this is a complex policy area which the Government are working with partners to resolve. A timely resolution is vital to enable providers of supported accommodation to be able to plan for the future. Failure to resolve these issues could reduce the amount of accommodation available for people who are homeless as homelessness increases. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1.&#xa0; St Mungo’s are implementing a strategy to boost the financial and budgeting skills of our clients. However, uncertainty over DWP’s plans around alternative payments and local support services mean it is extremely challenging to plan how the support we provide can be coordinated with Universal Credit.7.2.&#xa0; The Universal Credit local support services framework and alternative payments arrangements guidance set out the Government’s approach to deciding which claimants should be exempt from direct monthly payments and how budgeting support for claimants is to be provided. The current documents set out an overall approach but are lacking in detail7.3.&#xa0; The DWP’s direct payment pilots showed significant increases in rent arrears when direct payments were introduced. Direct payments have the potential to lead to increased levels of homelessness, substance use and financial exploitation if the correct alternative payments and budgeting support are not in place. Alternative payment arrangements and budgeting support must be targeted at the correct claimants and effectively administered. In this context reports around problems in administering the so far extremely limited roll out of Universal Credit are cause for deep concern.7.4.&#xa0; There is a particular need for clarity over arrangements and support for claimants transitioning from supported to independent accommodation. There is a risk that claimants could move from living in supported accommodation where there housing costs are paid directly to their landlord, to living in independent accommodation with no support available, and receiving all of their Universal Credit award in one monthly payment.

They are likely to need assistance before moving and some local authorities require a minimum residence period before applications will be considered. Good practice standards should be adopted across London – or preferably nationwide – so that no one finds that they are effectively not treated as resident anywhere for local support fund purposes and so cannot access any funds.&#xa0;8.3.&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]The scheme operated by the DWP did not require a budgeting loan application to be applied for before a Community Care Grant would be awarded. It is unclear why some local authorities have decided to adopt this measure, unless it is an attempt to deflect costs that they should meet onto the DWP.

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.1.&#xa0; St Mungo’s works across a number of local authority areas, we have seen significant variation in the way in which local schemes to replace council tax benefit operate. We have observed that people on low incomes in some of the poorer areas in which we operate, have been asked to make the highest contribution to council tax. This can means that people are now expected to pay a significant proportion of their income on council tax.9.2.&#xa0; St Mungo’s runs Peer Advice Link, a resettlement and tenancy support programme staffed by volunteers. One of our volunteers now has to pay £13 a month in council tax. His income consists of £56.80 a week Jobseekers Allowance. He therefore has to spend over five per cent of his income on council tax.
