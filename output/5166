&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence submitted by The Daily Mail (CLC071)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. How should climate scientists communicate their findings?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Daily Mail's science and environment correspondents read the major academic journals every
[normal] 
[normal]day and report on papers which we believe are important and will interest our readers,
[normal] 
[normal]Correspondents usually interview the author of the scientific paper, and other experts in that field,
[normal] 
[normal]on the phone to ask them questions about their rese
[normal]arch and its wider significance.
[normal] They also make
[normal] 
[normal]use of the independent Science Media Centre which organises panels of scientists a once or twice a
[normal] 
[normal]week to give their opinions on a topic or report and take questions from journalists, and provides
[normal] 
[normal]reaction from scientists to articl
[normal]es authored by their colleagues.
[normal] Climate change is no exception to
[normal] 
[normal]this and our reporters regularly interview climate scientists and other researchers whose work has
[normal] 
[normal]an impact on the cl
[normal]imate, and report on their work.
[normal] Like most scientists, climate scientists generally
[normal] 
[normal]send out press releases about their published research in advance, and offer to speak to journalists
[normal] 
[normal]about it, which is always 
[normal]appreciated.
[normal] There are very few scientists in this field who publicly
[normal] 
[normal]challenge the
[normal] consensus about climate change.
[normal] One example is Professor Judith Curry from the
[normal] 
[normal]Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology who speaks to the
[normal] 
[normal]media about her concerns that 1998 was the hottest year on record and there has been little
[normal] 
[normal]warmi
[normal]ng since so she is often quoted.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Science Media Centre gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and I am aware that they highly
[normal] 
[normal]value the Daily Mail as a supporter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Scientists usually come top of professions that are most trusted by the general public in surveys.
[normal] 
[normal]Why is that different in the climate debate?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reporters covering all science issues including climate change should give an impression of how
[normal] 
[normal]much agreement there is and how important a piece of research is in the wider context of that field.
[normal] 
[normal]In climate science there is almost universal agreement that the climate is changing, and humans are
[normal] 
[normal]having some impact on it, but not on its pace and scale and possible future effects. Just because the
[normal] 
[normal]public trust scientists does not mean every piece of research by every scientist should be reported as
[normal] 
[normal]fact - science is all about probabilities and it is our job to explain the debate and how it is changing.
[normal] 
[normal]For example the scientist James Lovelock whose influential books suggested that there would be
[normal] 
[normal]imminent disaster from global warning in the coming years has since moderated his stance as
[normal] 
[normal]reported here- 
[normal]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2134092/Gaia-scientist-James-Lovelock-I-alarmist-climate-change.html
[normal]. 
[normal]Most science published in newspapers is based on material published
[normal] 
[normal]in a peer-reviewed journal, further explained in an interview or conference presentation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. What is your opinion of mass media coverage of climate?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Climate science has changed dramatically in recent years - there are now departments at
[normal] 
[normal]universities around the world devoted to what was previously a niche issue. The UN's
[normal] 
[normal]Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has around 800 scientists. But it is also a political issue.
[normal] 
[normal]It is linked to rising energy bills for homes and businesses, to aid to the developing world, and feeds
[normal] 
[normal]in to the debate about renewable energy (for example whether in cutting carbon emissions it
[normal] 
[normal]damages the environment in other ways). For example in 2009 the 'Climategate' controversy
[normal] 
[normal]scientists at the University of East Anglia were exonerated of wrongdoing by a number of inquiries,
[normal] 
[normal]but it is clear from their emails to 
[normal]and from government departments and the Met Office that they
[normal] 
[normal]were discussing how their scientific findings fitted alongside political developments and
[normal] 
[normal]international negotiations. It is important to explain uncertainties and changes to the science and
[normal] 
[normal]expose where there may be a political agenda.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On sceptical voices, there are very few serious scientists who deny the climate is changing. But what
[normal] 
[normal]is causing it, how fast is happening and what we do about it is controversial. When quoting those
[normal] 
[normal]with well-known sceptical views such as Lord Lawson, we usually refer to him a climate change
[normal] 
[normal]sceptic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We note that according to last month's Spectator he complained that a meeting of scientists at the
[normal] 
[normal]Lords was held without reporters being present to record the differing views of scientists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. James Painters res
[normal]earch has found that press cove
[normal]rage in the UK has become increasingly
[normal] 
[normal]polarised - why is this?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Climate science is used by government and others to justify higher energy bills; construction of wind
[normal] 
[normal]farms, green taxes on businesses which can affect jobs; and closures of coal-fired power stations.
[normal] 
[normal]When a subject becomes more prominent in public debate, and has considerable political and
[normal] 
[normal]economic implications, then controversies will come to the fore. As far as the Painter report is
[normal] 
[normal]concerned we would take issue with information provided in 2009 in regard to this paper and the
[normal] 
[normal]reporting of Copenhagen.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To my knowledge the only Daily Mail editorial on the subject is the one attached to this email. It says
[normal] 
[normal]'this paper keeps an open mind on climate change'. Some columnists have doubted it in opinion
[normal] 
[normal]pieces under their own name such as this article by Christopher Booker
[normal] 
[normal]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2335982/CHRISTOPHER-BOOKER-A-dangerously-deluded-energy-policy-greens-want-hide-truth-soaring-bills.html
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Others say it is real and serious
[normal] 
[normal]and talk about how Britain should combat it - such as this by the New Scientist's Fred Pearce about
[normal] 
[normal]nuclear power 
[normal]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066726/Nuclear-power-Yes--A-opponent-calls-Chris-Huhne-embrace-energy-source-thats-cheap-AND-good-environment.html
[normal]. 
[normal]The public can
[normal] 
[normal]read the news report and the comment and make up their own mind. Readers of the Daily Mail will
[normal] 
[normal]be very familiar with distinct ways in which the paper reports news and comment. I am not aware of
[normal] 
[normal]any climate science stories that have had an effect on newspaper sales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]. What is your publications working definition of climate change?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It would be impossible to define every term used in the Daily Mail; we generally follow current
[normal] 
[normal]widely accepted usage. Scientists now refer to 'climate change' rather than global warming, as they
[normal] 
[normal]no longer believe the effects of greenhouse gas emissions are simply warmer weather, but as
[normal] 
[normal]climate patterns changes
[normal], the weather may become more extreme, with more floods and droughts;
[normal] 
[normal]some areas of the world could become colder and others warmer. There are also other factors
[normal] 
[normal]affecting the climate such as EI Nino and La Nina currents, volcanoes and cloud patterns. James
[normal] 
[normal]Painters' research (referred to in question 4) makes the point that scientists think it is misguided to
[normal] 
[normal]attribute single weather events to climate change as there is too much uncertainty there. But we do
[normal] 
[normal]mention these trends in the Mail's weather reporting - see the article attached 'Monsoon Britain'
[normal] 
[normal]from January 2013 about how scientists believe downpours will become more common.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Do you agree that there are core 
[normal]fa
[normal]cts that everyone might agree upon? Where should these
[normal] 
[normal]facts be promulgated?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The climate is always changing and the vast majority of climate scientists believe there is a
[normal] 
[normal]significant human impact on it although they disagree about the pace and effects. Climate scientists
[normal] 
[normal]are unlikely to write papers saying climate change is not happening. The implications of climate
[normal] 
[normal]change are also looked at by physicists, biologists, chemists, geologists - there is no one authority on
[normal] 
[normal]it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. As a publisher of news, you communicate with the public on climate issues. Do you think you
[normal] 
[normal]attract a broad spectrum of opinion or are you only speaking to like-minded people?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am not aware that we have polled the views of our readers on climate change, although national
[normal] 
[normal]surveys show a larger proportion of the public are sceptical about it than scientists are. (This may be
[normal] 
[normal]because our readers will remember just 20 years or so ago scientists used to think the world would
[normal] 
[normal]enter another Ice Age.) We try and relate our reporting to our readers lives in terms of possible
[normal] 
[normal]extreme weather and flooding, the effect on wildlife and nature, energy bills and energy security and
[normal] 
[normal]health phenomena, such as hay fever or deaths from cold weather. Climate change can be an
[normal] 
[normal]abstract concept so yes it can be better to link it to immediate concerns but we also cover major
[normal] 
[normal]reports on the subject, for example these latest predictions from the UN's climate change panel in
[normal] 
[normal]September 2013: 
[normal]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2436113/IPCC-climate-change-report-Humans-causing-global-warming.html
[normal]. 
[normal] Our reporting is intended to inform and entertain -
[normal] 
[normal]something eye-catching the readers may not have heard of before - for example this story on
[normal] 
[normal]animals shrinking as temperatures warm 
[normal]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049961/Animals-shrinking-heat-Sheep-deer-bird-reptile-numbers-falling-global-warming.html
[normal] 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]get coverage even though it does not directly relate to our readers' lives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Discussions and dissent on climate change policy often focus on uncertainties in the science.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is not the role of newspapers to dictate policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Policy is concerned with mitigating the risks of climate change - while trying to make sure other
[normal] 
[normal]countries do their bit and that it does not overburden households and businesses. It is driven by the
[normal] 
[normal]science, which involves uncertainty and the probability of different scenarios. The modelling of past
[normal] 
[normal]and future climate has become far more sophisticated in recent years but it is still prone
[normal] 
[normal]to uncertainty - the latest IPCC report put the predicted rise in temperature at between 2C and 4.8C
[normal] 
[normal]by the end of the century, and revised down how much warming there has been since the 1950s
[normal] 
[normal]from 0.12C per decade to just 0.05C since 1998. Our readers will want to know how sure scientists
[normal] 
[normal]are about different outcomes - especially if it involves tough choices now.
[normal] 
[normal]I trust your committee will find this helpful.
