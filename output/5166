default1. How should climate scientists communicate their findings?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Daily Mail's science and environment correspondents read the major academic journals every
default 
defaultday and report on papers which we believe are important and will interest our readers,
default 
defaultCorrespondents usually interview the author of the scientific paper, and other experts in that field,
default 
defaulton the phone to ask them questions about their rese
defaultarch and its wider significance.
default They also make
default 
defaultuse of the independent Science Media Centre which organises panels of scientists a once or twice a
default 
defaultweek to give their opinions on a topic or report and take questions from journalists, and provides
default 
defaultreaction from scientists to articl
defaultes authored by their colleagues.
default Climate change is no exception to
default 
defaultthis and our reporters regularly interview climate scientists and other researchers whose work has
default 
defaultan impact on the cl
defaultimate, and report on their work.
default Like most scientists, climate scientists generally
default 
defaultsend out press releases about their published research in advance, and offer to speak to journalists
default 
defaultabout it, which is always 
defaultappreciated.
default There are very few scientists in this field who publicly
default 
defaultchallenge the
default consensus about climate change.
default One example is Professor Judith Curry from the
default 
defaultDepartment of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology who speaks to the
default 
defaultmedia about her concerns that 1998 was the hottest year on record and there has been little
default 
defaultwarmi
defaultng since so she is often quoted.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Science Media Centre gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and I am aware that they highly
default 
defaultvalue the Daily Mail as a supporter.
default&#xa0;
default2. Scientists usually come top of professions that are most trusted by the general public in surveys.
default 
defaultWhy is that different in the climate debate?
default&#xa0;
defaultReporters covering all science issues including climate change should give an impression of how
default 
defaultmuch agreement there is and how important a piece of research is in the wider context of that field.
default 
defaultIn climate science there is almost universal agreement that the climate is changing, and humans are
default 
defaulthaving some impact on it, but not on its pace and scale and possible future effects. Just because the
default 
defaultpublic trust scientists does not mean every piece of research by every scientist should be reported as
default 
defaultfact - science is all about probabilities and it is our job to explain the debate and how it is changing.
default 
defaultFor example the scientist James Lovelock whose influential books suggested that there would be
default 
defaultimminent disaster from global warning in the coming years has since moderated his stance as
default 
defaultreported here- 
defaulthttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2134092/Gaia-scientist-James-Lovelock-I-alarmist-climate-change.html
default. 
defaultMost science published in newspapers is based on material published
default 
defaultin a peer-reviewed journal, further explained in an interview or conference presentation.
default&#xa0;
default3. What is your opinion of mass media coverage of climate?
default&#xa0;
defaultClimate science has changed dramatically in recent years - there are now departments at
default 
defaultuniversities around the world devoted to what was previously a niche issue. The UN's
default 
defaultIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has around 800 scientists. But it is also a political issue.
default 
defaultIt is linked to rising energy bills for homes and businesses, to aid to the developing world, and feeds
default 
defaultin to the debate about renewable energy (for example whether in cutting carbon emissions it
default 
defaultdamages the environment in other ways). For example in 2009 the 'Climategate' controversy
default 
defaultscientists at the University of East Anglia were exonerated of wrongdoing by a number of inquiries,
default 
defaultbut it is clear from their emails to 
defaultand from government departments and the Met Office that they
default 
defaultwere discussing how their scientific findings fitted alongside political developments and
default 
defaultinternational negotiations. It is important to explain uncertainties and changes to the science and
default 
defaultexpose where there may be a political agenda.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn sceptical voices, there are very few serious scientists who deny the climate is changing. But what
default 
defaultis causing it, how fast is happening and what we do about it is controversial. When quoting those
default 
defaultwith well-known sceptical views such as Lord Lawson, we usually refer to him a climate change
default 
defaultsceptic.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that according to last month's Spectator he complained that a meeting of scientists at the
default 
defaultLords was held without reporters being present to record the differing views of scientists.
default&#xa0;
default4. James Painters res
defaultearch has found that press cove
defaultrage in the UK has become increasingly
default 
defaultpolarised - why is this?
default&#xa0;
defaultClimate science is used by government and others to justify higher energy bills; construction of wind
default 
defaultfarms, green taxes on businesses which can affect jobs; and closures of coal-fired power stations.
default 
defaultWhen a subject becomes more prominent in public debate, and has considerable political and
default 
defaulteconomic implications, then controversies will come to the fore. As far as the Painter report is
default 
defaultconcerned we would take issue with information provided in 2009 in regard to this paper and the
default 
defaultreporting of Copenhagen.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo my knowledge the only Daily Mail editorial on the subject is the one attached to this email. It says
default 
default'this paper keeps an open mind on climate change'. Some columnists have doubted it in opinion
default 
defaultpieces under their own name such as this article by Christopher Booker
default 
defaulthttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2335982/CHRISTOPHER-BOOKER-A-dangerously-deluded-energy-policy-greens-want-hide-truth-soaring-bills.html
default.
default 
defaultOthers say it is real and serious
default 
defaultand talk about how Britain should combat it - such as this by the New Scientist's Fred Pearce about
default 
defaultnuclear power 
defaulthttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066726/Nuclear-power-Yes--A-opponent-calls-Chris-Huhne-embrace-energy-source-thats-cheap-AND-good-environment.html
default. 
defaultThe public can
default 
defaultread the news report and the comment and make up their own mind. Readers of the Daily Mail will
default 
defaultbe very familiar with distinct ways in which the paper reports news and comment. I am not aware of
default 
defaultany climate science stories that have had an effect on newspaper sales.
default&#xa0;
default5
default. What is your publications working definition of climate change?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would be impossible to define every term used in the Daily Mail; we generally follow current
default 
defaultwidely accepted usage. Scientists now refer to 'climate change' rather than global warming, as they
default 
defaultno longer believe the effects of greenhouse gas emissions are simply warmer weather, but as
default 
defaultclimate patterns changes
default, the weather may become more extreme, with more floods and droughts;
default 
defaultsome areas of the world could become colder and others warmer. There are also other factors
default 
defaultaffecting the climate such as EI Nino and La Nina currents, volcanoes and cloud patterns. James
default 
defaultPainters' research (referred to in question 4) makes the point that scientists think it is misguided to
default 
defaultattribute single weather events to climate change as there is too much uncertainty there. But we do
default 
defaultmention these trends in the Mail's weather reporting - see the article attached 'Monsoon Britain'
default 
defaultfrom January 2013 about how scientists believe downpours will become more common.
default&#xa0;
default6. Do you agree that there are core 
defaultfa
defaultcts that everyone might agree upon? Where should these
default 
defaultfacts be promulgated?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe climate is always changing and the vast majority of climate scientists believe there is a
default 
defaultsignificant human impact on it although they disagree about the pace and effects. Climate scientists
default 
defaultare unlikely to write papers saying climate change is not happening. The implications of climate
default 
defaultchange are also looked at by physicists, biologists, chemists, geologists - there is no one authority on
default 
defaultit.
default&#xa0;
default7. As a publisher of news, you communicate with the public on climate issues. Do you think you
default 
defaultattract a broad spectrum of opinion or are you only speaking to like-minded people?
default&#xa0;
defaultI am not aware that we have polled the views of our readers on climate change, although national
default 
defaultsurveys show a larger proportion of the public are sceptical about it than scientists are. (This may be
default 
defaultbecause our readers will remember just 20 years or so ago scientists used to think the world would
default 
defaultenter another Ice Age.) We try and relate our reporting to our readers lives in terms of possible
default 
defaultextreme weather and flooding, the effect on wildlife and nature, energy bills and energy security and
default 
defaulthealth phenomena, such as hay fever or deaths from cold weather. Climate change can be an
default 
defaultabstract concept so yes it can be better to link it to immediate concerns but we also cover major
default 
defaultreports on the subject, for example these latest predictions from the UN's climate change panel in
default 
defaultSeptember 2013: 
defaulthttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2436113/IPCC-climate-change-report-Humans-causing-global-warming.html
default. 
default Our reporting is intended to inform and entertain -
default 
defaultsomething eye-catching the readers may not have heard of before - for example this story on
default 
defaultanimals shrinking as temperatures warm 
defaulthttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049961/Animals-shrinking-heat-Sheep-deer-bird-reptile-numbers-falling-global-warming.html
default 
defaultmay
default 
defaultget coverage even though it does not directly relate to our readers' lives.
default&#xa0;
default8. Discussions and dissent on climate change policy often focus on uncertainties in the science.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is not the role of newspapers to dictate policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolicy is concerned with mitigating the risks of climate change - while trying to make sure other
default 
defaultcountries do their bit and that it does not overburden households and businesses. It is driven by the
default 
defaultscience, which involves uncertainty and the probability of different scenarios. The modelling of past
default 
defaultand future climate has become far more sophisticated in recent years but it is still prone
default 
defaultto uncertainty - the latest IPCC report put the predicted rise in temperature at between 2C and 4.8C
default 
defaultby the end of the century, and revised down how much warming there has been since the 1950s
default 
defaultfrom 0.12C per decade to just 0.05C since 1998. Our readers will want to know how sure scientists
default 
defaultare about different outcomes - especially if it involves tough choices now.
default 
defaultI trust your committee will find this helpful.
