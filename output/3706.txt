[[[Association of Colleges – Supplementary written evidence]]]&#xa0;I noted with interest the oral session on 23 October regarding the clauses in the Draft Deregulation Bill which cover further education and apprenticeships.  In particular, you discussed whether lecturers working in Further Education Colleges need to have qualified teacher status.&#xa0;The situation in Further Education Colleges is different to that in schools in that the vocational lecturers are often experts in their chosen professional field.  For example, a qualified engineer might teach a class or two a week in the local college very successfully, but might not be a qualified teacher.  The college might encourage such a person to gain qualified teacher status but we do not believe they need the law to tell them to do so.  Colleges have shown they can manage their own workforces at least as effectively as universities and should, therefore, have the same level of freedom in terms of teacher recruitment.&#xa0;Colleges will be under the remit of an Ofsted inspection and quality regime which specifically considers whether staff have the right qualifications and experience and I expect the vast majority of their teaching staff will be qualified teachers.  The Minister for Skills and Enterprise, Matthew Hancock MP, recently pointed out that 80% of teachers in colleges are qualified with the remaining 19% enrolled on training courses [Commons Hansard, 25 Oct 2013: Column 306W].&#xa0;I am content for you to consider this letter further written evidence from the Association of Colleges.&#xa0;Martin Doel OBEChief Executive&#xa0;&#xa0;11 November 2013&#xa0;
