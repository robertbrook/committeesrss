&#xa0;Written evidence from Lawrence Lomax (CYS0005)Thank you for the opportunity to contribute, its greatly appreciated.1.)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is cycling safe, yes largely, but the perception is no.  2.)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The perception as always is a little more complicated, some mornings while commuting I think yes it is safe, but when you have a bad experience and if you cycle for any length of time you’ll have a few, it quickly becomes a no. When you are on a bike you are a lot weaker than a car or truck, so when you have that bad experience it’s an unfair contest the cyclist always loses. Cyclist are weaker, slower and more exposed. 3.)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I have been cycling for a number of years now so am quite used to the road conditions, I recently had a terrifying experience, road rage driver wanted me out the way, narrow road. I went to the police to report this. Complete waste of time, the police said they would not even consider looking into this, not interested . So what do I do, get back on the road knowing there is nothing not even the law protecting me?4.)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What should be done4.1) Safe infrastructure, the Highway code, item 63 states use the cycle lane “ they can make your journey safer” so how is it a lot/most of cycle lanes are designed to offer no safety benefit at all. As I stated above the cyclist is the one who will lose, it really does not matter who’s fault it the cyclist who suffers. 4.2) Mixing HGV’s and cyclist is downright silly. HGV’s are designed to be used on motorways and have too many blind spots for use in amongst city traffic, it unfair on the driver and bike.  Simply a stupid idea.4.3) The Police need to take safety seriously, is it a funding issue or a cultural issue?  As cyclist could benefit from training the police should be educated into the challenges and faults in the system cyclist are exposed to. From my experience I will never waste my time reporting dangerous driving again. Which I know this is not helping, but it’s a waste of time. Every time the police come out with few day long operations and fiddle around the edges ignoring the Elephant in the room the real safety issues they lose credibility, yes the situation is complex but  challenge they face.5.)              It’s easy to play the blame game, drivers should do this, cyclist that, helmets, ear phone, car radios, tinted window, etc, none of which is going to resolve the fundamental issue, which is cyclist are weaker and need space and the law need to been seen to work, not as one off and not one sided.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
