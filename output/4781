[normal]Written evidence submitted by Professor [bold]John Bell[bold] (CRJ 13)[bold]This paper essentially answers the fifth question in you
[normal]r
[normal] terms of reference: 
[normal]When considering the constitutional role of the judiciary in the context of a codified constitution, are there any particularly instructive lessons to be drawn from other countries with common law jurisdictions and written constitutions?
[normal]Preliminary: Codification and its effects
[normal]The essential issue is not whether the Constitution is codified or not, but whether it is legally enforceable. The very fact of reducing the Constitution to a set of written rules or principles is likely to lead to judges treating the text as legally enforceable. The obvious parallel is the current French Constitution 
[normal]of October
[normal] 1958. 
[normal]The French had an unwritten constitution during its longest lasting political regime, the Third Republic (1870-1940), and resisted the creation of a judicial body to enforce the rules of the Constitution until 1958. The French tradition, like the British, was to have politicians decide on constitutional issues. While the Fifth Republic Constitution
[normal] was being adopted, the author, Michel Debré, was asked whether the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution would be legally enforceable. His reply in August 1958 was “Certainly not!” The Constitutional Council, however, decided that they were legally enforceable in a landmark decision of July 1971.
[normal] All the constitutional drafters managed to achieve was that the issue of whether a statute passed by Parliament was constitutional or not would be decided only by the Constitutional Council (deliberately not called a “court”) and not by the ordinary judges.
[normal] The drafters restricted the power to refer cases to the Council to a limited number of office-holders, because they were concerned that “Every time that a statute has given rise to an impassioned debate, the opposition will not fail to refer it to the Constitutional Council, and in the end effective government will be in the hands of the pensioners who will sit in the Council.”
[normal] The reference power was extended to 60 members of Parliament in 1974 and it is
[normal] now
[normal] true that political opposition groups refer contested issues (police powers, same sex marriages, education reforms) to the Council on a very regular basis. But that has not stopped the Government making key policy decisions. The key issue is whether the judges will be sufficiently respectful of the role of the Parliament in making policy decisions. 
[normal]The German experience has some similarities, but a key difference.
[normal] Judicial review came out of the experience of dictatorship in which Parliament voted to support a government which seriously infringed fundamental rights. So the idea of constitutional review was designed around the mistrust of politicians. To a great extent, the constitutions of Spain and Italy also reflect this concern. So judicial control over the boundaries of the political process was part of the original
[normal] constitutional
[normal] design. 
[normal]The Court’s
[normal] jurisdiction, set out in the law on the Constitutional Court (BVerfGG), includes not only the protection of fundamental rights, but the constitutionality of political parties (art. 21, para.2 GG), electoral issues relating to membership of Parliament (a jurisdiction which the French Constitutional Council also has), complaints against the President of the Republic, as well as conflicts between federal organs of state or concerning the relationship between the federation and the regions.  So, yes cases are brought
[normal] 
[normal]which are highly political.
[normal]Realistically, there is no way that the original intention of the constitutional codifiers about the role of the judiciary can be enshrined. The French experience is that this changed within the first 15 years, simply because the judges took a different view. The degree of intervention in Germany has also varied over time. As Kommers points out
[normal],
[normal] a lot depends on judicial self-restraint.
[normal]In the UK, t
[normal]he judiciary principally has the function of enforcing the statute law as laid down by Parliament and the common law to set the limits of the permitted behaviour of the Executive, the judiciary, and individuals. In doing so, they also protect the prerogatives of the Executive and the judiciary, as well as the rights of individuals.
[normal]The key area in which the judiciary does not play a role is in the control of the process of enacting legislation. Under 
[normal]s. 1(2) of 
[normal]the Parliament Act 1911, the decision whether a
[normal] bill is a “money” bill is made by the Speaker of the House of Commons. The certification of whether any bill has passed the appropriate stages is made by the Speaker. The creation of a codified constitution would lead to such issues becoming legally justiciable. In Germany, for example, the Constitutional Court faced a case in 2002 in which the votes for Brandenburg in the Bundesrat on a piece of legislation were contested. 
[normal]A regional government coalition diverged on how to vote on national immigration legislation. It
[normal]s representatives
[normal] did not give a 
[normal]unified
[normal] vote in relation to the legislation, but a divided vote.
[normal] The regional president then “clarified” the region’s vote in favour of the legislation, giving a bare majority in favour of the bill.
[normal] The Constitutional Council
[normal] declared that the votes of Brandenburg were invalid because
[normal] art. 51 of the Constitution required the region’s votes to be unanimous
[normal] and there was no power to correct them
[normal] within the legislative procedure. Similarly, the French 
[normal]Constitutional Council decided o
[normal]n
[normal] 24 December
[normal] 1979
[normal] that the minority Government’s tactic of getting Parliament to vote on the Finance Bill  as a single block by means of a no-confidence vote was invalid. The constitutional rules on voting finance bills required Part I (receipts) to be voted before debate on Part II (expenditure). As a result, Parliament had to be recalled on 26 December to re-vote the Finance Bill before the beginning of the fiscal year on 1 January. (And that re-voting process was subject to a
[normal] Constitutional Council decision on 30 December.)
[normal]A
[normal]rt. 113 of the German Constitution provides that bills increasing expenditure or reducing income require the explicit approval of the Federal Government. In the period 1963 to 1993, some 45 laws were referred to the Federal Government, but only one to the Court. This was because the parliamentary majority of the Federal Government was secure.
[normal] By contrast, there have been significant judicial decisions on the provisions on financial equalisation between the regions of Germany, especially in relation to the amounts different regions contribute to ensure solidarity with the new regions of the federation.
[normal] The scope of the 
[normal]“church tax” (the amount of tax revenues hypothecated to churches) has been the subject of regular
[normal] 
[normal]litigation
[normal].
[normal]Within the British Constitution, “money bills” are subject to special parliamentary procedures (and do not require the consent of the House of Lords). Experience of other countries would suggest that challenges might be brought to the constitutionality of money bills on the ground that they contain provisions that do not belong in money bills, as well as on the ground that they infringe constitutional principles such as equality.
[normal]Another area might follow from
[normal] treating the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 as part of a codified constitution (which it should be).
[normal] The German Constitution sets out a fixed term for Parliaments with a power of the President to dissolve where the Chancellor has lost a vote of confidence. The German Constitutional Court had to rule in 1983 and 2005 whether the action of the Chancellor is engineering the loss of a vote of confidence was an abuse of process, and so invalid. The issue of whether a parliamentary general election could be held
[normal] depended on the Court’s decision.
[normal]A final area is the approval of treaties. The French and German constitutional courts have had to adjudicate on the compatibility of successive amendments to the EU treaties to the existing constitution.
[normal] This then identifies where the national constitution has to be changed.
[normal]REFERENCE PROCEDURE
[normal]:
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]central
[normal] 
[normal]issue
[normal] in determining the role of the judiciary
[normal] is who should be able to refer cases. In my view, the big mistake of the German Constitution (copied by the European Court of Human Rights and the Spanish Constitutional Court) is to allow individual petition. Over 96% of cases each year come by this route.
[normal] Many are vexatious. 
[normal](Between 1951 and 2012, only 2.4% of such petitions 
[normal]in Germany 
[normal]have been successful.
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]Most are complaints against judicial decisions made by lower courts, thereby adding a further tier of appeal on cases that have been thoroughly investigated. These cases can only be reviewed cursorily, usually by a judicial assistant under the supervision of a single judge (as opposed to the panel which decides the other category of cases). The 
[normal]constitutional 
[normal]courts are overwhelmed
[normal],
[normal] and the justice done is rather rough. The procedure set out in the devolution legislation in this country and in Germany (and more recently France) of a reference made by an ordinary court of constitutional questions to the constitutional court seems highly appropriate.
[normal] The referring court acts as a filter and prepares the question to be answered by the constitutional court in a precise fashion.
[normal] That still leaves the issue of pre-enactment review (see section 4).
[normal]No specific comment
[normal]Continental experi
[normal]e
[normal]nce 
[normal]raises two issues. First, what is the relationship between national constitutional statements of rights and the EU Charter and the European Convention? Many continental courts have wished to retain the power to judge the EU against their own criteria for fundamental rights and would see the European Convention as lower in the legal hierarchy than the fundamental rights declared by a national constitution.
[normal] If the UK adopts a similar approach, then the question remains what are the national statements of rights which might prevail over those stated in the Charter or the Convention? There is currently no statement of such rights. So the effective default (enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998) is to treat the European Convention as the nearest we have to a full statement of fundamental rights.
[normal]The second question is whether the Supreme Court should be able to suspend or quash an unconstitutional statute or not. The German Constitutional Court has the power to 
[normal]declare a decision or practice unconstitutional, but not void. This is called an admonition to the Parliament and will often give instructions on how to correct the law.
[normal] Unless all review is pre-enactment, then the need to have a prospective nullity option will be an important safeguard for rights acquired under the unconstitutional law before the Constitutional Court declared it to be unlawful.
[normal]Germany has both pre-enactment review (especially in conflicts between constitutional organs and between the Federation and the regions). This is called “abstract constitutional review” because the Court is seised of the whole text and considers it without any examples of how it might apply, but simply in the light of the observations of the referring parties and the Government.) This kind of review was adopted by the EU (with a similar strict time limit) for challenges by Member States, and was the only route the French provided in the 1958 Constitution. The German Constitution also provided for post-enactment review arising in 
[normal]specific cases in courts. The constitutional question arising in such cases is then referred to the Constitutional Court to be resolved before the ordinary court proceeds to decide the case on the facts. This procedure is the most common route in Germany and in the EU, and it was 
[normal]copied by the French in 2008. British devolution legislation provides for both kinds of review. That was wise at the time and seems to cover the appropriate eventualities. First, parties in abstract review proceedings cannot always anticipate how the law will work in practice. Secondly, circumstances change and what might have seemed a right solution in the 1950s is no longer the case. The German have seen this on the issue of banning political parties. It made sense in the fragile conditions of the early 1950s to ban communist and neo-Nazi parties, but it has been seen as less appropriate in a more mature and confident democracy. Same sex marriage has also been an area in which the interpretation of the constitution has changed.
[normal]Unlike common law countries (Ireland, US, Canada), continental European countries have adopted the Kelsenian model of a distinctive constitutional court with distinct members (not all of whom are career judges). If we went down the road of codifying the Constitution and making it more legally binding, then the question would arise whether those who are experts in commercial law, property law or administrative law are the best people to adjudicate on matters which are constitutionally sensitive. Do we need judges who have more political awareness?  If so what should be their qualifications and who should appoint them?
[normal]Against having a specialised court is the caseload. If the court is not going to receive individual petitions and is not going to handle electoral petitions, then it could be argued that there would simply not be enough work for a separate court. If the cases are going to be referred by the ordinary courts, then the constitutional questions will be ancillary to legal issues with which the current judges are perfectly experienced in handling. So my view would be that the issue of who is going to be allowed to raise questions before the courts will determine whether it is best to have a separate court or not.
