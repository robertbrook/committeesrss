[[[Written evidence submitted by Professor Hywel Thomas (ESG 29)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Last year, the UK Government's Chief Scientific Adviser asked the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry out an independent review of the scientific and engineering evidence relating to the technical aspects of the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing to inform government policymaking about shale gas extraction in the UK. &#xa0;The terms of reference of this review were:&#xa0;&#xa0;A Working Group was set up to oversee this project. The Working Group met on six occasions when it was briefed by other experts. Consultations with other experts and stakeholders were held between meetings. Submissions were received from a number of individuals and learned societies. I am writing to you as a member of the Working Group, although I am writing in a personal capacity and not necessary on behalf of the two academies. &#xa0;Our key finding was that the health, safety and environmental risks associated with hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract shale gas can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and enforced through regulation. Hydraulic fracturing is an established technology that has been used in the oil and gas industries for many decades. The UK has 60 years’ experience of regulating onshore and offshore oil and gas industries. &#xa0;We were keen to stress that shale gas extraction in the UK is presently at a very small scale, involving only exploratory activities. Uncertainties can be addressed through robust monitoring systems and research activities identified in this report. There is greater uncertainty about the scale of production activities should a future shale gas industry develop nationwide. Therefore, our other key finding was that attention must be paidto the way in which risks scale up. Co-ordination of the numerous bodies with regulatory responsibilities for shale gas extraction must be maintained. Regulatory capacity may need to be increased.&#xa0;Concerns have been raised about the risk of fractures propagating from shale formations to reach overlying aquifers. The available evidence indicates that this risk is very low provided that shale gas extraction takes place at depths of many hundreds of metres or several kilometres. Geological mechanisms constrain the distances that fractures may propagate vertically. Even if communication with overlying aquifers were possible, suitable pressure conditions would still be necessary for contaminants to flow through fractures. More likely causes of possible environmental contamination include faulty wells, and leaks and spills associated with surface operations. Neither cause is unique to shale gas. Both are common to all oil and gas wells and extractive activities.&#xa0;Ensuring well integrity must remain the highest priority to prevent contamination. The probability of well failure is low for a single well if it is designed, constructed and abandoned according to best practice. The UK’s well examination scheme was set up so that the design of offshore wells could be reviewed by independent, specialist experts. This scheme must be applied appropriately for onshore activities. Effects of unforeseen leaks or spills can be mitigated by proper site construction and impermeable lining. Disclosure of the constituents of fracturing fluid is already mandatory in the UK. Ensuring, where possible, that chemical additives are non-hazardous would help to mitigate the impact of any leak or spill.  &#xa0;Concerns have also been raised about seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing. Natural seismicity in the UK is low by world standards. On average, the UK experiences seismicity of magnitude 5 ML (felt by everyone nearby) every twenty years, and of magnitude 4ML (felt by many people) every three to four years. The UK has lived with seismicity induced by coal mining activities or the settlement of abandoned mines for a long time. British Geological Survey records indicate that coal mining-related seismicity is generally of smaller magnitude than natural seismicity and no larger than 4 ML. Seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing is likely to be of even smaller magnitude. There is an emerging consensus that the magnitude of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing would be no greater than 3 ML (felt by few people and resulting in negligible, if any, surface impacts). Recent seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing in the UK was of magnitude 2.3 ML and 1.5 ML (unlikely to be felt by anyone). The risk of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing can be reduced by traffic light monitoring systems that use real-time seismic monitoring so that operators can respond promptly. &#xa0;Monitoring should be carried out before, during and after shale gas operations to inform risk assessments. Methane and other contaminants in groundwater should be monitored, as well as potential leakages of methane and other gases into the atmosphere. The geology of sites should be characterised and faults identified. Monitoring data should be submitted to the UK’s regulators to manage potential hazards, inform local planning processes and address wider concerns. Monitoring of any potential leaks of methane would provide data to assess the carbon footprint of shale gas extraction. &#xa0;The UK’s goal based approach to regulation is to be commended, requiring operators to identify and assess risks in a way that fosters innovation and continuous improvement in risk management. The UK’s health and safety regulators and environmental regulators should work together to develop guidelines specific to shale gas extraction to help operators carry out goal based risk assessments according to the principle of reducing risks to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). Risk assessments should be submitted to the regulators for scrutiny and then enforced through monitoring activities and inspections. It is mandatory for operators to report well failures, as well as other accidents and incidents to the UK’s regulators. Mechanisms should be put in place so that reports can also be shared between operators to improve risk assessments and promote best practices across the industry.&#xa0;An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) should be mandatory for all shale gas operations. Risks should be assessed across the entire lifecycle of shale gas extraction, including risks associated with the disposal of wastes and abandonment of wells. Seismic risks should also feature as part of the ERA.&#xa0;Water requirements can be managed through integrated operational practices, such as recycling and reusing wastewaters where possible. Options for disposing of wastes should be planned from the outset. Should any onshore disposal wells be necessary in the UK, their construction, regulation and siting would need further consideration.&#xa0;The report did not attempt to determine whether shale gas extraction should go ahead in the UK. This remains the responsibility of the Government. This report analysed the environmental, health and safety risks associated with shale gas extraction to inform decision making. Neither risks associated with the subsequent use of shale gas nor climate risks were analysed. Decision making would benefit from research into the climate risks associated with both the extraction and use of shale gas. Further benefit would also be derived from research into the public acceptability of all these risks in the context of the UK’s energy, climate and economic policies.&#xa0;In December 2012, the Secretary of State for Energy informed the House of Commons that the temporary suspension on shale gas activities in the UK would be lifted. In the same speech, he added that he ‘had the benefit of the comprehensive and authoritative review of the risks of fracking by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering .... I can announce that the Government accepts all the recommendations of the academies’ report addressed to it’.  The Secretary of State ‘placed in the Libraries of both Houses and placed on my Department’s website a full synopsis of the questions raised and of the Government’s responses to them as well as a response on all of the recommendations of the academies’ study group’. The two academies have been liaising with government, industry and regulatory officials to discuss how the recommendations are to be implemented. &#xa0;Appendix 1              Recommendations
