[[[Patricia A Whelan – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Ref: Upcoming Deregulation Bill, in particular Green Lanes&#xa0;All unsealed BOATs and UCRs should be reclassified as RESTRICTED BYWAYS.&#xa0;I am a member of Yorkshire Dales Local Access Forum and of N.Yorkshire LAF and a member of the British (Horse) Driving Society and am very aware of the problems caused by motorised vehicles – mainly motorcycles on ‘green lanes’.  &#xa0;I hope that you will consider my submission when assembling forthcoming Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;Thank you for your attention.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;31 August 2013&#xa0;
