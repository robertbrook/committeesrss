[[[ Albert Kennedy Trust]]]&#xa0;The Albert Kennedy Trust (AKT) is a charity that has been working with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) young people aged 25 and under, who are homeless or in crisis at home, since 1989. With offices in London, Manchester and, from this year, Newcastle, we provide a range of services, including advice and assessment, advocacy, mentoring, residential services, peer support and training. &#xa0;A year away from our 25th anniversary as a charity, and with many of the larger legislative issues for LGBT people now addressed by this and previous governments, we are nevertheless still seeing the same issues arise for young LGBT people as they struggle to sustain their lives in their family homes. We maintain that withdrawing the support that currently enables young people to live away from unsafe or unsuitable family homes will disproportionately affect young LGBT people in a negative way. &#xa0;This submission has been drafted at short notice, but AKT staff and trustees are very willing to enter into more detailed discussion with the Select Committee on this and other relevant points. Please contact Tim Sigsworth, Chief Executive: tim@akt.org.uk.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Over the past two years, the homelessness sector has seen a significant rise in demand for services. The Rough Sleeper Statistics reports for 2011 and 2012 showed an aggregate 30% rise in street homelessness, and statutory acceptances have risen by 24% over the same period (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/homelessness-statistics). &#xa0;By comparison, over the last 3 years, AKT has seen a 97% rise in new contacts in London, and a 78% rise in Manchester. &#xa0;&#xa0;Meanwhile, the capacity of the homelessness sector is shrinking.  Homeless Link reported that 2012 saw reductions in funding for 58% of projects, with frontline staff reductions in 28%. 24 night cover services, 22 floating support services, 18 outreach services, 15 accommodation services, and 3 day centres closed last year. Services reported reduced outcomes for clients in terms of employment (44%) and accommodation (38%). The same period saw LGBT-specific services shrink from 11% to just 3% of the sector (http://homeless.org.uk/sites/default/files/SNAP2012%20fullreport.pdf).&#xa0;

[[[Prevalence]]]Anecdotal evidence from homelessness services has long maintained that there is a large LGBT youth homeless population; there is also some social research suggesting a sizeable disproportion of LGBT people in the youth homelessness population, particularly in urban areas with LGBT cultural hubs. Dunne et al (2002) found an estimate of 26% LGBT people among the youth homelessness population from homeless agencies in London (this compares to an estimated 9% prevalence of LGBT people among the general population). Browne and Davis (2008) found a 22% prevalence of homelessness among a sizeable sample of LGBT people living and working in Brighton (this compares to around 8% prevalence of homelessness within the general population). By contrast, in the US, where state support for homeless people is far lower, the estimated prevalence of LGBT people in the young homeless population is between 25% and 40% (Kruks, 1991; Noel and Ochs, 2001; Cochran et al, 2002).&#xa0;

[[[Presenting issues]]]

[[[4.2.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Homelessness]]]In 2012-13, 63% of young people in London and 30% of those in Manchester gave homelessness as their primary reason for contacting us. The majority of those who contact AKT, particularly in London, are already homeless or living in an unsustainable situation which will result in imminent homelessness.&#xa0;

[[[4.2.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Family rejection]]]The great majority of young people who contact AKT have faced rejection from their families. Many have been asked to leave their homes on coming out (or being outed, an increasing phenomenon in the age of social media). Some have faced violence and abuse, some face psychological or religious reparative 'therapies' or rituals, forced marriage or corrective rape (see s4.2.3 and s4.2.4, below). Though AKT seeks to reconnect young people with their families wherever it is safe and appropriate to do so, this remains a minority of cases. Many young people, once settled and independent after a period of homelessness, do reconnect with their families at some level, but those who are forced to move back home for lack of options elsewhere often face the same issues and again become homeless because of them.&#xa0;

[[[4.2.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Domestic violence]]]While only 6% of young people gave domestic violence as their primary reason for contacting AKT last year, many of those who were already or imminently homeless had experienced domestic violence. The majority were experiencing violence from family members rather than from partners, which makes accessing services particularly difficult: though definitions of domestic violence in homelessness law include familial violence on young people, in practice the vast majority of domestic violence services are aimed at women experiencing partner violence; they are not designed for young people of all genders fleeing violence from their families. Domestic violence includes physical, emotional, sexual, psychological, financial and verbal abuse. It is AKT's position that frequently and stridently expressed homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language and attitudes are forms of emotional abuse when experienced by LGBT young people in their family context. Many of those who contact us have experienced several kinds of abuse from their families over a sustained period of time. &#xa0;

[[[4.2.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Forced marriage, religious abuse and 'honour'-based violence]]]AKT sees a small but steadily growing number of cases where young LGBT people have faced increased risks to their safety and wellbeing because of religious and cultural belief. We see a variety of backgrounds in this work, which in mainstream provision tends to be aimed at British Muslim women. We have seen cases of young people from Pentecostal, Jehovah's Witness, Salvation Army and Irish Traveller backgrounds as well as those from Muslim backgrounds. Of these young people the largest proportion have Pentecostal Christian backgrounds. AKT works with these young people to help them find safe and positive homes, supportive new networks, and legal protection. &#xa0;

[[[4.2.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Sexual exploitation]]]Around 65% of young gay and bisexual men and around 35% of young trans women working with AKT have exchanged sex for a place to stay. Sexual exploitation of LGBT young homeless people is common: the lack of relevant sex education, the power imbalance between older and younger people, and the club culture prevalent in LGBT commercial hubs all contribute to a situation in which too often, LGBT young homeless people are not offered an opportunity to meaningfully consent to safe sex. &#xa0;

[[[4.2.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Mental health]]]Of the 22% of our clients who count themselves as disabled, the most commonly reported form of disability is mental illness. Many of those who do not see themselves as disabled are also in varying levels of mental health distress. A considerable amount of research has shown that LGBT people, and particularly LGBT youth, are more vulnerable to mental health difficulties than heterosexual comparison groups. In particular studies have shown that there are higher rates of attempted suicide and depressive illness in the LGB population (Bagley and Tremblay, 1997, Garofalo et al., 1998, Bagley and D'Augelli, 2000, Webb and Wright, 2001, King et al., 2003a). One study of LGB youth report that 39% have attempted suicide compared to 6-10% of the general youth population (Rotherum-Borus et al., 1994); another recent study in Northern Ireland found that 27.1% of young gay or bisexual men had attempted suicide (McNamee, 2006). One study of LGBT youth (some of whom had been homeless) found that 64% of transgender youth had attempted suicide (Carolan and Redmond, 2003).&#xa0;

[[[4.2.7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Debt, sanctions and rent arrears]]]The majority of young people accessing AKT's services are claiming benefits for at least some of the time they work with us and over the last year, as the value of benefits has fallen below inflation, we have seen young people resort increasingly to expensive forms of credit.Â  Many have debts from mobile phone contracts; some have payday loans. Without the means to address these issues robustly they will often fall into rent arrears and risk losing their accommodation and making future tenancies far harder to find. At the same time we have begun to notice a pattern of benefit sanctions being applied to young homeless people who may be unable to meet the demands of their jobseeking agreements, or attend courses or placements while homeless. Young homeless people on sanctions also soon fall into rent arrears, as they are unable to pay the rent contributions which homeless hostels require; we have even seen some cases of young people being evicted from homeless hostels for this reason.&#xa0;

[[[4.2.8]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[LGBT migrants]]]Over the last year, the number of LGBT migrants approaching AKT for support has increased significantly, particularly in London. Though relatively few have made asylum claims, and most are in the UK on student or working visas, they tend to be strongly motivated to stay by experiences of violence, oppression and discrimination in their home countries. A thorough analysis of the housing and homelessness issues facing LGBT asylum seekers can be found here: http://www.metropolitan.org.uk/images/Over-Not-Out.pdf &#xa0;AKT would suggest that given the likely disproportion of LGBT people in the young homeless population, the recent rise in homelessness is leading to a disproportionately large number of young homeless LGBT people who face serious barriers both in services and in their ability to reconnect with their families and/ or enter employment or education. Simultaneously, there has been a reduction in LGBT-specific services that might help to address those issues. Both these factors are resulting in a vastly increased demand for services like AKT. Young LGBT people face a variety of complex issues and barriers folded in to their experience of family rejection and homelessness; it is AKT's contention that they should not be forced by lack of services or support to return to homes where they face violence and abuse, including the emotional abuse caused by homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.Â  &#xa0;10 October 2013&#xa0;
