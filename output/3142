UKR 39[bold]Roger Wade is CEO of Boxpark Shoreditch, the World’s 1
[normal]st
[normal] Pop Up Mall. Boxpark has successfully rebuilt a High Street in Hackney, London, and
[normal] has
[normal] a unique mix of
[normal] Events,
[normal] Indep
[normal]endent brands and 
[normal]Pop Up Retailers. 
[normal]The Government sho
[normal]uld be encouraging pop up units across Britain
[normal] and offering business rates relief for qualifying small business tenants
[normal]. This is potentially a sustainable solution to revitalising our empty high streets.
[normal] Pop ups are the future breeding
[normal] ground for next gene
[normal]ration of Independent R
[normal]etailers.
[normal]We recommend a qualifying small business tenant can claim up to 3 months rate
[normal]s
[normal] relief once per calendar year. The qualifying business could be administered by
[normal] an
[normal] I
[normal]ndepende
[normal]nt Pop U
[normal]p organisation like We A
[normal]re Pop Up
[normal], Appear 
[normal]Here, Pop Up Britain
[normal] or 
[normal]similar body.
[normal] 
[normal]The current business rates relief scheme allows landlords to qualify for up to
[normal] 3 months rates relief if they 
[normal]let empty units BUT the small business tenants are sti
[normal]ll responsible for paying rates if the rateable value 
[normal]is above £6000. 
[normal]This sys
[normal]tem is totally one sided
[normal] because it does not encourage small businesses to rent empty shops.
[normal] 
[normal]The suggested scheme encourages both the landlord and tenant to fill empty units. 
[normal]The 
[normal]long-term
[normal] objective i
[normal]s to encourage small
[normal] business
[normal]es
[normal] to trial pop up stores.
[normal] 
[normal]After a 
[normal]3-month
[normal] period the tenant will be then liable for 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]rent
[normal]al terms
[normal] and business rates.
[normal]The benefits are the following; the smal
[normal]l business tenant can test out 
[normal]business
[normal] concepts at relatively low set up costs. The land
[normal]lord can fill empty units and qualify for up to 3 months business rates relief and hopefully develop a 
[normal]long-term
[normal] tenant. The government can f
[normal]ill empty stores and hopefully 
[normal]after 3 months generate 
[normal]long-term
[normal] business rates.

[normal]depend
[normal]ent 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] supporting our suggested scheme.

[normal]2. [bold]Digital[bold] Market[bold]place[bold]:[bold] Create a 
[normal]Digital Marketplace 
[normal]for small independent retailers, allowing customers
[normal] to view all products available on 
[normal]the
[normal] high street
[normal]/town centre
[normal], and to 
[normal]buy or share products 
[normal]in store
[normal], online or mobile.
[normal]3. [bold]Digital High Street[bold]:[bold] Provide free public 
[normal]Wi-Fi
[normal] on our High Street and Town Centres
[normal], allowi
[normal]ng customers to use their mobiles to browse 
[normal]and locate local Independent 
[normal]stores and develop 
[normal]an
[normal] email 
[normal]database of local visitors, c
[normal]reating a connected community of retailers and customers.
[normal]The aim of this Box
[normal]park proposal is to develop three complementary, and sustainable 
[normal]inititives
[normal] which if successful could be applied to High Streets
[normal] and Town Centres 
[normal]across Britain. 
[normal]The business rates relief will encourage small independents to fill empty stores and reduce th
[normal]e
[normal] high cost of starting a retail business
[normal]. 
[normal]Once the retailers have started we need to help them develop their business 
[normal]and compete in this Digital age, by 
[normal]develop
[normal]ing
[normal] a digital 
[normal]marketplace
[normal] of connected local independent retailers
[normal]. 
[normal]Finally we need to connect
[normal] with the customer
[normal], and develop free Wi-Fi on the H
[normal]igh 
[normal]Street, allowing customers to view
[normal] 
[normal]local 
[normal]products available, and buy or share products instore, online or mobile.
[normal]Boxpark are prepared to run a
[normal] pilot scheme on a not for profit basis, and work with
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]Shoreditch Digital 
[normal]C
[normal]o
[normal]mmunity, Hackney Council, 
[normal]GLA
[normal] 
[normal]or Government
[normal] to develop these
[normal] 
[normal]initiatives further.
