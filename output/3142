UKR 39defaultRoger Wade is CEO of Boxpark Shoreditch, the World’s 1
defaultst
default Pop Up Mall. Boxpark has successfully rebuilt a High Street in Hackney, London, and
default has
default a unique mix of
default Events,
default Indep
defaultendent brands and 
defaultPop Up Retailers. 
defaultThe Government sho
defaultuld be encouraging pop up units across Britain
default and offering business rates relief for qualifying small business tenants
default. This is potentially a sustainable solution to revitalising our empty high streets.
default Pop ups are the future breeding
default ground for next gene
defaultration of Independent R
defaultetailers.
defaultWe recommend a qualifying small business tenant can claim up to 3 months rate
defaults
default relief once per calendar year. The qualifying business could be administered by
default an
default I
defaultndepende
defaultnt Pop U
defaultp organisation like We A
defaultre Pop Up
default, Appear 
defaultHere, Pop Up Britain
default or 
defaultsimilar body.
default 
defaultThe current business rates relief scheme allows landlords to qualify for up to
default 3 months rates relief if they 
defaultlet empty units BUT the small business tenants are sti
defaultll responsible for paying rates if the rateable value 
defaultis above £6000. 
defaultThis sys
defaulttem is totally one sided
default because it does not encourage small businesses to rent empty shops.
default 
defaultThe suggested scheme encourages both the landlord and tenant to fill empty units. 
defaultThe 
defaultlong-term
default objective i
defaults to encourage small
default business
defaultes
default to trial pop up stores.
default 
defaultAfter a 
default3-month
default period the tenant will be then liable for 
defaultcommercial 
defaultrent
defaultal terms
default and business rates.
defaultThe benefits are the following; the smal
defaultl business tenant can test out 
defaultbusiness
default concepts at relatively low set up costs. The land
defaultlord can fill empty units and qualify for up to 3 months business rates relief and hopefully develop a 
defaultlong-term
default tenant. The government can f
defaultill empty stores and hopefully 
defaultafter 3 months generate 
defaultlong-term
default business rates.

defaultDigital Marketplace 
defaultfor small independent retailers, allowing customers
default to view all products available on

defaultand locate local Independent 
defaultstores and develop 
defaultan

defaultreating a connected community of retailers and customers.
defaultThe aim of this Box
defaultpark proposal is to develop three complementary, and sustainable 
defaultinititives
default which if successful could be applied to High Streets
default and Town Centres 
defaultacross Britain. 
defaultThe business rates relief will encourage small independents to fill empty stores and reduce th
defaulte
default high cost of starting a retail business
default. 
defaultOnce the retailers have started we need to help them develop their business 
defaultand compete in this Digital age, by 
defaultdevelop
defaulting
default a digital 
defaultmarketplace
default of connected local independent retailers
default. 
defaultFinally we need to connect
default with the customer
default, and develop free Wi-Fi on the H
defaultigh 
defaultStreet, allowing customers to view
default 
defaultlocal 
defaultproducts available, and buy or share products instore, online or mobile.
defaultBoxpark are prepared to run a
