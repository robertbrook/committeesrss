"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Guide Dogs (TIC 065)&#xa0;1.0 About Guide Dogs1.1 Guide Dogs provides mobility and rehabilitation services\n for\n blind and partially sighted people in the UK\n, \ndelivered through 20 local \nmobility teams. T\nhe guide dog \nservice involves the training and provision of assistance dogs to blind and partially sighted people, working with both guide dog and owner to create a successful partnership through which the individual can become as indep\nendently mobile as possible\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.\n2 Alongside our mobility work we campaign to break down physical and legal barriers to \nhelp\n blind and partially sight people to get around on their own. \nCurrent estimates suggest \ntwo million people with sight loss in the UK of which around 360,000\n are regi\nstered as blind or partially sighted.\n We do not have\n absolute\n \nfigures\n of the proportion of blind and partially sighted \nwho live in isolated communities \nacross the UK \nbut an analysis of the \nGuide Dogs user \ndata we hold for Scotland \nindicates \nthat 4.5% of b\nlind and partially sighted people in Scotland live in the \nisolated communities of \nHighlands, Western Isles, Orkney \nIslands and\n Shetland Islands.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nP\nublic transport is \nextremely \nimportant\n to the independent mobility of blind and partially sighted people \nas the nature of their disability means they\n are unable to drive.\n \nResearch has revealed that although disabled people travel less often than non-disabled people, they are more likely to use bus services.\n&#xa0;\n2.0 To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?The needs of blind and partially sighted passengers are not sufficiently taken int\no account\n by local authorities or transport providers\n in isolated communities\n. The following areas cause significant problems for blind and partially sighted people\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 Limited Availability of ServicesLimited serv\nices in isolated areas can make the difference between people with sight loss\n going\n out and integrating with their community or remaining \nisolated and \nimmobile\n in their homes. Guide Dogs has received indications \nfrom service users \nthat \npublic transport provision \nin rural areas \nis declining, with serious consequences for people’s independence: \n&#xa0;2\n.1.1 \n“There isn’t a bus into Brecon\n anymore; it costs over £20 to get a taxi, so we have to rely on our family for lifts to go shopping. My wife is deaf blind and has depression, it’s very hard for us now as my sight is failing and we want to carry on doing things for ourselves, we’ve raise\nd a family together here in Llangorse, we’ve always lived in the village, but they say the little shop is closing now so I don’t know what we’ll do” Mr R, Llangorse \n&#xa0;\n2\n.1.2 \n“There aren't enough buses locally. I only have the choice of one bus to get me to \nwork and that only runs term time. Next year this service will stop\n,\n meaning I am totally reliant on others.\n”\n Guide Dog Owner, Dorset\n&#xa0;\n2\n.1.3\n \n“I stopped driving in 2001 due to severe sight loss.  At that time, the \nPost Bus came through Scethrog \nand other \nru\nral communities …\n It meant that I was able to retain a level of independen\nce …\n.  \nI\nt was always popular and well used.  About 2007 the service was withdrawn.  I now rely on my husband, and taxis\n…\n I really miss the Post Bus which was reliable, did not requir\ne booking and was efficient. \" Mrs S, Scethrog\n&#xa0;\n2.2 Unmanned Train Stations1 \nU\nnstaffed stations, of which there are 220 in Wales, 33 in Northern Ireland and 209 in Scotland,\n \npresent particular difficulties.\n \nU\nnmanned stations in rural areas \ncause problems \nfor blind and partially sighted people in purchasing tickets\n, \ngetting the information and suppor\nt they need from station staff,\n \nand embarking and disembarking\n \nsafely \nfrom trains\n&#xa0;\n2.\n2.1\n \nStepping from the platform to the train and vice versa is potentially d\nangerous \nas t\nhe gap between \ntrain and platform \nvaries b\noth horizontally and vertically.\n Pr\novision of \nappropriate\n color-\ncontrasted tactile warning strips \nat platform edges \nis inconsistent and often absent\n. \nA blind or partially sighted person may not be able to \nuse \nan unstaffed station unless they are absolutely certain of their route from \nthe train to the platform and from \nthe \nplatform \nto the \nstation \nexit\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n2\n \nN\new designs of automated ticket vending machi\nnes \nrequire \nuse of a touch screen \nwhich gives \nno tactile or audible feedback. Partially sighted people report problems with the size and tonal contrast of text on the screens and glare caused by reflective light sources. Whilst journeys can be pre-\nbooked o\nnline, it is still necessary to use a credit card and enter a pin number on the ticket machine to retrieve tickets. This is impossible for blind people to do without help from staff. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.3\n \nPassenger \nAssistance\n is generally useful for disabled travelers\n. \nHowever, Guide Dogs has\n received anecdotal evidence \nfrom our service users \nthat \nthe \nfaxes \nused to alert\n station staff to the need for passenger assistants are sometimes \nsent to unmanned stations where they are not\n picked up\n \nuntil after \nthe requested time o\nf departure\n.\n \nThis results\n in \npassengers disembark\ning\n, expecting to be met by staff\n,\n but \nfind\ning\n themselves alone in an unmanned station\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 Access to embarkation pointsThe ability of people to use public transport depends on them being \nable to access \nthe embarkation and disembarkation points. The Department for Transport has recognised this, stating \n“\nwe need to focus on improving the entire door-to-door journey.\n”\n \nOptions for public transport\n \nin isolated communities are more limited\n \nt\nhan in most metrop\nolitan areas\n, leaving blind and partially sighted people fewer \nplaces \nto \naccess public transport\n \nor interch\nange between modes of transport\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.1 \nSafe access to bus stops and stations \ncan be adversely affected by cars parked inappropriately, poor lighting, \npoor infrastructure\n design\n, poor maintenance of hedges a\nnd verges, isolated stops, \nand a lack of safe place\ns\n to cross\n roads\n. \nThe ability to walk to and from stops and stations depends\n also upon pavement quality. Kerbed\n footways clearly delineate b\netween pedestrian and traffic\n areas, indicate a safe place to walk\n,\n and deno\nte the positioning of bus stops and\n shelters. \nSome c\nountry roads \ndo not have \nformal \nkerbed footways, making it diffi\ncult for blind and partially sighted people to reach public transport embarkation points.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.2 \n\"Pengam railway station in Glan-yr-Nant has a busy crossroads with no pedestrian crossing over the main Bargoed to Ystrad Mynach\n road or the road leading to Fleur-de-Lys.”\n \nRehabilitation Officer, Wales.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.3\n \n“\n[the bus service is] \njust not suitable for people with sight loss living in rural areas. Need taxis to and from bus depots/stops.” G\nuide \nD\nog \nO\nwner,\n N\northern \nI\nreland\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.4\n \n“There is one bus an hour into Chepstow, but the road I have to walk to get to the bus stop has no pavements. At one point there are high walls on both sides and the \nLorries\n that go by frighten me. My guide dog and I have to push ourselves back against the\n wall if we get c\naught there, I really dread it” \nMrs G, Guide Dog Owner, Caerwent\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.4 Information availability Timetable and service information should be available to passengers in their preferred format. A lack of \naccessible\n,\n \naccurate and timely info\nrmation is a \nmajor deterrent to blind and partially sighted p\neople using public transport in isolated communities. \nAudio and visual announcements \non buses and bus stops\n \nare\n essential\n to disabled people in helping them to understand their location and proximity to \ntheir \ndestination. \n&#xa0;\n2.4.1\n \n“I live in a rural community, none of my busses have audio announcements, which makes it difficult for me to sometimes travel alone feeling entirel\ny comfortable and free of anxiety, particularly during quieter times of the day, and especially when not knowing if the bus stop is a \"request\" only stop.” Guide dog owner, Kent\n&#xa0;\n2.4.2\n \n“Recently when going home \n…\n I missed my stop and had to go to the end o\nf the route and come back. This would not have happen\ned\n if audio visual announcements were on the bus. It would be great to see some movement on getting some audio visual on some routes\n” \nGuide dog owner, \nNorthern Ireland\n&#xa0;\n2.5 Staff trainingWhere informati\non is not freely available, s\ntaff can be \na key point of\n \ninformation during journeys and at stops. \nThis means that, particularly in rural areas, d\nrivers’ attitudes and role in providing effective and timely information \nand support\n \nis critical. \n&#xa0;\n2.5.1\n \nDrivers need to be given disability awareness training to ensure they are aware of the needs of disabled passengers by, for example, pulling up next to the \nkerb \nor \nproviding \nassistance.\n Guide Dogs Road to Nowhere Report found that only 25% of blind and par\ntially sighted people reported that bus drivers always pulled up to the kerb. Only \n55% reported that drivers always say the number of the bus \nwhen asked, and\n \nas few as \n17% \nreported that drivers \nalways wait for blind or partially sighted passengers to find \na seat before pulling off.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.5.2\n \n“Some of the bus drivers drive so fast and then have to jam on the brakes hard when they see someone is waiting, on the rural journey from Cirencester to Cheltenham and back.  It makes me feel sick and my guide dog slide\ns along the floor towards the front of the bus if I don't grab her.\n” \nG\nuide \nD\nog \nO\nwner\n, South West England\n&#xa0;\n2.5.3\n \n“I rely heavily on rural transport to get to the bus stop in my local town which causes me more problems. In my local town there is no bus \nstati\non, so the buses pull up on the street and could be double parked or 2 ft away from the \nkerb\n. I can't tell which bus is the one I want and ne\ned to rely on other passengers… \nI don't have confidence in travelling by bus at night or in the dark evenings.” G\nui\nde \nD\nog \nO\nwner,\n N\northern \nI\nreland\n&#xa0;\n2.5.4\n \nGuide Dogs recommends that the Department for Transport reassess its decision to postpone the implementation of the disability awareness training for drivers \nrequired \nby EU Regulation 181/2011.\n \nThe Regulation\n’s \nimplementation\n would \nensure that \ndrivers in isolated areas \nproperly \ntake the needs of blind and partially sighted passengers into account. \n&#xa0;\n3.0 To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?B\nlind and partially sighted people \ncan \nrely\n \non \ntaxis to bridge the gap\n in public transport provision\n and avoid dangerous situation\ns. This is particularly relevant in isolated areas where \npublic transport\n \nservices \nare \nmore limited or \nharder to access.\n Visually impaired people\n \nmay have to use\n taxis in place of public transport \nat significant additional c\nost to them, especially as many\n qualify for free or heavily discounted public transport.\n The Road to Nowhere report showed that 67% of \nblind and partially sighted respondents spent money on taxi fares because they didn’t trust their local bus services.\n \n&#xa0;\n3\n.1 \n“\nUnfamiliar areas cause great difficulties for me and I don't know where to get off the bus, so tend to rely on taxi travel, rather\n than take the bus.” G\nuide \nD\nog \nO\nwner, \nN\northern \nI\nreland\n&#xa0;\n3\n.2 \nHowever, frequent taxi use is expensive\n. 14% of Road to Nowhere respondents spent between \n£30 and £50 on taxis a month and 10% spent more than £50 a month. \nAdditionally, \ndemand-responsive transpor\nt services may not always be readily available in isolated areas.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n \n“\nTaxis are not an option as the local operators cover the school runs so none available to get me to work. My DLA is under threat so I will not be able to afford to pay for a taxi \nanyway.”\n \nGuide Dog Owner, Dorset\n&#xa0;\n3\n.4\n \n“\nThere is a Dial a Ride service but I am very conscious that a 16-seater minibus travelling from Brecon to pick me up is neither cost effective nor environmentally friendly.  It also has to be booked a few days in adva\nnce and therefore does not cope with spontaneous trips.\n”\n  \nMrs S, Scethrog\n&#xa0;\n3\n.5\n \nT\nhe law \n(Equality Act 2010\n in England, Scotland and Wales and the Disability Discrimination Act in Northern Ireland) \nstates that the driver of a licensed taxi or private hire ve\nhicle cannot refuse to carry a guide dog, or other registered assistance dog, unless the driver has a medical exemption\n. However,\n \nGuide Dogs receives \nregular \nreports of \ncases\n \nwhere guide dog owners have been \nrefused access by taxi drivers. Due to the natur\ne of their disability, blind and partially sighted people may not be able to get the\n license plate number\n \nof the taxi or driver \nregistration \nand so many such incidents go unreported\n, or local authorities fail to take actio\nn because of a lack of evidence\n. W\nhilst guide dog owners continue to be refused access to taxis, \nit is unreasonable to\n expect\n them to rely upon taxis as a means of transport in isolated communities\n because of the commercial imperative in decision making relating to public transport\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nR\noyal \nN\national \nI\nnstitute for \nB\nlind People research\n: \nhttp://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus\n/research/statistics/Pages/statistics.aspx#H2Heading2\n \n \nAttitudes of Disabled People to Public Transport; DPTAC, pp 28, 2002\n \nDepartment for Transport, Door to Door Strategy, March 2013\n \nGuide Dogs Road to Nowhere Report:\n \nhttps://d3qkb2hv043xyy.cloudfront.net/fileadmin/gdmain/user/Help_us/Campaigns_and_petitions/Documents/R\noad_to_Nowhere_Report_22.04.2013.pdf\n  \n Regulation 181/2011: \nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:055:0001:0012:EN:PDF\n \n Guide Dogs, Road to Nowhere Report: \nhttps://d3qkb2hv043xyy.cloudfront.net/fileadmin/gdmain/user/Help_u\ns/Campaigns_and_petitions/Documents/Road_to_Nowhere_Report_22.04.2013.pdf\n  \n \nIbid\n"
