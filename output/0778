Written evidence from the [bold]Care Quality Commission (LTC 30)[bold]1.1.The Care Quality Commission (CQC) was established under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (HSCA) as the independent regulator of health and social care provision in 
[normal]England
[normal]. CQC ensures that only providers who can meet the statutory requirements are registered to provide regulated activities in health and/or social care.
[normal] 
[normal]Once services are registered, CQC continues to monitor and inspects them against the essential standards. It acts quickly in response to any concerns and takes swift enforcement action where services are failing people. All acute, community, mental health, ambulance, dental and adult social care providers are already registered with CQC. From 1 April 2013, all primary medical care providers, including GP practices will be registered with the CQC. We also protect the interests of vulnerable people, including those whose rights are restricted under the Mental Health Act.
[normal]2. [bold]The scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectiveness[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1. 
[normal]We support the aspiration for people with long term conditions to be treated outside hospital. Rather than consider health and social care separately there should be a truly integrated
[normal] model of care. 
[normal]J
[normal]oint commissioning of services between health and social care
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]via a common service specification can and should reduce overlap and duplication
[normal] and go some way to integration
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The main issue, however,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is clarity about who is responsible f
[normal]or the care package each person
[normal] r
[normal]eceives at home so that they
[normal] and 
[normal]their 
[normal]carers can alert someone with authority when things are not working or the package needs to be varied.
[normal] 
[normal]This clarity can be a major benefit from jointly commissioned services with a common service specification
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2. 
[normal]Although
[normal] home carers are usually a central feature
[normal] of all care packages they could be funded
[normal] by CCGs (NHS) or local councils and they could be contracted directly by CCGs or sub contracted by NHS fro
[normal]m councils
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]depending on the
[normal] outcome of the Continuing Health Care assessment. The responsibility for putting right problems in the care package can vary therefore and is oft
[normal]en extremely opaque to users of services
[normal].
[normal] Truly integrated care would not define a boundary between health and social care and would instead focus on the needs of the individual some of which will be health related and other social care related.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]The issue of local authority eligibility criteria could be a factor in restricting the availability of support to some people in the earlier stages of their disease so access to preventative help (e.g. advice, information, assistive technology, 
[normal]telehealth
[normal]/medicine) is important. The development of national eligibility criteria is not likely to change this much if it is set at a high level.
[normal]3. [bold]The readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the community[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 
[normal]The 
[normal]NHS and social care services has insufficient capacity and focus to treat people with long terms conditions adequately. 
[normal]The numbers of people with long term conditions is rising due to life style issues as well as a result of people living longer. 
[normal]In addition the breadth of conditions that are now seen as long term conditions is also increasing. 
[normal]Health and social services are at risk of becoming overwhelmed by the growth in demand for care. 
[normal]The impact of this is increased emergency admissions into 
[normal]hospitals and into Emergency Departments.
[normal] 
[normal]Primary care is not currently set up to deal with this. The focus is on treatment of illness rather than rigorous risk screening, preventions and support for self management of long terms conditions
[normal] outside of hospitals
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Integrated care planning that takes a personalised approach, and looks to the longer term as health needs are likely to increase is essential. This requires good local arrangements on shared information and joint working across health and social care
[normal].
[normal]4. [bold]The practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditions[bold] [bold]4.1 
[normal]We believe that there are design models available and it is important that commissioners are able to ensure providers comply with the model. 
[normal]We suggest that
[normal] it would be most appropriate for the commissioners to
[normal] focus on the provision of services from the ‘consumers’ perspective.
[normal] 
[normal]5. [bold]The ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual[bold] 
[normal]conditions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]More care is likely to be provided outside hospitals and care homes in the future. Primary care is best place to deal with people with multi-morbidities. 
[normal]Staff can play a big role in assisting people to manage their conditions in the community and to try and improve their lifestyles where this is a factor. This requires a less tasked based and more personalised approach to care and support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]However there are also challenges in the community as an increasing proportion of care will be delivered through unregulated services organised by people themselves. This raises questions about assuring the safety and quality of that support and the need for sector-led standards for care that are not reliant on a statutory regulator.
[normal]5.3 
[normal]The increase specialisation in hospitals leads to fragmentation of holistic care. Doctors and nurses increasingly specialise and therefore find it more of a challenge to care for elderly people with several different conditions. Staff skills will be increasingly stretched by the complex needs of increasing numbers of people with long term conditions living into old age. Links to specialist advice and support as well as continued investment in training will therefore be even more essential.
[normal]6. [bold]Obesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addressed[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 
[normal]Obesity should
[normal] not 
[normal]be 
[normal]an issue for the NHS to tackle. The numbers are too large. 25% of all adults in 
[normal]Reading
[normal] for example are clinically obese (
[normal]bmi
[normal] 30+). The NHS can't treat that number of new patients even if it wanted to. This has to be tackled by the government through taxation, information
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and education.
[normal]7. [bold]Current examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.1 
[normal]The effective management in the community of long-term conditions requires an integrated approach. NICE standards should be a starting point but relatively few cover both health and social care. A piece of work has just been completed on mental well-being for older people in care homes and ones are planned on older people with long-term conditions and on transition between health and social care. Whilst the development of more joint standards will be a big step forward, and may influence our inspection methodology, it will not transform services overnight. There needs to be a strong push from NHS England and ADASS/LGA to embed these standards and to provide the investment, planning, commissioning and training to achieve them.
[normal]8. [bold]The implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demand[bold] [bold]8.1 
[normal]Age is a major determinant of prevalence of LTC and co
[normal]-
[normal]morbidity increases with years. The distribution formulae for funding in NHS and Councils need to urgently reflect this more accurately.
[normal] 
[normal]There are also issues of sufficiency of staff with the necessary skills to meet future demand
[normal].
