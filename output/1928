[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.0 I first cycled in the Netherlands more than 20 years ago and apart from the first-class infrastructure for cyclists I was amazed at the efficiency of Dutch level crossings, mainly because of the speed of the open-closed-open sequence when compared with
[normal] the UK. I later found that this system is widespread on the Continent. Back in the UK I was disappointed to see that our crossing sequences appear to owe more to Victorian times than computer technology. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 I am also concerned that UK crossings are bei
[normal]ng closed regardless of inconvenience to cyclists/walkers and any increased risks to people displaced from a regular route. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 Research should be carried out so that new rail bridges and underpasses, which should replace crossings, are more suitable for
[normal] cyclists. They should also maximise subjective safety (ie, how safe a person feels).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 Planning authorities should also take better note of railway infrastructure so that current crossings, underpasses, bridges are a focus rather than an afterthought i
[normal]n their developments, which would encourage greater use of sustainable transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]About me[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0 I am chairman of Colchester Cycling Campaign (CCC), which supports utility cycling,  and also the North Essex representative of the Right to Ride group of CTC 
[normal]the cycling charity; I am involved with Sustrans, the healthy journeys charity. I work as a freelance journalist.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 In the area where I live, all road users are frequently held up at level crossings in the Colchester area, notably at East Gates, Hythe S
[normal]tation Road, Manningtree and Chitts Hill. Note that the crossing at Hythe Station Road is a particularly dangerous one despite it being lightly trafficked; there has been at least one fatality in the last five years and possibly several near misses. We hav
[normal]e also had issues with the closure of the cycle part of a cycle and pedestrian crossing (on private land) from the Wivenhoe Trail to Essex University.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Crossing issues[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0 Following various deaths at crossings over the years, I believe that the longer wai
[normal]ting times at UK crossings exacerbate some people’s impatience and increase risk-taking, which leads to people being hit by trains. I recommend that the committee seeks advice from an expert in human behaviour to find if this is the case. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 As an examp
[normal]le of what happens on the Continent I asked my friend Mark Wagenbuur to film a Dutch level crossing and also to time the open-closed-open sequence over the course of an hour. His video is at 
[normal]http://ww
[normal]w.youtube.com/watch?v=BTlUskj8aDg
[normal] and the crossing is in 's-Hertogenbosch 
[normal]at 
[normal]http://goo.gl/maps/LFVt7
[normal]. The red marking shows the only level crossing in the municipality while the blue markings show grade-separate
[normal]d crossings. Mr Wagenbuur says that the crossing closes for 12 trains an hour and is shut for a total of nearly 15min in every hour. The road is closed for an average of 66 seconds for each train; I would be interested to see how this compares with the UK 
[normal]for a similar urban, electrified, double-track stretch of railway; the crossing at Cosham, Hants, may be similar.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 I understand that UK railways rely on a system of a fixed point of detection — a bang-in point — that does not account for the speed of 
[normal]individual trains. A 100mph express can arrive within 20 seconds of the crossing closing, but a slower train, or one leaving an intermediate station, can take far longer to travel between the bang-in point and the crossing. For instance, the barriers at Co
[normal]sham were down for the entire time that a train was stopped at Cosham station.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 Mr Wagenbuur also notes that Dutch railways are eliminating level crossings on safety grounds and replacing them with bridges and subways. The process began several years a
[normal]go when railways were raised on embankments to allow subways to be level with their surroundings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mr Wagenbuur’s fellow campaigner, David Hembrow, reported four years ago on an initiative that made available €117 million to build extra railway underpasses
[normal]. His report is at 
[normal]http://bit.ly/1aouweZ
[normal]. This government money could be used for only a quarter of the cost of each tunnel, but 150 to 200 new underpasses were built. Mr Hembrow says that new tunnels are commonly buil
[normal]t as part of constructing or modernising a station. One example, at a minor station in Groningen, is shown briefly at the end of this short video:
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The videos produced by Mr Wagenbuur and Mr Hembr
[normal]ow are of great use to anyone wanting to see how a cycle-friendly country provides for utility cyclists, and I would recommend them to the DfT and Network Rail (NR) to see whether they can improve the solutions they offer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 The delays experienced at UK
[normal] crossings, especially in urban areas (East Gates, Colchester), also increases traffic congestion, affecting all drivers, buses, cyclists and pedestrians. Any action that could reduce such delay should be welcomed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 It should also be noted that long cr
[normal]ossing delays have disrupted crucial infrastructure projects, notably the Airtrack project at Heathrow, which was shelved because of perceived disruption to road traffic. Further information

[normal]P[bold]ersonal experience[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0 My personal experience of negotiating with NR over crossings has been in 
[normal]relation to Motts Lane, Witham (4.1), where a bridge is planned to replace a foot/cycle crossing, and Wivenhoe Trail/University of Essex (4.2) where this summ
[normal]er a foot/cycle crossing was closed to cyclists without consultation. Fifteen years ago, I was involved in securing a cycle/foot bridge between new development at University Quays, Colchester, (4.3) and the nascent University Research Park. Also, I have be
[normal]en involved in trying to improve a subway between Axial Way, Colchester, and Charter Wood (4.4).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 Motts Lane: Other people in the cycling community have taken over work on this crossing. Even though it is a bridleway, the replacement bridge, drawing be
[normal]low, is not cycleable. The shared path on the bridge is too narrow and the 180-degree corners are too sharp. Note that to attract cyclists, journeys have to be efficient: if people have to hop on and off a bike for short sections, they won't bother to cycl
[normal]e. The idea for this bridge may be a stock NR plan  as a similar bridge has been built in Chichester, Sussex. The latest information I have is that an inspector has refused to endorse the extinguishment of the Motts Lane bridleway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 University crossing
[normal]: In June this year, NR took a sudden decision to close to cyclists the foot/cycle crossing between the Wivenhoe Trail (an offroad riverside route that connects the towns 
[normal]of Wivenhoe and Colchester) and Essex University. This is apparently on a private pat
[normal]h but has been used for at least 20 years by cyclists accessing the university. There was no attempt at consultation. Many cycle commuters had to find another route to work. The move was made “on safety grounds”, but NR did not consider that cyclists would
[normal] instead have to use a busy 60mph road, placing them in greater subjective and actual danger. For several weeks cyclists were lifting their bikes over the barriers erected by NR, possibly providing a good conductor for the 25,000v overhead wires. To our kn
[normal]owledge there were no incidents that led to the move; NR did say the crossing gate had been left open occasionally, but all regular users say they have never seen that happen. NR has now offered to install a kissing gate at this site, but I do not believe 
[normal]this will be suitable for either disabled people or cyclists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 The University Quays bridge: This bridge was erected under a s106 as part of a planning application about 15 years ago. As a voluntary organisation, we successfully campaigned for a cycle/f
[normal]oot bridge and, in our naivety, expected the authorities to build a structure similar to those in the Netherlands. Unfortunately it was built with five sharp corners and ramps on each side, with the main bridge being only just wide enough for shared use. T
[normal]he south side has barriers that stop through-cycling; the north side is rideable although the university has put up “no cycling” signs, presumably on safety grounds. We hope to get the bridge altered through s106 money from neighbouring planning permission
[normal]s, but this wouldn’t have been necessary if it had been built properly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 The Axial Way underpass: This goes beneath the goods yard near Colchester North station. CCC asked Colchester and Essex councils for it to be improved for cyclists and walkers as 
[normal]part of a nearby 500-home housing development on the site of the former Woods of Colchester factory. 
[normal]While the underpass was improved -- with painting, lighting and new steps -- more should have been done to make it feel safer and to encourage its use by 
[normal]people on bikes and foot. Unfortunately, the entrance to the path is still hidden (rather than being a feature), and the steps are turned on two flights, which makes it impossible to see from one end of the tunnel to the other.
[normal]Had the developer, in conjun
[normal]ction with Colchester Council and NR, widened the entrance and provided a slope on the northern side, the tunnel could have been used more as a short-cut to Colchester town centre and nearby school and colleges. It would be worthwhile NR conducting a surve
[normal]y of crossing points such as this to identify how they can be incorporated in housing developments and cycle routes to help to increase the take-up of green transport, especially as a way of accessing stations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.0 OTHER POINTS
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 Work carried out by NR on new and existing railways should include “cycle-proofing” — acknowledging that the railway can create a barrier to walkers and cyclists, along with a promise to correct historic problems. This should apply to all points where 
[normal]the railway meets the public highway and other paths, including off-road paths. Cycle-proofing was recently included in 
[normal]Action for Roads, a Network for the 21st Century
[normal], published by the Department for Transport. Where appropriate, new rail investment shou
[normal]ld include making even greater provision for cycling as a form of transport. This should include improving access to railway stations, and improving access across railway land (either by retaining and improving crossing points/bridges/subways or building n
[normal]ew ones).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cycle-proofing would include directing NR to compare the safety gains made from closing a level crossing against any increased risks, from any source, to cyclists and pedestrians having to use an alternative route. In the event that a crossing i
[normal]s closed, cycle-proofing would mean that NR should provide an alternative crossing within 300m that is safe, convenient, usable by all, and with high quality integration into the existing cycle network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 I showed a draft of this report to Mags Hobby, a
[normal]n Essex representative of the Ramblers Association. She made the point that a closure causing a diversion of as little as 400 metres could, in some situations, lead to people using a car instead of cycling or walking.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3 I mentioned in the introduction 
[normal]the need to maximise subjective safety. One way of doing this is to build subways far broader than they need to be and position the approaches and ramps so that a user (on bike or foot) can see right through the subway as they approach. As well as encourag
[normal]ing more users, such a layout helps to offset the perceived threat from youths and others loitering in the area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4 Since starting to write this report, Fietsberaad, the Dutch national cycling organisation, has highlighted that it is no longer necessary 
[normal]for cyclists to cross at right angles to a railway track. New rubber inserts fixed to the railway, allow riders to cross at an oblique angle. NR may already be aware of this, but I pass it on just in case. Details at

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6 CONCLUSION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.0 I would urge the committee to look at how the UK system regarding crossing timings differs from practice on the Continent, and consider adopting some of the systems used in other countries to increase safety and redu
[normal]ce traffic congestion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 A special fund should be made available to NR to use to create better underpasses and bridges for cyclists and pedestrians on key routes. With a 25:75 funding mix (the three-quarter share coming from local councils and other sou
[normal]rces), such schemes would attract publicity and help to ensure community support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 Cycle-proofing should be adopted by NR across its network
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 The Wivenhoe Trail experience raises the question of how to contrast differing forms of risk. With this cr
[normal]ossing closed, displaced cyclists are probably in far greater danger on the road. While NR has resolved its own responsibility for health and safety there is a wider issue of government agencies’ responsibility for the overall safety of the public. It also
[normal] highlights the “acceptability” of casualties: these are minimal on the railway but still at a comparably high level on the road (despite face-value statistics, better road safety has been achieved partly by scaring would-be pedestrians and cyclists into c
[normal]ars. It is ironic that the government is now promoting “active travel” which may see an increase in casualties unless effective action is take to provide top-quality cycling infrastructure as well as road justice for victims of collisions). Cycle-proofing 
[normal]would help to address these issues
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 The case of the University Quays bridge shows the need to learn from continental practice — and absorb the smallest details — when trying to cater for cyclists. It looks like similar errors (sharp angles that cannot 
[normal]be cycled) are being made in planning for the Motts Lane bridge.
