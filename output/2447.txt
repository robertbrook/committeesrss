[[[Trade]]]&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) in the UK, which was established in 1974, works to end the international arms trade, which has a devastating impact on human rights and security, and damages economic development. CAAT believes that large scale military procurement and arms exports only reinforce a militaristic approach to international problems. &#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission looks at Government priorities and arms export promotion; export licensing transparency; the arms trade treaty; and the work of your Committees.&#xa0;

[[[rights]]]3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAAT is pleased that, in your July 2013 report, your Committees reiterated the point made in 2012, namely that "the Government would do well to acknowledge that there is an inherent conflict between strongly promoting arms exports to authoritarian regimes whilst strongly criticising their lack of human rights at the same time rather than claiming, as the Government continues to do, that these two policies 'are mutually reinforcing'." Such an acknowledgement is vital for public discussion about arms exports.&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also essential, for an informed debate about military exports, that the Government acknowledges your Committees' point "that it is fundamentally anomalous, not least in terms of public perceptions, for countries listed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as being of human rights concerns, such as Libya and Saudi Arabia, then to be listed by the United Kingdom Trade and Investment Organisation within the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as Priority Markets for arms exports."&#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UK military exports have aircraft at their heart. Leaving aside the use of UK-supplied aircraft by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, it has been argued that aircraft do not violate human rights. However, the very sale of such top-of-the-range military equipment gives support and prestige to authoritarian regimes. The aircraft often form part of a package which necessitates a long-term relationship between that regime, the supplying company and the UK government. This makes it difficult for the latter to raise issues regarding human rights or to refuse export licences for other equipment.&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Through their actions, successive UK governments have made it clear that arms sales take precedence and that human rights advocacy is muted. The Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index for 2012 ranks Saudi Arabia at 163 out of 167, meaning that there are only four more authoritarian regimes in the world. However, the quest for arms deals leaves the UK government reluctant to do anything to upset the Saudi authorities. Far from giving the UK influence over human rights in Saudi Arabia, arms deals give the power to the prospective purchaser.&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said the UK Embassy in Riyadh had been informed on 13th March 2011 that UK-made armoured vehicles would be going into Bahrain and the Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud had called the UK Foreign Secretary William Hague on the same day (FCO FoI response, 28.6.13). The next day the Saudi forces entered Bahrain to guard the infrastructure, freeing the Bahraini security forces to suppress pro-democracy protesters. There is no indication that William Hague remonstrated with Prince Saudi about this; indeed, an export licence for Tacttica components was issued on 10th June 2011, while Saudi forces remained in Bahrain (BIS FoI response, 12.9.12).&#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The exception to this general rule is that, to Saudi displeasure, the UK government has not armed the Syrian rebels, nor has it taken military action against the Syrian government. However, in both cases it was the UK Parliament that prevented the UK government from acting in the way the Saudi authorities would have wished. This did not prevent former UK Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Sir William Patey, warning of the possible impact on future trade: "It's difficult to pin it on a particular contract but from a Saudi point of view, our unwillingness to live up to our brave words would cause them to maybe doubt our reliability as an ally ...". (Daily Telegraph, 2.9.13)&#xa0;Prime Ministerial sales effort9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government claims to have tough export criteria, but many people are, rightly, sceptical when they see Prime Ministerial arms sales trips to some of the world's most repressive regimes. David Cameron's November 2012 visit to Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to promote the Eurofighter Typhoon is an example of this. &#xa0;10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; That promotional trip was remarkable as the media consensus in favour of arms sales, at least to human rights violators, appeared to break down. In contrast to the times when Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair made similar visits, this trip was questioned. On 5th November 2012 The Guardian editorial said the Prime Minister should admit that the interests of the military-industrial complex were taking precedence over human rights, while the Daily Telegraph headlined its article: "David Cameron defends arms deals with Gulf states". &#xa0;11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In yet another demonstration of his eagerness to promote the Eurofighter Typhoon, David Cameron welcomed Bahrain's autocratic ruler King Hamad to Downing Street on 7th August 2013. The King expressed his thanks for the UK's "supportive stances" towards Bahrain and indicated his eagerness to buy a fleet of Eurofighter Typhoon jets. In turn, David Cameron pledged continued support for “ongoing political reform in Bahrain”. On the same day, the King issued new decrees banning protests.&#xa0;12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Arms sales are put before regional peace

[[[.]]] Defence Secretary Philip Hammond thinks increased military expenditure in Asia is “worrying”: “(It) has the potential to escalate and become at best a prolonged source for instability and at worst, a driver for conflict,” he said. (AFP, 2.6.13) However, these worries did not prevent a business delegation to India in February 2013, led by David Cameron and including representatives of arms companies, among them BAE, EADS UK, Thales UK, Cobham and Ultra Electronics. &#xa0;Royal assistance13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Gulf royal families like to be associated with UK royalty, so the latter are used to support the arms sales effort. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Saudi Arabia in March 2013 with military and commercial links high on the agenda. Later, from 30th April to 1st May 2013, the ruler of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa, was welcomed by the Queen on a state visit to the UK. BAE's Chief Executive Ian King was a guest at the lunch for the Sheikh at Windsor Castle. In September 2013, Prince Andrew met with King Hamad of Bahrain in London. &#xa0;

[[[invites]]]14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK's biggest arms fair, Defence &amp; Security Equipment international (DSEi) took place in London's Docklands from 10th to 14th September 2013. DSEi is organised by Clarion Events, a private company, but the UK government, through the United Kingdom Trade and Investment Defence and Security Organisation (UKTI DSO), co-ordinates the presence of Ministry of Defence (MoD) and military representatives as well as inviting international delegations.&#xa0;15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Nine of the UK government invitees to DSEi 2013 are also on the FCO list of countries with the most serious wide-ranging human rights concerns. These are Afghanistan, Colombia, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Two others, Israel and Russia, had pavilions to display their wares. The invitation list also included Algeria, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were new to the list in 2013 while Libya was back, having been omitted from the 2011 invitations. As the UK government condemned the terrible violence in Syria,  it invited other brutal dictators to an arms fair.&#xa0;16.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 1,400 companies exhibiting at DSEi came from around the world, including Rostec (Russian Technology State Corporation). Rostec owns 100% of Rosoboronexport, the Russian state agency which supplies the equipment to Syria's President Assad. The 30,000 DSEi visitors from around the globe could trade freely, begin discussions on new deals or seal those mooted beforehand. In many cases, the equipment involved in the deals done or discussed at DSEi does not enter the UK, so  even UK export regulations do not apply.

[[[&#xa0;]]]17.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAAT is also concerned about the late publication of the DSEi invitation list. Business Minister Michael Fallon said the list would be placed on the UKTI website "when the exhibition opens." (Hansard, 20.5.13, col 619w)&#xa0;18.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although there had been no consistent pattern regarding the date of the release of DSEi invitation lists, previously it has usually been before the start of the exhibition. In 2009 the list was released two months in advance and included many delegates' names.  In 2011, although the full list was not available until the start of DSEi, a partial list of those not from the volatile (and potentially embarassing to the UK government) countries was published at the beginning of June. &#xa0;19.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disappointed the 2009 timetable had not been followed this time, CAAT wrote to the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, on 13th June 2013. In his response on 13th August 2013, he said that the invitations were not all issued at the same time: "Publishing details of countries invited in a piecemeal fashion risks causing offence to those countries who have not been invited at a particular point in time, and who may in fact be due to receive an invitation. It also risk offending countries that we may have planned to invite, but subsequently decide not to." CAAT wonders if the real reason for the delay is that the Government is an attempt to avoid the outcry the invitation list has caused previously. &#xa0;20.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To allow an informed debate about the delegations invited, it is essential that the UK  government shows a commitment to greater transparency by making the invitation lists available at least one, and preferably two, months in advance of all military and security exhibitions where delegations are invited by UKTI DSO. &#xa0;Ongoing support from the UKTI Defence and Security Organisation 21.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UKTI DSO's 150 civil servants promote military and security equipment sales around the world, working on behalf of private arms companies, but paid for by the UK taxpayer. Reflecting the huge and disproportionate support given to arms companies, UKTI employs more civil servants to sell military and security equipment than it provides for sector specific support for every other

[[[ ]]]industry sector combined.  Since 2012, companies have also received assistance from the MoD's Defence Export Support Group. &#xa0;22.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While Prime Ministerial visits and the major arms fairs are in the public eye, much of UKTI DSO's work takes behind the scenes, arranging contacts and smaller scale visits. For instance, despite continuing security problems in Libya, on 3rd April 2013 UKTI DSO organised a "Defence and Security Industry Day" in Tripoli aboard the Royal Navy frigate HMS Kent. Eleven companies were there including Babcock International, BAE, General Dynamics, Thales and Ultra (Hansard, 19.3.13 plus update). &#xa0;23.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are very many meetings. One example was on 29th April 2013, when

[[[ ]]]UKTI DSO Head Richard Paniguian and UK Defence Attaché Commodore Christopher Murray met with the Bahrain Minister for Defence Affairs, in Manama to discuss “bilateral military cooperation”. (Bahrain News Agency, 29.4.13)&#xa0;24.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no economic justification for such support: arms sales account for just 1.2 % of UK exports and sustain just 0.2% of the national labour force.  As the International Economy Editor  of the Financial Times said in August 2010: "You can have as many arms export jobs as you are prepared to waste public money subsidising." &#xa0;Institutionalised support for sales to Saudi Arabia25.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Large contracts between UK companies and Saudi Arabia are overseen by the UK MoD. The Ministry of Defence Saudi Armed Forces Project (MODSAP) covers the Saudi British Defence Co-operation Programme, formerly known as Al Yamamah (sale of Tornado, Hawk and PC-9 aircraft to the Royal Saudi Air Force) and the Al Salam programme (sale of Eurofighter Typhoons to the Royal Saudi Air Force). The Saudi Arabia National Guard Communications Project (SANGCOM) looks after the eponymous project. &#xa0;26.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although its approximately 200 staff are UK civil servants and military personnel Saudi Arabia pays for MODSAP,  £36.72 million in 2012/3. &#xa0;27.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is only in recent months that CAAT has fully understand that the costs of SANGCOM are met in the same way, being paid for by the UK MoD in the first instance and then recouped from the Saudi Arabian government. CAAT has been told that

[[[ ]]]a clause in the Memorandum of Understanding covering this deal, unlike that for MODSAP, prevents the disclosure of the costs. However, as at 1st April 2012, one MoD civil servant based in the UK worked on SANGCOM as did 20 UK military personnel and 50 UK MoD civil servants in Saudi Arabia. (Hansard, 19.12.12 col 837w) &#xa0;28.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The arrangements give a country that the FCO considers to be of human rights concern, and BAE, a private company, a centre of influence within the UK MoD establishment.&#xa0;Suspension of export licensing process 29.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In July 2013, following the ousting of President Morsi and the establishment of military rule in Egypt, CAAT contacted the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to ask if the new mechanism announced in 2012 suspending the export licence process had been used. In reply, the ECO said it had not been, but that it had been considered in 2012 in relation to Mali, Ethiopia, Syria, the Maldives, Egypt and Israel and, earlier in 2013, Egypt. It was said that any use of the mechanism would be announced to parliament.&#xa0;30.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 21st August 2013 the mechanism was used with respect to Egypt, but only for equipment which might be used for internal repression. Since it should be expected that any such goods would have, in any event, have been refused an export licence, this does not appear to reflect any change in export control policy. &#xa0;31.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a need to clarify the purpose of the suspension mechanism, one of the main responses of the Government to the failings in the export licensing system exposed by what was then known as the "Arab Spring". If the suspension mechanism just means that the processing of individual licence applications is suspended on a case-by-case basis, this would be a retrograde step from the refusal of export licence applications on a case-by-case basis.

[[[transparency]]]32.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAAT welcomed much in the July 2012 Government Response to the BIS Transparency in Export Licensing Consultation, but said at that time that a lot depended on how the changes were implemented. &#xa0;33.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It was with considerable dismay, therefore, that CAAT read the Notice to Exporters 2013/18 issued on 31st July 2013 with regard to Open Licences. This represented a major step back from the greater transparency promised by Vince Cable, and is not in line with the July 2012 Response. If the published information is not to include ratings / goods description nor, it appears, the value, it is almost meaningless, especially as Open Licences often cover an extremely wide range of equipment.&#xa0;34.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is unclear what prompted the about turn. In answer to a parliamentary question Michael Fallon said it was the "need to strike a proper balance between increased transparency and the need to minimise administrative burdens on business." (Hansard, 6.9.13, col 533w) However, the Export Group for Aerospace and Defence (EGAD), in its submission to the Committees' last report, quoted a company responding to the Consultation: "If summary information for goods comprising destination/ rating and the number of shipments and total value was provided this could probably be achieved within current resources." EGAD appeared to have no problem with the provision of the data as long as it could be provided simply. Indeed, the companies must collect and retain the data as a condition of the Open Licences. &#xa0;35.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The speed of the about turn on transparency was also strange, as was the way it was slipped out. On 1st July 2013 the Notice to Exporters 2013/15 indicated that the Open Licence transparency measures would be going ahead, albeit slightly later than planned. Yet just over two weeks later, it seems that major changes had been made. CAAT had not understood Vince Cable's answer to Sir Bob Russell MP's question (Hansard, 18.7.13, col 1295) as being an announcement to Parliament on the open licensing generally. It seems highly likely that many MPs would not have realised this was an announcement either.&#xa0;36.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If BIS undertook further consultations with industry, or received representations from companies, it should, in fairness, have contacted all those who responded to the original Consultation so that their views might be taken into account before the Government made a decision contrary to its previous announcement.&#xa0;37.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also unclear what is happening with regards to the provision of additional and disaggregated information on the Single Licences. There was correspondence between CAAT and Michael Fallon earlier in 2013 regarding CAAT concerns that less, rather than more, information might be provided than at present. &#xa0;38.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The export licence browser

[[[ ]]]on CAAT's website uses the ECO data, but is comprehensively searchable and provides itemised licences with ratings, values and the precise date on which the licence was approved, refused or revoked. The full raw data is also available from the CAAT website as .csv files for download. BIS had appeared  reluctant to acknowledge that in a large proportion of cases, disaggregating the  data to the daily level, equates to providing information about individual licences. The data should be available to all and not depend on CAAT producing a usable browser.&#xa0;39.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 6th August 2013 CAAT wrote to Michael Fallon about this, urging him to think again about the Open Licences and asking what is happenning regarding the Single Licence information. At the time of writing this submission, a reply to the letter is still awaited.

[[[difference]]]40.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAAT has always been sceptical about an arms trade treaty. These doubts appeared justified when  William Hague told the Foreign Affairs Committee on 16th July 2013 that, even if it became a signatory to the arms trade treaty, Russia would argue that it would be within its rights to supply the Assad regime with weapons and that would not change. Despite the treaty, it seems the UK will continue to enthusiastically

[[[ ]]]arm Saudi Arabia's authoritarian rulers while Russia's weapons supplies to Syria will continue unabated. &#xa0;

[[[ ]]]41.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAAT believes that the work of your Committees has had an immensely beneficial effect on the parliamentary, media and public discussion of arms trade issues. The Committees' detailed questioning, through letters and evidence sessions, of the Government has done much to hold it to account for its export policy and practice, as well as to illuminate the issue more generally.&#xa0;42.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAAT believes your Committees' work could be further enhanced by varying

[[[ ]]]the civil society organisations and industry representatives invited to give oral evidence each year, so that a wider range of views and perspectives might be heard. It appears that the UK Working Group on Arms may be perceived to reflect the whole civil society sector working on these issues when it does not. CAAT, which has made a written submission to the Committees every year, has never been asked to give oral evidence. There are others working on arms export issues too.&#xa0;43.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Likewise, on the industry side, oral evidence is usually given

[[[ ]]]by

[[[ ]]]representatives of the&#xa0;EGAD plus a consultant or two. While they do not submit written evidence, CAAT would suggest that staff from the export licensing departments of some of the bigger exporters of military goods, such as BAE Systems or Chemring, might provide a useful additional perspective if they were asked to appear before your Committees for the industry session in some years.&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
