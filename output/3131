defaultWritten submission from CRH Electrical Solutions default&#xa0;
defaultI have been watching the video of the meeting of the 2nd September and I can only add how completely ridiculous the current situation is.
defaultUnder Gas Safe there is a single scheme with assessments 
defaultevery 4 or 5 years.
defaultUnder “electrical” safety there are several schemes and all of which require annual assessments, plus the annual charges are far too high.
defaultAll we want is a single body, no profit making, presenting a single voice to the homeowners and s
defaultparkys.
defaultPlease, please, please curb the stupidity of the current situation.
