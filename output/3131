[normal]Written submission from CRH Electrical Solutions [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I have been watching the video of the meeting of the 2nd September and I can only add how completely ridiculous the current situation is.
[normal]Under Gas Safe there is a single scheme with assessments 
[normal]every 4 or 5 years.
[normal]Under “electrical” safety there are several schemes and all of which require annual assessments, plus the annual charges are far too high.
[normal]All we want is a single body, no profit making, presenting a single voice to the homeowners and s
[normal]parkys.
[normal]Please, please, please curb the stupidity of the current situation.
