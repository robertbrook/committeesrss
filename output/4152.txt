[[[Written evidence submitted by Phonographic Performance Limited t/a PPL [FBB0060]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0; PPL is the UK-based music licensing company which licenses recorded music to be played in public or broadcast (including certain online uses). Established in 1934, PPL carries out this role on behalf of over 10,000 record company and 65,000 performer members, the majority of which are small businesses or sole traders. PPL generated revenue of over £170m in 2012.1.2.&#xa0; PPL’s broadcast and online licensing covers the use of recorded music on the BBC’s television, radio and iPlayer services and by hundreds of commercial broadcasters. These include ITV, Channel 4, Five and BSkyB, together with services such as Virgin Media and BT Vision. These licences often cover a range of new media uses of recorded music in addition to “traditional” broadcasts. PPL also licenses commercial radio networks such as Capital, Heart and Absolute Radio, online services such as Last.fm, and community, hospital, student and prison radio stations.1.3.&#xa0; As regards the BBC, the licence granted by PPL provides the BBC with the right to include recorded music controlled by PPL’s members within the wide range of services operated by the BBC, including its radio and television broadcasts and digital services such as the BBC iPlayer. PPL also licenses BBC Worldwide for various uses of recorded music.  1.4.&#xa0; PPL welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Inquiry.  PPL notes the remit of the Inquiry and the questions set out in the Inquiry’s call for evidence. Many of the topics covered by the call for evidence are matters in respect of which, given its role as a music licensing company, PPL is not best placed to comment.1.5.&#xa0; However, PPL can offer evidence in the form of its experiences of licensing the BBC (and BBC Worldwide) over many years, particularly with regard to those aspects of the call for evidence which focus on the public purposes set out in the current Charter. PPL hopes that the information it is able to provide will be of some assistance to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee as it considers further the matters covered by the Inquiry.

[[[For ease of reference, PPL’s comments below are pres]]]

[[[ented under the headings of ]]]

[[[public purposes from the current Charter]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0; In PPL’s experience, the BBC generally makes use of a wider range of different sound recordings than equivalent commercial broadcasting services. 3.2.&#xa0; This is based on the reporting information provided by PPL’s broadcasting licensees.  In order to appropriately distribute royalties to its members, PPL requires its licensees to report details of the recordings that have been used under their licences, and the extent of such usage. PPL then pays its members based on this usage information (applying the same methodology whether the recording is owned by major record companies, independent labels or self-releasing artists).3.3.&#xa0; By way of example, 27,868 different unique recordings were played on BBC Radio 2 in 2012. This is significantly higher than the equivalent number on any commercial radio station in the same period, and can be compared to 1,375 unique recordings played on the Heart network of stations and 4,073 unique recordings played on the Magic network of stations. It is reasonable to assume that sourcing and selecting this larger range of recordings is likely to require investment of time and effort that is unlikely to be recreated by a service operating in the commercial sector. 3.4.&#xa0; The BBC is also a member of PPL in its role as the owner of a substantial amount of commercial music. New music commissioned by the BBC adds to the world-leading UK repertoire of music, particularly in the classical genre. 4.1.&#xa0; The UK is a net exporter of recorded music, adding to the UK’s balance of trade and helping to promote the UK and British culture in a wider sense. By way of example, in 2012, UK recordings made up 12% of the US recorded music market and four out of five of the top selling albums in the US were from UK artists.4.2.&#xa0; PPL licenses the BBC and/or BBC Worldwide for a number of international activities, which therefore form part of the revenue generated for PPL members by virtue of the popularity and consumption of UK recorded music around the world:(a)&#xa0;&#xa0; Simulcasting the World Service outside of the UK (BBC); (b)&#xa0;&#xa0; Inclusion of recorded music within BBC television and radio programmes released (i) as digital downloads-to-own (BBC) and (ii) for sale, rental or lending on DVDs and spoken-word CDs (BBC Worldwide);(c)&#xa0;&#xa0; Copying recorded music within radio and television programmes for the purpose of supplying those programmes for secondary use by other broadcasters; (d)&#xa0;&#xa0; Broadcasting recorded music within programming on the international television channels operated by BBC Worldwide. &#xa0;5.1.&#xa0; Collective licensing of rights in music and other creative content enables providers of new digital services to reduce transaction costs and invest in and operate their services with the confidence that rights have been cleared. In turn, this also delivers efficiencies and fair remuneration for creators and copyright owners and, ultimately, a greater range of legitimate services and content for consumers.5.2.&#xa0; The BBC has been an advocate of collective licensing for innovative digital services, such as the iPlayer. It has, on a number of occasions, been PPL’s first licensee in respect of new forms of exploitation, simply due to it being the first to offer those new services and/or to seek collective music rights clearance for them.  This has paved the way for the collective licensing of similar services operated by commercial providers.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
