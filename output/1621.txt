[[[ vehicles in National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am a very keen hill walker and have walked in most of our British National Parks for over 50 years. On many occasions I have seen at first hand the adverse effects that off road vehicles (4x4s motor bikes etc) have on green lanes and by-ways in these beautiful areas. They cause severe damage to these trails with deep ruts and in wet conditions large accumulation of mud. The noise from these vehicles destroys the peace and tranquillity too. More seriously unfortunately some vehicles are driven in an aggressive and dangerous manner which puts other users of these routes at risk of injury or worse (walkers cyclists and horse riders.)&#xa0;I urge the committee to recommend legislation to exclude off road vehicles from these trails lanes etc in our National Parks and AONBs&#xa0;&#xa0;Angela HiltonRetired Consultant Chest PhysicianChair Ramblers Trafford&#xa0;2 September 2013&#xa0;
