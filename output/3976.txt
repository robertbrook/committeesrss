[[[Written evidence submitted by the Welsh Language Commissioner (JRR 0036)]]]&#xa0;The Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to comment on the implications for access to justice of the Government's proposals to reform judicial review. This comment should be taken as evidence to assist the Joint Committee on Human Rights in scrutinising the Government's proposals in an area where meeting the needs of individuals, including their languages needs, is integral to the quality and effectiveness of services. &#xa0;The principal aim of the Commissioner is to promote and facilitate the use of Welsh. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organisations. This, in turn, will lead to the establishment of rights for Welsh speakers. &#xa0;Two principles underpin the Commissioner's work: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Persons in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium of the Welsh language if they choose to do so. In due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory Welsh language schemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh Language Act 1993.&#xa0;The role of the Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the freedom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints regarding the failure of organizations to meet standards. &#xa0;One of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinise Welsh language policy developments, acting as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh speakers in Wales. This evidence is provided to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in that capacity.&#xa0;The Commissioner’s comments, and the issues which the Joint Committee may wish to address, may be summarised as follows:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are many references in the Government's recommendations (Judicial Review: proposals for further reform) to assessing the impact of the proposed changes on various groups, as well as assessing the impact in accordance with the Ministry for Justice's duties under the Equality Act 2010. In terms of the Welsh language, there is no specific mention of it in the consultation documentation.

However, Welsh language provision in courts is often fragmented and arbitrary.
