"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Nicholas Zelle [FBB0017]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n              \n              \nThe BBC should be like the \nMonarchy :\n it needs to be an excellent, non political ambassador that represents and serves the whole nation. It should also present unbiased, honest and serious information, educate, inspire, uplift, and entertain the nation. \n2\n              \nThe BBC seems to be getting bigger, 'flabbier', less critical of itself, careless, arrogant\n,  and\n outrageously generous to itself with public money. The recent \nSavil\n scandal suggests the BBC can be sloppy and very evasive.\nThere are more TV and Radio cha\nnnels. The more channels there are, the more diluted the quality of the \nprogrammes\n becomes. But probably Radio and local radio are doing better than TV.  \nThere are excellent \nprogrammes\n but fewer of them. Many believe the BBC has been \ndumbing\n down. (We ha\nd a black and white TV with one channel - The BBC - I was allowed to stay up for 'The Cherry Orchard'. Now there are many channels with no \nprogrammes\n like the Cherry Orchard.) It seems everything now has to be 'popular' on all channels.  BBC 4 was planned \nas an 'Arts Channel'. But the 'arts' \nprogrammes\n have been watered down.  What is BBC 3 for? Reduce the hours broadcast and 'distill' the \nprogrammes\n into more powerful and potent offerings. \nOriginally, 'heats' were broadcast weekly of 'Young musician of t\nhe year'.  Now with more BBC channels, the whole competition is condensed into a couple of \nprogrammes\n (with much time given to what the competitors ate for \nbreakfast,\n and the like than their performances). Why?\nThe BBC News channel seems to compare badly \nwith Sky News, \nAlgezeera\n, France 24, and even CNN. The BBC must have the most extensive news network of any? Building themselves (at public expense) the grandest News studio in the world seems to have resulted in a less concise and less interesting station\n.(\nAnd why waste so much air time every 1/4 hour with the same trailer?)\nRecently on BBC News International, for 12 hours, the main items of International news (every 15 \nmins\n) were the stock market floatation of \n'Twitter' followed by the activities of the \nMayor of Toronto.  \nRadio 4 still seems to be excellent but even this station shows clear signs of \ndumbing\n down. One \nprogramme\n in \nparticular  -\n 'Dessert Island disks'. It was an interesting \nprogramme\n with a variety of people. Now most cast-\naways\n are 'cele\nbs', and the choice of discs has \ndumbed\n down dramatically. What a pity! \nThe changes at Radio 3 are a national, and even an international, calamity. This once great \nprogramme\n was the envy of musicians throughout the world. It has suffered more fundamental\nly than other stations. The excuse given: it needs to appeal to a larger audience. Why? The BBC now offers listeners several more Radio stations. Does anyone worry that the BBC Asian service is only listened to by a small proportion of the nation?  It is i\nllogical to dumb down this quality station. Instead, why not nurture new listeners on other stations - Radio 2 and Radio 4 - (Recently, Radio 3 presented 3 weeks of film music, and yet one of the nation's finest composers, was allocated a week-end in this,\n his centenary year!) The strategy has failed: fewer people listen to Radio 3 than ever before. This can only show that more former supporters are leaving than new listeners are joining. Does a second rate station attracting fewer listeners make sense?\nTh\ne latest listening figures show that the most \ndumbed\n down \nprogramme\n of all - the breakfast show on Radio 3 - lost 100,000 listeners in the last three month \nperiod :\n loosing 16% of its listeners in 3 months is a disaster. The experiment has failed. \nThe BB\nC, and its excellent orchestras, \nchampions\n modern music at the Proms as it should. It must be the most generous commissioner of new musical works in the world but does it use its financial clout wisely?  The vast majority of these performances are the prem\niers and also the \nderniers\n. Such a catalogue of total failures seems to be an extraordinary waste of public money.\nBBC Radio 3 is paranoid about the success of Classic FM. Why? Both \nprogrammes\n can be different and serve different members of society. \n(Woul\nd any one expect 'Simpson's-in-the-Strand' to add '\nbeefburgers\n and chips with mayo' to their menu to attract a larger number of clients?\n Or would anyone expect Oxford or Cambridge to offer 'Media studies' or the like, to attract more students? \nOf course no\nt.)\n  And yet \nalmost every change on Radio 3 is 'inspired' by Classic FM.\nIt seems that the BBC \nhave\n been poor at appointing staff. Year after year, rather \ncolourless\n executives seem to run the \norganisation\n. Appointees should have vision, personality, and \ncharacter to lead the various divisions. Does anyone at the BBC now have the vision, enthusiasm and inspiration of an Attenborough, or a Drummond? \nRecently, the new DG made a speech looking back at the quality of the BBC in the days of Lord Reith. Good n\news! But then a couple of weeks later we heard the 'Reith lectures' - given by a transvestite dressed in a farcical dress with orange shoes, and absurdly overdone 'make-up', who sadly seemed to have nothing of consequence to say, broadcast at 9.00am! Who i\ns the DG trying to kid?\n3\n              \n              \nYes. Surely far too many \nprogrammes\n do not relate in \nanyway\n to the high ideals of the Charter. \nImpartiality.\n  Many claim the BBC is politically biased. Probably the balance is not quite right.\n4\n              \n              \nThe BBC should have unlimited\n scope, scale and remit within their financial constraints.\n5\n              \n              \nWith several channels and stations, 'particular audiences' should be catered for. In the early days of TV, one single national station was able to cater for diverse national interests: excelle\nnt international and national news coverage, serious discussions, political debate, \nvisits\n to live theatre, opera, farce, satire, \nhumour\n, light entertainment, and many major sporting events. \n6\n              \n              \nWhat ever\n produces the best quality \nprogrammes\n at the best v\nalue for \nlicence\n fee \npayers.\n It is probably better to pay other (less profligate) \norganisations\n, to make as many \nprogrammes\n as possible for us.\n7\n              \n              \nThe BBC must have the largest collection of radio and TV archives in the world and as all these \nprogrammes\n h\nave been paid for by \nlicence\n fee payers, it would be wrong to charge the British public any more to continue to enjoy them.\n8\n              \n              \nIt would seem that the BBC is poor at spending money wisely on developing technology.\n9\n              \nThe BBC should be publicly funded but i\nt has grown too big, is out of control, and shows little concern for the way it spends public money.\n10\n              \nThere ought to be. But, does Channel 4 spend its public funds more wisely?\n11\n              \nThe arrangements in the UK, though not faultless, are infinitely prefera\nble to those in the US.\n12\n              \nThe BBC is too vast and unmanageable, and it has become careless and out of control. It lacks vision and focus. Like the NHS, it seems to be over managed and to be pointing in too many directions. It needs to aim at doing less, \nbut doing it more skillfully and enthusiastically. \nAnd with less public money.\n13\n              \nProbably not. Would a 5 yearly review be a possibility? As with parliament, if the governors are making a mess of things, it would be an improvement to be able to make signi\nficant changes every 5 years.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
