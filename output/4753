&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence from Jeff Farrardefault [CST0036]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultForce Crime Registrars- Note to the defaultPublic Administration Select Committeedefault&#xa0;defaultFCRs were introduced alongside the National Crime Recording Standard in 2002. Their duties vary across the country, but generally they conduct audits of crime, incidents and outcomes data and provide advice on these matters to officers and staff. Their role is to quality assure data, be the final arbiter with respect to disputes about the local interpretation of the Home Office Counting Rules and to act as the single point of contact between forces and the Home Office.

defaultAs I explained to the Committee, I have met with nearly every Regional FCR forum in England and Wales, and the inconsistent practices across forces with regards to their FCRs is striking. My recommendations to improve this consistency would be as follows;
default&#xa0;
default1. Accreditation- 
default              
defaultWhilst there has been national training in the past there is currently no training for newly appointed FCRs. Neither has there ever been any form of accreditation for FCRs. This is crucial for them to demonstrate their level of Professional competence and to allow Chief Officers to have confidence in the quality of advice they provide. The College of Policing are currently in the process of developing a training package which needs to be rolled out across the country.

default2. Relations with and access to Chief Officers- At present, there is marked disparity across the country with regard to the interactions FCRs have with their Chief Officers. There are some good examples where FCRs do have a close relationship and regular dialogue with their Chief Officers and I believe that this is central to ensuring Chief Officers have an unambiguous understanding of any data integrity issues in their force.  FCRs should be seen as enablers of integrity rather than just barriers to performance.
default&#xa0;
default3. Appropriate status- I believe FCRs need to be placed in the organisational structure in a way that gives them a status that demonstrates and supports the level of responsibility and expectations placed upon them. I accept that there are examples across the country where Inspectors, Sergeants or their Police Staff equivalents undertake FCR duties in an exemplary fashion. However, to better guarantee their independence and give them an appropriate standing in their forces, I believe that the FCR must carry the equivalent status of a superintending rank, either as a Police Officer or Police Staff equivalent, albeit with a recognition that they do not carry the full breadth of responsibilities that most officers of equivalent standing would carry. Forces should also ensure that whoever holds the post views their role as FCR as their primary responsibility, and not as ancillary to any other role or responsibility they hold.
