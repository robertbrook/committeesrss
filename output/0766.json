"Written evidence from The College of Optometrists (LTC 19)Summary&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThree long term conditions are responsible for most cases of sight loss in the UK: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAMD is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK.\n \nA recent study estimated that \n2.4% of people in the UK \naged 50\n \nyears or more had advanced wet AMD, increasing to 4.8% of those aged 65\n \nyears or more and 12.2% of those aged 80\n \nyears or more\n.\n \nSmokers are three times more likely to suffer AMD\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following table shows how the number of people with advanced AMD is predicted to rise\n \nby a third\n to 679,000 this decade\n (the middle line shows prevalence amongst women and the bottom line prevalence amongst men):\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiabetic retinopathy is the biggest cause of sight loss amongst pe\nople of working age in the UK.\n \nIt occurs when diabetes weakens the blood vessels in the eye.\n \nPeople with diabetes are 25 times more likely than the general population to become blind\n.\n \nDiabetes UK estimates that by 2025 there will be 5 million people in\n England \nwith diabetes\n and for each year someone lives with diabetes, their risk of retinopathy increases.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGlaucoma is estimated to affect about half a million people in England.\n \nThe prevalence of glaucoma rises steeply with advancing age.\n \nAfrican-Caribbean people are at particular risk.\n \nMore than half of those glaucoma cases are thought to be undetected\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government is committed to reducing preventable sight loss from these three long term conditions through an indicator in its \nPublic health outcomes framework\n.\n \nWe strongly support this.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSight loss has a major impact on people’s well being.\n \nSight is the sense people most fear losing.\n \nOver one-third of older people with sight loss are also living with depression\n. Two-thirds of registered blind and partially sighted people of working age are not in paid employment\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeople with a long term eye condition often have other health problems\n too\n.\n \nSight loss is associated with a heightened risk of falls and fractures\n and people with a long term eye condition\n often have \nother \nlong term condition\ns\n, such as dementia\n and diabetes.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is emerging evidence that eye care services are unable to meet current demand and will not meet rising demand in the future without significant improvements.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent survey found that half of all hospital eye units in England were unable to treat AMD patients within the recommended waiting times that would mini\nmise their risk of sight loss\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProfessor Sir Bruce Keogh\n’s\n \nevidence\n \nto the Health Select Committee in January t\nhat cataract \nsurgery\n was being rationed inappropriately by \nhalf of PCTs\n \nhighlighted\n the strain hospital eye units are under as they str\nuggle to meet existing demand, much of which is fuelled by long term conditions.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur recent report, \nBetter data, better care \nshowed how the NHS’ reliance on paper forms for payment and referrals hindered care and wasted valuable time and resources in the fight to prevent sight loss from long term eye conditions\n.\n \nThe failure to enable community and secondary care teams to share data is a major drag on the capacity of existing eye care services to meet demand now and in the future.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are examples of \ninnovation, which\n if properly implement\ned\n across the NHS, \nwould\n boost our capacity to meet the needs of people with long term eye conditions in the future.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTaking glaucoma care\n,\n for example, \nNICE recommends that patients at risk of glaucoma be monitored in t\nhe community by optometrists th\nrough ‘repeat measures’ schemes\n rather\n than\n in hospitals\n.\n \nMore advanced monitoring\n \nin the community\n (referral refinement)\n is also recommended by the College of Optometrists and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists\n.\n \nTogether, these schemes\n im\nprove \nglaucoma \npatients’ access to quality care by increas\ning\n the capacity of eye services.\n \nThey \nkeep less serious cases out of hospitals and take advantage of thousands of community optometrists already performing sight test\ns\n and \ncaring for patients \nin\n \nthe NHS.\n \nThey can also save significant amounts of money; NHS Evidence found that moving repeat measurement for glaucoma in \nto \nthe community \nin Bexley \nwas 62% cheaper than the equivalent hospital tariff\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo minimise sight loss from AMD, Gloucestershire has introduced a one stop shop model with integrated IT. Rather than assessing and treating patients over two visits, here assessment and treatment clinics run in parallel using non-consultant staff in particular nurse practitioners and optometrists. All clinical data is recorded electronically, allowing the consultant to make rapid treatment decisions for new and returning wet AMD patients using information on patient electronic medical records\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn most of England, we do not know the answer to simple questions like, how many patients are we\n treating for glaucoma or if at risk groups \nget their eyes examined.\n \nScotland has been particularly innovative \nin\n overcoming IT barriers \nby\n integrat\ning the electronic systems of\n community optometrists and hospitals eye unit \nto\n \nimprove access to \nbetter \nquality care and improve efficiency at the same time.\n \nFollowing a successful pilot, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that 95% of referrals from community optometrists to hospitals are done elect\nronically rather than in paper.\n \nPaper referrals are the \nnorm in most of England.\n \nMoving to e\nlectronic referral means community and hospital clinicians can share much more information about their patients over time with the aim \nof\n improv\ning\n the continuity of care, reduc\ning\n unnecessary referrals to the hospitals, improv\ning\n efficiency and improv\ning\n patient outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScotland is also working towards \nmaking \nprovider payment forms electronic\n.\n \nElectronic payment facilitates much better data collection about who is accessing eye care and how to design services that improve the care of populations with long term eye conditions.\n \nHowever, in England, most optometrists \nmust submit their payment forms, \nwhich include potentially valuable public health data, in paper form making it extremely difficult to analyse\n the data \nto\n improve eye health services\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf accomplished, the Governments push for a paperless NHS offers great potential to improve eye care for people with long term conditions.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe move to involve clinicians more closely in commissioning also offers potential to improve care.\n \nNHS England is introducing Local Eye Health Networks in to each local team area\n to bring together commissioners, community and hospital clinicians and patient groups to work together to assess local need and improve the quality and efficiency of eye health services for their local population.\n \nWe strongly recommend that commissioners take advantage of these networks and are supporting our members so they can contribute fully.\nMay 2013\n Department of Health (2012), Public Health Outcomes Framework\n&#xa0;\nHealthy\n liv\ne\ns, \nhealthy people: Improving outcomes and supporting transparency\n.\n \nAvailable from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-health-outcomes-framework-update\n O\nwen\n, C.G et al (2012) The estimated prevalence and incidence of late stage age related macular degeneration in the UK. \nBr J \nOphthalmol\n&#xa0;\n2012;96:5\n&#xa0;\n752-756\n&#xa0;\n \nCong, R. et al (2008).
