defaultWe understand that there will be no further public hearings by your committee on this subject. Following that decision, we would like to share with you some further evidence that we believe will assist you, particularly in the light of your questioning of Jan Prosser last Monday re the ORR's failure to prosecute NR over its negligence in the death of Jane Harding at Moreton on Lugg in 2010.
defaultYou may have been surprised by Mr Prosser's assertion that the ORR did not endorse NR's decision not to install automatic locking at the crossing. But the attached evidence from Peter Rayner, submitted on behalf of the defence at the trial in Birmingham Crown Court in April, makes clear he was merely drawing a distinction between approve and acquiesce.
defaultAs Peter makes clear, the ORR signed off on the 2007 flow chart which allowed NR to by-pass any formal decision not to install automatic locking. By agreeing such a schedule, the ORR green lighted a procedure which allowed NR not to instal automatic locking on financial grounds.
defaultMr Prosser was simply being disingenuous when he claimed to you he would have prosecuted NR if the Crown Prosecution Service had not done so. By providing cover for NR to make such a critical safety decision on costs grounds, the ORR had no moral standing to make such a prosecution.
defaultIf you wish to discuss the background to this case any further, please contact Peter directly. He would be more than willing to assist the committee as do we as the union which uncovered NR's duplicity and deceptions at Elsenham.
