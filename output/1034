defaultI am writing in response to the Committee's call for evidence. I have seen the evidence submitted to the Committee by The Howard League for Penal Reform in Scotland and would like to endorse the arguments made in their submission.

defaultAs you are aware, the debate about prisoner voting has recently surfaced in the context of the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill. That Bill also extends the franchise for the 2014 Referendum to 16-17 year-olds, which I welcome in the context of my long-standing support for a lower voting age in all elections. The question of prisoner’s eligibility to vote is thus relevant in terms of my remit under the Commissioner for Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2003.

defaultThe legal arguments, particularly those related to the European Convention on Human Rights, are well known and well-understood. In my view, The Howard League Scotland’s submission adds another valuable perspective to the wider debate, which points to the need to depart from the current UK policy on this matter.
