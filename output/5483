defaultBackground
default&#xa0;
default1. 
defaultThe British Marine Aggregate Producers Association (BMAPA) is the representative trade organisation for the British marine aggregate sector and a constituent body of the wider Mineral Products Association. The Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, m
defaultortar and silica sand industry
default. 
defaultBMAPA
default represents 11 member companies 
defaultof the MPA 
defaultwho collectively produce around 90% of the 20 million tonnes of marine sand and gravel dredged from licensed areas in the waters around 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default each year. 
default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultMarine dredged sand and gravel is principally used by the construction industry, and the marine contribution provides 20% of overall sand and gravel demand in 
defaultEngland
default, 35% of total construction aggregate demand in South East England and over 50% of construction aggregate demand in 
defaultLondon
default. In this respect, marine aggregate supplies play a key role in supporting the delivery of various Government policies. 
default3. 
defaultMarine dredged sand and gravel also provide a strategic role in supplying large scale coast defence and beach replenishment projects – over 25 million tonnes being used for this purpose since the mid 1990’s. With the growing threats posed by sea level rise and increased storminess, the use of marine sand and gravel for coast protection purposes will become increasingly important.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultIn the near future, marine sand and gravel resources can be expected to play a key role in supporting the successful delivery of major infrastructure projects associated with Government policies related to energy security and climate change, such as nuclear new builds, 
defaultgas storage facilities, 
defaulttidal power developments, port developments and offshore wind farms. The coastal location of many of these developments means that the sector is ideally placed to supply the large volumes of construction aggregate and fill material that will be required.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultIn all cases, the marine aggregate sector is dependant upon identifying and licensing economically viable sand and gravel deposits to secure sufficient reserves to maintain long term supply to existing and well established markets. The location of such deposits is extremely localised around the waters of 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, restricted to their geological distribution and their geographical position related to the markets location.

default7. 
defaultThe 
defaultdevelopment and provision of 
defaultnew controls to allow a network of 
defaultmarine protected areas
default of national nature conservation interest t
defaulto be designated and protected was fully 
defaultsupported
default by the British marine aggregate industry during the evolution of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (MACAA), as was
default the fact that the designations would have to take into account socio-economic interests
default. 
defaultThe rationale behind this 
defaultposition was that if marine industries
default know where marine sites of nature conservation significance are located in advance they can make more informed business decisions
default when planning their developments
default. This would encourage a more proactive approach to assessing impact, significance and r

default&#xa0;
default8. Representatives from the sector played a full and constructive part in all four of the regional Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) stakeholder projects that developed recommendations for the wider network of proposed sites. This included the provision of broad-scale mapping data from five Regional Environmental Characterisation projects funded through the marine Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund and high resolution data from site specific surveys to help refine site features and their associated boundaries. While time consuming, the regional stakeholder approach helped to develop a good level of understanding and ‘buy-in’ from the majority of stakeholders to both the wider process of site selection and the sites being identified. As a consequence, the regional projects went a long way to help build relationships between different stakeholder groups. This in turn broke down some of the historic misconceptions and barriers between different interests.
default&#xa0;
default9. Given the caveats outlined in this memorandum of written evidence, the marine aggregate sector has cautiously welcomed the staged approach that is now being proposed by Defra – with a first tranche of sites designated during 2013 which are underpinned by more robust levels of evidence. 
default&#xa0;
default10. There remain considerable uncertainties over the ‘real world’ implications of site designations to existing licensed activities. However, we would expect the staged process of designation to enable a more flexible, adaptive management approach to practical delivery as all parties ‘learn by doing’. This process of reflection, evolution and adaptation will be a key mechanism in ensuring that MCZ designations are able to be delivered that not only support the marine environment, but also recognise and support the wider socio-economic interests that exist within and around them. 
default&#xa0;
default11. We would also note that until the wider MPA network is in place, significant uncertainties and risks will remain for marine developers in terms of their potential exposure to nature conservation issues. This is particularly the case given the status of the proposed sites that remain outside of the first tranche of MCZ designations, together with the potential for additional sites to also be required (including reference areas), over and above those already identified by the regional projects. 
default&#xa0;
default12. As a consequence of these uncertainties, the approach to assessing impact, significance and risk through the development process will, by necessity, continue to be undertaken on a reactive basis – something that reduces developer certainty and confidence, and increases development risk and cost
default.
default For this reason, it is essential that the process of determining the status of the remaining MCZ site proposals and finalising the wider MPA network is completed by Government as soon as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultTranche 1 MCZ sites
default&#xa0;
default13. The Marine and Coast Access Act 2009 (MACAA) requires the Designation Order for an MCZ to include the location of the area to be designated together with the features to be protected and their conservation objectives. This requires a very different level of evidence to be provided up front, and is a subtlety that was never made clear throughout the regional MCZ project process. Consequently, the evidence provided to the regional projects to enable stakeholders to identify both sites and the features they contain was never likely to be able to provide the robust levels of site evidence that now appear to be required. 
default&#xa0;
default14. That being said, the levels of evidence now being required to support designation appear to be more aligned with the requirements placed upon developers, albeit with the fall back to the precautionary principle to allow sites with less evidence to be protected where there are threats to irreversible damage.
default&#xa0;
default15. However, the levels of evidence now required to support the designation of the first tranche of MCZ sites remain distinctly at odds with the level of confidence industry operators can have over the consequences of these designations to any interests within or adjacent to a site – with management measures only being developed once the Designation Order is in place. Many of the assumptions for the management measures required to deliver conservation objectives are based on the original extent of site features and their relationship to pressures arising from activities – both directly and indirectly. This is a simple spatial relationship, therefore if the location of the site feature relative to the pressures in place significantly change, the level of exposure and resultant management action may alter. If this is the case, the ‘real world’ business impact on an operator could be very different to that determined through the assumptions – yet this will only become clear once the site is in place. 
default&#xa0;
default16. Furthermore, there also appears to be considerable uncertainty among the statutory nature conservation bodies (SNCB’s) over the condition assessments for site features – with there being low confidence in all bar 19 of the features. This could result in a change in the conservation objective (from ‘maintain’ to ‘recover’) with an associated shift in the management measures required. Any such changes would potentially alter the practical consequences of designation to industry, but would fall outside of those identified through the Impact Assessment (IA) process that has been undertaken and which directly influences site selection decisions that are made. As such, the business impact associated with a site being designated could end up being considerably underplayed.
default&#xa0;
default17. The rather open ended nature of the site specific designation process for the first tranche of MCZ designations therefore has the potential to further undermine operators’ confidence, as their potential exposure could change at any time without them even being aware. As a minimum, there should be a commitment that any operator with a licensed activity or interests that may be directly affected by a change to a site post-consultation to be directly notified prior to designation, and be provided with a right to comment further. 
default&#xa0;
default18. Consequently, there remain considerable uncertainties around how existing or proposed development activities within or adjacent to individual MCZ sites are viewed within the site management process. This is particularly the case for those activities that have already been consented through EIA regulations and which may have significant sunk investment associated with them. 
default&#xa0;
default19. Clarity over the implications of individual site designations, and indeed the wider network, to both consented and proposed development activities (including the renewal of existing licensed interests) represents a key outcome for industry operators with interests adjacent to proposed MCZ sites. In many cases, the ongoing uncertainties associated with this will explain why operators and sectoral interests had to adopt less positive, precautionary positions with respect to site specific designation proposals. This position is further reinforced by the fact that the ‘real world’ implications of each individual MCZ will only become apparent 
defaultafter
default the Designation Order has been made, when management measures will be developed by the appropriate public authority to deliver the conservation objectives defined. As a consequence, the validity of the business costs identified through the Impact Assessment that supported the decision making process may potentially be open to question, given the current outputs were based on assumptions of management response rather than the actual measures imposed and their associated consequences.

defaultonly relating to the

default Consequently, we welcomed the decision for the Designation Orders for MCZs to specify not only the location of the area to be designated, but also the features to be protected and the conservation objectives for the site.
default&#xa0;
default21. Guidance for the MCZ process stated that network design should be based on the ‘
default…best information currently available…
default’, and the Defra consultation (December 2012) indicated that there have been various reviews of the evidence used to define site proposals including ‘
default…further engagement with the private sector to obtain access to data sources that were not available to the Regional MCZ projects or SNCBs
default’. 
default&#xa0;
default22. Clearly, the marine development sector has a potentially important and valuable role to contribute to this process, given the various marine evidence they acquire throughout the lifecycle of a project to inform development, operational management and compliance requirements. We would note that in several cases the site proposals presented in the original consultation package did not fully reflect the high quality evidence already provided to the regional projects by the marine aggregate sector. Nor has there been any significant engagement with industry to determine what additional evidence may be available across potential sites once the regional MCZ projects reported their final recommendations. It would appear though, that new marine survey data has been acquired across proposed sites where there was already high quality evidence held by the marine aggregate sector. 
default&#xa0;
default23. Going forwards, it is essential that future site selection and designation processes look to engage more closely with marine industry interests that may be in 
defaultor around both proposed and potential MCZ sites to maximise the value of existing evidence, and in turn minimise duplicated time, effort and cost. This will require more proactive and focussed direct engagement with industry operators, rather than simply relying upon passive, open calls for evidence. We would note that the marine aggregate sector has previously provided data and expert knowledge to the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies to help refine the understanding of offshore SAC features (specifically sub-tidal sand banks and biogenic reef features) in advance of site designation. There is no reason why this collaborative approach should not work equally well through the process of MCZ designation.

default designation and the wider Network
default&#xa0;
default24. Given the large number of MCZ sites that will remain undetermined following the first tranche, it is essential for there to be a clear process with defined timescales for their status to be resolved. Although guidance has been provided as to how such sites should be considered through licensing and planning decisions, until their status is fully resolved they represent an ongoing uncertainty to marine developer interests. In turn, this has the potential to increase development risk and cost despite the fact that individual sites may never actually be designated. It will therefore be important for regulators and statutory advisors to adhere to the guidance presented for treatment of these areas throughout the licensing process, to avoid any potential for inadvertent planning blight.
default&#xa0;
default25. It is also essential for a clear process and defined timescale for the delivery of the wider MPA network, and the role to be played by the network of MCZ sites within this – including timeframes within which any new MCZ sites (including reference areas) may be identified. By clearly defining the periods of ongoing uncertainty associated with the developing MPA network and particularly the potential for new sites (outside those identified by the regional MCZ projects), developers can better understand the risks and uncertainties associated with operational and development decisions and endeavour to manage their exposure accordingly. The key factor here is that for business to effectively manage the development risks they face, they need some clarity and understanding of where and when such risks may arise.
