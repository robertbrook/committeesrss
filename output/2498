defaultWritten evidence  submitted by the defaultLondondefault Borough of Newhamdefault1. defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultIn Newham we believe in promoting resilience
default among our residents
default. 
defaultBy this we mean that residents should be 
defaultenabled to posses
default a set of skills and hav
defaulte
default access to the resources that allow 
defaultthem
default to negotiate challenges, overcome the more difficult circumstances many of our residents experience, and take up opportunities
default that come their way
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultE
defaultmployment
default is
default at the heart of our conception of economic resilience, and our local 
defaultemployment
default scheme Workplace 
defaulthelped 5
default,000 people find jobs 
defaultlast year alone
default. We recognise that the perception, and in some cases reality, of a benefit trap is extremely damaging and can ac
defaultt as a major barrier to people taking up or progressing in work. We welcome the principle behind Universal Credit of a single taper on benefit removal as paid income increases.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultHowever, we are extremely concerned that the 
defaultwider 
defaultimplementation of welfa
defaultre reforms 
defaultcould
default be disastrous for low income families, for whom in many cases it will be impossible to provide affordable accommodation. We are particularly concerned about the impact of the benefit cap and 
defaultthe spare room subsidy (known as the ‘bedroom ta
defaultx’)
default. We do not feel that the Government’s approach to implementing reforms has shown a joined-up approach between departments.
default&#xa0;default1.4
default              
defaultThe changes have transferred c
defaultonsiderable risk onto 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaulta
defaultuthorities and come with a backdrop of benefit cuts that will 
defaultleave more people in poverty in 2020 than at present
default.
default As one of 
defaultLondon
default’s most deprived boroughs, Newham is committed to building a mixed community where people from different incomes and backgrounds
default live together cohesive
defaultly
default.  
defaultThe London Borough of Newham
default u
defaultltimately 
defaultbelieve
defaults
default that certain key aspects of the government’s welfare reforms will damage our efforts to ensure residents are economically resilient throughout times of hardship.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultThe reforms 
defaultrequire an
default increas
defaulte
default in Council resources at a time when bu
defaultdgets are being cut.
default W
defaulte are concerned that support and resources offered to 
defaulthelp 
defaultresidents through the transition are not taking into account levels of need in each area.
default We are predicting a steep rise in arrears from tenants, increased pressure on social 
defaultservices, and high numbers of requests for direct payments from tenants.  
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultAdditionally, while in principle we are supportive of a gradual rollout of Universal Credit, the lack of clarity on the timescales for certain reforms has 
defaultresulted in
default uncertainty over when the changes are likely to 
defaultaffect Newham
default's tenants
default.
default2. defaultLocal Housing Allowance (LHA) reformsdefault&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultIt is important that the private rented sector is affordable for all of our residents, including young single people, families with 
defaultchildren and disabled people. However, o
defaultur on the ground experience is that rising rents combined with welfare reforms are making an increasing proportion of our rented sector unavailable to people who are in receipt of LHA. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe DWP’s own research ha
defaults found that 94% of the shortfall resulting from overall LHA changes has fallen on tenants. Only 6% has fallen on landlords.
default As it is clear that these changes are reducing individuals’ incomes, we feel it is reasonable to target available funding at areas
default with the greatest shortfall between LHA rates and market rents. This will most effectively mitigate severe impacts on individuals already in housing, which may not be achieved through a focus on the proportion of the market available. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultOur operationa
defaultl experience has identified two particular barriers to residents who need to claim Housing Benefit accessing private sector tenancies. The first is the problem that 
defaultmany of the properties rented at under the 30th percentile of rents are not available
default to
default cl
defaultaimants. This is because some landlords are unwilling to rent to them due to a range of issues from negative perceptions, to the time taken to regain possession of a property occupied by a Housing Benefit claimant, to concerns about future affordability. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultThe second barrier is that the private rented sector in Newham is used by a number of other central 
defaultLondon
default local authorities as temporary accommodation for
default homeless
default residents. These authorities are able to offer high lump-sum incentive payments to lan
defaultdlords to secure Newham properties, increasing demand on the lower-rent section of the Newham market and pricing our residents out.  
defaultTherefore it is increasingly difficult to house people with ties to the borough in 
defaultLondon
default let alone in Newham itself. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultCuts to LHA are detrimental to working families in receipt of housing benefit and further restrict housing supply for those on low incomes. These changes have seen increased pressure on Newham’s homelessness service and increased hardship for local people.
default They drive down the standards of the local housing market – in particular we are concerned that it will encourage conversion of family homes to HMOs and leave families with little choice but to live in overcrowded accommodation. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultWe believe that with
defaultout sufficient resources to tackle the significant shortfall between LHA rates and market rents 
defaultwe will experience an acute impact on our ability to place homeless households in the PRS in Newham.
default&#xa0;default3. defaultDirect payment of housing costs to claimantsdefault&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultL
defaultondon
default Borough of 
defaultNewham is 
defaultanticipating a risk to revenues from the direct payment of housing costs under Universal Credit if tenants are unable to manage their finances effectively and fall into arrears. In particular we have concerns 
defaultthat some vulnerable
default claimants may be unable to manage regular rent payments. 
defaultThe DWP have estimated that the financial risk to Newham would be 8% yet we believe this is a significant underestimation.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultNewham believes the government’s evidence in support of this policy is
default misleading and 
defaultdoes not properly report the 
defaultearly
default findings from 
defaultpilot
default sites, which have shown increased risk of
default arrears.
default 
defaultThis proposal will impact 
defaultthe
default income levels of social housing providers, Newham included, and will add the additional burden on local 
defaultauthorities of increased rent collection activity which will need to be funded. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultIt is important that the findings from the pilot demonstration sites are reported and discussed in a transparent manner
default, 
defaultand take into account the levels of risk placed 
defaulton Local Authorities
default.
default It must also be recognised that the pilots to date have not looked into the full spectrum of benefit recipients
default, meaning they may not be
default fully reflective of the population and 
defaultnot reflect the true level of risk. 
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultHousehold benefitdefault cap default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultWhilst Newham agrees with the principle of 
defaulta
default cap, in reality it is making 
defaultLondon
default unaffordable for those seeking work. 
defaultF
defaultamilies will be forced to move to areas of affordable rents where unemployment is high and prospects for employment are low. 
defaultIf the government is to continue this policy then work must be undertaken to promote employment in these areas.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultAdditionally, Newham is concerned that the benefit cap represents a huge transfer of risk from central government to local authorities. Loc
defaultal authorities will have to deal with the costs in terms of lost rent, temporary accommodation and placement in alternative homes (often out-of-borough) and therefore we would support a higher benefit cap in 
defaultLondon
default areas.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultWhilst the financial risk to 
defaultlocal authorities occurs across a range of household types the risk is most acute in temporary accommodation provided for vulnerable households and those with young children. Those in temporary accommodation at the time of introduction
default 
defaultshould be excluded 
defaultfrom the cap. Temporary accommodation is inevitably of a higher unit cost that will often exceed the cap level. If local authorities are expected to continue to di
defaultscharge their homelessness duty, in or out of their own borough,
default it is arguable that all hous
defaulteholds placed in temporary accommodation 
defaultshould continue to be exempted, 
defaultperhaps for a fixed period. However
default,
default the most immediate pressure is on those in such accommodation at the time the cap is introduced. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultIf a cap is to be introduced we believe tha
defaultt it should be phased in 
defaultmuch 
defaultmore slowly than currently proposed to give households time to adapt to the change
default. 
defaultAs outlined above the cost to local authorities in implementing new systems and dealing with resident queries will be significant at a time wh
defaulten council budgets are already under extreme pressure. We believe that councils should be provided with additional transitional costs to implement these inevitable consequences of a shift in national policy. 
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultSocial sector size criteria default&#xa0;default5
default.0
default              
defaultSince the
default introduction of 
defaultpenalties for social housing under-occupancy
default, there has been a surge in demand to our customer service centre. This has caused significant difficulties with resourcing to meet such demand. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultLondon
default Borough of Newham is concerned th
defaultat there is a lack of availability of suitable accommodation for people to move into if they are classed as living in houses that are too large for their needs. We believe that local authorities are left with insufficient resources to ensure residents are 
defaultnot penalised unnecessarily by this policy. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default2
default              
defaultAs with the household benefit cap and direct payment of housing costs, we believe the 
defaultspare room subsidy (known as the ‘bedroom tax’)
default constitutes a new burden on Local Authorities. Councils are expected to house families who are deemed to be over-accommodated into more suitable housing units.
default However, without access to more suitable properties there is an increasing the risk of arrears,
default adding to the financial pressure experienced by Councils. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultWhilst we already have funding in place for mutual exchange programmes to allow them to make Local Authorities more attractive, we believe f
defaultunding should be made available 
defaultfor authorities to
default create 
defaultadditional supply and 
defaultdeliver schemes to assist 
default“
defaulthome swap
default”
default building programmes.
default 
defaultWe also believe that inconsistencies between policies relating to additional rooms for disabled adults and children 
defaultshould be 
defaultaddressed immediately.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6. defaultLocalised coudefaultncil tax supportdefault&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultNewham is worried that the resources allocated to deliver this policy are insufficient in terms of both programme and admini
defaultstration budgets. This uncertain
defaultty over funding makes the scheme very volatile and subject to change every 
defaultyear. This proposal also represents a transfer of risk from central government to local authorities and the fixed level of funding does not take into account extra burdens placed upon local authorities or population increases. The money being transferred i
defaultncludes a 10% cut, which increases to 19% nationally and 15% in Newham (IFS estimate
default) when pensioners are protected. Significantly, Newham is the largest growing 
defaultborough in 
defaultLondon
default but this is not recognised in grants therefore putting a further unfair bur
defaultden on authorities.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultWe are concerned that 
defaultGovernment plans to provide local authorities with a fixed level of funding for Localised Council Tax Support, set at 90% of current expenditure, do not take into account additional properties which will becom
defaulte available throughout the first two year period.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultIn total 5,905 new housing units will be delivered in Newham up to and including 2014/15 according to our Core Strategy Housing trajectory, including the new E20 community in the Olympic Park. At least 35% will be 'affordable', meaning over 2000 new afford
defaultable homes will be built in the area. 
defaultIt is therefore a realistic estimate that the number of individuals eligible to defaultclaim Councildefault Tax defaultSupport defaultunder current rules could increase by 10% over the next 2 to 3 years.default This is a key issue for us and we must empdefaulthasise that this change will heavily impact the council.default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultWe are proud that as a council we are delivering new homes for residents. However the new system of Council Tax Support will penalise the council with an additional financial burden for deliveri
defaultng affordable properties.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultWe are concerned that Localised Council Tax Support does not allow for in-year changes to the scheme, and is cash limited where previously it was covered by central government Annually Managed Expenditure. This means that if 
defaultthe level of applications increases against the expectations that we have budgeted for, we will have 
defaultto 
defaultfind savings elsewhere rather than alter our scheme. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default              
defaultThe set-up funding that has been offered to date for the administration of localised Council 
defaultTax Support has only been sufficient to cover the cost of software changes and consultation. No recognition has been given in this settlement of the cost of developing schemes on council officers’ time. No clarity has been offered over the level of funding
default that will be provided in future years. This urgently needs to be resolved in a way that reflects the reality of extra burdens, such as appeal costs, that are being placed onto local authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default7
default              
defaultThese unfunded administration costs come at a time whe
defaultn we 
defaultare
default one of only six local authorities to have our administration grant from the DWP reduced by the maximum of 10%, which along with a decrease in our special economic downturn grant totals over £500,000 in lost administrative budget. 
default&#xa0;
default7. Conclusiondefault&#xa0;defaultT
defaulthe London Borough of Newham is concerned that the reforms proposed by the Department for Work and Pensions increase the risks and burdens placed upon local authorities. The lack of adequate funding to deal with these increased burdens will 
defaultmean that Newha
defaultm’s residents are unfairly disadvantaged and we hope the 
defaultG
defaultovernment will take this on board and amend the proposals appropriately.
