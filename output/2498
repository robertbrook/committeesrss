[normal]Written evidence  submitted by the [bold]London[bold] Borough of Newham[bold]1. [bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]In Newham we believe in promoting resilience
[normal] among our residents
[normal]. 
[normal]By this we mean that residents should be 
[normal]enabled to posses
[normal] a set of skills and hav
[normal]e
[normal] access to the resources that allow 
[normal]them
[normal] to negotiate challenges, overcome the more difficult circumstances many of our residents experience, and take up opportunities
[normal] that come their way
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]E
[normal]mployment
[normal] is
[normal] at the heart of our conception of economic resilience, and our local 
[normal]employment
[normal] scheme Workplace 
[normal]helped 5
[normal],000 people find jobs 
[normal]last year alone
[normal]. We recognise that the perception, and in some cases reality, of a benefit trap is extremely damaging and can ac
[normal]t as a major barrier to people taking up or progressing in work. We welcome the principle behind Universal Credit of a single taper on benefit removal as paid income increases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]However, we are extremely concerned that the 
[normal]wider 
[normal]implementation of welfa
[normal]re reforms 
[normal]could
[normal] be disastrous for low income families, for whom in many cases it will be impossible to provide affordable accommodation. We are particularly concerned about the impact of the benefit cap and 
[normal]the spare room subsidy (known as the ‘bedroom ta
[normal]x’)
[normal]. We do not feel that the Government’s approach to implementing reforms has shown a joined-up approach between departments.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]The changes have transferred c
[normal]onsiderable risk onto 
[normal]l
[normal]ocal 
[normal]a
[normal]uthorities and come with a backdrop of benefit cuts that will 
[normal]leave more people in poverty in 2020 than at present
[normal].
[normal] As one of 
[normal]London
[normal]’s most deprived boroughs, Newham is committed to building a mixed community where people from different incomes and backgrounds
[normal] live together cohesive
[normal]ly
[normal].  
[normal]The London Borough of Newham
[normal] u
[normal]ltimately 
[normal]believe
[normal]s
[normal] that certain key aspects of the government’s welfare reforms will damage our efforts to ensure residents are economically resilient throughout times of hardship.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]The reforms 
[normal]require an
[normal] increas
[normal]e
[normal] in Council resources at a time when bu
[normal]dgets are being cut.
[normal] W
[normal]e are concerned that support and resources offered to 
[normal]help 
[normal]residents through the transition are not taking into account levels of need in each area.
[normal] We are predicting a steep rise in arrears from tenants, increased pressure on social 
[normal]services, and high numbers of requests for direct payments from tenants.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally, while in principle we are supportive of a gradual rollout of Universal Credit, the lack of clarity on the timescales for certain reforms has 
[normal]resulted in
[normal] uncertainty over when the changes are likely to 
[normal]affect Newham
[normal]'s tenants
[normal].
[normal]2. [bold]Local Housing Allowance (LHA) reforms[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]It is important that the private rented sector is affordable for all of our residents, including young single people, families with 
[normal]children and disabled people. However, o
[normal]ur on the ground experience is that rising rents combined with welfare reforms are making an increasing proportion of our rented sector unavailable to people who are in receipt of LHA. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The DWP’s own research ha
[normal]s found that 94% of the shortfall resulting from overall LHA changes has fallen on tenants. Only 6% has fallen on landlords.
[normal] As it is clear that these changes are reducing individuals’ incomes, we feel it is reasonable to target available funding at areas
[normal] with the greatest shortfall between LHA rates and market rents. This will most effectively mitigate severe impacts on individuals already in housing, which may not be achieved through a focus on the proportion of the market available. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Our operationa
[normal]l experience has identified two particular barriers to residents who need to claim Housing Benefit accessing private sector tenancies. The first is the problem that 
[normal]many of the properties rented at under the 30th percentile of rents are not available
[normal] to
[normal] cl
[normal]aimants. This is because some landlords are unwilling to rent to them due to a range of issues from negative perceptions, to the time taken to regain possession of a property occupied by a Housing Benefit claimant, to concerns about future affordability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]The second barrier is that the private rented sector in Newham is used by a number of other central 
[normal]London
[normal] local authorities as temporary accommodation for
[normal] homeless
[normal] residents. These authorities are able to offer high lump-sum incentive payments to lan
[normal]dlords to secure Newham properties, increasing demand on the lower-rent section of the Newham market and pricing our residents out.  
[normal]Therefore it is increasingly difficult to house people with ties to the borough in 
[normal]London
[normal] let alone in Newham itself. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Cuts to LHA are detrimental to working families in receipt of housing benefit and further restrict housing supply for those on low incomes. These changes have seen increased pressure on Newham’s homelessness service and increased hardship for local people.
[normal] They drive down the standards of the local housing market – in particular we are concerned that it will encourage conversion of family homes to HMOs and leave families with little choice but to live in overcrowded accommodation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that with
[normal]out sufficient resources to tackle the significant shortfall between LHA rates and market rents 
[normal]we will experience an acute impact on our ability to place homeless households in the PRS in Newham.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3. [bold]Direct payment of housing costs to claimants[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]L
[normal]ondon
[normal] Borough of 
[normal]Newham is 
[normal]anticipating a risk to revenues from the direct payment of housing costs under Universal Credit if tenants are unable to manage their finances effectively and fall into arrears. In particular we have concerns 
[normal]that some vulnerable
[normal] claimants may be unable to manage regular rent payments. 
[normal]The DWP have estimated that the financial risk to Newham would be 8% yet we believe this is a significant underestimation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Newham believes the government’s evidence in support of this policy is
[normal] misleading and 
[normal]does not properly report the 
[normal]early
[normal] findings from 
[normal]pilot
[normal] sites, which have shown increased risk of
[normal] arrears.
[normal] 
[normal]This proposal will impact 
[normal]the
[normal] income levels of social housing providers, Newham included, and will add the additional burden on local 
[normal]authorities of increased rent collection activity which will need to be funded. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is important that the findings from the pilot demonstration sites are reported and discussed in a transparent manner
[normal], 
[normal]and take into account the levels of risk placed 
[normal]on Local Authorities
[normal].
[normal] It must also be recognised that the pilots to date have not looked into the full spectrum of benefit recipients
[normal], meaning they may not be
[normal] fully reflective of the population and 
[normal]not reflect the true level of risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. [bold]Household benefit[bold] cap [bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst Newham agrees with the principle of 
[normal]a
[normal] cap, in reality it is making 
[normal]London
[normal] unaffordable for those seeking work. 
[normal]F
[normal]amilies will be forced to move to areas of affordable rents where unemployment is high and prospects for employment are low. 
[normal]If the government is to continue this policy then work must be undertaken to promote employment in these areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally, Newham is concerned that the benefit cap represents a huge transfer of risk from central government to local authorities. Loc
[normal]al authorities will have to deal with the costs in terms of lost rent, temporary accommodation and placement in alternative homes (often out-of-borough) and therefore we would support a higher benefit cap in 
[normal]London
[normal] areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst the financial risk to 
[normal]local authorities occurs across a range of household types the risk is most acute in temporary accommodation provided for vulnerable households and those with young children. Those in temporary accommodation at the time of introduction
[normal] 
[normal]should be excluded 
[normal]from the cap. Temporary accommodation is inevitably of a higher unit cost that will often exceed the cap level. If local authorities are expected to continue to di
[normal]scharge their homelessness duty, in or out of their own borough,
[normal] it is arguable that all hous
[normal]eholds placed in temporary accommodation 
[normal]should continue to be exempted, 
[normal]perhaps for a fixed period. However
[normal],
[normal] the most immediate pressure is on those in such accommodation at the time the cap is introduced. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]If a cap is to be introduced we believe tha
[normal]t it should be phased in 
[normal]much 
[normal]more slowly than currently proposed to give households time to adapt to the change
[normal]. 
[normal]As outlined above the cost to local authorities in implementing new systems and dealing with resident queries will be significant at a time wh
[normal]en council budgets are already under extreme pressure. We believe that councils should be provided with additional transitional costs to implement these inevitable consequences of a shift in national policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]Social sector size criteria [bold]&#xa0;[bold]5
[normal].0
[normal]              
[normal]Since the
[normal] introduction of 
[normal]penalties for social housing under-occupancy
[normal], there has been a surge in demand to our customer service centre. This has caused significant difficulties with resourcing to meet such demand. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]London
[normal] Borough of Newham is concerned th
[normal]at there is a lack of availability of suitable accommodation for people to move into if they are classed as living in houses that are too large for their needs. We believe that local authorities are left with insufficient resources to ensure residents are 
[normal]not penalised unnecessarily by this policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]As with the household benefit cap and direct payment of housing costs, we believe the 
[normal]spare room subsidy (known as the ‘bedroom tax’)
[normal] constitutes a new burden on Local Authorities. Councils are expected to house families who are deemed to be over-accommodated into more suitable housing units.
[normal] However, without access to more suitable properties there is an increasing the risk of arrears,
[normal] adding to the financial pressure experienced by Councils. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst we already have funding in place for mutual exchange programmes to allow them to make Local Authorities more attractive, we believe f
[normal]unding should be made available 
[normal]for authorities to
[normal] create 
[normal]additional supply and 
[normal]deliver schemes to assist 
[normal]“
[normal]home swap
[normal]”
[normal] building programmes.
[normal] 
[normal]We also believe that inconsistencies between policies relating to additional rooms for disabled adults and children 
[normal]should be 
[normal]addressed immediately.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. [bold]Localised cou[bold]ncil tax support[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]Newham is worried that the resources allocated to deliver this policy are insufficient in terms of both programme and admini
[normal]stration budgets. This uncertain
[normal]ty over funding makes the scheme very volatile and subject to change every 
[normal]year. This proposal also represents a transfer of risk from central government to local authorities and the fixed level of funding does not take into account extra burdens placed upon local authorities or population increases. The money being transferred i
[normal]ncludes a 10% cut, which increases to 19% nationally and 15% in Newham (IFS estimate
[normal]) when pensioners are protected. Significantly, Newham is the largest growing 
[normal]borough in 
[normal]London
[normal] but this is not recognised in grants therefore putting a further unfair bur
[normal]den on authorities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]We are concerned that 
[normal]Government plans to provide local authorities with a fixed level of funding for Localised Council Tax Support, set at 90% of current expenditure, do not take into account additional properties which will becom
[normal]e available throughout the first two year period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]In total 5,905 new housing units will be delivered in Newham up to and including 2014/15 according to our Core Strategy Housing trajectory, including the new E20 community in the Olympic Park. At least 35% will be 'affordable', meaning over 2000 new afford
[normal]able homes will be built in the area. 
[normal]It is therefore a realistic estimate that the number of individuals eligible to [bold]claim Council[bold] Tax [bold]Support [bold]under current rules could increase by 10% over the next 2 to 3 years.[bold] This is a key issue for us and we must emp[bold]hasise that this change will heavily impact the council.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]We are proud that as a council we are delivering new homes for residents. However the new system of Council Tax Support will penalise the council with an additional financial burden for deliveri
[normal]ng affordable properties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]We are concerned that Localised Council Tax Support does not allow for in-year changes to the scheme, and is cash limited where previously it was covered by central government Annually Managed Expenditure. This means that if 
[normal]the level of applications increases against the expectations that we have budgeted for, we will have 
[normal]to 
[normal]find savings elsewhere rather than alter our scheme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6
[normal]              
[normal]The set-up funding that has been offered to date for the administration of localised Council 
[normal]Tax Support has only been sufficient to cover the cost of software changes and consultation. No recognition has been given in this settlement of the cost of developing schemes on council officers’ time. No clarity has been offered over the level of funding
[normal] that will be provided in future years. This urgently needs to be resolved in a way that reflects the reality of extra burdens, such as appeal costs, that are being placed onto local authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]These unfunded administration costs come at a time whe
[normal]n we 
[normal]are
[normal] one of only six local authorities to have our administration grant from the DWP reduced by the maximum of 10%, which along with a decrease in our special economic downturn grant totals over £500,000 in lost administrative budget. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]T
[normal]he London Borough of Newham is concerned that the reforms proposed by the Department for Work and Pensions increase the risks and burdens placed upon local authorities. The lack of adequate funding to deal with these increased burdens will 
[normal]mean that Newha
[normal]m’s residents are unfairly disadvantaged and we hope the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment will take this on board and amend the proposals appropriately.
