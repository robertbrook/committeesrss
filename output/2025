defaultCRB 55default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by UK Competitive Telecommunications Associationdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA is a trade association promoting the interests of competitive fixed-line telecommunications companies competing against BT, as well as each other, in the residential and business markets. Its role is to develop and promote the interests of its member
defaults to Ofcom and the Government. Details of membership of UKCTA can be found at 
defaultwww.ukcta.com
default. UKCTA welcomes the opportunity to respond to this 
defaultcall for evidence since 
defaultthe
default Bill contains a number of provisions with very s
defaulterious implications for our members. 
defaultLast year UKCTA submitted a response to the BIS consultation document on the implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive.  In this response we have confined our comments to three areas of greatest concern to our me
defaultmbers
default&#xa0;defaultQuality as a matter of custom – 
defaults.36 (
default10)
defaultThe first concern which UKCTA has relates to 
defaultsection 36(10) which provides that “A contract to provide digital content may be treated as making provision about the quality of the digital content as a matter of custom.”
defaultUKCTA does not believe that it is appropriate to infer that any provision is made 
defaultbased on custom. One of the key 
defaultcharacteristics
default of the market for digital content is that it is continuously evolving and that the pace of change is rapid. The reference to custom might be appropriate in a more static market but it is not appropriate in re
defaultlation to the provision of digital content. UKCTA would therefore suggest that sub section 10 
defaultought to be
default deleted.
default&#xa0;defaultFitness for a particular purpose – Sections 37(1), (3) and (6)
default&#xa0;defaultS. 
default37 
default(1) 
defaultSubsection (3) applies to a contract to provide digital content 
defaultif before the contract is made the consumer makes known to the trader (expressly or by implication) any particular purpose for which the consumer is contracting for the digital content.
default&#xa0;
defaultS. 
default37 
default(3) 
defaultThe contract is to be treated as including a term that the
default digital content is reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which digital content of that kind is usually provided.
default&#xa0;
defaultS. 
default37 
default(6)
default              
defaultA contract to provide digital content may be treated as making provision about
default 
defaultthe fitness of the d
defaultigital content for a particular purpose as a matter of custom.
default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA has members whose business model involves the immediate delivery to 
defaultconsumers 
defaultof digital content, namely digital television content. 
defaultThis is something now offered by all the main consume
defaultr facing brands on the sector. 
defaultOur members have 
defaults
defaultignificant 
defaultconcerns about these 
defaultprovisions and how they will impact on transactions where 
defaultconsumers 
defaultreceive immediate delivery of content at the point of purchase.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultTypically such transactions involve the p
defaultrovision of information as to the nature of the content to 
defaultconsumers 
defaultin order that they can make a decision as to whether or not to purchase the content. But t
defaulthese subsections 
defaultlisted above would introduce for 
defaultconsumers 
defaultthe opportunity to inform suppliers t
defaulthat they intend to use the digital content for a particular purpose
default. As currently designed, digital content delivery platforms do not then allow providers the opportunity envisaged in the draft bill to 
defaultrespond as to whether or not the digital content 
defaultis in
default fact 
defaultindeed fit for the consumers’ stated purpose. 
defaultWorst still the sub sections require the providers to consider whether an express purpose may have been im
defaultpl
defaultied by the 
defaultconsumer
default. In a world where 
default 
defaultconsumers 
defaultexpect, and are given, immediate delivery of di
defaultgital content, these sub sections are completely out of step and inappropriate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese concerns apply not only to transactions for TV content involving UKCTA members but perhaps even more significantly (given the volume of transactions involved) to purcha
defaultses of smart phone apps via providers such as the Apple App Store, Google Play and Amazon. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, if a consumer was looking at a
default smart phone app 
defaultwhich was 
defaultof limited functionality but the 
defaultconsumer 
defaultemailed the supplier and either expressly or 
defaultimpliedly de
defaultscribed a more complex purpose 
defaultfor which they intended to use the app, 
defaultand then immediately downloaded it, under the draft
defaulting
default currently proposed
default, that App would be deemed fit for that purpose and if it did no
defaultt perform to the standard the 
defaultconsum
defaulter
default 
defaulthad stated, he would have a course of action against the supplier.
default In order to protect against exposu
defaultre to such risk we imagine that, if implemented as currently drafted, 
defaultthe regulations 
defaultmight
default force 
defaultsuppliers of digital content to redesign their deliver
defaulty platforms to mitigate the risks. Such changes would not enhance the consumer’s purchasing 
defaultexperience;
default we imagine it would be quite the reverse.
default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA believes the current drafting is simply not suitable for a market which 
defaulttypically
default involves immediate de
defaultlivery of digital content to order. Rather than the wording currently proposed UKCTA believes it would be more appropriate to require suppliers to provide greater transparency and information as to the quality and any intended purpose of digital content an
defaultd to require suppliers to ensure that the content is 
defaultfit for 
defaultany such 
defaultpurpose stated by the supplier
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultF
defaultailing which
default, if th
defaulte Government is minded to persevere with the current 
defaultdrafting, 
defaultsuppliers ought to be given an opportunity to respond within a reason
defaultable period to 
defaultthe consumer and either affirm the consumer’s stated purpose or to explain that the digital content is not suitable for the purpose stated by the consumer 
defaultbefore
default the consumer purchases the content.  If the consumer does not wait for a respon
defaultse from the trader before purchasing the digital content, the contract should not be treated as including a term that the digital content is reasonably fit for the consumer’s stated purpose.
default We envisage however that such a regime could only work if content
default delivery systems were modified to add an additional 
defaultorder step requiring 
defaultconsumers 
defaultto notify suppliers of their intended purpose, and this would inevitably result in delayed delivery of the content. We do not believe this would be regarded as a positive d
defaultevelopment by consumers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs already noted above UKCTA 
defaulthas concerns 
defaultabout the use of 
defaultthe term “as a matter of custom”
default and these concerns apply equally to Section 
default36(6).  A
defaults with our earlier comment on this point 
defaultwe would suggest deleting this subsection.
default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA believes that 
defaultthe reference to a “reasonable period of time” in this subsection could be 
defaultinterpreted by some 
defaultconsumers as overriding the enforceability of express limitations br
defaultought to the consumer’s attention pr
defaultior to the point of 
defaultpurchase.  For example, if digital content provided by way of a streaming service is 
defaultoften 
defaultmade available for a short period of time
default. 
defaultIn those examples with which UKCTA members are familiar 
defaultthis is ma
defaultde clear to the consumer
default 
defaultpr
defaultior to the point of sale. The period of validity of the content is another factor weighed up by the consumer in determining whether or not to purchase and it should not therefore be open to 
defaultthe consumer 
defaultto seek to use a statutory
default 
defaultprovision to argue that the period 
defaultset by the seller 
defaultwas unreasonable.  
defaultUKCTA believes that the wording
default should
default be clarified to ensure that such a right would only occur where a seller 
defaultdid notdefault make clear prior to the sale the 
defaulttime period for which the 
defaultcont
defaultent would be available for streaming by the consumer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultS
default.
default52 - Information provided about the trader or service to be treated as binding 
default&#xa0;defaultS.
default52 (1) 
default              
defaultEvery
default contract to provide a service is to be treated as including as a term of the contract (whether or not it does so expressly) anything that - 
default&#xa0;
default(a) is spoken or written to the consumer by or on behalf of the trader about the trader or the service, and
default&#xa0;
default(b) 
defaultis taken into account by the consumer when deciding to enter into the contract or when making any decision about the service after entering into the contract.
default&#xa0;defaultUKCTA supports any measures designed to ensure that 
defaultconsumers must be provided with correct and 
defaultup to date information on products and services
default.   
defaultConsumers
default should
default be able to rely on the information they are given
default. Consumers are already 
defaultprotect
defaulted 
defaultunder the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (the “CPRs”)
default but UKCTA has concerns th
defaultat 
defaultth
defaulte
default drafting 
defaultof section 52 may produce 
defaultunintended consequences.  
defaultIn our Members’ experience many transactions involve occasions when
default customer service agents are chatting to 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultto give them some background 
defaultinformation on a particular 
defaultproduct or service. 
defaultThe flexibility which companies 
defaultcurrently 
defaultha
defaultve
default,
default allows agents to talk to consumers in a friendly, personable way
default whilst providing accurate and clear information
default. 
defaultIt would be regrettable if as a result of section 52 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultwere greete
defaultd with completely scripted and wooden responses because agents were too wary to engage in any other conversation.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur member companies 
defaultdevote significant time and 
defaulteffort in training 
defaultcustomer service agents to make the 
defaultconsumer’s
default 
defaultinteraction with 
defaultthem as e
defaultasy and pleasant 
defaultas possible. 
defaultInevitably, there will be some
default 
defaultessential 
defaultinformation 
defaultwhich is 
defaultscripted which must be shared with the 
defaultconsumer
default 
defaultso that they fully understand their rights and obligations
default, for example key contractual information so that the con
defaultsumer understands their rights and 
defaultobligations and
default so that the Communications Provider can be sure of compliance with existing 
defaultconsumer protection and Ofcom regulation
defaults
default.
default Typically telephone based 
defaultconversations are followed up by 
defaulta postal delivery
default or 
defaultemail 
defaultof
default service or product as well as 
defaultcontractual information
default. This 
defaultalready involves 
defaultthe opportunity to cancel the order if the 
defaultconsumer
default 
defaultchanges their mind within the cooling off period
default specified in existing regulations
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is possible that although our members do their utmost to ensure their staff do 
defaultnot mislead p
defaultotential 
defaultcustomers, 
defaultsection 52 as currently drafted, would lead to the only prudent course of action being to ensure that contact centre 
defaultagents 
defaultstick rigidly 
defaultto 
defaulta 
defaultpre prepared 
defaultscript and not to engage with 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultany further than that, in order to ensure that no unscripted comments were to form part of the contract.  
defaultThis would in our view lead to a poorer 
defaultconsumer 
defaultexperience across the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlternatively C
defaultPs might have to go through the entire contract on the phone with a 
defaultconsumer;
default again we do not believe this would be welcomed by consumers any more than it would be by our members. Our members already do 
defaulthighlight the main terms of the agreement; for exampl
defaulte the price, minimum term
default, product being purchased
default etc.  
defaultFull 
defaultcontractual documentation 
defaultis then sent allowing 
defaultconsumers 
defaultto 
defaultconsider it 
defaultwithin the cooling off period. 
defaultConsumers 
defaultare used to transacting in this way and we believe they understand that t
defaulthe term
defaults and conditions 
defaultwhich they receive by post 
defaultconstitute the final contract. 
defaultThey also have the 
defaultopportunity to cancel the contract within any applicable cooling off period. 
defaultAgain this right is increasingly well understood by 
defaultconsumers
default. The consequence of sec
defaulttion 52 would be that 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultwere 
defaultable to add additional terms 
defaultto their contract based on their conversation with the contact centre. Each 
defaultconsumer 
defaultwould in effect have a bespoke contract. This would be confusing and would be an enormous administrative 
defaultburden on service providers. The additional costs of recording such bespoke arrangements would be significant and costs would inevitably be passed on in some form or other to consumers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a considerable body of consumer protection law already whic
defaulth UKCTA believes adequately protects consumers today. Communications Providers are regulated sector specific regulations and in particular General Condition 9 of the General Conditions of Entitlement regime monitored by Ofcom. This condition sets out certa
defaultin mandatory provisions which must be included in consumer contracts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther p
defaultrotection against 
defaultmisrepresentation 
defaultis provided 
defaultby the law of misrepresentation, the CPRs and in addition, the cooling off periods provided for under the current Door Stop 
defaultSelling Regulations
default and 
defaultthe Consumer Protection (
defaultDistance Selling
default) 
defaultRegulations
default 2000
default (to be replaced by the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Payments) Re
defaultgulations) that allow 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultto change their minds if they are unhappy with the products or services or the terms of the contract.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough the Government has reasoned that clarification to consumer rights is important because ‘consumers are more lik
defaultely to suffer detriment they are unable to resolve’, for the communications industry that is simply not the case. As part of the General Conditions of Entitlement regime all communications providers are required to be part of an ADR scheme; 
defaultthese arrangeme
defaultnts are widely regarded as effective and the ADR schemes are well utilised by consumers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe consider that this additional layer of consumer protection 
defaultis unnecessary and disproportionate.

default 
default(4)
default   
defaultA term is prominent for the purposes of this section if it is brought to the consume
defaultr’s
default 
defaultattention in such a way that an average consumer would be aware of the term.
default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA has
default some concerns about the requirement for price terms to be “prominent” in order to be within the exemption under section 65(1) so that the term
default is not assessable for
default fairness. In the electronic communications sector 
defaultconsumers 
defaultfrequently purchase a “
defaultbundle” of services, 
defaultand not infrequently they may initially purchase a primary service such as telephony but subsequently supplement this with a service such as broadband,
default superfast broadband or increasingly a TV service. These are often 
defaultpriced separately but form part of the same contracts
default. UKCTA is
default concern
defaulted
default that under the Bill, charges could be subject to an assessment of fairness if they are not brought to the average c
defaultonsumer’s attention at the time of entering into a contract.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example most of the major consumer focussed CPs 
defaultoffer 
defaulta variety of 
defaultfixed-line telephony 
defaultpackages.
default  
defaultThese typically require the consumer to pay 
defaulta monthly subscription cost 
defaultin return for a telephony service and an inclusive allowance 
defaultwhich allows the 
defaultconsumer
default 
defaultto make various types of calls without additional charge, e.g. evening and weekend calls to landline
default numbers within the UK, or calls to overseas landlines, or to mobile 
defaultphones
default.  
defaultThis is standard practi
defaultc
defaulte within the industry and indeed it is difficult to find a service which does not offer some form of calls allowance.  In addition to calls covered by the bundled allowance, these services also 
default 
defaultallow 
defaultconsumers 
defaultto 
defaultmake call
defaults which do not fall within the inclusive usage allowance.  Although the most 
defaultcommon or 
defaultpopular call charges 
defaultcan (and are) 
defaultbe brought prominently to the 
defaultconsumer’s
default 
defaultattention, it 
defaultis simply 
defaultimpractical 
defaultduring the sales process 
defaultto 
defaultdraw a 
defaultconsumer’s 
defaultattention t
defaulto every possible 
defaultcall charge
default which the 
defaultconsumer 
defaultmight incur. The best that can be done is to refer a 
defaultconsumer 
defaultto standard price lists detailing such charges. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs currently drafted section 67 would mean that any
default call charges not brought to the average cons
defaultumer’s attention at the point of sale, would not fall within the price exemption.
default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA fears this will 
default considerably lengthen 
defaultsales 
defaultcall
defaults
default, and 
defaultin so doing reduce the likelihood that the 
defaultconsumer 
defaultwill absorb other 
defaultmore importan
defaultt information provided durin
defaultg the call as they will have simply switched off through boredom while they are given
default information about charges they may or may not incur at a point in the future. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCPs already routinely 
defaultrefer 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultto pricing information on their website 
defaultin cases whe
defaultre such 
defaultinformation changes regularly
default. An example of this would be 
defaultcharges for directory enquiry calls which change frequently due to circumstances 
defaultbeyond 
default 
defaultthe control of the 
defaultCP. In such cases it is nigh on impossible 
defaultto provide 
defaultconsumers
default 
defaultwith up-to-date information in hard copy documents. 
defaultIndeed the risk of providing out of date information would increases with the use of hard copy rather than electronic information about such charges. 
defaultWould 
defaultsuch electronic information be 
defaultconsidered to be 
defaultsufficiently 
default"prominent" that the average consumer would be aware of it and so within the exemption in 
defaults65 (
default1)
default?
default  
defaultThis seems to UKCTA to be far from clear. 
defaultWe 
defaultwould welcome further clarity on these points. We understand from the BIS workshops that BIS will 
defaultbe discussing this issue with Ofcom to assess the impact on the communications sector. We support transparency for c
defaultonsumers
default but we would caution against measures which are impractical to implement.
default&#xa0;
defaultS.71 
default(2) If a term of a consumer contract is especially onerous or unusual, the trader must ensure that the term is drawn particularly to the consumer’s attention.
default&#xa0;
defaultS.71 
default(3) Whether a term of a contract is especially onerous or unusual is to be determined,
default in particular, by reference to the subject matter of the contract.
default&#xa0;defaultUKCTA has
default similar concerns under s71 (2) to those 
defaultwhich we expressed above in relation to 
defaultsection s67 (4). As explained
default above
default, communications providers
default typically have an extensive 
defaulttariff guide detailing the call charges to all 
defaulttypes of number range and to 
defaultinternational destinations.  
defaultWhat may be “unusual” for one person may be entirely normal for another. For example most c
defaultonsu
defaultmers will never have any occasion to call Kiribati and s
defaulto calls to that country would indeed be out of the ordinary, whereas a 
defaultconsumer 
defaultwith a friend or relative there might find nothing at all unusual in such calls. The Bill’s use 
defaultof the term “unusual” 
defaultdoes little to provide clarity or certainty of what is req
defaultuired. How are UKCTA members to determine which call charges are unusual and there must be 
default“drawn particularly to the consumer’s attention”. This is an even higher test than the “prominence” test under s65 (4)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe understand from one of our members who a
defaultttended that a
defaultt one of the 
defaultrecent 
defaultworkshops
default on this topic,
default BIS confirmed that s71 applied at the time the contract was concluded which would mean that for telephone sales, the agents would be required to read out any “unusual” call charges.   
defaultUKCTA cannot 
defaultbelieve that 
defaultthis is BIS’ intention but the unintended consequences may be that in the communications sector, in order to avoid the price terms of call charges being assessable for fairness, providers are required to bring all “unusual” charges to the cons
defaultumer’s attention thereby 
defaultnullifying any attempt to give prominence to terms which ought properly to be highlighted for consumers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe understand the Government’s desire to enhance consumer protection but we do not believe that a one size fits 
defaultall approach necessarily works. Certain protections, which may operate without any great difficulty in one scenario, may cause difficulties for both providers and consumers in another. In those areas which we have highlighted above, we believe that the spe
defaultcific measures proposed will cause difficulty in relation to services which involve the immediate delivery of digital content. It is easy to envisage them requiring changes to the delivery systems which will degrade rather than enhance the consumer’s use o
defaultf the services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUKCTA believes that the Government ought to look very carefully at the issues we have highlighted and to consider whether in these limited areas, the electronic communications sector ought to be exempt from these particular regulations.  
defaultT
defaulthere is 
defaultalready established 
defaultprecedent for this course of action within BIS’s attempts to implement the Regulations.  
defaultRegulation 6 provides that the Regulations do
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt apply to contracts for services of a banking, insurance or
default&#xa0;
defaultinvestment nature.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultUKCTA und
defaulterstands this approach was adopted because Government felt that 
defaultregulation of the financial sector was better addressed through sector specific legislation. 
defaultUKCTA believes that the practical difficulties which we have described suggest that the same approa
defaultch ought to be followed in relation to the Electronic Communications sector.
