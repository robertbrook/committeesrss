default&#xa0;
defaultStoney Middleton Parish Council writes to the Joint Parliamentary Committee as the village most affected by 4 x 4’s,trial and quad bikes using Jacob’s Ladder (an unsealed medieval Holloway).  With respect, we urge the committee to consider the impact on our residents of opening this track way as a Byway Open to All Traffic.
default&#xa0;
defaultJacob’s ladder has been used by generations of pedestrians and horse riders as a quiet pleasant walk. The spate of off-road vehicles in recent years has, for many, rendered this track unusable for horses and unpleasant and often dangerous for pedestrians, many of whom are local and no longer feel safe using this route.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the only access to the village cemetery, the most recent complaint being from a young widow taking her children to visit their father’s grave and being confronted by trail bikes who so frightened the two little girls that they didn’t want to continue.
defaultThis is only the latest in a long list of complaints.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a parish council we think our concerns are not being heard and our opinions brushed aside.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours sincerely
