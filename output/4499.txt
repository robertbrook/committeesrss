[[[Written evidence submitted by Mrs J Woodruff]]]&#xa0;Dear Sir / MadamThank you for this opportunity to contribute to the select committee inquiry.  I hope that you will find a parent’s perspective useful when considering the issues affecting academies and free schools.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Some of the issues on which views were sought are addressed in more detail below. 

[[[“]]]

[[[The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing ]]]

[[[the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes.]]]

[[[”]]]

[[[What should actually be done]]]

[[[ to narrow the gap?]]]  As discussed previously there are some actions that merely play lip-service to narrowing the gap rather than having a material impact.   Useful partnerships are likely to involve sharing experience and resources. 

[[[Sharing experience]]]Again, the forces that put schools in competition with each other may not result in maximising co-operation.&#xa0;&#xa0;
