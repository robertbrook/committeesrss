[[[Written evidence submitted by Alex Henney (IPC0006)]]]&#xa0;“The reason there is so much bad science is not that talent is rare, not at all;what is rare is character.  People are not honest, they don’t admit their ignorance, and that is why they write such nonsense.”Sigmund Freud&#xa0;1.              SUMMARY&#xa0;1.1              The changing context&#xa0;2007, when the Fourth AR was published, was the height of the IPCC’s prestige and the case for concern about anthropogenic climate warming (ACW).  The IPCC and Senator Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Subsequently the credibility of the IPCC’s treatment of science has taken some serious blows:-&#xa0;&#xa0;*              the “hockey stick” was the star of Assessment Report 3 (AR3) in 2001 and was included in AR4 in 2007.  The hockey stick claimed that the global temperature declined since about 1000 to the end of the nineteenth century, when it has been increasing due to CO2&#xa0;*              the report falsely claimed that “more likely than not human activities have contributed to an increase in tropical cyclone intensity” &#xa0;*              Canadian journalist Donna Laframboise showed that contrary to IPCC claims the reports are not based exclusively on peer reviewed input from leading scientists were not true&#xa0;*              the IPCC had to withdraw its claim that the glaciers in the Himalayas were likely to melt by 2035&#xa0;*              the Nongovernmental Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) was set up to provide an alternative – and less politically alarmist slanted - story&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Global CMIP5 RCP45 39 models, annual Tas reference base 1979-1983, 7-yr running average&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;There has been increasing realization that the IPCC’s interpretative material – in particular the Summary for Policy Makers but also some of the base science – is not independent but there is a political agenda behind some – if not much – of it:-  &#xa0;&#xa0;“The climate summit in Cancun —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War…One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governments of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”&#xa0;1.2              The IPCC’S Fifth Assessment Report&#xa0;There are a few improvements in the science in AR5 – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick, and has dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and that flooding and drought will become more serious.  The main shortcoming is that the report is unable to explain the 16 or 17 year pause in global warming.   Next, despite the expenditure of hundreds of £M on climate models they do not track global temperature accurately. The (leaked) final draft Summary for Policy Makers identified that “Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10–15 years”.  This admission disappeared in the final version, which massaged the inaccuracy of the models. &#xa0;Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus, Program in Atmospheres, Oceans, and Climate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, observed:-&#xa0;“I think that the latest IPCC report has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.&#xa0; They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…&#xa0;Their excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the heat is hiding in the deep ocean.&#xa0; However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…&#xa0;

A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), “The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth’s Climate,” lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar activity can make itself felt on our planet.”&#xa0;A new paper by two Dutchmen at the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands “found that that during the major part of the four centuries investigated, i.e. the period 1610 till&#xa0; around&#xa0; 1900 – 1950 , the&#xa0; average terrestrial ground temperatures depend solely on solar magnetic field variations.”&#xa0;Jasper Kirby, Head of fthe CLOUD Experiment at CERN, recently gave a thorough review showing strong  correlations between cosmic rays, solar cycles and earth’s climate.  He projects a possible mini ice age by 2015 similar to the Dalton or Maunder minimum.&#xa0;1.4              Response to the Committee’s questions&#xa0;While the IPCC has addressed a few of the criticisms of its too often sloppy and “politicially” slanted approach in the past, it has not explained the reasons for the global temperature pause but attempted to fudge it, and it does not analyse why the climate models – on which £100Ms have been invested – are so inaccurate; they are useless for forecasting temperature change.  The report includes a number of factual errors and does not adequately consider the possible effect of the sun on the climate.  The IPCC has not addressed the main question about the extent of man’s effect on the climate, merely asserted a belief buttressed by phony statistical wording about the reliability of its view.The truth is that far from being “settled” – which is a political or bureaucratic concept, not a scientific one – climate sciences are immature and there are many areas that merit extensive research.  AR5 doubtless reflects the views of “state scientists” in Britain (i.e. those directly on the government’s payroll including the Met Office, and those in universities seeking grants funded by the government, who must be politically correct).  But it does not reflect the views of many competent and “free” thinking climate scientists in North America, ANZAC, and some continental countries.  Because of the dominance of state scientists, we live in a parochial little bubble of ignorant (so called) consensus.&#xa0;From the analyses in 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 I draw the main conclusion that AR5 is a most unsatisfactory report and should not be the basis for any policies in any country.  The Committee asks “What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? - it should have none.

He wrote a book “The Climate Fix” which sets out the story of how this paper ran and ran, and how the IPCC distorted a paper from a workshop which he (Pielke) had organised&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;*              the writing of 28 out of 44 chapters included at least one individual affiliated with the WWF; 15 chapters were led by WWF-affiliated scientists &#xa0;*              in three instances, chapters were led by two WWF-affiliated coordinating lead authors&#xa0;She reported on her blog on 4/4/13 that the IPCC selected three scientists, who had variously worked for the US Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, WWF, and a doctor who was urging other doctors to “Educate and encourage patients…in climate change action”, to be in charge of a chapter in the forthcoming working Group 2 AR5 report and to work on its Summary for Policy Makers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2              The IPCC climate models failed to track the global temperature pause&#xa0;The global temperature has remained constant since 1998.  This led to increasing criticism of the climate models which the IPCC increasingly relied on. Professor Christy has recently compared the performance of 39 climate model that were used in AR5 over the period 1975 to 2012 with measured temperature data.  The models over back-cast temperature significantly in a range 0-0.7oC.&#xa0;Global CMIP5 RCP45 39 models, annual Tas reference base 1979-1983, 7-yr running average&#xa0;&#xa0;There are numerous recent blogs about the failure of the models.&#xa0;In a recent paper he concludes:-&#xa0;“After thirteen years and two new generations of climate models (CMIP-3, -5) the results still suggest that model-averages are unable to represent (1) the observed magnitudes of tropical temperature trends throughout the tropospheric levels, and (2) the relationship between the temperature trends of the surface and troposphere. The disparity remains.”&#xa0;

[[[increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and observations increase.  ]]]&#xa0;2.3              “Climategate”&#xa0;“Climategate” - the release of e-mails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in November 2009 - cast light on the modus operandi of the IPCC and an aspect of its “science” base.  It revealed a story of hiding and manipulating data; attempting to censor publication of papers that did not follow the ACW line; refusing requests under Freedom of Information; and rigging the peer review process.  &#xa0;UEA commissioned two Inquiries and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee held a hearing.  All three were superficial whitewashes.  None of these inquiries interviewed critics of the IPCC authors and none subjected the information provided by IPCC authors to cross examination.&#xa0;2.4              Challenges from internet blogs&#xa0;The conventional publication channel of scientific journals has been increasingly challenged by some very good blogs such as:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5              The IPCC is a political body&#xa0;There has been increasing realization that the IPCC’s interpretative material – in particular the Summary for Policy Makers but also some of the base science – is politicized.  The editing of Chapter 8, Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes, in AR2 of 1995 was a cause célebre.   The final draft prepared by scientists stated that there was insufficient evidence to support ACW, but the lead author then excised denials or doubts of any scientific evidence of ACW, replacing them with statements to make the Scientific report consistent with the Policymakers’ Summary which claimed there is “a discernible human influence on the global climate”.  This example reflects the political agenda. Timothy Wirth, a close political ally of Gore’s and now President of the UN Foundation, commented:-&#xa0;“Even if the theory of global warming is wrong we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.”&#xa0;Comments by two leading people involved in the IPCC make the political agenda clear:-&#xa0;&#xa0;“The climate summit in Cancun —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War.”&#xa0;“One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”&#xa0;              “If global emission rights are distributed – If this happens, on a per capita basis, then Africa will be the big winner, and huge amounts of money will flow there.”&#xa0;              “One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.”&#xa0;&#xa0; “I am not going to rest easy until I have articulated in every possible form the need to bring about major structural changes in economic growth and development. That’s the real issue. Climate change is just a part of it.”&#xa0;Pachauri has publicly admitted that government bodies influence how the IPCC operates and reports, commenting:-&#xa0;“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governments of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”&#xa0;Pachauri is here letting the cat out of the bag.  The first word of IPCC is intergovernmental, and governments are political bodies.&#xa0;The hypothesis implicit in all IPCC writings is that dangerous global warming will result from human related CO2 emissions.&#xa0;3.              THE IPCC’S FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT&#xa0;There are a few improvements in the science in AR5 – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick and reinstated the Medieval Warming Period, and has dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and that flooding and drought will become more serious.  But it is strangely quiet about the feedback of climate sensitivity, which has inflated the estimates of future supposed warming by CO2, and it is slightly more modest in its estimates of future warming.  &#xa0;The main shortcomings are that the report is unable to explain the 16 or 17 year pause in global warming, a shortcoming which is linked to the second shortcoming.  Namely despite the expenditure of hundreds of £M on climate models they do not track global temperature accurately.  Furthermore there are factual errors in the report, and it does not take account of the increasing evidence for the influence of the sun on the climate.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1              Finessing the temperature pause&#xa0;The full Science report comments:-&#xa0;This difference between simulated and observed trends could be caused by some combination of (a) internal climate variability, (b) missing or incorrect radiative&#xa0;forcing, and (c) model response error.&#xa0;The relevant text is in Box 9.2 of the full report and runs to five pages of incomprehensible jargon and gibble gabble which does not explain the pause.Another storyline is that 16 or 17 years is not long enough to reliably assess trends in climate change, and so we must wait some more.  But this principle was not applied by the “warmists” during the 1980s and 1990s when a decade of warming was enough to set the alarm bells ringing on ACW due to CO2 and a few more years ring them louder to scare us.&#xa0;Paul Homewood shows how the IPCC graphs misrepresened the longer term temerature trend:-&#xa0;“Their base period of 1951-2013, against which they have measured post 1998 trends, includes:-&#xa0;1.              28 years of cooling – 1951-792.              22 years of warming – 1979-20013.              12 years of cooling again – 2001-2013&#xa0;So, in total, during 40 out of the 62 years there has been a cooling trend. They are comparing a statistically insignificant amount of warming since 1998, with three decades of cooling. The result is to make this small trend sound much more significant than it is.It would surely have been more honest to have compared the post 1998 trend with the 1979-98 period. If they had have done this, of course, most people would realised that the much trumpeted global warming really had stopped for the time being. And, in the IPCC’s eyes, that was not the message they wanted people to hear.”&#xa0;Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus, Program in Atmospheres, Oceans, and Climate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, observed:-&#xa0;“I think that the latest IPCC report has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.&#xa0; They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…&#xa0;Their excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the heat is hiding in the deep ocean.&#xa0; However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…&#xa0;Finally, in attributing warming to man, they fail to point out that the warming has been small, and totally consistent with there being nothing to be alarmed about.&#xa0; It is quite amazing to see the contortions the IPCC has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going.”&#xa0;3.2              Massaging the models&#xa0;The final draft SPM (which was leaked) identified that “Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10–15 years”.  This admission disappeared in the final version. &#xa0; McIntyre points out that a draft of the report “clearly showed the discrepancy between models and observations, though IPCC’s covering text reported otherwise…Needless to say, this diagram did not survive.  Instead, IPCC replaced the damning (but accurate) diagram with a new diagram in which the inconsistency has been disappeared…Now here is the replacement graphic in the Approved Draft: this time, observed values are no longer outside the projection envelopes from the earlier reports. IPCC described it as follows:-&#xa0;               Even though the projections from the models were never intended to be predictions over such a short time scale, the observations through 2012 generally fall within the projections made in all past assessments.”&#xa0;McIntyre explains how the IPCC massaged the exhibit to arrive at this result, and  comments “None of this portion of the IPCC assessment is drawn from peer-reviewed material.  Nor is it consistent with the documents sent to external reviewers.”&#xa0;

A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), “The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth’s Climate,” lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar activity can make itself felt on our planet.”&#xa0;A new paper by two Dutchmen at the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands “found that that during the major part of the four centuries investigated, i.e. the period 1610 till&#xa0; around&#xa0; 1900 – 1950 , the&#xa0; average terrestrial ground temperatures depend solely on solar magnetic field variations.

Have the IPCC adequately addresses criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions? &#xa0;              The headline conclusions are flimsy; the IPCC has addressed some of the criticisms but not the main ones about the extent of man’s effect on the climate.  There is extensive scope to question the AR5’s conclusion about a very basic issue, namely “Statistical Analyses of Surface Temperatures in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report” by Douglas Keenan explained the complexities, uncertainties, in developing trends from time series data, in particualr the pitfalls in choosing statistical  models. He then shows the simplistic manner in which the IPCC adopted a model; and argues that (S 10.2.2) “[the IPCC] effectively acknowledges that we do not understand the data well enough to choose a statistical model.”  He concludes “Simply put, no one has yet presented valid statistical analysis of any observational data to show global warming is real. Moreover, that applies to any warming - whether attributable to humans or to nature.  This is implied by S 10.2.2 and indeed is clear from statistics”&#xa0;2.              To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?&#xa0;              It reflects the views of “state scientists” in Britain (i.e. those directly on the government’s payroll including the Met Office, and those in universities seeking grants funded by the government, who must be politically correct).  But it does not reflect the views of many “free” climate scientists in North America, ANZAC, and some continental countries.

Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?&#xa0;              The approach of claiming 90% in AR4 and in AR5 95% probabilities of confidence in belief of this and that is bizarre, increasing the IPCC’s confidence as the divergence between models and reality increased. The probablity figures have nothing to do with scientific or statistical methodology, but all to do with politics &#xa0;5.              Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?&#xa0;              No – it attempted to finesse their inaccuracy&#xa0;6.              Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?&#xa0;              No – it fudged the issue&#xa0;7.              Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? &#xa0;              Weaken, if not eliminate&#xa0;8.              What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally? &#xa0;              It should have little either nationally or internationally because it does not make a scientific (as opposed to PR) case for ACW&#xa0;9.              Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?&#xa0;              No to the first sentence; yes to the second&#xa0;10.              To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis summary? &#xa0;              It is a political document like its predecessors, crawled over by officials from various governments &#xa0;11.              Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? &#xa0;              Most inappropriate because the conclusions drawn from the science are so weak

As Peter Lilley MP pointed out in a recent speech in Westminster Hall, the increase in China’s CO2 emissions in 2011 was 200Mt more than the total emitted by the UK. In a presentation on 14 October 2013 to the World Energy Congress Wood Mackenzie forecast that global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25% by the end of the decade slightly overtaking oil on energy source.

[[[TCOME.]]]&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I studied engineering at the universities of Bristol and Virginia and some economics at the LSE.  I was on the board of London Electricity.  In  February 1987 I was the first person in Britain to propose a competitive restructuring of the electric industry.  Following the election of June 1987 I was involved with Secretary of State Cecil Parkinson and civil servants in the early days of restructuring.  Subsequently I have worked on electric markets from Norway to New Zealand via North America.  I wrote “The British Electric Industry 1990-2010: the rise and demise of competition”.  My interest in climate science was stimulated by the effect it has had on the British government’s belief in anthropogenic climate warming, which has led to very expensive policies for renewables and nuclear power.
