&#xa0;Written evidence Community Transport Association (TIC )&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This evidence is submitted by the Community Transport Association (CTA), a national charity providing leadership, learning and enterprise support to organisations delivering innovative and flexible transport solutions to achieve social change in their communities.  The CTA currently has around 1,500 member organisations.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The demand for community transport (CT) has increased in recent years for a variety of reasons, particularly in isolated areas. Services include demand responsive routes, dial-a-ride, voluntary car schemes, minibus hire, scheduled bus services, wheels to work and patient/visitor transport, as well as brokerage, training and community development.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CTA welcomes the inclusion of CT in the Transport Committees inquiry and the opportunity to provide written evidence. We would also welcome the opportunity to provide further insights and ideas about the important role CT can plays in supporting isolated communities when oral evidence is being heard in the autumn.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;2.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Community Transport Association:  The CTA provides a voice for CT across the UK with a long history of consulting members and the sector and articulating the views and needs of community based transport to policy makers at a national (and devolved) government level.  In so doing, it is able to comment on demand at a strategic level as it consults with operators around the country at regional events, members meetings and via national conferences and through electronic communication groups.&#xa0;2.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Sub-regional/county CT consortia:  We are seeing the development of more county/sub-regional bodies supporting the development of community transport in their area, including formally constituted consortia of which Suffolk, Devon, Norfolk, Greater Manchester are all good examples.  They can act as a conduit for communication with local government on the needs of CT providers and users.&#xa0;2.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authority consultation, research and transport departments:  Local authorities in some areas have an excellent record of consulting with both CT providers and CT users.  They commission their own research from time to time and transport department staff are frequently very knowledgeable on policy and operational matters.  This experience is not universal, however, and the CT sector does struggle to engage with local authorities in many areas.&#xa0;2.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CTA State of the Sector (SOTS) reports:  The CTA researches and publishes its SOTS reports in England (and other countries of the UK) in order to continually improve the available evidence base on CT.  These reports are used to build a better picture of CT service development across England.  This development reflects demand for services given the fact that CT services are established in direct response to identified user need.&#xa0;2.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Additional data sources:  Additional publicly available research and data analyses will be used by authorities to, such as:&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;2.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Account taken of different groups’ requirements is patchy:  It is the experience of the CTA and the CT sector that the account taken of different groups’ needs can vary widely by area.  Typically this can depend on the structure of the local authority transport department or even on the commitment of a small team or one individual.&#xa0;2.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lack of network planning due to the unregulated bus market:  There is a lack of ability to develop planned public transport networks outside London due to the de-regulated nature of the market.  This, in turn, means that it can be difficult for local authorities to influence the extent to which services take account of different passenger groups in isolated areas.  The current economic climate also means that authorities are less able to support socially necessary bus services through tendered routes.&#xa0;2.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disadvantaged groups’ needs are often an afterthought:  It is understandable that transport authorities and operators seek to maximise the efficiency of the services they procure and/or operate.  Too often, however, the needs of marginalised groups of people are not fully considered from the outset.  One clear example of this is the failure to require the mandatory reimbursement for transportation of eligible concessionary pass holders on services (such as community transport) where no registered local bus service operates or where such services are inaccessible to users.  The transport of young people is also a particular issue as no consistent concessionary arrangement exists for them across England.  A national young persons’ concession would not only help to address the problems of isolation for young people, it would also help to build the habit at an early age of using public/community transport rather than assuming obtaining a car is the solution to all transport problems.&#xa0;2.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Expectation that CT will pick up needs that others cannot meet:  In recent years we have seen a growing assumption that CT services will grow to fill the gaps that commercial/statutory providers are unable to.  However, this increasing demand for CT services is set against a backdrop of decreasing funding which is stretching many to breaking point.  Many CT operators have sought to develop a social enterprise business model in order to become more sustainable.  This has been successful for some but has also resulted in some struggling to manage new business relationships, particularly when service commissioners do not appear prepared to pay for the full cost of the service received.  There is only limited use of community audit or transport needs analysis at district or parish level, which could potentially better inform authorities of user needs.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome? &#xa0;2.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lack of integrated network planning:  The inability to plan and develop an integrated network is a challenge for transport authorities. The lack of bus route/market regulation which would allow this means that only profitable routes are developed in many areas.  This leads to an expectation that transport authorities and/or the CT sector will pick up on the needs of those who cannot access commercial bus services.&#xa0;2.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Silo funding mentality:  Local authorities, health agencies, government departments and other bodies appear to be trying to protect their own budgets rather than focusing on the strategic benefits of integrated services. The complex nature of the NHS and its particular transport requirements is a significant challenge in this respect.  There is evidence of the NHS reducing transport provision in some areas by changing (tightening) eligibility criteria in order to reduce transport spend.  This merely has the effect of requiring someone else (typically CT or local authorities) to deliver the transport.  It is not unusual for the CT sector to deliver transport to health because the NHS will not or cannot pay for it.  In many cases the charitable/voluntary sector is not receiving full cost recovery for services provided and so it is, in effect, subsidising the statutory sector (eg the NHS).&#xa0;2.3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Restrictive national policy:  In some cases, national policy is restricted to too narrow a field.  For instance, the lack of a mandatory obligation to reimburse local CT operators running Section 19 services at separate fares for transporting eligible concessionary passengers means that many CT operators end up subsidising these passengers themselves.&#xa0;2.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Service information:  Information on existing services should be more visible and accessible and more detailed guidance is required on how isolated communities can improve public and community transport (for instance by running more services themselves).&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved? &#xa0;2.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Community transport is based on user need:  CT is flexible and responsive to local need and as a sector.  It understands passenger requirements so services are devised to meet their needs.  CT is the only sector of the public transport market that was conceived and designed to deliver community development and equality of opportunity – it merely uses transport as the tool to do this.  There has been huge increase in the demand for CT in recent years but at the same time, the available funding has reduced the sector’s ability to service need is becoming ever more compromised.&#xa0;2.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CTA State of the Sector reporting illustrates the impact of the sector:  Three reports have now been published by the CTA (2009, 2010 and 2012) on the state of the CT sector in England.  The next report is due for publication in 2014.  Although covering the whole of England, the 2012 report also included a particular focus on rural areas, which is where many communities and individuals suffer from isolation.  Some of the key findings on the CT sector in England summarised in this report were:&#xa0;&#xa0;2.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Improving community transport: The effectiveness of CT could still be greatly improved by implementing a number of measures.  These include:&#xa0;Investing in growth through transport&#xa0;&#xa0;Permits &amp; operator licensing&#xa0;&#xa0;Drivers licensing&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services? &#xa0;2.5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Improving the DRT network:  Reliance on taxis and DRT as opposed to fixed route local bus services could be acceptable (assuming CT is included in the definition of DRT) providing a sufficiently diverse network exists.  Flexible community based DRT can meet needs for many people but it needs investment.  It is also imperative that the systemic discrimination that exists within the concessionary travel system that prevents many isolated people from accessing such services is tackled.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable? &#xa0;2.6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Service integration and cross-sector benefits:  Challenges presented by the lack of integrated planning are detailed above.  There needs to be a requirement on all publicly funded services to assess the impact of their planning and service provision in order to consider how they can integrate with other sectors.  It is also important that the real cost of service provision is recognised insofar as those using or procuring services (particularly when this is done indirectly) meet the full and realistic cost of the service which they are receiving.&#xa0;2.6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Brokerage and shared resources:  The default position for all publicly funded services/operators/vehicles is that they should be shared and accessible to the maximum number of people unless it can be shown that there is a real and pressing reason for this not to happen.  In isolated communities, it is particularly important that scare resources are effectively utilised.  There is no reason why NHS, local authority, school or CT vehicles cannot be used to help meet the needs of groups other their core clients.&#xa0;2.6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Full cost recovery for voluntary car schemes:  Hundreds (possibly thousands) of car schemes operate across the country.  Transport authorities and the NHS frequently make use of these services to support the delivery of their statutory obligations.  This engagement needs to be more formally recognised and statutory agencies must pay the full cost of the services/benefits they are receiving.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CTA has shared this evidence with its (1,500) member organisations for discussion and would be keen to expand further on those discussions and the points above through oral evidence to the Transport Committee.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
