"Written Evidence Submitted by Keep Wales Tidy (KWT)BackgroundKWT is an independent National Voluntary Organisation with Charitable Status.\n&#xa0;\n We are \none of Wales’ largest and most effective environmen\ntal charities\n, \ncovering the whole\n of Wales \nand influencing a wide range of organisations and communities\n. Our approach leads to sustainable change\n \nthrough \ninfluencing behaviour and enabling individuals, groups and schools to take their own actions. \n&#xa0;\nOur focus is on people \nand their connections with the environment. \nWe deal with far more than litter\n;\n \nour work encompasses biodiversity, access and recreation, health improvement, \nfood growing, beach awards, Eco-\nSchools, Young Reporter for the Environment and so forth. \nOur work is underpinned by research and policy work \nincluding; Local Environmental Quality Surveys and developing advice for Government and other stakeholders.\n&#xa0;\nIn relation to the \nforthcoming charge for plastic bags in England\n, KWT would like to put forward the following evidence\n based on \nour experience in relation to \nthe \nSUCB \nlevy in Wales.\n  \nKWT continues to support the \nSUCB \nlevy on the grounds that it both protects and improves our environment. \n \nIt has successfully reduced the consumption of carrier bags in Wales, and therefore the impact they have in manufacture and disposal (including litter). Meanwhile the proceeds of the levy are making a tangible difference \nto\n many charitable causes, including environmental projects.\nThe \nSUCB l\nevy came into being in Wales on 1\nst\n October 2011. \nKWT\n was fully supportive of the Welsh Government in introducing the levy and the evidence below sets out our reasons for continued support\n,\n as well as suggestions moving forward. KWT understands that the W\nelsh Government\n is to review the policy in \nNovember 2014\n, at which point KWT \nwill s\nubmit \nfurther evidence\n.\nIn terms of u\nsage\n, \n8.1bn single-use carrier bags were used in the UK in 2012; a 1.3% rise on th\ne \nprevious year. However, regional differences show that \nin Wales carrier bag use fell over this period by 76%. \nIn the same time frame, the number of bags used per person per month in Wales reduced from 7.4 to 1.8.\n W\nelsh Government\n information based on 13 \nretailers\n shows further reductions in carrier bag use of between 35-96%\n \nafter the introduction of the levy\n. This range suggests that some retail sectors\n, \nparticularly food service and fashion\n,\n are harder to tackle than others \n- \nand that targeted work may be needed for further improvements.   \nIn measuring the success of the scheme, the Welsh Government has commissioned research to understand the extent of the reduction in bag use generated\n,\n and to understand how the general public feels about the levy.  \nThe levy has been \nseen to increase own bag use in Wales from 61% \nto 82%\n.\n Over this period public support for the levy has also increased\n:\n from 59% to 80%\n. \nK\nWT\n has observed a decrease in littered carrier bags through \nour Local Environmental Audit and Management System \nLEAMS\n \nstreet\n data, albeit only marginal. In the full survey year prior to the introduction of the levy carrier bags were found on an average of 1.1% of each local authority’s streets. Since the introduction of the levy that figure has dropped to 0.9%. The percentage of streets littered with carrier bags has reduced in 12 of the 22 local authorities and remained the same in a further four.\nMeanwhile \nKWT\n has long recognised that street-data is likely to significantly understate the extent of littered carrier bags. This owes to the physical properties of carrier bags which render them not readily degradable, meaning they persist for long periods in the environment and are easily transportable by weathe\nr, causing wide dispersal. Keep Wales Tidy \nstaff and volunteers routinely remove bags that have blown in\nto trees and along river banks.\nProceeds from the ChargeThe Waste (Wales) Measure 2010 gives Welsh Ministers the power create regulations which would impose duties on retailers on the destination of proceeds from the charge. However this has not been used; instead the W\nelsh \nG\novernment\n advocates a voluntary agreement\n and the success of \nthis agreement is to be measured by meeting the principles that:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe net proceeds are passed on to good causes.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere possible, the net proceeds will benefit Wales.\n&#xa0;\nThe small number of businesses across Wales found to be failing to enforce the charge has been seen as a marker of the scheme’s success\n. The proceeds from the charge are making a substantial difference in Wales, with 100s of thousands of pounds already being pledged to ‘good causes’\n.\nGoing ForwardKWT should like to see data on usage and street cleanliness continuously monitored. If support for the levy waivers, then it may be necessary to reinforce the messages which have, so far, succeeded in gaining support. It may also be beneficial to publicise the good causes that \nbenefit \nfrom the proceeds of the charge\n, including amongst retailers\n.\nE\nxperience from the Republic of Ireland suggests that as time goes on, people may get used to paying for bags and, as such, bag use may rise. Should this prove to be the case then consideration should be given to increasing the value of the charge. KWT has previously stated that a cost of up to 15p would be reasonable. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition, we’d like to\n include \ninform\nation on \nthe current debate in Wales relating to bags for life\n linked to the proposed Environment Bill.\nThe ‘Towards the Sustainable Management of Wales’ Natural Resources’ White Paper \nproposes to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags\n.\nKWT agrees with this proposal due to the increased use and disposal of, for example bags for life, and the detrimental effect that these can have on the environment.\nHowever, we recognise the aims of the levy will have failed if the charge and distribution of funding goes on forever, as the key aim is change behaviour - reduce waste and litter and the negative environmental impacts.\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-publishes-new-figures-carrier-bag-use\n \n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-publishes-new-figures-carrier-bag-use\nhttp://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/epq/waste_recycling/substance/carrierbags/reduction/?lang=en\nhttp://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/epq/waste_recycling/substance/carrierbags/attituderesearch/?lang=en\n \nhttp://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/retailers/reportingback/?lang=en\n Only six businesses found in breach of the carrier bag charge’, The Western Mail, 10/09/12\n‘Carrier bag charge reduces bag handout by up to 96%’, The Western Mail, 18/07/12\n"
