defaultThe world faces major challenges – from climate change, to resource use, to

defaultchallenges for the

defaultBringing
default these technologies to market 
defaultis 
defaultoften too expensive and risky for industry to de

default In the case of academic research
default,
default private companies are 
defaultrarely
default incentivised to engage in such activities
default without public sector intervention and support
default. 
default Even later stage innovation is often too expensive and risky for companies to engag
defaulte in alone
default where costs to commercialise a new product may run to tens of millions over many years
default.
default 
default  
defaultPublic funding acts as an enabler in de-risking investment, through mechanisms such as grants which part fund the development of technologies
default along

defaultvate sector investment
default.

defaultIn order to deliver its objectives, Government 
defaultprovides
default support
default and incentives
default for 
defaultthe research,

default and deployment of innovative technologies

default:
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s policy is to 
defaultensure the UK 
defaultcan develop and deploy
default the energy technologies
default required to deliver on its economic and 
defaultlow 
defaultcarbon objectives
default. 
defaultThese technologies cover a range of sectors, including energy generation, industrial energy 
defaultefficiency, heat and built environment, and transport.
default 
defaultGovernment
default targets public sector incentives on technologies 
defaultthat
default 
defaultwould not be delivered by the market alone a
defaultnd 
defaultwhich 
defaultcan also provide wider societal benefits, such as knowledge and learning, reduced energy costs, employment and exports
default.  
default 
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK will not meet its low carbon targets with current technologies at today’s costs.  Innovation in low carbon technologies is essential if we are to transition to a low carbon society cost effectively.  
defaultGiven its scale, complexity and interdependencies
default, the energy system can neither be transformed quickly nor by a single “silver bullet”. Rather, innovation must occur across a broad front 
defaultfrom generation through to use, at a component and system level.
default  
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLow carbon technologies can take decades to develo
defaultp, with inherently high costs and risks during pre-commercial stages. 
defaultMarket failures and barriers include p
defaultoor market signals, long payback periods, under-developed supply chains
default,
default and knowledge spill-overs that make it cheaper to replicate existing techno
defaultlogies than to develop 
defaultthem
default from scratch. 
defaultThese
default barriers have meant that businesses have tended to under-invest in low carbon innovation
default.  
default At the same time, while market incentives provide confidence to technology developers that there will be a return on
default investment, in many cases these are not 
defaultsufficient t
defaulto drive the required innovation.  Low carbon innovation is normally taken forwards by different businesses with different skills sets to those deploying the technologies which receive incentives.
default 
defaultFor exa
defaultmple, bioenergy technologies requires considerable up-front investment across the entire agricultural supply and value chain to realise future benefits as well as investor confidence and a 
defaultsupportive policy environment.  To fully realise the benefits will 
defaultrequire a thirty year time horizon, but 
defaultonce established the returns from well managed energy crops are effectively sustainable indefinitely.
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor these reasons, 
defaultpublic sector
default investment is a critical component in addressing market failures, managing risk a
defaultnd achieving technological breakthroughs, while leveraging substantial funding from the private sector or other governments. 
defaultPublicly funded programmes
default range from fully funding the most uncertain phases of primary research through to joint funding and risk
default sharing in the later stages, as technologies approach commercialisation. 
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe aim of these policies and programmes is to take key technologies to the point at which they are sufficiently proven
default, that the market,
default 
defaultpotentially 
defaultwith the support of market mech
defaultanisms
default (such as the Renewables Obligation), or in partnership with the Green Investment Bank can
default deploy them widely.

defaultdeliver economic benefit to the UK and
default/or
default reduce the cost of energy
default while reduc
defaulting greenhouse gas emissions to meet legally binding targets
default that stretch out to 2050
default.  
defaultThe energy system is highly complex with multiple technologies interacting through multip
defaultle interfaces. Supporting innovation across the whole energy system and the full innovation journey is therefore also complicated. Energy also touches on many government policies and priorities including 
defaultI
defaultndustrial 
defaultStrategy
default, regional economies, environment
default, housing and transport. No single support mechanism or programme could deliver the range of support needed to deliver the diversity and scale of technology innovation required across the system.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment support therefore is provided in a range of ways 
defaultby a range of Departments and Agencies

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default defaultThe defaultETIdefault is a public-private partnership which receives half of its funding from Government and the remainder from 7 large industrial companies (BP, Caterpillar, EDF, E.ON, Roll

defaulttest and demonstration leasing p
defaultrogramme facilitate
defaults
default successful demonstration of technology breakthroughs, through existing sites, new sites and non-grid sites, 
defaultallowing offshore wind manufacturers greater flexibility to deploy and test wind turbines alongside existing projects in UK wat
defaulters.  The Department for Communities and Local Government uses
default regulation and policy to ensure the construction of low carbon buildings
default. The Department for Transport has a renewable transport policy including support for the most sustainable biofuels, in a
defaultddition to innovation in freight and low emission vehicles.
default The Welsh Government , with ‘low carbon , energy and environment’ as one of its three science grand challenges, makes extensive
default&#xa0;
default use of its EU Structural Fund programmes to support low carbon innovation.”
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment and members of the LCICG have strategies and delivery plans which have been developed with and disseminated to the low carbon sector.  The LCICG will develop a shared strategy in 
defaultearly 2014 
defaultwhich 
defaultdefines the agreed priorities for future programm
defaulte delivery.
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSignificant public sector RD&amp;D investment in low carbon technologies is needed to accelerate deployment and to capture economic gains. With constrained resour
defaultces, government needs to prioritise and target its investments in those technology areas that promise to deliver maximum value both in terms of cost, carbon savings, and economic impact
default for the UK
default.
default  Inevitably some technologies will be required to be bough
defaultt in from abroad.
default  
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultTINA project was launched in autumn 2010 
defaultby
default LCICG, combined with input from sector experts and organisations. Its aim is to create a robust shared knowledge base to inform coordinated programme planning and to support a portfolio ap
defaultproach to innovation investments. The TINAs consolidate existing research and experience across government and apply a consistent methodology to identify and value the potential for innovation within those technologies likely to be most important in achiev
defaulting our energy and emissions targets and in delivering economic benefits. For each selected technology area, the TINAs identify key innovation needs out to 2050, including an assessment of:
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe TINAs have already been used extensively by a number of LCICG organisations, for example in 
defaultthe development of current programmes, in the drafting of strategy documents such as the Off-shore Wind Industrial Strategy and in the des
defaultign and launch of specific initiatives such as the Off-shore Renewables Catapult
default.
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe TINAs
default focus
default on those technologies that previous modelling and analysis (by individual LCICG members, the Energy Research Partnership and the Committee on Climate Change) 
defaultsuggested were of particular importance to government objectives
default and where significant and coordinated UK government support was likely needed. These are:
defaultBioenergy
defaultCarbon Capture and Storage
defaultDomestic Buildings
defaultElectricity Networks and Storage
defaultHeat
defaultHydrogen for Transport
defaultIndustrial 
defaultProcesses
defaultMarine
defaultNon-domestic Buildings
defaultNuclear Fission
defaultOffshore Wind

default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is not 
defaultintended to be 
defaulta definitive list
default 
defaultof all technology families that could contribute to the UK’s energy and growth objectives. 
defaultThe LCICG
default 
defaultcontinue
default to monitor technology developments
default and we will expand the TINA evidence base to include other technologies if 
defaultthe Group identifies
default a need for TINA 
defaultanalysis.
default 
defaultCurrently 
default3 areas for further work – Solar PV, Industrial CCS and Heat Networks – 
defaultare bein
defaultg considered for
default 2014.
default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuilding on 
defaultthe LCICG’s joint work to date the LCICG members are drafting a strategic document that will help the Group work closely together to develop its future work programmes. That document will
default describe ho
defaultw public 
defaultsector-
defaultbacked innovation support is delivered in the UK, summarise the progress made to date in strengthening coordination, 
defaultwill
default set out 
defaultthe Group’s
default shared aims and objectives and 
defaultwill 
defaultdetail how 
defaultthe Group
default plan to work together to further strength
defaulten 
defaulttheir
default coordination and impact in the future.
default29.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrioritising our resources on those innovations where the need is most pressing and where our investment can have the most impact is a key challenge for the Group. 
defaultThe 
defaultTINAs
default described above
default analysed and quantified the impact of technology innovation needs for a dozen technology sectors
default. The 
defaultdocument 
defaultwill 
defaulttake that analysis a step 
defaultfurther by
default set
defaultting
default out what 
defaultthe Group
default believe are the key innovation needs in each of those dozen technology sectors and assess
defaulting
default the scale of support that would be needed to address those needs.  
default30.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe document will provide a framework for future prioritisation
default,
default it will not however set out a
default prioritised work programme. The UK government alone cannot support all the innovation needs identified and difficult choices will have to be made. 
defaultT
defaulthose choices will need to be informed by the success or otherwise of current innovation programmes, the dev
defaultelopment of the technologies over the next few years, the development of wider energy policy and the availability of funding in future spending rounds. The future investment decisions made by members of the Group will be informed by the analysis in the doc
defaultument and the principles set out in it.  
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs outlined in the NAO
default’s Public Funding for Innovation in Low Carbon Technologies in the UK
default report, m
defaulteasuring the return on innovation RD&amp;D programmes is complex, not least due to inter-linkages 
defaultwith deployment support and other policies, though there is some evidence
default that such programmes can result in significant returns.
default32.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe LCICG have developed a common set of seven low carbon energy innovation metrics
default which are being piloted
default.  The metrics 
defaultaim
default to
default 
defaultevaluate the impact and outcomes the LCICG’s programmes have had against the core themes of 
defaultdelivering: affordable, secure, low carbon energy for the UK; UK economic growth; and the UK’s capabilities, knowledge and skills.
default33.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe metrics will 
defaultaim to 
defaultident
defaultify projects 
defaultand programmes 
defaultin which significant cost reduction or improved efficiency has been achieved. By tracking the estimated costs of technologies we 
defaultlook to
default 
defaultshow progress towards commercial viability. 
defaultThe vision is for 
defaultLCICG 
defaultto
default 
defaultuse this data to loo
defaultk for longer-term evidence that LCICG-supported innovations are having a beneficial impact on cost reductions in commercial technology.
default&#xa0;
default34.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe metrics 
defaultlook to
default 
defaultcapture the contribution of the LCICG to UK growth, where commercial sales or increased company val
defaultuation occurs within 3 years of receiving LCICG support. 
defaultIncreased international sales also contribute to this measure. 
default For
default less commercial technologies, by tracking estimated years to market the LCICG can forecast when it expects economic impact to occur
default.  
defaultAnalysis will 
defaultsupport 
defaultthe LCICG to spot valleys of death in technology sub areas which has not been possible with a top down approach.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe LCICG needs to 
defaultenable
default a healthy UK innovation system if it is to succeed in delivering 
defaultits
default aims. 
defaultAdoption of t
defaulthe metrics will measure the generation of unique knowledge and inventions, the mobilisation of financial capital and perceived UK skills gaps. 
defaultIt
default will also
default support
default identify where LCICG collaborations have 
defaultprecipitated new innovation ac
defaulttivity and identify k
defaultey players in the landscape.
default36.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to the LCICG metrics
default,
default individual members adopt 
defaultin-house 
defaultevaluation processes to measure their programmes successes against their original objectives.   
defaultThi
defaults section aims to provide evidence against the Committee’s
default defaultquestion
default 
default5
default: 
defaultWhat is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?
default37.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUK Government investment leverages substantial funding from other sources and private sector funding
default for development or demonstration projects usually matches or exceeds the government investment.
default  The balance of 
defaultpublic and private 
defaultfunding is dependent on the project type
default and European State Aid limits.
default38.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrivate investment in low carbon generation and 
defaultenergy efficiency technologies plays a crucial role in innovation, and is influenced by expected returns, the cost of capital and its availability, the degree of regulatory certainty, perceived risks (demand, technological and political), and the extent to
default which firms can enter and exit markets with ease. Al
defaultt
defaultogether, a ‘productive ecosystem’ is required to encourage innovation, including conditions in which risks can be understood, managed and anticipated. For conventional private funds, 
defaultsuch as commercial 
defaultbanks, 
defaultwhich generally have a low appetite for risk, the uncertainties inherent in the development of energy technologies will often be sufficiently large to dissuade investment.
default 
default39.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe LCICG members seek to reduce these risks by offering a range of interve
defaultntions which may benefit different innovations such as capital grants, equity investment and incubation.  The members also play a different role in the commercialisation of technologies at different stages of development.  
default40.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInnovation, particularly in the 
defaulte
defaultnergy sector, can take a long time. Most public sector funding for low carbon
default innovation 
defaultis constrained by the 
defaultspending r
defaultound timetables which limit commitments beyond the current spending round. This lack of long term certainty that support will be avail
defaultable can be a barrier to investment by private sector innovators. Some public-sector 
defaultbacked bodies such as 
defaultthe Energy Technologies Institute and the Catapult Centres and 
defaulthave
default,
default however
default,
default been able to plan activities on 
defaulta 
defaultlong
defaulter time horizon. 
default41.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultUK 
defaultGovernme
defaultnt’s industrial strategies
default,
default published in 2013
default,
default set out how 
defaultgovernment aims to overcome specific barriers faced by businesses developing their technologies, including for the offshore wind, construction and nuclear sectors.  These include access to finance;
default partnerships with sectors; support for emerging technologies; creating a pipeline of skilled workers; and government procurement to support the development of supply chains.
default 
defaultSome specific 
defaultrecent 
defaultexamples:
default42.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to the UK industrial strategies 
defaultScotland developed 
defaultspecific strategies for its key strategic sectors such as the 
defaultOffshore Wind Ro
defaultute Map.
default43.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany
default low carbon
default innovations are driven by 
defaultvery small businesses
default which can
defaultno
defaultt raise capital from banks as their businesses are pre-revenue
default generating
default.  They often seek support from Angel or 
defaultV
defaultenture 
defaultC
defaultapital 
defaultinvestors.  The public low carbon innovati
defaulton landscape offers a range of solutions to support different type of businesses, third sector organisations and academia 
defaultto 
defaultget the support they need, 
defaultmainly in the form of
default capital grants
default and
default procuring their 
defaulttechnology
default but also to a lesser extent equity and business incubation
default.
default 
default44.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is through coordinated 
defaulta

defaultof an ‘energy catalyst’ fund that could support the best new energ
defaulty technologies from concept all the way through to commercialisation in a continuous manner and at the time when needed.  This kind of mechanism could provide greater certainty of public support to low carbon technology developers.
default  
defaultFor example, t
defaulthe RCUK a
defaultnd TSB are to launch the Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (IB Catalyst) in January 2014.  The IB Catalyst will fund proposals to support the early translation of research (including gaseous and liquid biofuels) from groups led by academics only, academic-
defaultindustrial collaborations and industrialists.   
defaultThis section provides evidence against the Committee’s
default 
defaultquestion
default 7
default: 
defaultHow is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with i
defaultnternational partners within and beyond the EU?
default46.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe LCICG members 
defaulthave increasingly looked for opportunities to
default collaborate with foreign partners to research, develop and demonstrate low carbon technologies of mutual interest. There is good potential to ma
defaultke more of the UK’s reputation for high quality research and our attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment. 
defaultThe UK can
default build on this to work with others in addressing challenges that nation states cannot tackle alone, to share costs and
default risks, accelerate technology development and 
defaultdisseminate
default lessons learned.
default47.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK also works in partnership with other countries, with RCUK offices in China, India and USA. Over the last few years RCUK has funded activities in key technologies with China i
defaultn renewable energy generation technologies, CCS, fuel cells
default, energy storage
default and smart grids worth 
default£30m
default, and with India in fuel cells, smart grids
default, energy storage
default, solar energy and bioenergy, worth £23m, as well as collaborations with India in nuclear resea
defaultrch.
default&#xa0;
default Members of the LCICG are working together to identify new collaboration opportunities in technology areas where the UK has shared interests with other countries.
default&#xa0;
default 
default48.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the EU level, Horizon 2020 has replaced the Framework Programme. Horizon 2020 is intended as a 
defaultsingle integrated mechanism for supporting EU research and innovation, 
defaultand will run from 2014 until 2020. Funding for energy 
defaultresearch and innovation
default will be a
defaultround €1bn a year, 
defaultmore than double
default the amount available previously. Subject to certain conditions, the new mechanism is also open to entities from all over the world, and therefore provides more collaboration opportunities for researchers, scientists and 
defaultinnovative businesses.
default49.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHorizon 2020 presents opportunities for LCICG members to build on the progress made under the Framework Programme - to make greater use of the funding on offer while bringing industry and academia together in productive international
default collaborations
default50.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has been successful in positioning itself at the heart of the EU’s processes for setting energy priorities, under the 
defaultCommunitie
defaults
default’
default 
defaultcoordinated technology programme - the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan). However, there is 
defaultscope to do more: in addition to LCICG members collaborating with each other and with private sector partners, they are increasingly seeking to forge international partnerships to pool resources and share risks in taking forward joint programmes. Internati
defaultonal collaborations help UK companies to gain technical expertise from their foreign counterparts and provide access to new markets.
default51.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne such example in practice is the ‘BESTF’ ERA-NET 
default(Networks Emerging from European Research Area) 
defaultPlus
default, a consortium of 
defaulteight EU Member States, including the UK, and associated countries. This venture is providing funding and support to collaborative bioenergy projects that demonstrate one or more innovative steps resulting in pre-commercial demonstration. 
defaultMembers of the LC
defaultICG are 
defaultalso engaged in ERANETS in Solar and Marine energy technologies
default 
defaultas well as Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy
default52.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK is also engaging in European 
defaultindustry-driven, bottom-up approac
defaulthes
default aimed at facilitating transnational cooperation on technical
default innovation 
defaultsuch as Eurostars, managed by the 
defaultTechnology Strategy Board for SME collaboration in Europe and 
defaultEUROGIA 
defaultunder
default EUREKA
default which has been linked and managed through DECC’s Energy Entrepreneurs Fund.

defaultuse
default 
defaultthe European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as a springboard to launch and establish low carbon energy innovation programmes
default in assisted areas
default.
default54.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe European Commission has identified that a new impetus is needed to join up energy techn
defaultology policies across the EU. Implementation plans for 2013-15 under the SET Plan European Industrial Initiatives are to be drawn up to help identify the priority areas for Member State collaboration in the short term. For the longer term, Horizon 2020 - t
defaulthe EU’s new, simplified research, development, demonstration and deployment support programme - includes international cooperation as an important cross-cutting priority. The expectation among LCICG members and beyond is that exploring productive partnersh
defaultips and finding common interests with others will in future play a much bigger role in low carbon innovation activity

default79.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2010 Spending Review announced 
defaultDECC 
defaultcapital 
defaultfunding of over £200m for low carbon technologies. This included up to £60m for the development of offshore wind manufacturing at port sites. The remaining capi
