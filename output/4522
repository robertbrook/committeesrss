[normal]This is the 
[normal]Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group’s

[normal] 
[normal]The LCICG brings together the major 
[normal]UK 
[normal]public sector backed organisations that 
[normal]support
[normal] low carbon 
[normal]technology 
[normal]innovation. 
[normal]The LCICG members between them expect to invest in excess of £1billion of public funding in low carbon innovation technologies between 2011-15. 
[normal]The LCICG is not an organisation 
[normal]but
[normal] a group of 
[normal]organisations
[normal] which meet 
[normal]regularly
[normal] 
[normal]and work together to deliver 
[normal]a joint workplan
[normal].  
[normal]The Group 
[normal]is supported by a 
[normal]secretariat (0.5FTE) resourced 
[normal]by
[normal] the 
[normal]D
[normal]epartment of Energy and Climate Change
[normal] (DECC)
[normal].  The LCICG
[normal]’s aim is
[normal] 
[normal]to maximise the impact of UK public sector funding for low carbon technologies, in order to:

[normal]This evidence submission focusses on providing 
[normal]factual information 
[normal]against 
[normal]all seven
[normal] questions asked by the Committee
[normal].  
[normal]The evidence given against the questions is not in the 
[normal]same 
[normal]numerical order
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]issued by the Committee
[normal]. 
[normal]The ECC Committee’s question number six focus
[normal]s
[normal]ed on DECC innovation spend for the period 2011-15.  Evidence has been
[normal] provid
[normal]ed against this question 
[normal]by DECC 
[normal]under A

[normal]es on the work of the 
[normal]LCICG
[normal] as whole. To compl
[normal]e
[normal]ment that and to provide more details on some individual programmes
[normal],
[normal] separate submissions have been prepared by the Technology
[normal] Strategy Board and the 
[normal]ETI

[normal]on DECC’s remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation. 
[normal]The LCICG 
[normal]expects to 
[normal]publish a 
[normal]s
[normal]trategy
[normal] document in
[normal] early 20

[normal] which the Committee

[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The world faces major challenges – from climate change, to resource use, to
[normal] population growth and
[normal] changing demographics – and these are creating 
[normal]challenges for the 
[normal]global
[normal] economy and 
[normal]market opportunities for new 
[normal]technology 
[normal]solutions. 
[normal] 
[normal]Failing to respond t
[normal]o these challenges would have 
[normal]a 
[normal]significant impact on our everyday lives.  Energy plays a vital role in the UK economy
[normal] and it is essential for us to maintain affordable and secure supplies for the future.
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Technological i
[normal]nnovation in the energy sector can b
[normal]e defined as the application of new and improved technologies to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of extracting, generating, distributing and using energy. 
[normal]Bringing
[normal] these technologies to market 
[normal]is 
[normal]often too expensive and risky for industry to de
[normal]liver them alone. 
[normal] In the case of academic research
[normal],
[normal] private companies are 
[normal]rarely
[normal] incentivised to engage in such activities
[normal] without public sector intervention and support
[normal]. 
[normal] Even later stage innovation is often too expensive and risky for companies to engag
[normal]e in alone
[normal] where costs to commercialise a new product may run to tens of millions over many years
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]Public funding acts as an enabler in de-risking investment, through mechanisms such as grants which part fund the development of technologies
[normal] along
[normal]side
[normal] pri
[normal]vate sector investment
[normal]. 
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to deliver its objectives, Government 
[normal]provides
[normal] support
[normal] and incentives
[normal] for 
[normal]the research, 
[normal]development
[normal], demonstration
[normal] and deployment of innovative technologies
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]LCICG
[normal] has a proactive low carbon innovation 
[normal]agenda
[normal] 
[normal]which is
[normal] 
[normal]focus
[normal]s
[normal]ed on delivering
[normal] 
[normal]government policy
[normal] objectives
[normal], including
[normal]:
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s policy is to 
[normal]ensure the UK 
[normal]can develop and deploy
[normal] the energy technologies
[normal] required to deliver on its economic and 
[normal]low 
[normal]carbon objectives
[normal]. 
[normal]These technologies cover a range of sectors, including energy generation, industrial energy 
[normal]efficiency, heat and built environment, and transport.
[normal] 
[normal]Government
[normal] targets public sector incentives on technologies 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]would not be delivered by the market alone a
[normal]nd 
[normal]which 
[normal]can also provide wider societal benefits, such as knowledge and learning, reduced energy costs, employment and exports
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK will not meet its low carbon targets with current technologies at today’s costs.  Innovation in low carbon technologies is essential if we are to transition to a low carbon society cost effectively.  
[normal]Given its scale, complexity and interdependencies
[normal], the energy system can neither be transformed quickly nor by a single “silver bullet”. Rather, innovation must occur across a broad front 
[normal]from generation through to use, at a component and system level.
[normal]  
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Low carbon technologies can take decades to develo
[normal]p, with inherently high costs and risks during pre-commercial stages. 
[normal]Market failures and barriers include p
[normal]oor market signals, long payback periods, under-developed supply chains
[normal],
[normal] and knowledge spill-overs that make it cheaper to replicate existing techno
[normal]logies than to develop 
[normal]them
[normal] from scratch. 
[normal]These
[normal] barriers have meant that businesses have tended to under-invest in low carbon innovation
[normal].  
[normal] At the same time, while market incentives provide confidence to technology developers that there will be a return on
[normal] investment, in many cases these are not 
[normal]sufficient t
[normal]o drive the required innovation.  Low carbon innovation is normally taken forwards by different businesses with different skills sets to those deploying the technologies which receive incentives.
[normal] 
[normal]For exa
[normal]mple, bioenergy technologies requires considerable up-front investment across the entire agricultural supply and value chain to realise future benefits as well as investor confidence and a 
[normal]supportive policy environment.  To fully realise the benefits will 
[normal]require a thirty year time horizon, but 
[normal]once established the returns from well managed energy crops are effectively sustainable indefinitely.
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For these reasons, 
[normal]public sector
[normal] investment is a critical component in addressing market failures, managing risk a
[normal]nd achieving technological breakthroughs, while leveraging substantial funding from the private sector or other governments. 
[normal]Publicly funded programmes
[normal] range from fully funding the most uncertain phases of primary research through to joint funding and risk
[normal] sharing in the later stages, as technologies approach commercialisation. 
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The aim of these policies and programmes is to take key technologies to the point at which they are sufficiently proven
[normal], that the market,
[normal] 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]with the support of market mech
[normal]anisms
[normal] (such as the Renewables Obligation), or in partnership with the Green Investment Bank can
[normal] deploy them widely. 
[normal]Innovation can support growth and deployment by reducing risk and costs by :

[normal]s
[normal] evidence against the Committee’s 
[normal]question
[normal] 4
[normal]: 
[normal]Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the 
[normal]innovation process, including over the long-term?

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government
[normal] 
[normal]s
[normal]upports
[normal] UK based companies 
[normal]to 
[normal]develop low carbon innovation technologies.  The funding is focussed on developing low carbon technologies which 
[normal]deliver economic benefit to the UK and
[normal]/or
[normal] reduce the cost of energy
[normal] while reduc
[normal]ing greenhouse gas emissions to meet legally binding targets
[normal] that stretch out to 2050
[normal].  
[normal]The energy system is highly complex with multiple technologies interacting through multip
[normal]le interfaces. Supporting innovation across the whole energy system and the full innovation journey is therefore also complicated. Energy also touches on many government policies and priorities including 
[normal]I
[normal]ndustrial 
[normal]Strategy
[normal], regional economies, environment
[normal], housing and transport. No single support mechanism or programme could deliver the range of support needed to deliver the diversity and scale of technology innovation required across the system.
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government support therefore is provided in a range of ways 
[normal]by a range of Departments and Agencies
[normal]. 
[normal]Funding for low carbon innovation 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]is primarily channelled
[normal] through the Department for Business
[normal],
[normal] Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)
[normal], and the Scottish Government
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]The following section sets out the
[normal] roles of these organisations, 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]the organisations they sponsor, which 
[normal]together 
[normal]make up the core membership of the 
[normal]Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group[bold] (LCICG).
[normal]In addition, associate members of the LCICG also play a fundamental role within the innovation landscape, such include Ofgem, which manages 
[normal]the £500m Low Carbon Ne
[normal]tworks Fund

[normal] 
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DECC and [bold]the [bold]ETI[bold] are the only
[normal] core
[normal] LCICG members which 
[normal]solely 
[normal]have a
[normal]n
[normal] energy focus with both seeking to reduce the cost of energy
[normal] as their primary innovation objective
[normal].  DECC and ETI offer different but complementary approaches to innovati
[normal]on support
[normal] represented by their differ
[normal]ing
[normal] skills mix and governances
[normal].  
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DECC supports innovation by inviting companies to express interest in specific “technology calls” such as components for offshore wind turbines and assesses bids based on their merits.
[normal]  Most of its funding is 
[normal]aimed at
[normal] later stage innovation to support the demonstration of technologies.  DECC provides grants to companies which part fund the development of the technology (in line with European state aid rules) and incubation support to he
[normal]lp smaller companies develop sufficient skills to commercialise technologies. 
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] [bold]The [bold]ETI[bold] is a public-private partnership which receives half of its funding from Government and the remainder from 7 large industrial companies (BP, Caterpillar, EDF, E.ON, Roll
[normal]s Royce, Shell and Hitachi).  The ETI seeks to identify solutions to a particular technology issue
[normal]s
[normal], such as a novel floating wind turbine.  Its solutions 
[normal]generally 
[normal]follow a procurement approach where it invite
[normal]s
[normal] companies 
[normal]and academia 
[normal]to submit proposals t
[normal]o demonstrate how they would deliver the 
[normal]output the ETI seeks
[normal],
[normal] or it

[normal]s
[normal] business development approaches such as taking 
[normal]equity stakes in businesses while providing direct input into how the business 
[normal]is 
[normal]run
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]RCUK[bold] and 
[normal]T[bold]echnology Strategy Board[bold] 
[normal]both 
[normal]adopt an interdisciplinary approach to enabling technology
[normal] innovation.  They 
[normal]prioritise
[normal] their in
[normal]novation on different stages 
[normal]of development and audiences.  
[normal]RCUK 
[normal]funds energy research in early stage technologies to help define and underpin future energy sup
[normal]ply options; enhance the understanding of the social, environmental and economic implications of future energy options; reduce energy consumption and demand through the development of behavioural, governance, market and technological advances; and build ca
[normal]pacity of skilled people.

[normal]More information on RCUK’s energy programme can be found at Annex A.
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Technology Strategy Board
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]the UK innovation agency, stimulating economic growth by helping UK businesses innovate more effectively.  It 
[normal]provides funding
[normal] and collaboration support
[normal] across the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]economy, with energy
[normal], built environment and low carbon transport
[normal] being 
[normal]amongst its key
[normal] 
[normal]focus areas.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Scottish Enterprise’s focus is on stimulating economic growth; exploiting low carbon opportunities; improving Sco
[normal]tland’s business infrastructure; and supporting business
[normal], with Wales and Northern Ireland’s governments having similar interests within their own geographical boundaries
[normal].
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Other members of the 
[normal]LCICG
[normal] which form the “associate” membership 
[normal]typically 
[normal]prioritise
[normal] on a sub-set of technologies and/or do not focus
[normal] on providing direct funding support
[normal], such as grants
[normal],
[normal] to aid technology development,
[normal] but have other innovation
[normal]-
[normal]enabling levers.  For example, the Crown Estate
[normal]’s offshore wind
[normal] 
[normal]test and demonstration leasing p
[normal]rogramme facilitate
[normal]s
[normal] successful demonstration of technology breakthroughs, through existing sites, new sites and non-grid sites, 
[normal]allowing offshore wind manufacturers greater flexibility to deploy and test wind turbines alongside existing projects in UK wat
[normal]ers.  The Department for Communities and Local Government uses
[normal] regulation and policy to ensure the construction of low carbon buildings
[normal]. The Department for Transport has a renewable transport policy including support for the most sustainable biofuels, in a
[normal]ddition to innovation in freight and low emission vehicles.
[normal] The Welsh Government , with ‘low carbon , energy and environment’ as one of its three science grand challenges, makes extensive
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] use of its EU Structural Fund programmes to support low carbon innovation.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government and members of the LCICG have strategies and delivery plans which have been developed with and disseminated to the low carbon sector.  The LCICG will develop a shared strategy in 
[normal]early 2014 
[normal]which 
[normal]defines the agreed priorities for future programm
[normal]e delivery.
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Significant public sector RD&amp;D investment in low carbon technologies is needed to accelerate deployment and to capture economic gains. With constrained resour
[normal]ces, government needs to prioritise and target its investments in those technology areas that promise to deliver maximum value both in terms of cost, carbon savings, and economic impact
[normal] for the UK
[normal].
[normal]  Inevitably some technologies will be required to be bough
[normal]t in from abroad.
[normal]  
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]TINA project was launched in autumn 2010 
[normal]by
[normal] LCICG, combined with input from sector experts and organisations. Its aim is to create a robust shared knowledge base to inform coordinated programme planning and to support a portfolio ap
[normal]proach to innovation investments. The TINAs consolidate existing research and experience across government and apply a consistent methodology to identify and value the potential for innovation within those technologies likely to be most important in achiev
[normal]ing our energy and emissions targets and in delivering economic benefits. For each selected technology area, the TINAs identify key innovation needs out to 2050, including an assessment of:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The TINAs have already been used extensively by a number of LCICG organisations, for example in 
[normal]the development of current programmes, in the drafting of strategy documents such as the Off-shore Wind Industrial Strategy and in the des
[normal]ign and launch of specific initiatives such as the Off-shore Renewables Catapult
[normal].
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The TINAs
[normal] focus
[normal] on those technologies that previous modelling and analysis (by individual LCICG members, the Energy Research Partnership and the Committee on Climate Change) 
[normal]suggested were of particular importance to government objectives
[normal] and where significant and coordinated UK government support was likely needed. These are:
[normal]Bioenergy
[normal]Carbon Capture and Storage
[normal]Domestic Buildings
[normal]Electricity Networks and Storage
[normal]Heat
[normal]Hydrogen for Transport
[normal]Industrial 
[normal]Processes
[normal]Marine
[normal]Non-domestic Buildings
[normal]Nuclear Fission
[normal]Offshore Wind
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is not 
[normal]intended to be 
[normal]a definitive list
[normal] 
[normal]of all technology families that could contribute to the UK’s energy and growth objectives. 
[normal]The LCICG
[normal] 
[normal]continue
[normal] to monitor technology developments
[normal] and we will expand the TINA evidence base to include other technologies if 
[normal]the Group identifies
[normal] a need for TINA 
[normal]analysis.
[normal] 
[normal]Currently 
[normal]3 areas for further work – Solar PV, Industrial CCS and Heat Networks – 
[normal]are bein
[normal]g considered for
[normal] 2014.
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Building on 
[normal]the LCICG’s joint work to date the LCICG members are drafting a strategic document that will help the Group work closely together to develop its future work programmes. That document will
[normal] describe ho
[normal]w public 
[normal]sector-
[normal]backed innovation support is delivered in the UK, summarise the progress made to date in strengthening coordination, 
[normal]will
[normal] set out 
[normal]the Group’s
[normal] shared aims and objectives and 
[normal]will 
[normal]detail how 
[normal]the Group
[normal] plan to work together to further strength
[normal]en 
[normal]their
[normal] coordination and impact in the future.
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Prioritising our resources on those innovations where the need is most pressing and where our investment can have the most impact is a key challenge for the Group. 
[normal]The 
[normal]TINAs
[normal] described above
[normal] analysed and quantified the impact of technology innovation needs for a dozen technology sectors
[normal]. The 
[normal]document 
[normal]will 
[normal]take that analysis a step 
[normal]further by
[normal] set
[normal]ting
[normal] out what 
[normal]the Group
[normal] believe are the key innovation needs in each of those dozen technology sectors and assess
[normal]ing
[normal] the scale of support that would be needed to address those needs.  
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The document will provide a framework for future prioritisation
[normal],
[normal] it will not however set out a
[normal] prioritised work programme. The UK government alone cannot support all the innovation needs identified and difficult choices will have to be made. 
[normal]T
[normal]hose choices will need to be informed by the success or otherwise of current innovation programmes, the dev
[normal]elopment of the technologies over the next few years, the development of wider energy policy and the availability of funding in future spending rounds. The future investment decisions made by members of the Group will be informed by the analysis in the doc
[normal]ument and the principles set out in it.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As outlined in the NAO
[normal]’s Public Funding for Innovation in Low Carbon Technologies in the UK
[normal] report, m
[normal]easuring the return on innovation RD&amp;D programmes is complex, not least due to inter-linkages 
[normal]with deployment support and other policies, though there is some evidence
[normal] that such programmes can result in significant returns.
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LCICG have developed a common set of seven low carbon energy innovation metrics
[normal] which are being piloted
[normal].  The metrics 
[normal]aim
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]evaluate the impact and outcomes the LCICG’s programmes have had against the core themes of 
[normal]delivering: affordable, secure, low carbon energy for the UK; UK economic growth; and the UK’s capabilities, knowledge and skills.
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The metrics will 
[normal]aim to 
[normal]ident
[normal]ify projects 
[normal]and programmes 
[normal]in which significant cost reduction or improved efficiency has been achieved. By tracking the estimated costs of technologies we 
[normal]look to
[normal] 
[normal]show progress towards commercial viability. 
[normal]The vision is for 
[normal]LCICG 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]use this data to loo
[normal]k for longer-term evidence that LCICG-supported innovations are having a beneficial impact on cost reductions in commercial technology.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The metrics 
[normal]look to
[normal] 
[normal]capture the contribution of the LCICG to UK growth, where commercial sales or increased company val
[normal]uation occurs within 3 years of receiving LCICG support. 
[normal]Increased international sales also contribute to this measure. 
[normal] For
[normal] less commercial technologies, by tracking estimated years to market the LCICG can forecast when it expects economic impact to occur
[normal].  
[normal]Analysis will 
[normal]support 
[normal]the LCICG to spot valleys of death in technology sub areas which has not been possible with a top down approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LCICG needs to 
[normal]enable
[normal] a healthy UK innovation system if it is to succeed in delivering 
[normal]its
[normal] aims. 
[normal]Adoption of t
[normal]he metrics will measure the generation of unique knowledge and inventions, the mobilisation of financial capital and perceived UK skills gaps. 
[normal]It
[normal] will also
[normal] support
[normal] identify where LCICG collaborations have 
[normal]precipitated new innovation ac
[normal]tivity and identify k
[normal]ey players in the landscape.
[normal]36.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to the LCICG metrics
[normal],
[normal] individual members adopt 
[normal]in-house 
[normal]evaluation processes to measure their programmes successes against their original objectives.   
[normal]Thi
[normal]s section aims to provide evidence against the Committee’s
[normal] [bold]question
[normal] 
[normal]5
[normal]: 
[normal]What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?
[normal]37.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UK Government investment leverages substantial funding from other sources and private sector funding
[normal] for development or demonstration projects usually matches or exceeds the government investment.
[normal]  The balance of 
[normal]public and private 
[normal]funding is dependent on the project type
[normal] and European State Aid limits.
[normal]38.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Private investment in low carbon generation and 
[normal]energy efficiency technologies plays a crucial role in innovation, and is influenced by expected returns, the cost of capital and its availability, the degree of regulatory certainty, perceived risks (demand, technological and political), and the extent to
[normal] which firms can enter and exit markets with ease. Al
[normal]t
[normal]ogether, a ‘productive ecosystem’ is required to encourage innovation, including conditions in which risks can be understood, managed and anticipated. For conventional private funds, 
[normal]such as commercial 
[normal]banks, 
[normal]which generally have a low appetite for risk, the uncertainties inherent in the development of energy technologies will often be sufficiently large to dissuade investment.
[normal] 
[normal]39.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LCICG members seek to reduce these risks by offering a range of interve
[normal]ntions which may benefit different innovations such as capital grants, equity investment and incubation.  The members also play a different role in the commercialisation of technologies at different stages of development.  
[normal]40.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Innovation, particularly in the 
[normal]e
[normal]nergy sector, can take a long time. Most public sector funding for low carbon
[normal] innovation 
[normal]is constrained by the 
[normal]spending r
[normal]ound timetables which limit commitments beyond the current spending round. This lack of long term certainty that support will be avail
[normal]able can be a barrier to investment by private sector innovators. Some public-sector 
[normal]backed bodies such as 
[normal]the Energy Technologies Institute and the Catapult Centres and 
[normal]have
[normal],
[normal] however
[normal],
[normal] been able to plan activities on 
[normal]a 
[normal]long
[normal]er time horizon. 
[normal]41.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]Governme
[normal]nt’s industrial strategies
[normal],
[normal] published in 2013
[normal],
[normal] set out how 
[normal]government aims to overcome specific barriers faced by businesses developing their technologies, including for the offshore wind, construction and nuclear sectors.  These include access to finance;
[normal] partnerships with sectors; support for emerging technologies; creating a pipeline of skilled workers; and government procurement to support the development of supply chains.
[normal] 
[normal]Some specific 
[normal]recent 
[normal]examples:
[normal]42.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to the UK industrial strategies 
[normal]Scotland developed 
[normal]specific strategies for its key strategic sectors such as the 
[normal]Offshore Wind Ro
[normal]ute Map.
[normal]43.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many
[normal] low carbon
[normal] innovations are driven by 
[normal]very small businesses
[normal] which can
[normal]no
[normal]t raise capital from banks as their businesses are pre-revenue
[normal] generating
[normal].  They often seek support from Angel or 
[normal]V
[normal]enture 
[normal]C
[normal]apital 
[normal]investors.  The public low carbon innovati
[normal]on landscape offers a range of solutions to support different type of businesses, third sector organisations and academia 
[normal]to 
[normal]get the support they need, 
[normal]mainly in the form of
[normal] capital grants
[normal] and
[normal] procuring their 
[normal]technology
[normal] but also to a lesser extent equity and business incubation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]44.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is through coordinated 
[normal]a
[normal]nd strategic investment that government can catalyse greater levels of private sector innovation and unlock the resources required to achieve improved efficiencies and
[normal] reduced costs for low carbon technologies, while delivering economic benefits from growing businesses and supply chains
[normal].
[normal]45.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]  
[normal]The 
[normal]Technology Strategy Board
[normal] and RCUK
[normal] are developing 
[normal]the 
[normal]concept 
[normal]of an ‘energy catalyst’ fund that could support the best new energ
[normal]y technologies from concept all the way through to commercialisation in a continuous manner and at the time when needed.  This kind of mechanism could provide greater certainty of public support to low carbon technology developers.
[normal]  
[normal]For example, t
[normal]he RCUK a
[normal]nd TSB are to launch the Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (IB Catalyst) in January 2014.  The IB Catalyst will fund proposals to support the early translation of research (including gaseous and liquid biofuels) from groups led by academics only, academic-
[normal]industrial collaborations and industrialists.   
[normal]This section provides evidence against the Committee’s
[normal] 
[normal]question
[normal] 7
[normal]: 
[normal]How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with i
[normal]nternational partners within and beyond the EU?
[normal]46.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he LCICG members 
[normal]have increasingly looked for opportunities to
[normal] collaborate with foreign partners to research, develop and demonstrate low carbon technologies of mutual interest. There is good potential to ma
[normal]ke more of the UK’s reputation for high quality research and our attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment. 
[normal]The UK can
[normal] build on this to work with others in addressing challenges that nation states cannot tackle alone, to share costs and
[normal] risks, accelerate technology development and 
[normal]disseminate
[normal] lessons learned.
[normal]47.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK also works in partnership with other countries, with RCUK offices in China, India and USA. Over the last few years RCUK has funded activities in key technologies with China i
[normal]n renewable energy generation technologies, CCS, fuel cells
[normal], energy storage
[normal] and smart grids worth 
[normal]£30m
[normal], and with India in fuel cells, smart grids
[normal], energy storage
[normal], solar energy and bioenergy, worth £23m, as well as collaborations with India in nuclear resea
[normal]rch.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Members of the LCICG are working together to identify new collaboration opportunities in technology areas where the UK has shared interests with other countries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]48.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the EU level, Horizon 2020 has replaced the Framework Programme. Horizon 2020 is intended as a 
[normal]single integrated mechanism for supporting EU research and innovation, 
[normal]and will run from 2014 until 2020. Funding for energy 
[normal]research and innovation
[normal] will be a
[normal]round €1bn a year, 
[normal]more than double
[normal] the amount available previously. Subject to certain conditions, the new mechanism is also open to entities from all over the world, and therefore provides more collaboration opportunities for researchers, scientists and 
[normal]innovative businesses.
[normal]49.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Horizon 2020 presents opportunities for LCICG members to build on the progress made under the Framework Programme - to make greater use of the funding on offer while bringing industry and academia together in productive international
[normal] collaborations
[normal]50.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK has been successful in positioning itself at the heart of the EU’s processes for setting energy priorities, under the 
[normal]Communitie
[normal]s
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]coordinated technology programme - the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan). However, there is 
[normal]scope to do more: in addition to LCICG members collaborating with each other and with private sector partners, they are increasingly seeking to forge international partnerships to pool resources and share risks in taking forward joint programmes. Internati
[normal]onal collaborations help UK companies to gain technical expertise from their foreign counterparts and provide access to new markets.
[normal]51.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One such example in practice is the ‘BESTF’ ERA-NET 
[normal](Networks Emerging from European Research Area) 
[normal]Plus
[normal], a consortium of 
[normal]eight EU Member States, including the UK, and associated countries. This venture is providing funding and support to collaborative bioenergy projects that demonstrate one or more innovative steps resulting in pre-commercial demonstration. 
[normal]Members of the LC
[normal]ICG are 
[normal]also engaged in ERANETS in Solar and Marine energy technologies
[normal] 
[normal]as well as Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy
[normal]52.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK is also engaging in European 
[normal]industry-driven, bottom-up approac
[normal]hes
[normal] aimed at facilitating transnational cooperation on technical
[normal] innovation 
[normal]such as Eurostars, managed by the 
[normal]Technology Strategy Board for SME collaboration in Europe and 
[normal]EUROGIA 
[normal]under
[normal] EUREKA
[normal] which has been linked and managed through DECC’s Energy Entrepreneurs Fund.
[normal]53.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The devolved Governments 
[normal]and Local Enterprise Part
[normal]nership (LEPs) 
[normal]use
[normal] 
[normal]the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as a springboard to launch and establish low carbon energy innovation programmes
[normal] in assisted areas
[normal].
[normal]54.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The European Commission has identified that a new impetus is needed to join up energy techn
[normal]ology policies across the EU. Implementation plans for 2013-15 under the SET Plan European Industrial Initiatives are to be drawn up to help identify the priority areas for Member State collaboration in the short term. For the longer term, Horizon 2020 - t
[normal]he EU’s new, simplified research, development, demonstration and deployment support programme - includes international cooperation as an important cross-cutting priority. The expectation among LCICG members and beyond is that exploring productive partnersh
[normal]ips and finding common interests with others will in future play a much bigger role in low carbon innovation activity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]question
[normal] 4
[normal]: 
[normal]Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, i

[normal] [bold]55.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The RCUK Energy Programme aims to position the UK to meet its energy and environmental targets and policy goals through the support of world-class research and doctoral training.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Energy Programme 
[normal]is investing more than £540M in research and skills in the current spending 
[normal]review period to pioneer a low carbon future. This builds on an investment of £839M over the previous eight years (to December 2011).
[normal]56.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Led by the Engineering and Physical Sciences R
[normal]esearch Council (EPSRC), the Energy Programme brings together the work of EPSRC and that of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
[normal], and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

[normal]These investments will be supplemented by further funding made available through the BBSRC Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (up to £18M from BBSRC and EPSRC) and the Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (to be funded by BBSRC, EPSRC, TSB and
[normal] industry) which will start in 2014 and will include support for the early translation of basic research in the area of liquid and gaseous biofuels as well as the processing of lignocellulosic biomass. 
[normal]61.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bioenergy is also an integral part of the SUPERGEN pr
[normal]ogramme – see below. The current total RCUK bioenergy 
[normal]grant 
[normal]portfolio is £57.7M.
[normal]Carbon Capture and Storage[bold]62.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EPSRC funds the UK CCS Research Centre (UKCCSRC; £10.1M), which is a virtual hub that brings together leading UK CCS researchers, acting as an inter
[normal]face for government, industry and international collaboration. The UKCCSRC innovates, leads and coordinates a programme of underpinning research that covers all aspects of CCS to deliver basic knowledge and understanding and support UK government efforts o
[normal]n energy and climate change.
[normal]  UKCCSRC builds on the joint NERC/EPSRC (£3m) Carbon Capture and Storage programme. 
[normal] The current total RCUK CCS portfolio is £67.6M.
[normal]Conventional Power Generation [bold]63.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EPSRC supports research in conventional power plant lifetime ex
[normal]tension, efficiency and flexibility, fuel flexibility and sustainability, 
[normal]including
[normal] through the Flexible and Efficient Power Plant consortium led by Loughborough (£2
[normal].0
[normal]M)
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]the

[normal]The current total RCUK end-use energy demand portfolio is £126.8M.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Energy storage [bold]66.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Energy storage is one of the government’s Eight Great 
[normal]Technologies, defined as an emerging technology with the potential of driving UK growth. EPSRC recently invested £30M in new science capital facilities for grid-scale energy storage, to help accelerate the development of national scale electricity storage.
[normal] Five centres were supported, covering a wide range of storage technologies including electrochemical, thermal, compressed air, liquid air and grid integration aspects.
[normal]67.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Energy storage is also an integral part of the SUPERGEN programme, with a new Hub due t
[normal]o be funded (£3M) by the end of the current financial year. The current total RCUK energy storage portfolio is £32.8M (excluding capital).
[normal]Nuclear fission and fusion[bold]68.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the current financial year EPSRC has funded the DISTINCTIVE programme in decommissionin
[normal]g and pre-treatment of spent nuclear fuel (£5M), a successor to the DIAMOND programme. A further £3M has been invested in a programme of research addressing the nuclear fuel cycle, focussing on: fuel manufacturing, radiation performance, and recycle techno
[normal]logies to allow the nuclear fuel cycle to be closed. 
[normal]NERC has funded the Radioactivity and the Environment Programme (£5m) which also has support from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (£2M), Environment Agency (£1M) and STFC.  
[normal]The current total RCUK n
[normal]uclear fission portfolio is £61.8M (excluding capital).
[normal]69.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EPSRC and STFC support nuclear fusion for energy research, including both magnetic confinement fusion and inertial fusion energy. Current investments include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]70.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EPSRC has also committed £15M to the new National Nuclear User Facility (NNUF), 
[normal]to support active radioactive material handling facilities at
[normal] the National
[normal] Nuclear Laboratory (NNL), the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE) and the Dalton Nuclear Institute.  NNUF will bring together previously fragmented nuclear research facilities in the UK into a coordinated suite of complementary facilities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Oil and Ga[bold]s [bold]71.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A recent NERC award of £2·8M supports

[normal] 
[normal]aimed at helping the oil and gas sector put environmental science at the heart of responsible management of 
[normal]our planet.
[normal]  
[normal]At the same time, NERC has invested £800k in projects that will engage the oil and gas sector in developing existing 
[normal]partnerships and building new ones
[normal] to 
[normal]help the industry use environmental science to accelerate economic growth.
[normal]Renewable Ene[bold]rgy Technologies, including the [bold]Sustainable Power Generation and Supply [bold]Programme [bold]– SUPERGEN [bold]72.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SUPERGEN is the focus of the RCUK Energy programme’s investment in sustainable power generation and supply technologies with over £76M currently invested in seven
[normal] key areas: energy storage, hydrogen &amp; fuel cells, sustainable power networks, wind, marine (wave and tidal), solar and bioenergy. The SUPERGEN programme’s mission is to bring the UK’s academic community together in each field to address the underpinning r
[normal]esearch challenges holding back the deployment of low carbon technologies. The programme also provides an easily accessible point of contact for industry and government. The programme was renewed for a third phase in 2011, moving from large fixed consortia
[normal] to a hub and spoke model that is more open, more flexible and easier to manage.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]73.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Offshore Renewables (wind, wave and tidal) Research Programme (2011-2014) is jointly funded by NERC and DEFRA and contributes £3.6M to essential research on environment
[normal]al interactions with offshore renewables technologies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, the NERC Marine Renewable Energy
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Knowledge Exchange programme is focussed on accelerating uptake of NERC research by businesses as well as policy/regulatory organisations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and facilitating 
[normal]development of innovative tools and methods for

[normal].
[normal]This section provide
[normal]s
[normal] evidence against the Committee’s
[normal] [bold]6
[normal]th
[normal] question: 
[normal]How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will 
[normal]be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?
[normal]79.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 2010 Spending Review announced 
[normal]DECC 
[normal]capital 
[normal]funding of over £200m for low carbon technologies. This included up to £60m for the development of offshore wind manufacturing at port sites. The remaining capi
[normal]tal funding is supporting innovation in low carbon technologies and systems. Using the 
[normal]TINAs, 
[normal]the programme has prioritised key technology families, to inform innovation plans and properly target spending.
[normal]80.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NAO’s
[normal] 
[normal]report into Public funding for innovatio
[normal]n in low carbon technologies in the UK
[normal],
[normal] stated that DECC’s spending in 2011/12 and 2012/13 was substantially less than budgeted and that the department was looking to accelerate spending in 2013/14 and 2014/15.
[normal]  The report stated that DECC had forecast (ca
[normal]pital and programme) spend for four year spending review of £173.2m against a budget of £181m.

[normal]Innovation projects are innately ris
[normal]ky and challenging to forecast becaus
[normal]e they are unique and dealing with unknowns in 
[normal]their 
[normal]development and construction. F
[normal]lexibility to adapt to the realities of the project as it develops is important to maximise the chances of successful delivery. Part of the challenge for the 
[normal]programme managers 
[normal]is to track the comm

[normal]while making
[normal] adjustments and trade-offs between

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In the US, for example, in 2001 the National 
[normal]Academy of Sciences examined 17 federal R&amp;D programmes in energy efficienc
[normal]y, estimating that the return on the $300m investment was around $30bn. This was attributed almost entirely to the success of 3 of the 17 programmes, illustrating the huge variability in programme returns and lending support to an approach of supporting a 
[normal]range of projects.
