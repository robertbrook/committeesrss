[[[Written evidence from the UK Major Ports Group (WRT 009)]]]

[[[Summary]]]1              The arrangements for winter resilience for transport have improved greatly since the winter of 2009/10. The strategic importance of ports to the UK economy is now much better recognised in planning arrangements. Moreover much of the strategic stockpile of salt and grit is being stored at ports which can provide the necessary space, access to supply lines, and handling and distribution expertise. It is essential that ports and main connecting road and rail links continue to be given priority in winter resilience planning. 

[[[Introduction]]]2              UKMPG is one of two associations representing ports in the UK.  Our 9 member groups handle over 70 percent of the UK’s international trade by volume, and therefore play a significant role in supporting the UK economy and promoting exports.  UK ports are privately financed and do not seek any financial help from the taxpayer.  &#xa0;

[[[Winter 2009/10]]]3              During severe winter weather in January 2010, some ports began to encounter problems because they were not getting the salt they needed to keep full operations going. These delivery problems appeared to be linked to the Government’s then prioritisation programme with the Highways Agency and local authorities being given priority for supply over all other customers. On behalf its members UKMPG pressed strongly for ports to be given high priority for salt supplies not only as an essential part of the nation’s transport infrastructure  network but also because of their role in the distribution of imported salt and grit. The Department of Transport acted on these concerns and facilitated the distribution of salt and grit supplies to ports which needed them.

[[[ Report]]]4              In February 2010 the then Secretary of State for Transport announced that severe winter planning would need to be handled more strategically in future and that the Government would be commissioning a review. In the event this review was carried out by a small team led by David Quarmby CBE.  UKMPG inputted to this review and we were pleased to see that the final report published in October 2010 stressed the strategic importance of ports and the strong economic case for maintaining access to ports during severe winter conditions. The main recommendations affecting ports were that -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ports should increase their own pre season salt stock holdings to minimise reliance on in season re-stocking-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; there should be a dialogue between ports and relevant highway authorities to ensure there is clear agreement on boundaries and responsibilities-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the relevant access roads should feature on the highway authorities priority gritting network&#xa0;5              Ports moved quickly to respond to the report where necessary strengthening the links with highway authorities and also participating in the development of the national strategic salt stockpile managed by the Highways Agency. &#xa0;

[[[Subsequent guidance]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6              In Autumn 2011 Department for Transport officials wrote to ports in England inviting them to participate in strengthening contingency planning for the forthcoming winter. DfT commended ports for improved performance during the severe weather in the previous winter which had much to do with greater strategic stockpiles of salt and improved planning. In the light of this experience and the implementation of the Quarmby review DfT drew up an overall action plan for ports for winter 2011/2. The main new elements of this were-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A standardized ports industry template on severe weather planning designed to ensure consistency of approach and strengthened co-ordination between the ports sector and the Government. This was drafted  by DfT in consultation with ports and others concerned-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A full induction and training programme on ports issues for the new DCLG regional resilience teams who had now replaced the Government Office emergency planning network-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ports were asked to consider how their response to bad weather conditions could be strengthened and to share conclusions with DfT-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ports were strongly encouraged to establish effective links with the new regional resilience teams by for example inviting them on familiarization visits-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Where needed, ferry ports were asked to establish robust communication links with port operators at the other end of the route to identify potential problems at an early stage7              Some of the actions that ports themselves have taken to improve winter resilience on port sites include              -    Building new storage facilities for salt and grit              -    Acquiring additional snow ploughs and gritting machines              -    Trialing de-icer sprays on cranes              -    Arrangements put in place to lease additional snow clearance vehicles at short notice              -   Working closely with the Met Office via Local Resilience Forums to receive bespoke severe weather forecasts and alerts              -  Developing Business Resilience and Continuity programmes to cover all issues connected with extreme weather including snow and flooding, and carrying out regular test exercises.

[[[Current position]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]8              Major ports are satisfied that prioritization and planning arrangements are now much improved since the problems encountered in winter 2009/10. Should there be a recurrence of severe wintery conditions in winter 2013/4, ports will work closely with customers, stakeholders and other infrastructure providers to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum. It is essential that connecting infrastructure to and from ports receives priority for snow and ice clearance etc – ports are liaising closely with highway authorities and Network Rail on this. It also remains important that ports have guaranteed salt and grit availability in the event of severe weather. &#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
