defaultDear 
defaultMr
default Betts and CLG Select Committee Colleagues, 
default&#xa0;
defaultPoints of Clarification following defaultthe defaultCLG Select Comdefaultmdefaultittee defaultHearingdefault 6defaultthdefault Januarydefault&#xa0;defaultThank you for giving us the opportunity to attend the CLG Select Committee Hearing on the 6
defaultth
default January and respond to concerns raised by both the industry and the committee. Following this
default, I thought it best to write to you with a few p
defaultoints of clarification
default which were 
defaultrequested by yourselves.
default&#xa0;
defaultNumber of memberships terminated in 2013default&#xa0;defaultNAPIT Registration’s
default disciplinary process is set up with a number of sanctions such that non
default‐
defaultcompliance does not simply result in termination (not least because that would result in successful appeals and legal challenges if opportunities to address non
default‐
defaultcompliance are not giv
defaulten). Non
default‐
defaultcompliance is against any of the requirements of the EAS which may mean that non
default‐
defaultcompliance is against the rules allowing self
default‐
defaultcertification even if works are compliant with the Building Regulations. 
defaultIn 2013, the following compliance actions and 
defaultsanctions were taken: 
default&#xa0;defaultHence the 163 who cance
defaultlled their own membership without addressing improvement actions plus the 2
default4
default actively removed by the compliance procedure gives 18
default7
default whose membership ended as a result of identified non
default‐
defaultcompliance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis figure represents 15% of the 1224 enterprises whose P
defaultart P membership ended during 2013 the remaining 85% is made up of retirements, business closure, sole traders gaining employment in larger firms and simple non
default‐
defaultrenewal. Only a small number of these seem to have scheme
default‐
defaulthopped, the majority are either genui
defaultnely not trading or they continue to trade without being registered.
default&#xa0;
defaultNAPIT stance of Qualified Supervisor modeldefault&#xa0;defaultNAPIT’s scheme is based on the person who 
defaultattends site to 
defaultinspect and test the installation being a Qualified Operative who is at least equiva
defaultlent to the EAS Qualified Supervisor. Because we have a high proportion of micro
default‐
defaultbusiness this is still often one person.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe total number of Qualified Operatives is 12
default,
default235 within 9006 enterprises. 8134 operatives work for 8134 sole traders and micro
default‐
defaultcompanies (i.e. 1 per enterprise) and 4101 operatives work for 872 larger companies at an average of 4.7 per enterprise (excluding one very large scheme member gives an average of 3.2 qualified operatives per enterprise for the rest).
default&#xa0;
defaultNumber of Complaintsdefault&#xa0;

defaultreports 
defaultto DCLG, the annual level of complaints

defaultreceived by 
defaultNAPIT 
defaultruns at a level of 1-in-5000 installations – of course scheme members themselves will receive and resolve the bulk of complaints with
defaultout them being escalated to the scheme.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope you find this clarification of use, and would be happy to provide any further information that you would assist you further in this enquiry. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if this would be desirable.
