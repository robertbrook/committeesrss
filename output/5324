defaultOur submission focuses on four issues: 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur central point is that the 
defaultpublic is being poorly serv
defaulted 
defaultby the 
defaultcar 
defaultinsurance industry.
default Our submission 
defaultproduces evidence
default that the major car insurers have used their strong position 
defaultin 
defaultone of only two 
defaultlegally-required 
defaultinsurance markets in the UK 
defaultto boost their profits and returns to 
defaulttheir 
defaultshareholders at the e
defaultxpense of consumers and access to justice.

defaultThe letter 
default(
default29.10.13
default) 
defaultfrom the Transport Select Committee chair, Louise 
defaultEllman
default MP, to the Secretary of State for Justice, Chris Grayling MP, asks the government to explain 
defaulthow
default it will monitor whether or not insurers will honour their commitment to ensure t
defaulthat any cost reductions resulting from legal reforms are passed through to consumers.
default In the absence of proper regulation of this broken market
default,
default we
default 
defaultbelieve motorists will not gain any benefit from a reduction in the number of accidents and claims
default.
default Car insu
defaultrers should operate transparently and should not seek to influence public policy using information that cannot be independently verified.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe lack of transparency on the part of the leading car insurers is most clearly evident in the failure of AVIVA and defaultAXA to provide information on the profits they make from this captive market.  We believe that their failure to report trading figures for car insurance is a clear breach of International Financial Reporting Standards, which require public companies to repdefaultort separately on an operating segment contributing 10% or more to overall reported profit.default We urge the Transport Select Committee to seek an explanation for defaulttheir failure to comply with thisdefault basic reporting requirement.default&#xa0;
defaultAs a 
defaultshort-term
default measure
default, we argue 
defaultthat the car insurers should share some of their inflated profits with the public through a windfall tax that would be ring-fenced for investment in measures to improve road safety. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission consists mainly of new information that has emerged sinc
defaulte the 
defaultT
defaultransport Select Committee’s consultation 
defaultin April 2013
default, to which we also made a submission
default, a copy of which is attached.
default The arguments we put forward in that submission still stand. The information that has emerged subsequently serves only to reinfo
defaultrce them.

default3 defaultMotor insurance - a broken marketdefault&#xa0;
defaultAs car insurance is a legal requirement for motorists, it is vital the provision of this product functions in a way that is competitive and treats consumers 
defaultfairly both in terms of value and their ability to make genuine claims. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn our view, motorists are ill-served by a market dominated by a handful of providers who 
defaulthave an agenda 
defaultto 
defaultpersuade politicians and 
defaultgovernment 
defaultof the need to introduce further legal
default reforms 
defaultthat will serve 
defaultto boost 
defaulttheir already substantial profits. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFive key facts underpin our analy
defaultsis of the broken state of this
default market, from a consumer’s point of view:  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will look at each of these points in turn and substantiate them.
default&#xa0;
default3.1default defaultMarket dominationdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Association of British Insurers says
default there are 23.8 private vehicles insured in the 
defaultUK
default. Published financial information show
defaults
default sales of motor policies by the four market leaders in 2012 were as follows:

defaultAXA is French owned and 
defaultdoes not 
defaultdisclose 
defaultthe details of its trading activities 
defaultin the 
defaultUK
default 
defaultcar insurance 
defaultmarket. However, we estimate from the limited 
defaultinformation
default available that they are not far behind
default AVIVA in sales.
default&#xa0;
default3.2default Profits - substantial and risingdefault&#xa0;
defaultDirect Linedefault - In the first nine
default months of 2013, Direct Line made an operating profit of £418m, a 20.1% increase on the same period last year (£348m). In its annual accounts, Direct Line gives a separate figure for operating profit from 
defaultUK
default motor insurance. In 2012, this was £262m, a 3% i
defaultncrease on 2011 (£255m).
default&#xa0;
defaultAdmiraldefault - 
defaultIn the first half of 2013, the second largest car insurer saw its profits from the UK market increase 5% to £192.7 million (H1 2012: £183.3 million). This follows a bumper year in 2012 when its profit from the UK car 
defaultins
defaulturance
default rose 19% to £373m (2011: £314m).
default&#xa0;
defaultAVIVAdefault - The third largest car insurer does not divulge its profits from selling motor insurance, despite - like Direct Line and Admiral - being listed on the London Stock Exchange
default. Its 2012 annual report did, howeve
defaultr, say that
default 
defaultit had increased the number of motor insurance policies sold by 250,000 to nearly 2.5 
defaultmillion 
defaultcustomers. It also said 
defaultthe group had generated £448m in operating profit from selling general insurance in the UK, which included ‘
defaultgood profitability
default in personal lines’ 
default(
defaultmotor
default and homeowner
default insurance
default)
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultInternational Financial Reporting Standards 
default(IFRS) 
defaultrequire public companies to report
default 
defaultseparately on an operating segment that contributes 10% or more to overall reported profit. 
defaultGiven that 
defaultAVIVA 
defaultachiev
defaulted a better ‘combined operating ratio’ for motor insurance than Direct Line (97% versus 101.6%) – albeit on a smaller customer base – it seems very likely that UK motor insurance on its own accounted for more than 10% of AVIVA’s 2012 operating profit of £1
default.888 billion. On this basis
default, we would argue AVIVA is in breach of IFRS 
defaultsegmental reporting requirements.
default Indeed, once non-operating and restructuring costs are added back, 
defaultAVIVA made a profit before tax of only £25m, which suggests profits from motor insur
defaultance
default 
defaulthave been propping up an ailing company and funding mouth-watering pay outs to shareholders (see below) and executives (including a £5m plus remuneration package for new chief executive Mark Wilson).
default&#xa0;
defaultAXAdefault - The French-headquartered insurance group, wh
defaultich is listed on the Paris Bourse, does not give separate profit figures for UK motor insurance. However, AXA UK &amp; Ireland did issue a press release on 21
defaultst
default February 2013 saying: “Motor profitability improved in 2012
default.”
default 
defaultAs with AVIVA, we would argue AXA is 
defaultin breach of IFRS and should be required to provide segmental trading information for this market.
default&#xa0;
default3.3default Over-provision defaultand ongoing decrease in defaultbodily injury claims default&#xa0;
defaultDirect Linedefault default- T
defaulthe market leader
default was able to make substantial
default 
defaultreleases from 
defaultits overall cla
defaultims 
defaultreserves in 2012 
defaultmainly 
defaultbecause of ‘favourable bodily injury experience for recent accident years’ and admitted claims ‘continue to be’ lower than ‘actuarial expectations
default’
default. In
default 
defaultthe first nine months of 2013, Direct Line 
defaultreleased a further 
default£311.1 million
default from reserves and said: “
defaultThe bulk of the release arose in the Motor division where the Group has experienced favourable development on bodily injury claims, which is currently expected to continue
default”
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdmiraldefault - The second ranked player released 
default£23.5m 
defaultin 2
default012 
defaultfrom its
default reserves for 
defaultUK
default car insurance
default claims
default, 128% more than in the previous year. Then, in the first half of 2013, it was able to make even higher releases of £29.7m in just six months
default. Like Direct Line, Admiral 
defaultadmitted it had over-provided
default and that it was seeing an ongoing reduction in claims. Its half year statement said: “
defaultThese higher releases were possible due to the positive claims experience during 2012 and the first half of 2013, which resulted in improvements in the projected ultimat
defaulte loss ratios, especially for the 2010 to 2012 underwriting years.
default” Chief executive Henry 
defaultEnglehardt
default added: “We were able to increase profits largely due to excellent claims experience”.
default&#xa0;
defaultAXA and AVIVA do not 
defaultdisclose
default information on 
defaultreserves releases.

defaultDividend payments thi
defaults year are equivalent to £63 for
default 
defaulteach of their 7.6 million 
defaultpolicy holder
defaults
default.
default 
defaultBoth Direct Line
default and Admiral have indicated 
defaultto shareholders 
defaultthat they expect dividend payments to continue to
default increase.
default&#xa0;
defaultAVIVA 
defaultdoes not pay a dividend directly attributable to its 
defaultUK
default car insurance division. However, it is interesting to note that the 
defaultgr
defaultoup’s latest market 
default(7.11.13) 
defaultupdate says:  
default“
defaultO
defaultur focus is on improving dividends paid by our business units to G
defaultroup
default”. 
default In 2012, AVIVA group paid dividends to shareholders and coupon payments to bond holders worth £847m (the dividends being for 
defaulta two-year period)
default. 
defaultIn 2013, 
defaultAVIVA 
defaulthas 
defaultpaid 
defaultshareholders a total of approximately £430m.
default Given car insurance is a highly pr
defaultofitable revenue stream in a largely unprofitable group, it is fair to say motorists have served as a cash cow for shareholders at a time when they might otherwise
default not
default have received any dividends.
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilarly, 
defaultAXA
default UK pay
defaults
default dividends to its French parent
default, whi
defaultch
default are in turn paid out to shareholders
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5default Having it both waysdefault default&#xa0;
defaultVehicle repair referral fdefaulteesdefault - The 
defaultcurrent Competition 
defaultCommission investigation into the private motor insurance market
default has 
defaultprovisionally 
defaultconclu
defaultded
default 
defaultthat “
defaultthe separation of cost liability and cost control in the provision of post-accident services to non-fault 
defaultPMI (personal motor insurance) c
defaultlaimants does appear to give rise to a moral hazard problem, whereby the ultimate costs paid by the fault insurer are 
defaulthigher than they would otherwise be
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe investigation has found that 
defaultthis 
defaultcan increase the average cost of a non-fault repair by 
default‘
defaultup to around £270 if the non-fault insurer manages the repair
default’
default.
default However, while these inflated costs are passed on to the motorist in higher prem
defaultiums, the insurance companies have been
default banking the referral fees to boost their bottom line. Direct Line, for example, benefited to the tune of £25.9m in 2012 from revenue fo
defaultr vehicle recovery and repair services
default, according to its annual report. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLegal referral fees go in-housedefault - 
defaultAdmiral 
defaulthas responded to the ban on personal injury referral fees, from which it earned £18.6m in 2012, by setting 
defaultup its own legal businesses, 
defaultAdmi
defaultral Law and BDE Law. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAdmiral says ‘n
defaultew and proposed reforms to the handling of bodily injury claims mean that the businesses are not expected to make a material contribution to Group profits in the foreseeable future
default’
default.
default However, Admiral is clearly trying t
defaulto gain a competitive advantage following the 
defaultJackson
default reforms by creating a legal business that has a guaranteed income
default and no marketing costs for 
defaultcases that are, in effect, referred in-house
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOnline driving recordsdefault 
default–Cabinet Office Minister
default Francis Maude
default 
defaulttold the media this month
default (9.1.14) that most of the UK’s 40 million motorists would see premiums fall as a result of the introduction of online driving records by the middle of next year.  The Association of British Insurers said ‘honest’ motorists could s
defaultee premiums fall by up to £15 a year. But no one produced a shred of evidence to support these assertions
default, and there is every reason to assume – based on the financial behaviour of the car insurers outlined above – that 
defaultany
default cost saving to the insurers from accessing online driving records will simply boost 
defaulttheir 
defaultprofits
default. This 
defaultis
default yet another case of the car insurers wanting it both ways: taxpayers funding systems that help them make more profit for distribution to shareholder
defaults
default. 
defaultCar insurers should be charged for accessing online driving records with the proceeds earmarked for road safetydefault (see below).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4default Transparency and political lobbyingdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe facts outlined above add up to a market that serves consumers poorly, to say the l
defaulteast. We believe this situation has come about because the car insurers have gained a disproportionate influence over government policy and 
defaultthe
default 
defaultlack 
defaultof 
defaulta
default regulatory framework 
defaultmeans 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is insufficient 
defaulttransparency and accountability.
default&#xa0;
default4.1 Lobbying  default default&#xa0;
defaultThe car insurers are brazen
default 
defaultabout their lobbying activities. Direct Line, for example, said in its annual report:  
default“
defaultWith the ongoing debates in the motor market surrounding referral and legal fees, the increase in whiplash claims and the implementation 
defaultof the gender directive, we aim to be leaders through this period of change and lobby for reform to provide the best outcome for our customers and shareholders
default”
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBeing ‘leaders’ appears to mean 
defaulta regular flow of 
defaulte mails 
defaultto MPs from individual insurance companies and from the ABI and the holding of meetings on parliamentary premises 
defaultabout a ‘whiplash pandemic’ 
defaultand a ‘compensation culture’ 
defaultwithout 
defaultno apparent embarrassment
default at the inconsistency - to put it euphemistically 
default–
default 
defaultthat they are at the same time saying in
default their shareholder communications 
defaultthat 
defaultbodily injury claims have been falling in recent years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is 
defaulta 
defaultlobbying activity 
defaultthat 
defaultwould not be covered by the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Un
defaultion Administration Bill in its present form.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 defaultTransparency defaultand accountabilitydefault default&#xa0;
defaultCar insurance is a necessity
default yet, unlike other necessities such as utilities, it is not regulated in a way that ensures the public and policy makers have the 
defaultfacts
default they need to make informed decisions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultevidence
default in this submission has been painstakingly 
defaultextracted 
defaultfrom various published 
defaultsources but 
defaultit is
default far from complete because the car insurers are not required to provide information about their finances and c
defaultlaims in a consistent and comprehensive way
default. In our view
default,
default a
defaultny company
default selling insurance to UK motorists -
default whether private or public,
default foreign or UK owned - should be obliged to conform to the same reporting sta
defaultndards. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the short term, the Sdefaultelect Committee defaultmay wish to defaultaskdefault AVIVA defaultand AXA why they are not meeting international accountancy standards for public companies by reporting separately defaulton the UK car insurance market.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5 Road safetydefault&#xa0;
defaultLouise 
defaultEllman’s
default letter raises the important question of
default information sharing 
defaultbetween the Department for Transport and police 
defaultabout accidents so that spending on road safety can be better targeted. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK has 77 cars per kilometre of road compared to a European average of 43. 
defaultCongestion is bound to increase th
defaulte risk of road accidents and therefore personal injury. Car insurers are in possession of vital data that could be used to highlight acciden
defaultt trouble-
defaultspots and prioritise 
defaultthe allocation of funds for 
defaultinvestment in road
default safety. 
defaultIn our viewdefault,default it is without quedefaultstion that tdefaulthey should therefore be defaultrequired to take part indefault any information-sharing arrangements.default&#xa0;
defaultAt the same time, there is a strong case for levying a windfall tax on car insurers so that some of the profits bonanza they have enjoyed in recent years isdefault channelled into investment in road safety. The money raised could be ring-fenced and used to tackle the worst trouble-spots as a matter of urgency.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6 Access to justicedefault&#xa0;
defaultRaising the small claims track limitdefault - 
defaultThe car insurers are actively lobbying for the small claims track limit to be raised to £5,000 from the current level of £1,000.  
defaultOur arguments against the raising of the small claims limit can be summarised as:
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the very least
default,
default 
defaultwe fully support the view expressed in L
defaultouise 
defaultEllman’s
default letter that the g
defaultovernment shou
defaultld analyse the impact of the electronic portal 
defaultbefore
default it considers whether or not to increase th
defaulte threshold.
default 
defaultIt is clear from defaultour evidence defaultabove that defaultthe number of bodily injury claidefaultms is not as high as was claimed by the car insurersdefault and therefore there idefaults no case for rushing into further legal changes until the facts and all the implications are much clearer.default&#xa0;
defaultFrom our own work, we know that people with genuine claims are often pressurised into accepting less compensation than they deserve by 
defaultinsurers and 
defaultlawyers acting for
default them
default. We attach as an appendix 
defaultthe 
defaultcase of
default Donald and Enid 
defaultWinterbottom
default, which highlights how raising the threshold for the portal could undermine access to justice for genuine claimants.
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation for motorists on their defaultlegal rightsdefault – The Competition Commission’s recommendation that motorists should automatically be provided with information on their legal rights in the event of an accident is very welcome (Private Motor Insurance Market Investigation – Notice of Possible
default Remedies, 17.12.13). We are, however, concerned that the Commission suggests in 21(c) that this should be provided by the Association of British Insurers. In our view, this would be a travesty. The ABI exists to protect the interests of car insurers, wher
defaulteas any statement of consumer rights must be seen to be entirely independen
defaultt.

defaultAppendix Adefault&#xa0;
defaultCase study: Donald and Enid defaultWinterbottomdefault&#xa0;
defaultDonald and Enid 
defaultWinterbottom
default, aged 81 and 79 respectively, w
defaultere injured on 12 January 2012 when a car overtaking from the opposite direction hit their car head-on. 
defaultMrs
default 
defaultWinterbottom
default was airlifted to hospital with a severe whiplash injury. The next day while 
defaultEnid
default was still in hospital, and with no discussion with her
default, their legal expense insurers, 
defaultCogents
default, started a claim. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe medical ‘expert’ appointed by 
defaultCogents
default estimated that both Donald and Enid would recover from their injuries within 
defaultseven
default months and the company estimated damages for 
defaultMrs
default 
defaultWinterbottom
default at £1,800
default – £2,000.
default&#xa0;
defaultDonald and Enid rejected the offer and moved their claim to 
defaultMr
default 
defaultWinterbottom’s
default old union, Unite Legal Services, in November 2012. In July 2013 Thompsons Solicitors settled 
defaultMrs
default 
defaultWinterbottom’s
default case for £8,000, four times the estimated damages. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe lawyer at Thompsons who ran the case, Hazel Webb, found that 
defaultCogents
default had failed to take proper instructions from the 
defaultWinterbottoms
default and referred them to the wrong type of medical expert who missed the long-term impact of one of 
defaultMrs
default 
defaultWinterbottom’s
default injuri
defaultes – namely, numbness in her hand which needed an 
defaultorthopaedic
default specialist to whom Thompsons referred her.
default&#xa0;
defaultEnid 
defaultWinterbottom
default said
default:
default 
default“We didn’t ask for Cogent and we can only assume they got our details from our car insurance company. We were in shock after t
defaulthe accident yet we were harassed with phone calls from 
defaultCogents
default pushing us to make a claim and then, when we agreed, the way we were dealt with was so impersonal we felt like we were just a statistic
default.
default Their letters were in legal mumbo jumbo
default,
default and we struggle
defaultd to make sense of t
defaulthem
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“The disinterest of the doctor they appointed was shocking. He was clearly just there to tick boxes. I had an imprint of the seat belt across my stomach and the doctor didn’t even look at it. 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIn the end they only offered us 
default£1,800. For all the trauma of the accident and the knock-on effect it had on our lives, it just seemed far too low. 
default&#xa0;
default“It was at this point we saw a Unite leaflet which said we could pursue a claim with them because Donald had been a member when he was wor
defaultking as an engineer. Immediately we felt a relief because a solicitor from Thompsons came to see us in our h
defaultome. 
defaultWith no children it was such a relief to know and feel that our case was being handled correctly. 
default&#xa0;
default“The accident made us 
defaultrealise
default we are not as
default invincible as we once thought we were. It’s been a very traumatic period in our lives, especially as the accident wasn’t our fault. Our confidence completely collapsed, and it is only in past few months that we have started to feel like we are on the way 
defaultto recovery. 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultWhat happened to us is a real warning to others – don’t allow yourself to be pushed into having your insurers appoint people to act for you and get a second opinion if you are in any doubt.”
