[normal]Written evidence from Thompsons Solicitors (CMI0029)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. [bold]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Our submission focuses on four issues: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our central point is that the 
[normal]public is being poorly serv
[normal]ed 
[normal]by the 
[normal]car 
[normal]insurance industry.
[normal] Our submission 
[normal]produces evidence
[normal] that the major car insurers have used their strong position 
[normal]in 
[normal]one of only two 
[normal]legally-required 
[normal]insurance markets in the UK 
[normal]to boost their profits and returns to 
[normal]their 
[normal]shareholders at the e
[normal]xpense of consumers and access to justice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]S
[normal]ome 
[normal]car insurers 
[normal]are now admitting they over-
[normal]stated the problem of 
[normal]personal 
[normal]bodily injury
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]releas
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]hundreds of 
[normal]millions 
[normal]pounds from their
[normal] reserves 
[normal]in the form of 
[normal]huge pay outs to shareholders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The letter 
[normal](
[normal]29.10.13
[normal]) 
[normal]from the Transport Select Committee chair, Louise 
[normal]Ellman
[normal] MP, to the Secretary of State for Justice, Chris Grayling MP, asks the government to explain 
[normal]how
[normal] it will monitor whether or not insurers will honour their commitment to ensure t
[normal]hat any cost reductions resulting from legal reforms are passed through to consumers.
[normal] In the absence of proper regulation of this broken market
[normal],
[normal] we
[normal] 
[normal]believe motorists will not gain any benefit from a reduction in the number of accidents and claims
[normal].
[normal] Car insu
[normal]rers should operate transparently and should not seek to influence public policy using information that cannot be independently verified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The lack of transparency on the part of the leading car insurers is most clearly evident in the failure of AVIVA and [bold]AXA to provide information on the profits they make from this captive market.  We believe that their failure to report trading figures for car insurance is a clear breach of International Financial Reporting Standards, which require public companies to rep[bold]ort separately on an operating segment contributing 10% or more to overall reported profit.[bold] We urge the Transport Select Committee to seek an explanation for [bold]their failure to comply with this[bold] basic reporting requirement.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As a 
[normal]short-term
[normal] measure
[normal], we argue 
[normal]that the car insurers should share some of their inflated profits with the public through a windfall tax that would be ring-fenced for investment in measures to improve road safety. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission consists mainly of new information that has emerged sinc
[normal]e the 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport Select Committee’s consultation 
[normal]in April 2013
[normal], to which we also made a submission
[normal], a copy of which is attached.
[normal] The arguments we put forward in that submission still stand. The information that has emerged subsequently serves only to reinfo
[normal]rce them.

[normal]2 [bold]About Thompsons[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thompsons Solicitors has been standing up for the injured and mistreated since the firm was founded by Harry Thompson in 1921. We have fought for millions of people, won countless landmark cases and secured key legal reforms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have more experience of w
[normal]inning personal injury and employment claims than any other firm – and we use that experience solely for the injured and mistreated.
[normal] 
[normal]We do not work for insurance companies or employers
[normal],
[normal] a
[normal]nd we have 
[normal]never taken 
[normal]part in the merry-go-round of referrals betwee
[normal]n the insurance industry, claims companies and some lawyers
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3 [bold]Motor insurance - a broken market[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As car insurance is a legal requirement for motorists, it is vital the provision of this product functions in a way that is competitive and treats consumers 
[normal]fairly both in terms of value and their ability to make genuine claims. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n our view, motorists are ill-served by a market dominated by a handful of providers who 
[normal]have an agenda 
[normal]to 
[normal]persuade politicians and 
[normal]government 
[normal]of the need to introduce further legal
[normal] reforms 
[normal]that will serve 
[normal]to boost 
[normal]their already substantial profits. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Five key facts underpin our analy
[normal]sis of the broken state of this
[normal] market, from a consumer’s point of view:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We will look at each of these points in turn and substantiate them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1[bold] [bold]Market domination[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Association of British Insurers says
[normal] there are 23.8 private vehicles insured in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. Published financial information show
[normal]s
[normal] sales of motor policies by the four market leaders in 2012 were as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]AXA is French owned and 
[normal]does not 
[normal]disclose 
[normal]the details of its trading activities 
[normal]in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]car insurance 
[normal]market. However, we estimate from the limited 
[normal]information
[normal] available that they are not far behind
[normal] AVIVA in sales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] Profits - substantial and rising[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Direct Line[bold] - In the first nine
[normal] months of 2013, Direct Line made an operating profit of £418m, a 20.1% increase on the same period last year (£348m). In its annual accounts, Direct Line gives a separate figure for operating profit from 
[normal]UK
[normal] motor insurance. In 2012, this was £262m, a 3% i
[normal]ncrease on 2011 (£255m).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Admiral[bold] - 
[normal]In the first half of 2013, the second largest car insurer saw its profits from the UK market increase 5% to £192.7 million (H1 2012: £183.3 million). This follows a bumper year in 2012 when its profit from the UK car 
[normal]ins
[normal]urance
[normal] rose 19% to £373m (2011: £314m).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AVIVA[bold] - The third largest car insurer does not divulge its profits from selling motor insurance, despite - like Direct Line and Admiral - being listed on the London Stock Exchange
[normal]. Its 2012 annual report did, howeve
[normal]r, say that
[normal] 
[normal]it had increased the number of motor insurance policies sold by 250,000 to nearly 2.5 
[normal]million 
[normal]customers. It also said 
[normal]the group had generated £448m in operating profit from selling general insurance in the UK, which included ‘
[normal]good profitability
[normal] in personal lines’ 
[normal](
[normal]motor
[normal] and homeowner
[normal] insurance
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]International Financial Reporting Standards 
[normal](IFRS) 
[normal]require public companies to report
[normal] 
[normal]separately on an operating segment that contributes 10% or more to overall reported profit. 
[normal]Given that 
[normal]AVIVA 
[normal]achiev
[normal]ed a better ‘combined operating ratio’ for motor insurance than Direct Line (97% versus 101.6%) – albeit on a smaller customer base – it seems very likely that UK motor insurance on its own accounted for more than 10% of AVIVA’s 2012 operating profit of £1
[normal].888 billion. On this basis
[normal], we would argue AVIVA is in breach of IFRS 
[normal]segmental reporting requirements.
[normal] Indeed, once non-operating and restructuring costs are added back, 
[normal]AVIVA made a profit before tax of only £25m, which suggests profits from motor insur
[normal]ance
[normal] 
[normal]have been propping up an ailing company and funding mouth-watering pay outs to shareholders (see below) and executives (including a £5m plus remuneration package for new chief executive Mark Wilson).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AXA[bold] - The French-headquartered insurance group, wh
[normal]ich is listed on the Paris Bourse, does not give separate profit figures for UK motor insurance. However, AXA UK &amp; Ireland did issue a press release on 21
[normal]st
[normal] February 2013 saying: “Motor profitability improved in 2012
[normal].”
[normal] 
[normal]As with AVIVA, we would argue AXA is 
[normal]in breach of IFRS and should be required to provide segmental trading information for this market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] Over-provision [bold]and ongoing decrease in [bold]bodily injury claims [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Direct Line[bold] [bold]- T
[normal]he market leader
[normal] was able to make substantial
[normal] 
[normal]releases from 
[normal]its overall cla
[normal]ims 
[normal]reserves in 2012 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]because of ‘favourable bodily injury experience for recent accident years’ and admitted claims ‘continue to be’ lower than ‘actuarial expectations
[normal]’
[normal]. In
[normal] 
[normal]the first nine months of 2013, Direct Line 
[normal]released a further 
[normal]£311.1 million
[normal] from reserves and said: “
[normal]The bulk of the release arose in the Motor division where the Group has experienced favourable development on bodily injury claims, which is currently expected to continue
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Admiral[bold] - The second ranked player released 
[normal]£23.5m 
[normal]in 2
[normal]012 
[normal]from its
[normal] reserves for 
[normal]UK
[normal] car insurance
[normal] claims
[normal], 128% more than in the previous year. Then, in the first half of 2013, it was able to make even higher releases of £29.7m in just six months
[normal]. Like Direct Line, Admiral 
[normal]admitted it had over-provided
[normal] and that it was seeing an ongoing reduction in claims. Its half year statement said: “
[normal]These higher releases were possible due to the positive claims experience during 2012 and the first half of 2013, which resulted in improvements in the projected ultimat
[normal]e loss ratios, especially for the 2010 to 2012 underwriting years.
[normal]” Chief executive Henry 
[normal]Englehardt
[normal] added: “We were able to increase profits largely due to excellent claims experience”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AXA and AVIVA do not 
[normal]disclose
[normal] information on 
[normal]reserves releases.

[normal]Dividend payments thi
[normal]s year are equivalent to £63 for
[normal] 
[normal]each of their 7.6 million 
[normal]policy holder
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Both Direct Line
[normal] and Admiral have indicated 
[normal]to shareholders 
[normal]that they expect dividend payments to continue to
[normal] increase.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AVIVA 
[normal]does not pay a dividend directly attributable to its 
[normal]UK
[normal] car insurance division. However, it is interesting to note that the 
[normal]gr
[normal]oup’s latest market 
[normal](7.11.13) 
[normal]update says:  
[normal]“
[normal]O
[normal]ur focus is on improving dividends paid by our business units to G
[normal]roup
[normal]”. 
[normal] In 2012, AVIVA group paid dividends to shareholders and coupon payments to bond holders worth £847m (the dividends being for 
[normal]a two-year period)
[normal]. 
[normal]In 2013, 
[normal]AVIVA 
[normal]has 
[normal]paid 
[normal]shareholders a total of approximately £430m.
[normal] Given car insurance is a highly pr
[normal]ofitable revenue stream in a largely unprofitable group, it is fair to say motorists have served as a cash cow for shareholders at a time when they might otherwise
[normal] not
[normal] have received any dividends.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similarly, 
[normal]AXA
[normal] UK pay
[normal]s
[normal] dividends to its French parent
[normal], whi
[normal]ch
[normal] are in turn paid out to shareholders
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5[bold] Having it both ways[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Vehicle repair referral f[bold]ees[bold] - The 
[normal]current Competition 
[normal]Commission investigation into the private motor insurance market
[normal] has 
[normal]provisionally 
[normal]conclu
[normal]ded
[normal] 
[normal]that “
[normal]the separation of cost liability and cost control in the provision of post-accident services to non-fault 
[normal]PMI (personal motor insurance) c
[normal]laimants does appear to give rise to a moral hazard problem, whereby the ultimate costs paid by the fault insurer are 
[normal]higher than they would otherwise be
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The investigation has found that 
[normal]this 
[normal]can increase the average cost of a non-fault repair by 
[normal]‘
[normal]up to around £270 if the non-fault insurer manages the repair
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] However, while these inflated costs are passed on to the motorist in higher prem
[normal]iums, the insurance companies have been
[normal] banking the referral fees to boost their bottom line. Direct Line, for example, benefited to the tune of £25.9m in 2012 from revenue fo
[normal]r vehicle recovery and repair services
[normal], according to its annual report. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Legal referral fees go in-house[bold] - 
[normal]Admiral 
[normal]has responded to the ban on personal injury referral fees, from which it earned £18.6m in 2012, by setting 
[normal]up its own legal businesses, 
[normal]Admi
[normal]ral Law and BDE Law. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Admiral says ‘n
[normal]ew and proposed reforms to the handling of bodily injury claims mean that the businesses are not expected to make a material contribution to Group profits in the foreseeable future
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] However, Admiral is clearly trying t
[normal]o gain a competitive advantage following the 
[normal]Jackson
[normal] reforms by creating a legal business that has a guaranteed income
[normal] and no marketing costs for 
[normal]cases that are, in effect, referred in-house
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Online driving records[bold] 
[normal]–Cabinet Office Minister
[normal] Francis Maude
[normal] 
[normal]told the media this month
[normal] (9.1.14) that most of the UK’s 40 million motorists would see premiums fall as a result of the introduction of online driving records by the middle of next year.  The Association of British Insurers said ‘honest’ motorists could s
[normal]ee premiums fall by up to £15 a year. But no one produced a shred of evidence to support these assertions
[normal], and there is every reason to assume – based on the financial behaviour of the car insurers outlined above – that 
[normal]any
[normal] cost saving to the insurers from accessing online driving records will simply boost 
[normal]their 
[normal]profits
[normal]. This 
[normal]is
[normal] yet another case of the car insurers wanting it both ways: taxpayers funding systems that help them make more profit for distribution to shareholder
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]Car insurers should be charged for accessing online driving records with the proceeds earmarked for road safety[bold] (see below).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold] Transparency and political lobbying[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The facts outlined above add up to a market that serves consumers poorly, to say the l
[normal]east. We believe this situation has come about because the car insurers have gained a disproportionate influence over government policy and 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]lack 
[normal]of 
[normal]a
[normal] regulatory framework 
[normal]means 
[normal]that 
[normal]there is insufficient 
[normal]transparency and accountability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 Lobbying  [bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The car insurers are brazen
[normal] 
[normal]about their lobbying activities. Direct Line, for example, said in its annual report:  
[normal]“
[normal]With the ongoing debates in the motor market surrounding referral and legal fees, the increase in whiplash claims and the implementation 
[normal]of the gender directive, we aim to be leaders through this period of change and lobby for reform to provide the best outcome for our customers and shareholders
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Being ‘leaders’ appears to mean 
[normal]a regular flow of 
[normal]e mails 
[normal]to MPs from individual insurance companies and from the ABI and the holding of meetings on parliamentary premises 
[normal]about a ‘whiplash pandemic’ 
[normal]and a ‘compensation culture’ 
[normal]without 
[normal]no apparent embarrassment
[normal] at the inconsistency - to put it euphemistically 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]that they are at the same time saying in
[normal] their shareholder communications 
[normal]that 
[normal]bodily injury claims have been falling in recent years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is 
[normal]a 
[normal]lobbying activity 
[normal]that 
[normal]would not be covered by the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Un
[normal]ion Administration Bill in its present form.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 [bold]Transparency [bold]and accountability[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Car insurance is a necessity
[normal] yet, unlike other necessities such as utilities, it is not regulated in a way that ensures the public and policy makers have the 
[normal]facts
[normal] they need to make informed decisions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]evidence
[normal] in this submission has been painstakingly 
[normal]extracted 
[normal]from various published 
[normal]sources but 
[normal]it is
[normal] far from complete because the car insurers are not required to provide information about their finances and c
[normal]laims in a consistent and comprehensive way
[normal]. In our view
[normal],
[normal] a
[normal]ny company
[normal] selling insurance to UK motorists -
[normal] whether private or public,
[normal] foreign or UK owned - should be obliged to conform to the same reporting sta
[normal]ndards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the short term, the S[bold]elect Committee [bold]may wish to [bold]ask[bold] AVIVA [bold]and AXA why they are not meeting international accountancy standards for public companies by reporting separately [bold]on the UK car insurance market.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5 Road safety[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Louise 
[normal]Ellman’s
[normal] letter raises the important question of
[normal] information sharing 
[normal]between the Department for Transport and police 
[normal]about accidents so that spending on road safety can be better targeted. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK has 77 cars per kilometre of road compared to a European average of 43. 
[normal]Congestion is bound to increase th
[normal]e risk of road accidents and therefore personal injury. Car insurers are in possession of vital data that could be used to highlight acciden
[normal]t trouble-
[normal]spots and prioritise 
[normal]the allocation of funds for 
[normal]investment in road
[normal] safety. 
[normal]In our view[bold],[bold] it is without que[bold]stion that t[bold]hey should therefore be [bold]required to take part in[bold] any information-sharing arrangements.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]At the same time, there is a strong case for levying a windfall tax on car insurers so that some of the profits bonanza they have enjoyed in recent years is[bold] channelled into investment in road safety. The money raised could be ring-fenced and used to tackle the worst trouble-spots as a matter of urgency.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6 Access to justice[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Raising the small claims track limit[bold] - 
[normal]The car insurers are actively lobbying for the small claims track limit to be raised to £5,000 from the current level of £1,000.  
[normal]Our arguments against the raising of the small claims limit can be summarised as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the very least
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]we fully support the view expressed in L
[normal]ouise 
[normal]Ellman’s
[normal] letter that the g
[normal]overnment shou
[normal]ld analyse the impact of the electronic portal 
[normal]before
[normal] it considers whether or not to increase th
[normal]e threshold.
[normal] 
[normal]It is clear from [bold]our evidence [bold]above that [bold]the number of bodily injury clai[bold]ms is not as high as was claimed by the car insurers[bold] and therefore there i[bold]s no case for rushing into further legal changes until the facts and all the implications are much clearer.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]From our own work, we know that people with genuine claims are often pressurised into accepting less compensation than they deserve by 
[normal]insurers and 
[normal]lawyers acting for
[normal] them
[normal]. We attach as an appendix 
[normal]the 
[normal]case of
[normal] Donald and Enid 
[normal]Winterbottom
[normal], which highlights how raising the threshold for the portal could undermine access to justice for genuine claimants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Information for motorists on their [bold]legal rights[bold] – The Competition Commission’s recommendation that motorists should automatically be provided with information on their legal rights in the event of an accident is very welcome (Private Motor Insurance Market Investigation – Notice of Possible
[normal] Remedies, 17.12.13). We are, however, concerned that the Commission suggests in 21(c) that this should be provided by the Association of British Insurers. In our view, this would be a travesty. The ABI exists to protect the interests of car insurers, wher
[normal]eas any statement of consumer rights must be seen to be entirely independen
[normal]t.

[normal]Appendix A[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study: Donald and Enid [bold]Winterbottom[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Donald and Enid 
[normal]Winterbottom
[normal], aged 81 and 79 respectively, w
[normal]ere injured on 12 January 2012 when a car overtaking from the opposite direction hit their car head-on. 
[normal]Mrs
[normal] 
[normal]Winterbottom
[normal] was airlifted to hospital with a severe whiplash injury. The next day while 
[normal]Enid
[normal] was still in hospital, and with no discussion with her
[normal], their legal expense insurers, 
[normal]Cogents
[normal], started a claim. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The medical ‘expert’ appointed by 
[normal]Cogents
[normal] estimated that both Donald and Enid would recover from their injuries within 
[normal]seven
[normal] months and the company estimated damages for 
[normal]Mrs
[normal] 
[normal]Winterbottom
[normal] at £1,800
[normal] – £2,000.

[normal]Donald and Enid rejected the offer and moved their claim to 
[normal]Mr
[normal] 
[normal]Winterbottom’s
[normal] old union, Unite Legal Services, in November 2012. In July 2013 Thompsons Solicitors settled 
[normal]Mrs
[normal] 
[normal]Winterbottom’s
[normal] case for £8,000, four times the estimated damages. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The lawyer at Thompsons who ran the case, Hazel Webb, found that 
[normal]Cogents
[normal] had failed to take proper instructions from the 
[normal]Winterbottoms
[normal] and referred them to the wrong type of medical expert who missed the long-term impact of one of 
[normal]Mrs
[normal] 
[normal]Winterbottom’s
[normal] injuri
[normal]es – namely, numbness in her hand which needed an 
[normal]orthopaedic
[normal] specialist to whom Thompsons referred her.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Enid 
[normal]Winterbottom
[normal] said
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]“We didn’t ask for Cogent and we can only assume they got our details from our car insurance company. We were in shock after t
[normal]he accident yet we were harassed with phone calls from 
[normal]Cogents
[normal] pushing us to make a claim and then, when we agreed, the way we were dealt with was so impersonal we felt like we were just a statistic
[normal].
[normal] Their letters were in legal mumbo jumbo
[normal],
[normal] and we struggle
[normal]d to make sense of t
[normal]hem
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The disinterest of the doctor they appointed was shocking. He was clearly just there to tick boxes. I had an imprint of the seat belt across my stomach and the doctor didn’t even look at it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]In the end they only offered us 
[normal]£1,800. For all the trauma of the accident and the knock-on effect it had on our lives, it just seemed far too low. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“It was at this point we saw a Unite leaflet which said we could pursue a claim with them because Donald had been a member when he was wor
[normal]king as an engineer. Immediately we felt a relief because a solicitor from Thompsons came to see us in our h
[normal]ome. 
[normal]With no children it was such a relief to know and feel that our case was being handled correctly. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The accident made us 
[normal]realise
[normal] we are not as
[normal] invincible as we once thought we were. It’s been a very traumatic period in our lives, especially as the accident wasn’t our fault. Our confidence completely collapsed, and it is only in past few months that we have started to feel like we are on the way 
[normal]to recovery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]What happened to us is a real warning to others – don’t allow yourself to be pushed into having your insurers appoint people to act for you and get a second opinion if you are in any doubt.”
