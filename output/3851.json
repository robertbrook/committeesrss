"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Justice (JRR 0018)&#xa0;“There is no principle more basic to our system of law than the maintenance of the rule of law itself and the constitutional protection offered by judicial review”&#xa0;Lord Dyson, R (Cart) v Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 2, at 122&#xa0;JUSTICE considers that the proposals for reform in Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform are ill-considered, poorly evidenced  and ill-advised.  &#xa0;Modern judicial review provides an essential opportunity for people who are aggrieved by poor public decision-making to take their challenge to an independent and impartial tribunal with the power to undo or reverse its effects and to require the decision to be taken again.  In a country with no written constitution to control the relationship between the citizen and the State, this function takes on a particular constitutional significance.  &#xa0;Clearly, it must be open to the Government – and to Parliament – to review whether the existing arrangements for judicial review are working.  However, the constitutional importance of judicial review places a significant responsibility on reformers to justify the need for change and to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to preserve access to justice, accountability and good administration.  We are concerned that the Consultation fails to take this obligation seriously.  &#xa0;Changes proposed to legal aid for judicial review – together with other proposals to limit access to funding for prisoners and non-residents – appear designed to insulate public decision makers (including central Government) from effective judicial oversight.  Minor amendments to the Government’s earlier proposals introduce a possible discretionary payment for some work done on risk, in some cases, according to limited criteria.  This, in our view, is far from adequate to meet the damage that the proposed cuts may do to the availability of advice and representation for vulnerable people who want to complain about their treatment by public bodies.  &#xa0;New proposals on standing and costs could significantly impact upon public interest litigation within the United Kingdom, without clear evidence to support the case for change.  We seriously regret that nothing in the Consultation appears to consider or evaluate the important public interest function played by organisations who expend resources to bring cases in their own name when they would otherwise not be heard.  The picture painted by the Consultation of the conduct of third party interveners neglects that the role of organisations who intervene in the public interest is to assist the court.  In light of the enthusiasm expressed by our senior judiciary for the impartial assistance provided by third party interventions in the public interest – including those by JUSTICE – this is surprising.  &#xa0;It is regrettable that the measures in the Consultation which address standing, protective costs orders and the costs of interventions appear to neglect the gatekeeper function of the courts in making these public interest orders.  In each of our domestic courts, the question of standing, permission to intervene, and the imposition of costs orders remains squarely within the power of our judges.   The current rules strike a fine balance between the proper, efficient and fair administration of justice and the public interest in ensuring that significant public interest cases are heard and when they are heard, any information of value to the court is available without undue restraint of costs risk.  &#xa0;The Government’s proposed short timetable for the consideration of responses to its Consultation, and the implementation of the reforms, does not allow adequate time for reflection and analysis.  JUSTICE is concerned that without such opportunity for fuller consideration, the proposals will lead to a significant shift in administrative law practice in this country to the detriment of the constitutional relationship between individuals and the State.  Introduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is no principle more basic to our system of law than the maintenance of the rule of law itself and the constitutional protection offered by judicial review\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Constitutional significance of judicial review&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n…with the existence of a great bureaucracy there are inevitably occasions, not \ninsignicant\n in number, when through error or indifference, injustice is done – or appears to be done … But too often the little man, the ordinary humble citizen is incapable of asserting himself…The little man has become too used to being pushed around: it rarely occurs to him that there is any appeal from what “they” have decided.  And as this Report shows, too often in fact there is not.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJudicial review under the common law is based upon an understanding of the respective constitutional responsibilities of public authorities and the courts.  The \nconstitutional function of the courts in the field of public law is to ensure, so far as they can, that public authorities respect the rule of law.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPublic law is not at its base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWith the ever-increasing power of Government, which now commands almost half the country’s GDP, \n[the court’s]\n function of calling the executive to account could not more important. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhile the Government is entitled to look at the way that JR is operating and to propose improvements, we must look at any proposed changes with particular care, because of the importance of maintaining JR, and also bearing in mind that the proposed changes come from the very body which is at the receiving end of JR.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEvidence-based policy making: the case for change&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStanding and third party interventions &#xa0;\nJUSTICE does not agree that there is a problem with the current test for standing under section 31(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and as interpreted by the courts. \n&#xa0;\nThe current law\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n \n&#xa0;\nThe case for change\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIntervention and the public interest\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAn intervention is however of no assistance if it merely repeats points which the appellant or respondent has already made.\n&#xa0;\nAlthough no such specific guidance is given in connection with reasonable intervention in the High Court and the Court of Appeal, it is understood by practice that submissions made must assist the court by adding something tangible to its consideration of the case so as to serve the public interest.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBut from our – or at least my \n–\n point of view, provided they stick to the rules, interventions are enormously helpful. \n…\n The most frequent are NGOs such as Liberty and Justice, whose commitment is usually to a principle rather than a \nperson. They usually supply arguments and authorities, rather than factual information, which the parties may not have supplied.\n&#xa0;\nCosts&#xa0;Legal aid: shifting risk to claimant solicitors\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDiscretionary payments by the LAA \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProtective costs orders\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInterveners and costs\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProcedural defects in decisions&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOnce it is appraised of a procedural impropriety the court will always be slow to say in effect , ‘no harm has been done’.  That usually would involve arrogating to itself a value \njudgement\n which Parliament has left to others.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Public Sector Equality Duty &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Combined effect of these proposals and other proposed reform&#xa0;P\nroposals to reform legal aid, in particular the proposed introduction of a residence test\n &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;P\nrovisions in Part 2 of the Immigration Bill reducing rights of appea\nl against immigration decisions\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n25\n              \n For example, see \nss\n 1 and 3.\n Lord Dyson, \nR (Cart) v Upper Tribunal \n[2011] UKSC 2, at 122\n.\n \nSee JUSTICE, Response to Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform, November 2013 (“\nJUSTICE, \nConsultation Response”)\n,\n \nparas\n 4-8 for detailed background to the Consultation. \nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/359/judicial-review-proposals-for-further-reform\n. \n \nJUSTICE, \nConsultation Response\n.\n The Dynamics of Judicial Review Litigation: the resolution of public law challenges before final hearing, \nVarda\n \nBondy\n and Maurice \nSunkin\n, 2009.  See also \nJudicial Review Reform:  Who is afraid of judicial review?

The Canadian Supreme Court held that in determining whether to grant public interest standing, a court should weigh the following factors: (1) Whether there is a serious \njusticiable\n issue raised; (2) Whether the plaintiff has a real stake or a genuine interest in it; and (3) Whether, in all the circumstances, the proposed suit is a reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the courts. Further, the Supreme Court ruled that the factors were not to be viewed as a rigid checklist, but should be “considered in a purposive, flexible and generous manner”. Finally, “courts should exercise their discretion and balance the underlying rationale for restricting standing with the important role of the courts in assessing the legality of government action.”\n Order 84 Rule 20(4) of Ireland’s Rules of the Superior Courts requires “sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates” before applicants may be granted leave for judicial review. The courts have approached the question of standing for organisations on a discretionary basis. Thus, a bona fide organisation with a genuine interest can bring a challenge if the individual affected is not in a position to effectively assert the claim (\nIrish Penal Reform Trust Limited &amp; Ors v the Governor of \nMountjoy\n Prison &amp; Ors \n[2005] IEHC 305), or if the issue is one that affects almost all of the population and it is unlikely that any individual would litigate the matter (\nDigital Rights Ireland v The Minister of Communication, Marine and Natural Resource &amp; Ors. \n[2010] IEHC 221).\n Section 38 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 grants the following categories of individuals or groups the right to bring a challenge in cases where a Bill of Rights guarantee has been allegedly infringed or threatened: “(c) \nanyone acting as a member of, or in the interest of, a group or class of persons; (d) anyone acting in the public interest; and (e) an association acting in the interest of its members.”\n \nS.P. Gupta v President of India &amp; Ors \nAIR 1982 SC 149 (Supreme Court of India), Justice \nBhagwati\n: “If no one can maintain an action for redress of such public wrong or public injury, it would be disastrous for the rule of law, for it would be open to the State or a public authority to act with impunity beyond the scope of its power or in breach of a public duty owed by it….[W]\nhenever\n there is a public wrong or public injury caused by an act or omission of the State or a public authority which is contrary to the Constitution or the law, any member of the public acting bona fide and having sufficient interest can maintain an action for \nredressal\n of such public wrong or public injury.”\n The “direct and individual concern” test which operates in EU law is subject to criticism in its own right, for example, C-50/00P \nUnión de \nPequeños\n \nAgricultores\n v Council of the European Union \n[2002] ECR I-6677.\n Who guards the Guardians, Baroness Hale, Public Law Project Conference, Judicial Review: Trends and Forecasts, 14 October 2013.\n \nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/data/files/Rahmatullah_JUSTICE_PRESS_RELEASE_FINAL_-_311012.pdf\n  (Lord Kerr)\n \nJUSTICE, \nConsultation Response\n, \npara\n 72.\n \nIn Re A Child (Northern Ireland) \n[2008] UKHL 66\n.\n \n Who Guards the Guardians, Public Law Project Conference: Judicial Review Trends and Forecasts, 14 October 2013. \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/144/who-guards-the-guardians\n \n \nJUSTICE, \nConsultation Response\n, \nparas\n 48, 55.\n \nJUSTICE, \nConsultation Response\n, \npara\n 52.\n \nThe \ncriteria \nto be applied: \na) the reason that costs were not obtained; b) the extent to which the client obtained the benefit sought in the proceedings; c) the reason why the client obtained that benefit; and d) the likelihood at the point of settlement that permission would have been granted.\n \nVarda\n \nBondy\n and Maurice \nSunkin\n, How many JRs are too many?
