defaultWritten evidence submitted by The Crown Estate (CCS19)defaultSummary:defaultThe key messages articulated below can be summarised as the following:-default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Estate welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to
default the
default Commons Select Committee inquiry into carbon capture and storage (CCS)
default.
default  
defaultT
defaulthe focus of our
default response 
defaultis 
defaulton the offshore transport and storage components
default,
default 
defaultas this is where we are able to bring to bear an in
default-
defaultdepth understanding of the potential benefits that 
defaultCCS could have
default,
default as well as the barriers to development and ways to overcome them
default. 
default The statements contained are in the context of The Crown Estate’s role and 
defaultresponsibilities with 
defaultregards to 
defaultrights to leasing of carbon dioxide transportation and storage in
defaultfrastructure 
defaultwithin areas 
defaulton 
defaultand beneath 
defaultthe 
defaultUK 
defaultseabed
default that we manage
default. 
default 
defaultThe Crown Estate has been working with
default the CCS
default industry
default on project specific cases, (including power station developers, potential industrial users and potential storage providers)
default 
defaultas
default well as 
defaultthrough the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force
default in 2012/13, which was chaired by the CCSA, 
defaultto identify ways of 
defaulthelping to 
defaultreduc
defaulte
default the cost of 
defaultdeploying 
defaultCCS infrastructure
default and promoting an intelligent systems design in the 2020s. 
defaultThe Task Force signalled 
defaultthe importance of storage to the cost and deployment of this technology and highlighted 
defaultaspects
default such as 
defaultstorage 
defaultsite availability and 
defaultstore 
defaultviability as being critical to its delivery. 
default We are now leading an industry Transport and Storage Development Group
default to take forward recommendations of the Task Force and assist delivery of proven storage sites and transport infrastructure.
defaultDuring the past year, we signed the UK’s first two Agreements for Lease for the permanent geological storage of CO2, representing a
default positive milestone in the plan to build a demonstration project in the UK. These agreements provide exclusive time-limited options with pre-agreed terms for leases, allowing developers to progress their projects through to a Final Investment Decision (FID
default).
defaultWe suggest that any policy developed for CCS needs to enable opportunistic deployment for all sectors that can make use of the infrastructure, e.g. the offshore oil and gas sector (enhanced oil recovery (EOR) &amp; enhanced gas recovery (EGR)), 
defaultnatural gas 
defaultprocessing, coal and gas fired power generation, and 
defaultindustrial 
defaultprocesses such as iron and steel
default.  
defaultIn order to de-risk the delivery of the UK’s aspirations for energy security, decarbonisation and retention of its industries in a low carbon world, w
defaulte belie
defaultve that domestic policy should support a clear route to market across 
defaultall 
defaultthese
default sectors
default 
defaultthat can leverage an early clear
default route to market for the power sector.
defaultIn
default our view policy should help drive both ends of the 
defaultCCS 
defaultchain (capture, along with transport and storage) towards 
defaultdeployment of 
defaultfull chain 
defaultinfrastructure
default (through incentives and obligations)
default,
default as well as clearly setting out how this sits alongside the wider discussion on energy security.  This should include pro
defaultviding incentives for bringing storage forward at a pace that delivers de-risked stores, in parallel with designing and developing new low carbon fossil fuel power stations.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestions posed in call for evidence:defaultEach of the questions asked by the Committee has been considered in turn. 
default 
defaultWe have focused the submission of evidence primarily on those 
defaultin which we can add most value 
defaultfrom the experience we have gained 
defaultin our role 
defaultat
default The Crown Estate
default.
defaultIt was clear from our work on the cost reduction taskforce that 
defaultcapture 
defaulttechnology providers will be able to answer this in far more precise detail 
defaultthan 
defaultwe could offer on post
default-combustion, pre-combustion or oxyfuel techniques and product delivery.
default  The capabilities of CO
default2
default transport and storage technologies have been demonstrated elsewhere, for example in North America and Norway, over many years and experience in these operation
defaults is best provided by the oil and gas industry.
defaultIt is widely acknowledged
default that tackling climate change requires 
defaulta 
defaultglo
defaultbal 
defaultresponse
default.
default 
default 
defaultThe International Energy Agency
default (IEA)
default considers successful deployment of CCS as critical to global efforts 
defaultin
default mitigat
defaulting
default climate change and to keep
defaulting
default global warming 
defaulttemperature rises 
defaultbelow 2°C.
default 
defaultFor the UK
default, the 80% reduction in greenhouse ga
defaultses by 2050 (as defined by the Climate Change Act 2008) requires a significant 
defaultchange in the way we generate and use energy
default. Projections from the Committee on Climate Change show that the power sector will need to be largely decarbonised by around 2030 in 
defaultorder to be on track to hit the 2050 targets (given the difficulties in achieving emissions reductions elsewhere in the economy
default)
default.
default 
defaultMany alternate scenarios can be created as to what the energy mix could or should 
defaultlook like 
defaultin the future
default; but one thing which seems clear is that by just shifting the fossil fuel use from coal to gas will not in itself deliver the targets that are required in the Climate Change Act
default (2008)
default – particularly given the 
defaultextent of 
default“locked-in” fossil fuel plant, whic
defaulth has been made 
defaultmore certain
default by the gas generation strategy and the grandfathering of gas plants
default under the Emissions Performance Standard
default.  
defaultCCS can be used with both coal or gas power stations and therefore early deployment of transport and storage infrast
defaultructure can provide an effective hedge, keeping options open for 
defaulteither fuel within the nation’s 
defaultlow carbon 
defaultportfolio.
defaultBoth DECC and the Committee on Climate Change identify the primary options for power sector decarbonisation to 2030 as (in no particular 
defaultorder): large scale renewables, nuclear, CCS, and energy efficiency. DECC’s CCS Roadmap identifies that CCS has the potential to be one of the most cost effective technologies for decarbonisation of the UK’s power and industrial sectors. In the power secto
defaultr, CCS has a unique 
defaultplace 
defaultin providing a continuing role for flexible fossil fuel capacity that is able to respond to demand in the way that other low carbon technologies 
defaultcan
defaultnot. 
defaultOf course it is understood that the three-stage process of CCS, including tra
defaultnsportation and storage, has yet to be demonstrated on large scale power stations, which is why the successful deployment of projects in the DECC commercialisation programme is critical.
defaultBeyond the power sector, 
defaultCCS is almost unique in its 
defaultpotential 
defaultto hel
defaultp reduce emissions from industries where there are no alternative abatement technologies e.g. cement
default,
default 
defaultfertiliser 
defaultand 
defaultsteel 
defaultproduction processes
default.
default 
default 
defaultWhilst we feel that CCS power projects are likely to come before industrial CCS; smaller scale industrial proj
defaultects do need to start sooner rather than later in order to leverage synergies wherever possible to ensure that learning occurs in sufficient time to hit decarbonisation targets beyond 2030.
default 
default 
defaultDECC and the Committee on Climate Change have outlined 
defaulta wide ran
defaultge of scenarios for the relative contribution 
defaultof low carbon technologies 
defaultin recent publications
default.
default 
defaultFigure 1: DECC Scenarios defaultfor installed capacity in default2030default (GW)defaultFigure 2: CCC Scenarios defaultfor installed capacity in default2030default (GW) – note that all the scenarios presented reach a power sector emissions intensity of 50g/KWhdefaultOur observations on these scenarios are as follows:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe scenarios 
defaultdemonstrate that CCS could potentially make a very significant contribution to decarbonisa
defaulttion by 2030 – with up to 15GW of capacity envisaged.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the level of ambition for 2030 power sector decarbonisation increases, the need for CCS to make a contribution also increases. CCS makes a very significant contribution to all of the scenarios which 
defaulthit 50g/KWh by 2030 (for example 9GW in DECC’s scenarios; 10-15GW in CCC’s scenarios).
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCCS could play an important balancing role alongside other low carbon technologies such as nuclear and renewables.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe risk of not developing CCS is that decarbonisation
default options become more limited, and power sector decarbonisation becomes much harder to achieve.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst
default the scenarios show potential for CCS, they also highlight the uncertainty 
defaultpower generators face in making investment decisions without targeted policies t
defaulthat go beyond the renewables focus of t
defaulthe EMR Delivery Plan
default.
default 
defaultIn order to give greater confidence to the CCS industry, it will be important for the government to provide
default early and 
defaultconsistent signals over the level of ambition for decarbonisation
default; and f
defaulturth
defaulter 
defaultdetails on 
defaultto how CCS 
defaultwill be supported 
defaultbeyond the current commercialisation programme
default. It will be important to consider the contribution CCS can make in reducing industrial emissions as well as power sector emissions.

default 
default Many countries will be looking to the North Sea rather than using dry land storage potential.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to 
defaulta
default 
defaultNorth Sea 
default“storage market”
default, there is an opportunity for large scale deployment through the development of infrastructure (pipelines to storage) in a coordinated manner. 
defaultI
defaultt would seem prudent for the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and other North 
defaultSea
default basin countries to collaborate in o
defaultrder to drive forward early projects.
default 
default 
defaultThis would help to increase trade and supply chain opportunities
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPotential 
defaulteconomic opportunities 
defaultwill exist 
defaultfor UK supply chains that currently support the North Sea oil and gas industry
default.  If a CO
default2
default transport and st
defaultorage sector is encouraged to develop it will be possible to transfer skills, services and supply chains from oil and gas construction and operations.  Any decline in North Sea activity could be compensated for in CTS activity.  Growth could also be possib
defaultle if CTS 
defaultdeployment
default was to leverage oil and gas activity in both conventional storage and CO
default2
default enhanced hydrocarbon recovery.  
defaultAny roll-out of CCS power and industrial plant will increase the need for supply chains providing capture technologies and associ
defaultated services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Estate is very supportive of the
default £1bn commercialisation programme capital grant and 
defaultcontract for difference
default support 
defaultbeing provided by the Government 
defaultfor the two early projects
default – these projects will help understand deployment 
defaultand operational barriers along with the viability
default 
defaultof full scale
default CCS power generation. 
defaultIn a European context this is very progressive and 
defaultan excellent kick-start for
default the sector.  
defaultThis section will focus on 
defaultwhere we see the barriers that can potentially prevent CCS being a viable option for energy decarbonisation and 
defaultwhich can create a gap between aspiration and delivery in the UK.
default 
default 
defaultThese 
defaultbarriers 
defaultcan be seen as risks that need to be managed and mitigated.  W
defaulte have provided some suggestions for 
defaultmitigating these risks
default.
defaultContractdefaultsdefault for Differencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe EMR framework 
defaultoffers 
defaulta
default suite of measures to support and encourage the deployment of non-commercial technologies for energy system decarbonisation. In respect of CCS, it is
default 
defaultthe 
defaultContract for Difference Feed in Tariff 
default(
defaultCfD FiT
default)
default that will be used initially to remunerate b
defaultoth of th
defaulte projects 
defaultthat are currently preferred bidders in the DECC 
defaultcommercialisation 
defaultcompetition
default. This FiT is suitable for the first demonstration projects alongside capital grants because they are full chain and have an integrated transport and storage solution 
defaultallowing for risk and liability sharing to be established ahead of final investment decision (FID).
default&#xa0;
defaultCfD FiT focuses on
default, and is designed for, 
defaultthe investment risks involved in power generation projects.  
defaultAs with the first commercialisation project
defaults
default, this ap
defaultproach only 
defaultaddresses 
defaultthe risk and risk sharing for full chain CCS projects.  
defaultHowever t
defaultransport and permanent storage of CO
default2
default as a disposal service face
defaults
default a number of complex investment and deployment issues with risks that are quite different from those in 
defaultpower generation.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order for 
defaultfuture CCS 
defaultprojects to benefit from CfD FiTs, they will 
defaulttherefor 
defaultneed to have reached agreement across the full CCS chain.  Power generators generally do not have the expertise to develop CO
default2
default transport and storage solutions,
default and are dependent on third parties to agree novel business structures and counterparty arrangements to deal with the complex new value chain.  
defaultUnder the EMR framework there is therefor
defaulte
default a significant drag on 
defaultpower generators even being able to negotiate a
default CfD.  Furthermore, 
defaultwho, without an incentive, could deliver transport and storage infrastructure ahead of a guaranteed income?
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother barrier to the development of efficiently sized CTS infrastructure under EMR arises because 
defaultCfD FiT 
default funding 
defaultis directed 
defaultto the power 
defaultgenerator 
defaultonly
default.  A
defaults power plant developers will not build capture plant without guaranteed assurances of access to a transport and storage
default solution
default 
defaultproject development will
default likely 
defaultbe 
defaultlimit
defaulted
default to point to point projects rather than e
defaultncourage over sizing and sharing of infrastructure.
default 
default 
defaultK
defaultey to the success of CCS 
defaultdelivery 
defaultwill be avoid
defaulting the
default uncoordinated deployment of full chain integrated projects over the next decade
default, as this would
default do little to promote a
defaultn integrated
default transport infrast
defaultructure 
defaultapproach 
defaultor the development of storage hubs
default – both of which will lead to substantial cost reductions
default. 
default 
defaultSuch ‘point to point’ CCS projects will suffer economically from having 
defaultunnecessarily 
defaultexpensive transport and storage systems.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBecause of thes
defaulte timing, business model and coordination barriers, a significant risk therefor
defaulte
default exists that CCS will not become a viable option for power generators because the necessary disposal infrastructure will not be independently built.
default  
defaultThe Crown Estate is develo
defaultping an understanding of the market failures that we believe will stand in the way of the development of a mature CTS infrastructure and therefor
defaulte
default CCS as a viable power generation option.  Workshops with industry representatives have provided a comprehensi
defaultve background to various sources of market failures impeding the development of CTS infrastructure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe activities of Capture, Transport and Storage of CO
default2
default differ by industry type, risk/return profile and their development stage and must therefore be tac
defaultkled appropriately. 
defaultStorage development lead times can 
defaultbe 
defaultaround 10
default years 
defaultfor a new unexplored site 
defaultcompared to an average of 5 years for power generation projects.
default 
default 
defaultEncouraging up-front investment in de-risking storage and providing ’proven and bankable’ 
defaultstores will need to be a key policy focus.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn light of the above, 
defaultThe Crown Estate believes there are risks 
defaultin the current approach to
default 
default‘
defaultrolling out
default’
default CCS on power generation beyond the demonstration phase 
defaultand we see that this could be addressed through 
defaultenhancing EMR with additional interventions that recognise the particular complexities of the CCS value chain
default. 
default 
defaultThe power sector needs to see the 
defaultrequirement and purpose
default 
defaultof 
defaultCCS and needs to have the storage solutions delivered to them.
default&#xa0;
defaultCapacity MarketdefaultWe suggest that existing government policy for CCS and 
defaultthe 
defaultEMR 
defaultcapacity mechanism 
defaultin combination with the gas generation strategy and 
defaultCarbon Capture Readiness (
defaultCCR
default)
default creates
default 
defaulta further barrier to the development transport and storage infrastructure due to no
default clear imperative for developers to invest in CO
default2
default disposal.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Capacity Market
default 
defaultis 
defaultdesigned 
defaultto ensure there is sufficient capacity in place to cope with peaks and troughs in demand.  This can, however, lead to a large amount of money 
defaultbeing spent on
default plan
defaultt
defaults
default with ever-decreasing load factors over the next 15-20 years.  The alternative is that this plant is fitted with CCS and efficiently utili
defaults
defaultes a transport and storage infrastructure 
defaultsolution 
defaultthat has been facilitated through smart policies in addition to 
defaultEMR.
default  
defaultETI energy system modelling has indicated that deployment of CCS-equipped power generation will lead to a lower overall cost of decarbonisation for the UK economy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCarbon PricedefaultCarbon pricing can only influence power generator behaviour not
default that of
default the companies who are potential
default CTS 
defaultinfrastructure 
defaultdevelopers.  Whilst the carbon price floor can be a market mechanism to drive investment 
defaultby producers of carbon emissions 
defaultit does 
defaultexacerbate the timing, coordination and 
defaultphasing problem 
defaulthighlighted above.
default  Without a penalty on emissions commensurate with the cost of building the full CCS chain there are not likely to be investment
defaults
default 
defaultin CTS infrastructure.  With the current carbon price floor trajectory
default 
defaultthere is a high risk that 
defaultinvestment decisions 
defaulton CCS-e
defaultquipped gas power plants would not be influenced
default 
defaultuntil 
defaultthe mid-late 2020s.
default&#xa0;
defaultIndustrial CCSdefaultIndustrial decarbonisation is likely to require its own bespoke set of policies and support interventions.  However, it will require CTS infrastructure to be in 
defaultplace in advance if the least cost pathway is to be achieved and to ensure that industry is not adversely affected.  Logically this means that the use of CTS in power should be planned and designed with the whole system in mind.
default&#xa0;
defaultOdefaultvercomdefaultingdefault the barriersdefaultTo

defaultare required to address 
defaultthe structural problem 
defaultthat

defaultO2 transport and storage needs 
defaulta development pathway in parallel to EMR
default. 
default 
defaultAs it stands, EMR requires all CTS i
defaultnfrastructure to be funded from payments made to the power station (a trickle-down funding approach).  
defaultAn alternative would be a direct revenue stream for transporting and storing CO
default2
default, which results in removing (or lowering) one element of contractual risk
default for both the power station and the transport/store operator.
default 
default As all of the initial projects would by definition, need to be full chain, direct funding for the CTS infrastructure would not significantly impact the risk for early projects.  Any payment to 
defaultthe Transport and Store would net directly off payments that would have been made to the power station under EMR.  Once multiple CCS projects are operating in the UK
default,
default direct funding can reduce risk for all parties by providing greater price certainty and l
defaultower contract
defaultual
default risk.  The eventual contracting structure that arises in the industry will partially dictate the impact of this intervention.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultRevenue 
defaultc
defaultould most likely come from the CfD FiT
default funding body that is paid via a levy on suppliers and be delivered in the form of a fee per tonne of CO
default2
default.  If the revenue would otherwise have been supplied by a CfD FiT such a scheme could be reasonably cost-neutral.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation on most of the potential storage sites in the UKCS is still sparse. 
default 
defaultCollection of the necessary data is time-consuming and at the later stages of site characterisation costly. The gap between initial site screening and operation therefore puts
default significant capital at risk. 
default 
defaultThis will be most noticeable when developing new geological formations.  Not surprisingly, storage is therefore currently regarded as the most risky part of the CCS chain for project developers.
default 
defaultSpecifically targeted storage 
defaultexploration subsidies focused on early-stage development of the industry, could be used to target ‘new’ areas of storage or incremental work at existing storage sites (which would bring wider benefits).

default 
default The incentive could be relatively revenue neutral for Government if it was associated with a project which would otherwise have required a higher CfD FiT. 
default 
defaultAny
default exploration subsidies could encou
defaultrage early appraisal of storage and provide benefits through the de-risking of the wider storage area and gains from knowledge sharing to the CTS industry.
defaultInvestment in storage site appraisal could 
defaultalso 
defaultbe encouraged through different tax break options. O
defaultne option is 
defaulta c
defaultross-sector tax break which would allow losses or some form of ‘allowances for investment’ to be transferred from the CCS industry to other activities undertaken by the same company even if it is completely outside the CCS sphere. 
default 
defaultFor exam
defaultple if a potential s
defaulttorage developer
default was able to expense &gt;100% of their exploration cost against oil/gas income this could act as a sufficient primer
default.  
defaultThis can change the perspective of oil and gas operators late in a field life if they could appraise fro
defaultm their platform and potentially convert the facility. 
default 
defaultIts key benefit would be to encourage companies who would otherwise not be involved in CCS to get involved and provide equity at the early stage of the industry roll-out.  It could help
default to
default incentivise
default oil companies who due to their skills and expertise are seen as key stakeholders but have no incentive to get involved at present into the sector.
default 
defaultTax breaks could be relatively revenue neutral for Government as an improvement in project economics through a tax break should enable a lower CfD FiT price to be paid to power stations offsetting the loss in tax revenue.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default setting 
defaultof 
defaulttargets / emissi
defaulton 
defaultdrivers offer
default an understandable and robust commitment that would offer the power and storage industry the level of security it needs to invest in CCS. 
default 
defaultThe lack of targets / emissions drivers for CO
default2
default emissions 
defaultinevitably 
defaultcreates uncertainty for investor
defaults. 
default A target 
defaultc
defaultould be seen as a positive rather than a negative thing to
default pursue
default.  
default&#xa0;defaultTaking CCS from an early stage technology to a commercially viable one 
defaultwhich is 
defaultsuitable for private sector development and widely adopted
default,
default will require reducing the overal
defaultl costs
default, 
default includ
defaulting
default the cost of capital sufficiently enough to make CCS commercially competitive with traditional generating technologies.
default 
default While the outcome from DECC’s commercialisation programme may result in one or two projects
default being successfully devel
defaultoped
default, the challenge will be how to maintain momentum among other projects 
defaultwhich have been 
defaultunsuccessful in obtaining DECC funding and 
defaultto 
defaultscale up the industry beyond that.
default&#xa0;
defaultSupport beyond EMR for follow-on projects needs to be progressed if the sector is to
default be capable of ramping up, lowering costs and making a large scale contribution 
defaultto the energy mix 
defaultthrough
defaultout
default the 2020s. 
default 
defaultThe first follow
default-
defaulton CCS projects will need to progress
default (
defaultpotentially to 
defaultFID),
default before many learnings
default have emerged from the projects supported by DECC’s commercialisation programme. 
default 
defaultGiven the challenges identified for the sector
default,
default there is a real risk that without targeted intervention
default,
default follow-on projects will not emerge
default.
default 
default 
defaultIn the long
default 
defaultrun
default,
default projects need t
defaulto be investable without the benefit of public funding
default.
default 
default 
defaultT
defaulthis will require significant progress on a range of issues and 
defaultis 
defaultnot 
defaultable to 
defaultbe delivered by the market on its own.  Further targeted intervention is required to facilitate these developments and de
defaultliver these opportunities.
default 
default This is not about capital grants as they do not resolve structural failings; instead smart design of policy drivers is required to bring forward the sector to invest in the technology on a realistic scale.
default&#xa0;defaultWe would propose that the two best starting places to cover these issues are the 
defaultEU CCS Directive, which places 
defaultvery stringent requirements related to storage site selection, characterisation and monitoring
default, along with the FAQ’s that can be found at
default (
defaulthttp://www.ccsassociation
default.org/faqs/ccs-general/
default. The CCSA has a working group dedicated to this area.
default&#xa0;defaultOn a wider global scale
default,
default it can be seen that th
defaulte drivers for delivery of projects in Australia, Canada and 
defaultthe 
defaultUSA are all very different to the UK and largely derive from 
defaultassistance such as grants and loan guarantees that support a semi-viable conventional business model
default. 
default Examples include

default,

default 
defaulthas a commercial value and 
defaultcan be sold for use 
defaultin oil production using EOR
default.
default 
default 
defaultTherefore there is
default no obvious cross-over to the UK
default model,
default although
default we do agree that
default all the deploying countries offer lessons to be learned.
default  Capture plants are being built on power stations in both Canada and the USA. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNorway 
defaultincentivised the use 
defaultof CCS 
defaultin offshore 
defaultgas pr
defaultoduction 
defaultthrough
default a carbon tax, however similarly to the countries above there is an associated conventional business model in the production and sale of natural gas.  Norway has plans to 
defaultdeploy CCS on the combined heat and power plant 
defaultat Mongstaad 
default(
defaultwith go
defaultvernment support
default)
default, where there is an industrial scale test facility currently using waste gas from the refinery
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn contrast to these countries, the UK’s approach for encouraging
default CCS beyond the commercialisation programme relies on a mixture of policies using “carrots” and “sticks”, including CfD FiTs, Carbon price floor and the emissions performance standard.  
defaultIt is our view that carbon floor prices are not a driving force in th
defaulte short to medium term unless they go immediately to £50 /tonne (or thereabouts).  This also means that the ETS is unlikely to drive European projects. By way of contrast, the Norwegian carbon tax was set at a level that meant avoiding emissions was

defaultthe pr
defaulteferred outcome.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to the 
defaultpricing of CO

default emissions as a penalty 
defaultand
default its role in the delivery of CCS, we note that 
defaultunder the current UK carbon floor price trajectory of £30/tonne in 2020 rising to £70/tonne in 2030

default 
defaultTherefor
default unabated gas will remain

defaultpreference and transport and storage infrastructure will not be built until 
defaultbeyond the mid 2020’s
default. 
default 
defaultThis delay in deployment will mean costs will not be reduced ahead of essential use of the 
defaulttechnology 
defaultin 
defaultthe 2030’s
default 
defaultfor achieving emissions targets 
defaultin both power and 
defaultindustry
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;defaultThe roadmap was important in setting out the need for CCS and stating its role as a key technology in the fight against the dangers of climate change. 
defaultHowever, the
default roadmap did not set out a route 
defaultto market for the transportation and storage segments of CCS. Without the delivery of this infrastructure 
defaultwe believe 
defaultthe 
defaultviability of CCS as an option for decarbonisation is at risk
