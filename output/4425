default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSensitize DFID program staff so that they 
defaultgain 
defaultknowledge and understanding of key international instruments
default on disability rights and inclusive development, as well as local legal and policy frameworks that c
defaultould support mainstreaming efforts
default,
default and existing programs and services that target disability issues. 
default 
defaultIt is essential that DFID staff understand the following terms/concepts: inclusive development, disability as a rights and development issue, effective l
defaultobbying and advocacy, and disability mainstreaming
default 
default(to include strategies for mainstreaming disability, development of output/outcome indicators and monitoring/evaluation tools).
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSign a memorandum of understanding with DFID local partners, government 
defaultministries and or departments to prioritize mainstreaming of disability issues as one of the pre-conditions for accessing financial and technical support from DFID.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdentify/appoint disability focal points in DFID local partners in each of the countries t
defaulthat benefit from DFID support
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuild capacity of focal points in DFID local partners in terms/concepts outlined in 
default5.1 above
default and in concrete strategies that DFID partners could use to meaningfully mainstream and monitor program outputs and outcomes. It wo
defaultuld help for DFID to partner with existing local expertise during development and execution of the training program. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEstablish a task force on disability mainstreaming for on-going mentoring of the partner organization/ministry to include local expertise
default drawn from the line ministry for disability, DPOs and
default the
default disability mainstreaming focal point in DFID country offices.
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn partnership with local line ministries for disability and local federations of disabled persons and other international development
default partners that champion disability issues, develop disability awareness material and 
defaulta 
defaultdissemination strategy.
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaintain a strategic focus on implementation of the UNCRPD through support to DPOs, NGOs, 
defaultand 
defaultgovernment structures/duty bearers, rather than 
defaultcreating parallel structures through service delivery.
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRequire and support monitoring, documentation and research to identify and document results for disabled persons as a result of disability mainstreaming initiatives at all levels.

defaultFEDOMA’s long
default standing efforts to engage the media to raise the issue of rights
default of disabled persons bore fruit when journalists in a national newspaper independently uncovered that disabled children were taught in rooms previously used as toilets in a school in Blantyre, Malawi. The media outlet gave the story a lot of coverage and t
defaulthe reaction was immediate. The local member of Parliament got engaged and even the mobile provider Zain initiated a text message campaign to its customers which spread the story nationwide. After initial reluctance on the part of the local authorities and 
defaultheadmaster of the school, the children were moved to a new and bigger classroom on the same premises. 
defaultThe partners in this project are FEDOMA and NAD.

defaultThe Microfinance and Disability Project in Uganda aims for disabled persons to enjoy equal and fair acce
defaultss to quality financial products and services. The project is doing targeted lobby and advocacy activities towards a selected segment of microfinance institutions in Uganda and also training of economically active men and women with disabilities. This has 
defaultresulted in close collaboration with the Center  for Financial Inclusion at ACCION where ‘disability’ has become a new dimension in financial inclusion
default;
default increasingly inclusive microfinance institutions
default;
default and disabled persons being awarded as outstanding entrepreneurs. On a personal 
defaultlevel,
default disabled persons are able to provide for themselves and their families, gaining independence and a sense of self-worth while at the same time contributing to the economy
default.
default The partners in this project are NUDIPU, AMFIU and 
defaultNAD
default.

defaultThe CBR program implemented by MACOHA in Malawi is working to promote more inclusive practices in local communities to improve the access of disabled children and adults to their
default rights, entitlements
default and available services and to increase their participation in their communities.  CBR workers and District CBR Committees report that their efforts to raise the awareness of local magistrates and chiefs on the rights of disabled perso
defaultns are 
defaultachieving 
defaultresults.  After encouraging these local leaders to practice an inclusive justice system, an increasing number of disabled persons, many of whom are women, have reported violations of their rights.  Raising awareness about the right of disa
defaultbled persons to earn a livelihood has resulted in local chiefs including disabled persons in all public works projects.  For example, in the Traditional Authority Somba in Blantyre district, after many years of exclusion, it is now a familiar sight to find
default disabled people among those clearing a road and receiving fertilizer or cash for their work.  
defaultThe partners in this project are
default              
defaultMACOHA, the 
defaultpara-statal organization in Malawi
default that 
defaultimplements the CBR program
default, and NAD.

defaultas its 
defaultcornerstone,
default has recently implemented a 3-year project aimed at contributing to increased promotion and protection of the rights and entitlements of 
defaultdisabled 
defaultchildren and adults from the Arab-Palestinian community in East Je
defaultrusalem.   As a result of action taken by lawyers acting within a legal framework to secure the rights of disabled persons in East Jerusalem, the Israeli Ministry of Transportation has committed to making the three central bus terminals in East Jerusalem a
defaultccessible by 2014 and has agreed to expand the number of bus lines that will ultimately be made accessible.
default The partners in this project are Bizchut (an Israeli disability rights organization), 
defaultthe EU, 
defaultDiakonia and NAD.
