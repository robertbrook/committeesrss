[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Norwegian Association of Disabled (NAD)[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive summary
[normal]In this letter, the Norwegian Association of Disabled (NAD) 
[normal]offers 
[normal]recommendations for concrete measures 
[normal]that 
[normal]DFID can undertake to support the inclusion of disability/disabled persons in its development work.  Based on
[normal] 
[normal]current efforts of the Malawi Government 
[normal](with support from NAD, CBM and SADPD) to
[normal] promote
[normal] disability 
[normal]inclusion 
[normal]in the public sector
[normal], 
[normal]NAD has
[normal] 
[normal]outlined key
[normal] practical
[normal] steps 
[normal]towards 
[normal]mainstreaming disability 
[normal]in 
[normal]development programs and services
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] NAD also recommends that DFID support the development, 
[normal]implement
[normal]ation
[normal] 
[normal]and documentation of 
[normal]Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) 
[normal]initiatives as a 
[normal]human 
[normal]rights-based, multi sector
[normal],
[normal] disability inclusion development approach
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] implement
[normal]ation of 
[normal]the UN
[normal] Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN
[normal]CRPD
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]  NAD offers 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]of 
[normal]the effectiveness of CBR to facilitate disability inclusion 
[normal]in development 
[normal]through 
[normal]four 
[normal]brief case stories.

[normal]and documentation 
[normal]of 
[normal]CBR programs, in particular CBR programs anchored in and supported by 
[normal]DFID’s country partner 
[normal]government at all levels, with the long-term goal and a clear plan for the government to eventually assume full responsibility for CBR in the country.  
[normal]Provision of technical support to the national partner may be outsourced 
[normal]to a N

[normal](s) 
[normal]with disability/CBR expertise
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sensitize DFID program staff so that they 
[normal]gain 
[normal]knowledge and understanding of key international instruments
[normal] on disability rights and inclusive development, as well as local legal and policy frameworks that c
[normal]ould support mainstreaming efforts
[normal],
[normal] and existing programs and services that target disability issues. 
[normal] 
[normal]It is essential that DFID staff understand the following terms/concepts: inclusive development, disability as a rights and development issue, effective l
[normal]obbying and advocacy, and disability mainstreaming
[normal] 
[normal](to include strategies for mainstreaming disability, development of output/outcome indicators and monitoring/evaluation tools).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sign a memorandum of understanding with DFID local partners, government 
[normal]ministries and or departments to prioritize mainstreaming of disability issues as one of the pre-conditions for accessing financial and technical support from DFID.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Identify/appoint disability focal points in DFID local partners in each of the countries t
[normal]hat benefit from DFID support
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Build capacity of focal points in DFID local partners in terms/concepts outlined in 
[normal]5.1 above
[normal] and in concrete strategies that DFID partners could use to meaningfully mainstream and monitor program outputs and outcomes. It wo
[normal]uld help for DFID to partner with existing local expertise during development and execution of the training program. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Establish a task force on disability mainstreaming for on-going mentoring of the partner organization/ministry to include local expertise
[normal] drawn from the line ministry for disability, DPOs and
[normal] the
[normal] disability mainstreaming focal point in DFID country offices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In partnership with local line ministries for disability and local federations of disabled persons and other international development
[normal] partners that champion disability issues, develop disability awareness material and 
[normal]a 
[normal]dissemination strategy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Maintain a strategic focus on implementation of the UNCRPD through support to DPOs, NGOs, 
[normal]and 
[normal]government structures/duty bearers, rather than 
[normal]creating parallel structures through service delivery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Require and support monitoring, documentation and research to identify and document results for disabled persons as a result of disability mainstreaming initiatives at all levels.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]FEDOMA’s long
[normal] standing efforts to engage the media to raise the issue of rights
[normal] of disabled persons bore fruit when journalists in a national newspaper independently uncovered that disabled children were taught in rooms previously used as toilets in a school in Blantyre, Malawi. The media outlet gave the story a lot of coverage and t
[normal]he reaction was immediate. The local member of Parliament got engaged and even the mobile provider Zain initiated a text message campaign to its customers which spread the story nationwide. After initial reluctance on the part of the local authorities and 
[normal]headmaster of the school, the children were moved to a new and bigger classroom on the same premises. 
[normal]The partners in this project are FEDOMA and NAD.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Microfinance and Disability Project in Uganda aims for disabled persons to enjoy equal and fair acce
[normal]ss to quality financial products and services. The project is doing targeted lobby and advocacy activities towards a selected segment of microfinance institutions in Uganda and also training of economically active men and women with disabilities. This has 
[normal]resulted in close collaboration with the Center  for Financial Inclusion at ACCION where ‘disability’ has become a new dimension in financial inclusion
[normal];
[normal] increasingly inclusive microfinance institutions
[normal];
[normal] and disabled persons being awarded as outstanding entrepreneurs. On a personal 
[normal]level,
[normal] disabled persons are able to provide for themselves and their families, gaining independence and a sense of self-worth while at the same time contributing to the economy
[normal].
[normal] The partners in this project are NUDIPU, AMFIU and 
[normal]NAD
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The CBR program implemented by MACOHA in Malawi is working to promote more inclusive practices in local communities to improve the access of disabled children and adults to their
[normal] rights, entitlements
[normal] and available services and to increase their participation in their communities.  CBR workers and District CBR Committees report that their efforts to raise the awareness of local magistrates and chiefs on the rights of disabled perso
[normal]ns are 
[normal]achieving 
[normal]results.  After encouraging these local leaders to practice an inclusive justice system, an increasing number of disabled persons, many of whom are women, have reported violations of their rights.  Raising awareness about the right of disa
[normal]bled persons to earn a livelihood has resulted in local chiefs including disabled persons in all public works projects.  For example, in the Traditional Authority Somba in Blantyre district, after many years of exclusion, it is now a familiar sight to find
[normal] disabled people among those clearing a road and receiving fertilizer or cash for their work.  
[normal]The partners in this project are
[normal]              
[normal]MACOHA, the 
[normal]para-statal organization in Malawi
[normal] that 
[normal]implements the CBR program
[normal], and NAD.

[normal]he Rehabilitation Program in 
[normal]Palestine
[normal], which 
[normal]h
[normal]as 
[normal]CBR 
[normal]as its 
[normal]cornerstone,
[normal] has recently implemented a 3-year project aimed at contributing to increased promotion and protection of the rights and entitlements of 
[normal]disabled 
[normal]children and adults from the Arab-Palestinian community in East Je
[normal]rusalem.   As a result of action taken by lawyers acting within a legal framework to secure the rights of disabled persons in East Jerusalem, the Israeli Ministry of Transportation has committed to making the three central bus terminals in East Jerusalem a
[normal]ccessible by 2014 and has agreed to expand the number of bus lines that will ultimately be made accessible.
[normal] The partners in this project are Bizchut (an Israeli disability rights organization), 
[normal]the EU, 
[normal]Diakonia and NAD.
