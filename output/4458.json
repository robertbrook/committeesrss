"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by\n \nAlzheimer’s Society and Alzheimer’s Disease International\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDementia is a development issue&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe burden of dementia is rapidly becoming a challenge to our global economic, health, and social landscape for b\noth men and women.  Dr \nMargaret Chan, WHO\n Director-General\n,\n declare\nd\n deme\nntia\n to be\n \na global health priority\n.  In a 2012 WHO report, \nDr Chan stated:\n \n \n“The need for long-term care for people with dementia strains health and social systems, and budgets. The catastrophic cost of care drives millions\n of households below the poverty line. The overwhelming number of people whose lives are altered by dementia, combined with the staggering economic burden on families and nations, makes dementia a public health priority”\n.\n \n \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere remains a tremendous lack\n of awareness in many lower and middle income countries, especially in Africa.  In the last few years a number of Alzheimer associations have started to work in African countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius and Namibia.  They all rep\nort a lack of understanding of dementia that is related to mystification and even witchcraft.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010 there were an estimated 35.6 million people with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias worldwide.\n  This number will \nincrease to 66 million by the year 2015 and \nwill rise to 135 million\n by 2050.  The main increase will be in low and middle income countries where more than 70% of people with dementia will live by 2050 (Figure 1).\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile there continues to be n\no way of preventing or curing dementia these numbers will be driven up by the ageing world population.  An example of this is in \nIndia where it was estimated that in 2010 there were 3.7 million people with dementia\n rising to over 14 million by 2050, with \napproximately one half of that number being over 75 years, and almost 2 million over 90 years of age.  \n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorldwide the elderly population is rapidly increasing and by 2050, adults over the age of 60 are expected to reach t\nwo billion as displayed in F\nigure \n2\n, \nbelow (WHO\n, 2012). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFigure 2\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy 2030, the oldest segment of the population will increase by 200% in low- and middle-income countries and 68% in developed countries\n which is problematic because it is widely accepted that the main risk factor\n for dementia is age. T\nhe prevalence of dementia is projected to double every\n five years after the age of 65\n. Almost three-quarters of dementia cases will reside in low and middle income countries with most of Asia and Africa experiencing the fastest grow\nth rate shown in the Table 1\n at Annex 1\n.  \n&#xa0;\n[People with dementia] “should be part of the development agenda…we need to keep up the pressure on wealthy countries to live up to their responsibility.  …it needs proper resourcing and we should make sure it’s at the heart of the future development agenda.David Cameron – 11\nth\n December 2013\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn most developing countries the problem of dementia is, for a variety of reasons, hidde\nn.  O\nne report which identifies the sc\nale and nature of the problem is \nDementia India\n 2010\n.  This report\n result\ns from\n a ‘twinning’ programme implemented by ADI, which twinned \n‘\nAlzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India\n’\n (ARDSI) with \n‘\nAlzheimer’s Society\n’\n based in London.  Alzheimer’s Society was able to assist ARDSI with the establishment of a nation\nal\n office in New Delhi; source\n funding within the UK for the \nDementia India\n report\n; and secure\n scientific and editorial support from the Institute of Psychiat\nry\n at King’s College\n in London.  \nDementia India \nnot only gave details of numbers in India, it also analysed the impact of the condition in India and the services required for people living with \nthe condition.\n  The report would not have been possible withou\nt the funding and support provided from within the UK voluntary and academic sectors. \n It is indicative of the impact that a small intervention\n by voluntary organisations \ncan \nhave on d\nementia in devel\noping\n countries.\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIt is the view of A\nDI\n a\nnd Alzheimer’s \nSociety\n that intervention by the developed nations through their international aid programmes is the only way to tackle the global dementia epidemic, to reduce the numbers of people who will develop the condition; reduce the impact upon those with the cond\nition and their families; and reduce the levels of poverty that are the inevitable result of dementia.\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nementia costs in 2010 total\nl\ned $604 billion worldwi\nde.  If\n dementia was a country, it would be the 18\nth\n largest economy of the world, ranking in 201\n0 \nbetween Turkey and Indonesia.  In\n developing countries, there has been little work\n \non evaluating direct and indirect costs because dement\nia is viewed as a low priority \nand fewer health economists have \nexplored these regions\n.  With \nthe lack of institutionalized care and healthcare resources, informal care makes up 58% of \ncosts in low-income countries versus 40% in high-income countries. \n This has a big\n impact on women and those in poverty.\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs\n average life expectancy for women increas\nes, especially among the “oldest old” group, more women are at risk of dementia\n \n but a paradox exists because although women are living longer, they are living with more disabilities stemming from dementia\n \n. Not only are the numbers not in women’s favo\nur\n, \n \n research indicates women decline at faster speeds than men regarding cognitive functions\n.  Because dementia\n is expected to triple by 2050, women will be affected in\n other ways, \nas they become primary caregivers for love\nd ones\n, resulting in\n decreased p\narticipation in the workforce and\n a loss in wages \n. In fact, a majority of total costs from dementia derive from informal, usually unpaid care provided by spouses, daughters\n, and daughters-in-law \n.\n \n Women are in jeopardy particularly because of gender dis\nparities as more women are less educated, face higher poverty rates, and are valued less in certain societies. This is of concern especially in developing countries which intensify the disparities and inequalities women currently face and will continue to \nexperience unless\n persistent action is taken at\n national and global level\ns by declaring dementia\n a woman’\ns health issue.\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe G8 meeting on dementia in London has issued a declaration identifying dementia as a major disease burden and has resolved to increa\nse significantly the resources devoted to dementia resource.\n This is greatly welcomed. But if dementia is to be, in the Prime Minister’s words, at the heart of the future development agenda then the UK needs to give a lead through its own development progr\namme.\n \n The meeting also resolved to support countries to strengthen health and social care systems to improve care and services for people with dementia.  This is something that can begin to have a more immediate impact as opposed to the long term impact o\nf more and better research.\n&#xa0;\nThere should be a global fight back to help those with dementia to live well and live with dignity.David Cameron, 11\nth\n December 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the absence of almost any policy or action for people with dementia \nin the developing world the difficulty in identifying what can be done is: just where do we start\n?\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThree priorities for the developed world to assist are clear.  The funding of research into prevention\n,\n treatment and care is one.  Such research may well be\n undertaken in the developed world but it is also important \nto grow research capacity in\n low and middle-income countries - particularly when evaluating care models.  A second is raising awareness - which amongst other things will help to reduce the levels \nof stigma experienced by people with dementia.  \n(The G8 Declaration recognised the need for greater respect and dignity for those affected by dementia and for global efforts to reduce stigma, exclusion and fear.)  \nThe third is creating comprehensive care m\nodels suitable for the developing world, supported by research which identifies how this needs to differ from care models in the developed world.\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis would assist the work already being undertaken by the developing world where strategies to combat dementi\na are being devised eg in Mexico and Peru; and in Pakistan where training programmes for GPs and social workers are being put together.  Capacity building and awareness are the two main challenges.\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor capacity building ADI has developed two successful pro\ngrammes.  One is ‘Alzheimer’s University’ for emerging associations which takes place each year in London.  Alzheimer’s Society has always been involved in this and is supported by other developed associations in Europe and North America.  \n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second prog\nramme is ‘twinning’, in which a developed association works with a developing association\n.  A\nlzheimer’s Society twinned\n \nwith \nthe Indian association\n resulting\n in an office in New Delhi being opened, to co-ordinate activities, raise awareness and promote the\n organisation with the Federal Government.  Funding for the \nDementia India \nreport was also found in the UK but more importantly that project was directed by the 10/66 group at Kings College, London (see 6.3).  Wi\nthout the twinning programme that report wou\nld not have been\n published. Other twinning programmes were set up between, for example, Australia and Pakistan, Netherlands and Indonesia and between Canada and Trinidad &amp; \nTobago\n.\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch within the developing world is essential to assist awareness and \ncapacity building.  This can be founded upon work already done, eg care related (where much work has been done in the UK, facilitated by Alzheimer’s Society) and how care may vary between cultures (where the 10/66 Group has done some work).  Prevention res\nearch is also important and recent evidence suggesting that risk factors can be modified, and that these factors vary from country to country (largely lifestyle related) again suggests that this is undertaken within the low and middle-income countries.\n4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo \npromote the work that needs to be done ADI is now seeking to start a global awareness programme.  This is an ambitious target but it has been greatly assisted by actions in the UK.  The raised level of dementia awareness in this county, prompted by Alzheim\ner’s Society, has led the British government to implement a comprehensive dementia strategy and in 2012 the Prime Mi\nnister issued a challenge to ALL\n government departments to seek ways to support the needs of people living with dementia.  \nTo date, DFID has\n still to do so. \nWith the UK now in the cha\nir of G8, Mr Cameron convened\n a conf\nerence in London this year on\n 11\nth\n December to discuss the issue and there will be a further three conferences arranged next year.  We regard this as hugely important and indica\ntive of the important role played by Britain in the dementia challenge.\n  However, the challenge goes beyond the G8 countries, making DFID’s involvement essential.\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID’s lack of response to th\ne Prime Minister’s challenge\n \nis \ndisappointing.  Even small \ninterventions\n by DFID could be significant in\n raising awareness, building capacity and facilitating research.\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch support would almost certainly have to be undertaken in conjunction with, or advised by, specialist a\ngencies – three\n of which are based in Lo\nndon, namely: the 10/66 Group (based at Kings College, London); Alzheimer’s Disease International, possibly the single biggest source of information on dementia in the developing world through its 80 member countries; and Alzheimer’s Society which has expe\nrience in developing awareness;  researching dementia cause, cure, care and prevention; and providing support services in the UK.  It has also worked with and supported ADI – particularly in India.\n4.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll three agencies would welcome a close working relations\nhip with DFID to enable UK development aid to be directed towards the dementia challenge.\n              \n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) was created in 1984 by the Alzheimer societies of the UK, \nCanada, USA and Australia to be the global voice on dementia and exchange information betwee\nn societies worldwide.  \nIt\n \nhas \n 80 member organisations from all parts of the world. Al\nl\n members are the leading patient and family organisations in their countries\n. There \nare\n currently a number of associations from Africa and the Middle East seeking support and once they are established they w\nill become members\n in the next few years.\n  It is headquartered in London.\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 10/66 Dementia Research \nGroup\n was formed in 199\n8 in India and is led by a research group from the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London. This group has done ground-breaking community based research in lower and middle-inco\nme countries\n into the prevalence and incidence of dementia, risk factors\n and social systems and\n has\n published over 60 scientific papers into the main international scientific journals. This included a series of five World Alzheimer Reports published with ADI since the year 2009 and the data from these reports are now the leadi\nng sources of information on dementia worldwide.\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlzheimer’s Society is the leading dementia charity in the UK, operating in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  It has long established\n dementia support services \nand leads a multi-million pound dementia \nresearch funding programme\n primarily\n within the UK.  It has been credited with raising awareness of dementia to the extent that in 2007 the government made dementia a health priority and became the leading partner in the National Dementia Strategy.  It is \nworking closely with the Prime Minister’s Challenge on dementia and is in the forefront of the work to create dementia friendly communities\n.\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Alzheimer’s Disease International;  64 Great Suffolk Street, London SE1 0BL\nCorrespondence: \nm.wortmann@alz.co.uk\n and \naketteringham1@btinternet.com\n&#xa0;\n World He\nalth Organization, 2012\n World Alzheimer Report, 2009\n Dementia India Report 2010, published by Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India.\n Alzheimer’s Disease International\n Bamford, 2011\n Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2010\n Alzheimer’\ns Disease International, 2009\n ADI, 2010\n WHO, 2009\n Irvine et al 2012\n Bamford 2011\n"
