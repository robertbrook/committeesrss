"&#xa0;\nDavid Bancroft – Written evidence&#xa0;\nI am a member of 2 rambling clubs and walk every Sunday in any one of 5 national parks accessible from Manchester on day trips.\n&#xa0;\nWhen I encounter much mud and water in deep ruts and tranches created by motorbikes and 4x4 vehicles I think something must be done to stop irreparable damage.  Surely National Parks are not intended to accommodate convoys of 4x4s and motorbikes.\n&#xa0;\nMy purpose in writing this letter is to support formal submissions made by:-\n1. YDGLA (Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance)\n2. PDGLA (Peak District Green Lanes Alliance)\n3. GLEAM (Green Lanes Environmental Action Group)\n4. GLPG (Green Lanes Protection Group)\n&#xa0;\nPlease give their submissions your favourable consideration.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
