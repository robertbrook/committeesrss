"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Novamont, the Kyoto Club, The Italian Association of Bioplastics and the Italian Composting Association &#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are a group of Italian organisations looking to provide the Committee with information on the effect of a ban on single use-plastic bags in Italy (with exemptions for dual-use compostable bags).\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe measure has had a number of benefits for the re-industrialisation of the European and Italian chemical sector, as well as benefits to organic recycling and agricultural industries and the Italian Environment.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe policy measure has helped the support emergence of a \nbioplastics\n industry (plastics made from starch and vegetable oils) at a time when its traditional chemical industry is faltering. This sector is far less reliant on petrochemicals.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe introduction of compostable bags has increased the level and quality of organic recycling – which has been beneficial to both the farming and \nbiowaste\n industries. It has also reduced the costs of disposal (landfill and incineration) for local Government.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere has been a decline in the volume of plastic litter in the marine environment.\n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis kind of “\necoinnovation\n” is \ninline\n with EU strategies on the \nBioeconomy\n, Resource Efficiency\n and Smart Specialisation.\n&#xa0;\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, it is important not to confuse compostable bags, with \noxo\n-degradable bags which lack all of these advantages.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission has been jointly prepared \nby a group \nof four Italian organisations with the \nshared vision\n to create a circular \nbioeconomy\n. We believe sustainably produced \nbioplastic\n products can help encourage a \nbioeconomy\n (and by extension a reduction in environmental impact) through improved organic recycling. \nOur submission intends to explain to the committee the impact of a ban on single-use plastic bags in Italy and highlight how the UK can learn from Italy’s experiences. \nThe organisations are as follows:\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNovamont - a manufacturer of \nbioplastics\n made with starch, vegetable oils (e.g. thistle, sunflower) and other renewable agricultural materials with a\nn annual \nturnover of €125M. \nNovamont produced compostable plastics for the 2012 Olympic Games, and already work with the Co-op supermarket chain and many local councils.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Kyoto Club - a not for profit organisation, officially founded in February of 1999, made up of companies, organisations, associations and local governments committed to achieving the goals of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases employed under the Kyoto Protocol.\n \nTo achieve these objectives, the Kyoto Club promotes awareness-raising, information and training in use of renewable materials. As a partner of public decision-makers, the Kyoto Club is also committed to stimulating targeted and incisive proposals and policy interventions in the energy-environment.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAssobioplastiche - the Italian Association of \nBioplastics\n and Biodegradable and Compostable Materials - was formed in 2011 and represents companies operating in Italy and overseas, who are active in the production of biodegradable polymers and finished products and end of life management of products made with \nbioplastics\n.\n&#xa0;2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsorzio Italiano Compostatori (CIC)\n - \nThe Italian Composting Association unites public and private companies, local authorities and others involved in the production of compost, as well as organizations which do not make compost but have an interest in the composting process (producers of machinery and equipment, producers of fertilisers, research bodies etc.).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011, Italy became the first country in the EU to introduce a law prohibiting the distribution of single use plastic bags. Since being passed in March 2012, the law has seen a r\neduc\ntion in the\n \nconsumption of plastic bags, and the associated \nenvironm\nen\ntal impact\ns. And, led by \nindustrial and societal symbiosis\n, the \ndevelopment of \na circula\nr economy\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA circular economy is one that which requires that energy come from renewable resources and that biological materials, such as food waste, are returned to the organic and economic cycles.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe law was aimed at reducing the environmental contamination caused by traditional plastic bags. With this in mind, and to help support the Italian \nbioplastics\n industry, an exemption was allowed for compostable bags.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince its introduction, the new law has helped reduce the consumption of carrier bags by 33% (from 145kton 2010 to 97kton in 2012). In 2011, Italian producers of films and biodegradable compostable bags i\nncreased their workforce \nand through investment in research and new machinery a further 500 jobs were created (according to Plastic Consult).\nThis level of investment would not have been made possible without the policy certainty created by the new law.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne un\nintended \nconsequence of the law was the exploitation of legislative loopholes – namely the lack of a clear requirement to comply with the European Norm for compostable plastics (EN13432:200\n0\n). \nAs such there has been a proliferation of plastic bags claiming to be biodegradable; these products gained their biodegradable status because of weak certification processes and a system of self-declarations. \nThis loophole was closed in 2013 with the introduction of a new law and fiscal penalties, but this serves to prove the need for any exemptions to be specific with penalties for breaches.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nItaly’s tourism industry is dependent on a clean marine environment. Single use plastic bags make up the majority \nof pollution in the marine environment. As such, action had to be taken by the Italian Government. \nDegradable bags offer a potential solution to the problem of build up of plastic waste in the sea. The paragraphs below explain in more detail.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith more than 8,000 km of coastline, Italy is badly \naffected\n by plastic litter in the marine environment – particularly as any deterioration in the environment impacts tourism - a fundamental economic resource for the country. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn March 2011, the Environmental Protection Agencies of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna carried out an environmental survey which revealed that 73% of human-origin waste found on the seabed is made up of plastic bags of various sizes. Further monitoring has revealed that 95% of the large-scale refuse floating in the Tyrrhenian Sea is made up of plastic, 41% of this being made up of plastic bags and fragments.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConventional plastics are strongly resistant to biodegradation, and tend to build up in the marine environment if not properly disposed of. Moreover many studies show that, in the long term, plastic bags are transformed in small fragments of dimension and concentration similar to plankton with the risk of entering in the food chain. \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe European Standard, EN13432:200\n0\n, used to determine biodegradation of packaging items was established to verify biodegradation for composting \npurposes. \nIn 2012, an Italian study investigated biodegradation in different marine habitats and the tests indicated that the EN13432:200\n0\n compostable films biodegraded to a substantial extent (88% in 236 days) in conditions replicating the sea bed and had completely disappeared on the shoreline tests. These results mirrored those of Plymouth University who found that compostable bags fully degraded (disappeared completely) in 24 weeks in Queens Anne Battery Marina unlike the conventional or pro-oxidant (\noxo\n-degradable) polythene which showed almost no change (max 2%) in 40 weeks.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStudies as to how the measure has affected waste going into the marine environment are ongoing.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Italian chemicals industry – due \nin part \nto high feedstock costs has been in long term decline. The emergence of a \nbioplastics\n industry – underpinned by a legal system which supports the development of \nbioplastics\n has played a role in reversing this decline, and reduced the fossil fuel dependence of the industry. See below for detail.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom the 1930s until the 1990s, Italy was one of the world’s leading research and manufacturing hubs for plastics. \nIn addition, up \nuntil 2012\n, Italy was (\nper capita\n)\n Europe’s largest consumer of flexible plastic packaging and in particular carrier bags.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, the combination of overexpansion, increased competition from cheaper imports and a lack of enforced regulation over \ntime\n meant that Italy’s global position in the traditional chemical market declined significantly. \n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring the \ne\nconomic crisis of 2009, the fragility of the industry was further exposed and multinational chemical companies across the country were forced to close their older facilities. The industrial crisis was compounded further by the relative cost of naphtha (€761 / tonne in Italy v €93 / tonne in the Middle East) meaning the traditional plastics industry was increasingly concentrated outside of Italy and Europe and into Asia\n...\n \n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsequently, Italy went from being a leader in manufacturing and exports to being a net importer (7% of internal production against 19% imports). A situation not dissimilar to that of the UK.\n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRising oil costs and\n a\n desire to commercially apply green chemistry \nsaw the emergence of companies like Novamont and \nColdiretti\n – who sought to use locally sourced \nbioproducts\n (such as thistles, corn and sunflowers) to produce new types of plastic.\n&#xa0;\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe developme\nnt of a new industry using innovative\n biotechnology to produce biodegradable and \nbiobased\n plastics in Italy is continuing to thrive. A prime example of this is the Joint Venture between ENI-\nVersalis\n and Novamont in Porto Torres in Sardinia. The Porto Torres petrochemical facility is one of Italy’s most important industrial chemical facilities but due to the decline in the overall industry it has in recent years been in crisis. The new joint venture – \nMatrica\n - will see investments of €500M to convert part of the facility into the world’s first third generation \nbiorefinery\n to produce new materials from locally sourced agricultural resources such as the non-food crop, cardoon grown on marginal and previously contaminated land. The investment will see seven new industrial facilities to produce not just \nbioplastics\n but \nbiolubricants\n, \nbiofillers\n and additives. It is estimated \nMatrica\n alone with create a work force of 690 jobs.\n&#xa0;\n5.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeyond \nMatrica\n, investments are seeing the redevelopment of other disused industrial facilities including a fermentation plant in \nAdria\n / Veneto to produce renewable-sourced chemical intermediates used in \nbioplastics\n. There is also a “magnet” effect, non-Italian companies such as \nCereplast\n (USA), \nRoquette\n (Fr) and DSM (NL) have decided to invest in \nbioplastics\n and biochemical intermediates.\n&#xa0;\n5.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are currently watching the evolution of policy in the UK, if the Government signals that it is supportive of compostable plastics and regulates accordingly we may consider investment in the UK\n – as we would prefer to manufacture the bags locally if demand is great enough – which would create new jobs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe plastic bag law has supported Italy’s drive to reduce food and garden waste going to landfill. In addition, it has lead to\n an\n improved quality of material being composted or digested. This has substantial benefits for the agricultural sector.\n \nThe following paragraphs \noutline these benefits in more detail.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 1992, landfill costs in northern Italy, and in particular\n Lombardy, were as low as £8 / tonne. T\nhere were no legislative requirements for any form of diversion.  \nHowever, the sudden closure of \nMilan’s largest landfill \nled to a dramatic spike in the costs of landfill\n – with costs rising to £80 / tonne\n within the year \nand some \nwaste \neven \nbe\ning\n transported to Switzerland for incineration\n. By 2005, the price for landfill has risen to \nnearly £120 / \ntonne\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the same time, \ndespite some government assistance, \nagriculture in Italy has been in decline. I\nn recent years the high costs, particularly associated with labour, fuel and fertilisers have led to a drop in the number of farms. Between 1982 and 2010, over 3\n million\n \nhectares \nof arable land have been\n lost.\n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs \nthe cost of treating food waste \nthrough composting \nis less than half \nthe cost of \nlandfill\n the composting industry has seen significant investment\n. Most \nrecent figure\ns show that over \nfour and a half \nmillion tonnes of \nbiowaste\n (food and garden waste)\n are \nnow \nbeing \norganically recycled through anaerobic digestion and / or composting \n a year \nin Italy\n. This industry now h\nas an annual turnover of €400M. For comparison, the total municipal \nbiowaste\n sent for organic recycling in England in 2012 was\n roughly five \nmillion \ntonnes \nand the industry has an estimated annual turnover of £200M and employs over 1,000 full time staff.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1992 the most common tools for collecting food waste in Italy are a small cont\nainer (7 – 10l\n) and compostable liners for use in the kitchen and a larger outdoor container (25l) which is emptied twice a week. Following a visit by WRAP to Novamont and northern Italy in 2006, this system of collecting food waste has become increasingly common in the UK with over ten million households receiving a food waste collection where compostable liners are accepted.\n&#xa0;\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimply collecting materials is half the battle – t\nhe importance of quality \nof \nfeedstock\n for efficient organic recycling cannot be over stated. \nThe presence of components that are not completely degradable in a composting feedstock poses a significant risk to the environment. \nIn order to meet the defined quality standards for composted materials the organic recycling industry has to extract the non-biodegradable fraction. Despite the best efforts of local authority collection services, the quantity of non-biodegradable contaminants in \nfeedstock\n presented for organic recycling in Italy and the UK is a serious concern. \n&#xa0;\n6.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the past decade, substantial data has been collected which supports the need to implement separate collection of bio-waste (including kitchen, agriculture and green waste) to recover valuable resources for soil enhancement while decreasing GHG emissions. Separate collection of municipal as well as commercial bio-waste as the steering principle in bio-waste recycling via composting or anaerobic digestion would constitute the highest level of environmental benefit as well as economic viability. \n&#xa0;\n6.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Italy, the CIC have calculated that at least 53,000 T of non-compostable plastics have to be removed and sent for disposal each year at a cost of €10-12M. In England, according to the median data of the WRAP ASORI survey for 2012, the quantity of non-compostable plastic is in the region of 64,000T costing the industry at least £15M / year (based on data from the REA).  To put this in context, the latest RECOUP survey shows that less than 7,000T of household plastic film was collected for recycling in 2012. \n&#xa0;\n6.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA study released by CIC has found that impurities in biodegradable waste streams have decreased by 8% and as a result compost is less contaminated by plastic waste. \nThis has happened because the public recognise compostable carrier bags as an equivalent to a caddy liner bag for collection organic waste. Compostable carrier bags now represent a strategic tool to implement high performing organic waste collection schemes and are strongly supported by the CIC and by the Italian Association of the Local Authorities (ANCI)\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTrials carried out in conjunction with the Co-operative Supermarket chain in the UK have shown that compostable bags have reduced the volume of waste going to landfill and quality of \nfood waste\n collected by councils.\n&#xa0;\n6.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompostable flexible films have also been shown to be compatible with the current collection and treatment stream of conventional plastic packaging up to 10%. These are the conclusions of the study carried on by \nConai\n (Italian Consortium for Packaging Recycling).  Although the reality is the compostable bags are used mainly for organic recycling of food waste and not sent for recycling with traditional plastics.\n&#xa0;\n6.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is estimated that the policy has so far saved Italy €5.1m in landfill costs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent surveys show that most Italians (94%) believe that the law is an important milestone for the environment, while 88% recognise that biodegradable compostable plastics are an important innovation capable of triggering multiple positive effects (i.e. green attitudes, new green jobs, etc.) (ISPO data)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDirective 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste defines organic recycling as “the aerobic (composting) or anaerobic (\nbiomethanization\n) treatment, under controlled conditions and using micro-organisms, of the biodegradable parts of packaging waste, which produces stabilized organic residues or methane”.  \n&#xa0;\n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the past decade, substantial data were collected supporting the need to implement separate collection of bio-waste (including kitchen, agriculture and green waste) to recover valuable resources for soil enhancement while decreasing GHG emissions. Separate collection of municipal as well as commercial bio-waste as the steering principle in bio-waste recycling via composting or anaerobic digestion would constitute the highest level of environmental benefit as well as economic viability.\n&#xa0;8.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the introduction of the Italian law, the EU has moved to introduce measures to restrict the consumption of single use plastic bags across the EU. On November 27, the \nEuropean Parliament Environment Committee voted on a number of amendments to the European Strategy on Plastic Waste in the Environment including:\n&#xa0;8.3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nt\nhat the most dangerous plastics, those that by scientific evidence are shown to be the most disruptive to human health and the environment (such as micro- and \noxo\n‐biodegradable plastics) and those which contain heavy metals and other substances that can also make recycling processes more difficult, should be phased out of the market or banned outright, as soon as possible before 2020\n.\n&#xa0;8.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsingle-use, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic bags should be radically reduced and where possible phased out\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n9.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effectiveness of measures to reduce the use of single-use carrier bags can be \nincreased with exemptions for compostable bags.\n&#xa0;\n9.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnlike single-use bags these compostable bags have significantly lower environmental impact – and can completely biodegrade quickly in most natural environments. They have no further impact on wildlife or the food chain.\n&#xa0;\n9.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe compostable bio-plastics industry is a research driven sector, and an alternative to the traditional European petrochemical industry which is struggling to compete with high fuel costs outside Europe.\n&#xa0;\n9.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompostable bags can play a significant role in the reducing the volume of food waste going to landfill – and improve the quality of \ncompostable materials passed onto the agricultural sector. By providing them through supermarkets it can reduce the costs to councils of providing compostable bin liners.\n&#xa0;\n9.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe measure has been shown to complement the recycling of single-\nuse plastics\n.\n&#xa0;\n9.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe policy measure is popula\nr with the Italia\nn public.\n&#xa0;\n European Commission: Innovating for Sustainable Growth – COM2012 (60) Final.\n European Commission: A resource-efficient Europe – Flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 strategy.\n"
