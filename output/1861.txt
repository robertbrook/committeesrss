[[[Written submission from the TaxPayers’ Alliance (LPG 48)]]]&#xa0;1. The TaxPayers’ Alliance is extremely concerned at the amount of taxpayers’ money that is wasted through bad procurement processes. We welcome this inquiry by the Select Committee and hope that the following points can be borne in mind by committee members. &#xa0;2. According to research by the Institute of Directors (https://www.iod.com/MainWebSite/Resources/Document/policy_article_towards_tesco.pdf), public sector procurement can cost around £220 billion a year. Indeed, public sector procurement in the UK made up 0.75 per cent of global GDP in 2011. The research, carried out by respected analyst Colin Cram, points out that the public sector still imitates a “corner shop” model – with purchasing happening in small scale silos. While we are supporters of more localism, it’s clear that better benchmarking processes need to be established. &#xa0;3. TaxPayers’ Alliance research bears this out. After analysing official figures across Whitehall departments, we found (http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/qdsprocurement.pdf) that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid £12.43 per box of 2,500 sheets of A4 paper. That was £3.50 per box more than the Department for Health. It bought boxes of paper for £8.93 each. That is despite the earlier Efficiency Review by Sir Philip Green in October 2010, which highlighted the problem.&#xa0;4. We would urge that Cram’s report, Towards Tesco, is read in full by each member of the committee and for it to feature heavily when final recommendations are being established.&#xa0;5. We would also urge the committee to explore the role that open data can play in reducing the procurement bill. Allowing armchair analysts and local taxpayers access to full spending data could result in innovative ways to save money.&#xa0;6. The Department itself released research (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/shining-a-light-on-council-spending-could-save-up-to-450-per-household) showing possible savings on energy, mobile phone and legal services across three separate local councils. It found that of the £13.6 million pounds spent, the councils could have saved £1.44million by using their joint buying power to get the best prices. &#xa0;7. We strongly feel that councils should publish all of their spending, not just above £500.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
