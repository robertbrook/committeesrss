[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Like many universities,
[normal] Bournemouth University 
[normal](BU) 
[normal]faces significant challenges
[normal] 
[normal]attracting and 
[normal]retaining women in academic careers
[normal], particularly in STEM subjects
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In
[normal] 2009
[normal] we had 
[normal]only 
[normal]four female 
[normal]P
[normal]rofessors
[normal], and 
[normal]we have been urgently working to address this
[normal]. 
[normal]Between 2009 and 2012 the number of 
[normal]female
[normal] Professors at 
[normal]BU
[normal] increased from four to nine, or a fifth of all Professors. Although there is still a long way to go, with the help of initiatives 
[normal]like those outlined in this submission 
[normal]we have been able to make sustained progress.
[normal] 
[normal]Overall 
[normal]BU
[normal] now employs 309 
[normal]female
[normal] academ
[normal]ics to 342 male academics, another positive sign that the ratio of 
[normal]female
[normal] Professors will improve in the coming years as more junior academics’ careers progress.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BU has learnt important l
[normal]essons from this 
[normal]experience, 
[normal]which
[normal] we believe
[normal] can be applied to othe
[normal]r instituti
[normal]ons starting 
[normal]with 
[normal]low base
[normal] numbers
[normal] 
[normal]of female academics.
[normal] The i
[normal]ssues 
[normal]and challenges that we have encountered 
[normal]extend beyond STEM subjects 
[normal]and 
[normal]are 
[normal]directly
[normal] applicable to many different subject areas. 
[normal]Interestingly, not all 
[normal]of the 
[normal]challenges are rest
[normal]ricted to women either.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are no simple answers to the questions raised by this inquiry
[normal], rather many different issues 
[normal]that wome
[normal]n in academia encounter, which 
[normal]when 
[normal]combined compound the problem of under
[normal] representation of wome
[normal]n in STEM.
[normal] 
[normal]We have not 
[normal]attempted to provide an exhaustive sum
[normal]mary of all the
[normal] issues 
[normal]in this submission
[normal] (which will vary by institution and according to different women’s experience). Instead we have 
[normal]noted
[normal] the problems which were frequently raised in discussions with women 
[normal]in aca
[normal]demia 
[normal]at 
[normal]BU.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some of the problems and barriers encountered are practical whereas others are cultural, although there is 
[normal]frequent
[normal] cross-over and often no clear distinction between the two. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It 
[normal]is
[normal] apparent that some of the evidence of cultural problems within academia is
[normal],
[normal] by its 
[normal]very 
[normal]nature
[normal], more anecdotal and qualitative. However, 
[normal]given the frequency with which such points were raised we think it
[normal] is
[normal] imp
[normal]ortant that it be
[normal] taken into account.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Several women 
[normal]reported
[normal] feeling that 
[normal]the academic culture i
[normal]s 
[normal]not conducive
[normal] to raising a family
[normal]. W
[normal]omen 
[normal]perceived that they were 
[normal]expected to dedicate their liv
[normal]es to academia 
[normal]in order 
[normal]to be successful, and 
[normal]that 
[normal]a decision to have children 
[normal]was
[normal] seen as an admission
[normal] that they we
[normal]re not serious about their careers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A key issue underpinning this problem is the difficulty 
[normal]that 
[normal]STEM 
[normal]academics face when contemplating a l
[normal]onger 
[normal]period of leave – 
[normal]naturally
[normal] 
[normal]needed
[normal] for women starting a family. They believe that they run
[normal] the risk of missing 
[normal]key 
[normal]developments in
[normal] such
[normal] rapidly changing research areas and institutions.
[normal] 
[normal]In
[normal] other
[normal] careers it can be much easier to take 
[normal]maternity leave 
[normal]and time
[normal] off to care for children, 
[normal]but 
[normal]for women in academia there is never a good time to be out of their field.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In practical terms, statutory rates of maternity pay in academia are 
[normal]relatively
[normal] low, meaning women taking time off to h
[normal]ave children face fina
[normal]ncial penal
[normal]ties
[normal]. They also often feel that they have to c
[normal]ontinue 
[normal]working
[normal] while off campus
[normal], since it is impossible to bring in a direct replacement in their area of 
[normal]research 
[normal]specialism and expertise
[normal].
[normal] This can create a very frustrating compromise situation, 
[normal]where women typically continue working 
[normal]while on maternity leave, 
[normal]but 
[normal]still feel that the
[normal]ir careers are set back by taking time off, as they inevitably publish less and 
[normal]risk 
[normal]mi
[normal]ss
[normal]ing
[normal] key developments in their field.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women
[normal] in academia
[normal] can 
[normal]also f
[normal]ind the retur
[normal]n to work and 
[normal]the year immediately following maternity leave
[normal] particularly challenging. They may not receive any
[normal] additional administrative support or r
[normal]eduction in 
[normal]teaching 
[normal]workload, 
[normal]but still have to catch up on research
[normal] work afte
[normal]r a year’s absence while
[normal], o
[normal]f course, continuing to care
[normal] for 
[normal]their 
[normal]children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As one academic
[normal] succinctly
[normal] puts it
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]‘The bottom-line is that academia does not currently
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]make it easy in any way for women to retain their research ca
[normal]reers when they have children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Academia is highly competitive, and it is very difficult for women to keep their careers on a par with men 
[normal]if they wish to have children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It's easier not to bother trying’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As well as issues with caring for children, balancing academic careers with 
[normal]partne
[normal]rs
[normal]’ careers
[normal] can 
[normal]also cause difficulties for wome
[normal]n in academia.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] partner
[normal]’s 
[normal]non-academic 
[normal]career
[normal] 
[normal]can 
[normal]often 
[normal]be prioritised, being more likely to provide
[normal] a 
[normal]permanent rather than 
[normal]fixed term contract and 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]mo
[normal]re stability
[normal]. 
[normal]If the ‘non-academic partner’ moves to take up another role it can often be 
[normal]in 
[normal]an area where the woman cannot find a suitable academic position.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women in 
[normal]relationship
[normal]s with 
[normal]other acade
[normal]mic
[normal]s may not be immune to this. A
[normal]lthough such a relationship could be t
[normal]hought to work well in terms of balancing a career, a woman with a partner who is a
[normal]t a
[normal] more senior academic 
[normal]level to herself 
[normal]may find herself disadvantaged if they have to relocate to another university
[normal]. 
[normal]The situation essentially becomes a self-fulfilling 
[normal]prophecy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]nother
[normal] fundamental issue affecting retention of women in STEM subjects is the poor availability of 
[normal]permanent
[normal] contracts in academia. 
[normal]Generally, it takes slightly longer in academia to reach the experience level appropriate for permanent posts, and unfortunately this tends to coincide with the time at which people are seeking to purchase houses and/or start a family. Consequently many wo
[normal]men 
[normal]leave academia, or never enter it in the first place, in favour of more stable careers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Due in part to these 
[normal]challenges
[normal], culturally
[normal] there is a shortage of
[normal] female
[normal] role models in many universities,
[normal] with few (or no) 
[normal]women visibly holding senior academic positions. 
[normal]This
[normal] can in turn affect the confidence and ambition of other wo
[normal]men as well as affecting the 
[normal]availability of female mentors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A lack of women in
[normal] senior positions can also 
[normal]affect recruitment and lead to a soli
[normal]difying of the status
[normal] quo, as senior male academics (consciously or subconsciously)
[normal] recruit colleagues and successors in their own image
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition 
[normal]to recruitment panels potentially tending to
[normal] recruit in their own likeness, 
[normal]research
[normal] 
[normal]has shown that ther
[normal]e can often be an ‘un
[normal]conscious bias’
[normal] against women.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, in
[normal] terms of applications for jobs and p
[normal]romotion, when CVs are judged blindly 
[normal]women fare better on average, but when names are included, men
[normal] have the advantage
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some women also describe 
[normal]encountering ‘anti-role models’
[normal] (one 
[normal]academic described
[normal] them as
[normal] ‘Margaret Thatcher
[normal]’ characters
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] who after rising through the ranks
[normal] 
[normal]themselves 
[normal]do not necessarily promote or encourage other women, and do not see the n
[normal]eed for a wider gender balance 
[normal]other
[normal] tha
[normal]n themselves as a lone figure at the top.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One academic writes 
[normal]“There are also women that use their single or childless status to their advant
[normal]age.
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or example one candidate seeking a Chair stating that ‘Well, I’m gay – so you don’t have to worry about me g
[normal]oing off to have children’. Not strictly true, but she got the post.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Female academics
[normal] have also reported experiencing harassment
[normal] or
[normal],
[normal] more frequently
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]an underlying prejudice
[normal] on account of their 
[normal]gender, which 
[normal]obvious
[normal]ly has a
[normal] negative
[normal] 
[normal]effect
[normal] on
[normal] morale and the retention of female academics.
[normal] 
[normal]Some women recount
[normal] being viewed as automatically less capable than male colleagues, less interested in promotion, and potentially distracted from their careers by 
[normal]their 
[normal]decisions to have children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One academi
[normal]c writes that while no-one would openly admit to ho
[normal]lding or expressing such views,
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]Equally no-one
[normal] 
[normal]wants to speak out about the daily issues they have encountered in the fear of having their name blackened or career slighted. Academia is a small world, dep
[normal]endent on your reputation and personal networks, so a small amount of negativity can have a huge
[normal] impact on your personal career”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At a cul
[normal]tural level many women also encounter
[normal] ‘macho practices’ within male-dominated disc
[normal]iplines such as STEM, sometimes 
[normal]having to be highly assertive to ensure they receive credit for their work, such as
[normal] inclusion of
[normal] their names on research papers co-
[normal]authored
[normal] with male colleagues.
[normal] 
[normal]One academic comments
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]‘Quite simply, many women do not feel this is a modus operandi they can
[normal] tolerate, let alone flourish in’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The wome
[normal]n
[normal] that BU
[normal] consulted
[normal] 
[normal]for this inquiry were obviously all still within academia, and many
[normal] still
[normal] within STEM subjects. They were therefore unable to comment personally on reasons for leaving academia, but many reported friends and colleagues’ experiences. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Anecdotally, it appears that most women who leave 
[normal]STEM subjects 
[normal]do so 
[normal]in favour of working in business.
[normal] 
[normal]This is partly attributed to companies in the private sector being able to offer more appealing maternity leave and childcare benefits than universities
[normal], along with more competitive salaries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some women also move into management schemes for large private companies after completing PhDs in STEM subjects, which not only draws them away from academic careers, but can also be count
[normal]erintuitive 
[normal]as these are of
[normal]ten careers
[normal] they could have followed 
[normal]after 
[normal]an undergraduate degree, without needing a Doctorate to qualify.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Preparing this submission has been an interesting exercise for BU, and we are extremely grateful to everyone who gave up their time to put forward comments and experiences. We strongly believe in the value of diversity and the p
[normal]ositive effect that it has on our ability to be creative and innovative. We also feel very strongly that it is completely unacceptable for anyone to feel harassed or subject to underlying prejudice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a result of this submission, we will be recommending
[normal] a review of BU’s maternity policy and the support we provide to colleagues on their return to work. We will also recommend that BU explores possible actions to bring about a cultural change in attitude towards women in 
[normal]academia, including how we can bette
[normal]r celebrate those who successfully combine their career with family commitments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, it is important to note that BU academics were recounting their experiences from across their entire career span, and that significant progress on supporting women 
[normal]in academia has been made over the last few years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A 
[normal]u
[normal]niversity-wide Women’s 
[normal]Academic Network 
[normal](WAN) 
[normal]has been established, with support from the highest level being provided as a key institutional priority.
[normal] 
[normal]Such networks can serve multi-faceted purposes; r
[normal]aising the profile of existing women academics across the University, serving as networking forums allowing women
[normal] in academia to meet regularly (
[normal]including 
[normal]via social events),
[normal] and arranging 
[normal]events
[normal] with high-profile, inspirational speakers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At 
[normal]BU
[normal] 
[normal]the Networ
[normal]k
[normal] also provides a means by which the University can identify the
[normal] important issues affecting wome
[normal]n academic
[normal]s, crowd-source potential remedies, and maintain a direct dialogue with women over whether 
[normal]introduced 
[normal]measur
[normal]es are having a positive effect
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] would highly recommend the establishment of such a network
[normal] to all universities
[normal], 
[normal]preferably 
[normal]built into the 
[normal]institution’s formal structures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As an
[normal] institution we have also signe
[normal]d up to the Athena SWAN
[normal] Charter -
[normal] a national initiative which recognises and celebrates good pract
[normal]ice in maintaining and promoting wome
[normal]n academics in STEM subjects. 
[normal]Along with many other universities we are also taking part in th
[normal]e Athena Swan Awards, which are
[normal] proving a rigorous, external
[normal]ly verified means of monitoring and celebrating our progress in this area.
[normal] 
[normal]We strongly recommend that all u
[normal]niversities 
[normal]sign up to the Athena S
[normal]WAN 
[normal]initiative, and would suggest 
[normal]holding a week of events to promote the initiative internally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BU
[normal] has also intr
[normal]oduced an Associate Professor grade, a post in which holders are provi
[normal]ded with considerable advice and development opportunities to support them in pro
[normal]gressing to full Professorships within three to five years.
[normal] 
[normal]There 
[normal]are currently eight wome
[normal]n Associate 
[normal]Professors
[normal],
[normal] which gives us confidence 
[normal]that 
[normal]we can 
[normal]further 
[normal]significantly increase the number of 
[normal]female
[normal] Professors at 
[normal]BU
[normal] over the next few years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are also other general measures 
[normal]that
[normal] women consulted at B
[normal]U believe that universities across the UK
[normal] could 
[normal]take to improve the retention of women in STEM.
[normal] For example:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although many universities have been making progress 
[normal]on tackling the under-representation of women in STEM, there is clearly more that can be done, and given 
[normal]that 
[normal]they face a potential drain of talent from academia, universities need to be more proactive in combatting this 
[normal]- 
[normal]both for the sake of equality, 
[normal]an
[normal]d
[normal] for their own institutional 
[normal]effectiveness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]initial 
[normal]onus to provide more sustainable, 
[normal]permanent 
[normal]contr
[normal]acts for academics is 
[normal]on 
[normal]universities
[normal]. However
[normal], Government also has an important role in securing these 
[normal]by
[normal] recognising the importance of protecting research a
[normal]nd development funding for STEM, both through the
[normal] UK Treasury and from international sources, particularly the European Com
[normal]mission. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One suggestion 
[normal]is that the Government should set national targets for the number of men in s
[normal]enior roles in Higher Education.
[normal] A target of, for example, no more than 60% of roles in university leadership 
[normal]teams being held by men by 2020
[normal] wo
[normal]uld give 
[normal]a strong message, and c
[normal]o
[normal]uld also be a 
[normal]less contentious approach than
[normal] the
[normal] introduction of quotas for women.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At a national level, the Government could also set targets 
[normal]to ensure that
[normal] all funding bodies m
[normal]aking decisions about awards 
[normal]have an equal 
[normal]number of 
[normal]men and women on the
[normal]ir decision-
[normal]making panels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The next Research Excellence
[normal] Framework process, scheduled for 2018, could also monitor gender equality 
[normal]amongst researchers, and potentially make the availability of schemes such as mentoring of women in STEM,
[normal] and participation in national 
[normal]initiatives
[normal] such as the Athena SWAN
[normal] Awards, conditions of funding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government can also play a role in working with Universities UK and other scientific bodies to promote success stories of women in STEM nationally, ensuring 
[normal]Ministers frequently celebrate particular case studies and best practice.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This
[normal] 
[normal]inquiry by the 
[normal]Science and Technology Select Committee into the issue of women in STEM subjects is to be welcomed as an initial step 
[normal]towards evaluating the extent o
[normal]f the problem, and concentrating minds natio
[normal]nally on 
[normal]possible solutions
[normal]. 
[normal]We hope
[normal] that the Government will serious
[normal]ly consider any collective
[normal] recommendations made, and that the Committee will continue to return to the issue and monitor progress.

[normal] 
[normal] Dr. Heather Savigny, 
[normal]Senior Lecturer in Politics at Bournemouth University has written a paper, ‘Women Know your Limits; Cultural Sexism in Academia’ currently under peer review prior to publication, examining this issue.
[normal]
