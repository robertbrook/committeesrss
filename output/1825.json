"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from YPO (LPG 24)OverviewYPO is a Joint Committee governed by a management committee of elected representatives from \n13 constituent member authorities\n.\n In addition YPO has \n28 Associate Members\n that both support the organisation and enjoy the benefits of any ‘profit’ that the organisation generates. \n&#xa0;\nWe engage extensively with Local Authorities not only within the Yorkshire &amp; Humber and North West regions but on a national basis as we support customers to deliver savings through the development of frameworks and other contractual vehicles\n.\n Our Category Management approach has been established to deliver in a range of areas, from stationery and office resources to energy, IT, fleet, insurance, professional services social care and facilities management contracts. \nWe work closely with organisations within the Local Government sector to establish tailored procurement solutions which benefit Local Authorities. We also establish partnerships with individual authorities, responding to procurement demand on a localised level. This may be to establish a single specific contract, or provide a complete outsourced procurement service. \nAs a publicly owned organisation, all profit that YPO makes is paid back into the public sector, delivering even better value for money. Through \nthe loyalty scheme\n customers receive a proportion of the profit back based on their individual annual spend with YPO.\nCollaboration and PartnershipsYPO actively supports collaboration across the public sector in order to deliver efficiencies of cost and resource but also to provide a more coherent voice to suppliers and providers that enables the market to respond more effectively to the needs of the public sector. Whilst we encourage Local Authorities to collaborate on procurement activity we also seek alliances with other organisations to ensure that demand can be aggregated and efficiencies found in procurement processes. \nGovernment Procurement Service (GPS)YPO and Government Procurement Service have formally established a strategic alliance to help drive efficiencies with local authorities and the wider public sector. Pooling resources, costs and working more closely on common objectives will mean smarter combined purchasing, giving you further savings and quality. \nNorth Yorkshire Procurement Service (NYPS)Securing the contract to run North Yorkshire County Council’s procurement function reinforces our commitment to work with local authorities more closely to achieve efficiencies. This service can cater locally for the council’s unique demands, while being able to access procurement expertise from an enhanced team of colleagues. This will help to equip the service in sourcing better value solutions from the market to gain maximum value. \nPro5YPO is a member of the Pro5 Group, a collective of the UK’s largest professional public sector buying organisations. Pro5 is committed to developing frameworks for the public sector, and is well-placed to make a substantial contribution to efficiency targets by combining capability, knowledge and resources. \n&#xa0;\n1.1 \nClearly the current financial climate is influencing the structure of Procurement \nteams \nwithin many Local Authorities and to a large degree it would not be appropriate for us to comment on these structures as we are not directly involved\n in the decision making process\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nHowever, within this context it is interesting to note the varying efforts that are currently being made to change and improve the structures within local government \nprocurement to deliver greater value for money and other social, economic and environmental objectives. Whilst some Local Authorities are seeking to develop relationships with 3\nrd\n party outsourcing organisations, others are seeking to make more of scarce Procurement expertise across a wider base by entering into Shared Services with other public bodies and some are focussing efforts more inwardly by retracting from collaborative pursuits. Against this back drop there does not seem to be a great deal of guidance of the merits and de-merits of such structures at either an academic or empirical level. In order to make more effective decisions in this regard, a greater level of information would be beneficial to Local Authorities.  \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nFrom YPO’s perspective we are keen to express the cu\nrrent structures that exist to \nlink \nthe needs of \nlocal residents through the Procurement teams in Local Authorities to the Public Sector Buying Organisations. YPO operates representative groups\n \nthat seek to understand the needs derived from Local Authority Commissioners and Procurement colleagues to develop category management strategies that determine the right level of market engagement and approach for individual contract areas. In some instances, where appropriate, YPO takes these requirements through to its engagements with national partners such as Pro5 and the Government Procurement Service to develop solutions for the whole of the Local Government sector. There are many examples where this is delivering benefit for Local Government including the recent collaborative work on\n \nMulti-Functional Devices\n, \nInsurance\n \nand\n \nIT Hardware\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.4 At YPO we fundamentally believe that the delivery of a tender only points to the ‘promise’ of greater value within a contract and that effective supplier management is required to ensure that promise is fulfilled. However, we recognise the implications of operating compliantly within the EU Public Contracting Regulations make developing long term relationships with supplier difficult. Further, in most Local Authorities the responsibility for supplier management lies with teams outside of Procurement who may not have the commercial skills to perform this function. As part of the North Yorkshire Procurement Service, YPO has developed a contract management toolkit designed to help service teams understand their role in the performance management cycle, determine where their time would be best applied to manage risks whilst delivery greater value and how to structure an engagement plan with \nsuppliers to foster a culture of improvement. We are aware of the Contract Management Toolkit developed by Sheffield City Council and would support a national scheme that enables a toolkit for contract management that is accessible and useable for all structural models of Procurement support with Local Authorities. . \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 \nIn responding to this question it needs to be recognised that YPO is predisposed to suggesting that Local Authorities do not take sufficient \nadvantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities\n. We fully recognise that pressures to engage local suppliers and to stimulate local economies are both valid and unique to that Local Authority but at the same there are numerous instances where supply markets have matured to a national level and it would make sense to aggregate demand to a similar level also in order to drive greater levels of value for money. We are not suggesting a single solution would be the most appropriate answer as choice is a significant driver in obtaining best value (particularly in Care markets where personalisation is becoming an increasing driver) but in order to understand the supply market and provide a cohesive voice on the requirements of Local Government greater levels of collaboration are required.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 Fundamental to this challenge is the current lack of resource to co-ordinate collaborative activity regionally and ultimately input into national strategies. Whilst YPO, the other PBOs and Local Authority collaboration networks such as AGMA and the West Midlands Procurement Alliance do much to foster greater levels of collaboration this does not provide true national coverage.    \n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nYPO are keen to support the development of a \nmore cohesive national voice and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1 \nThe reduced role of OGC and the \nfunding withdrawal for the RIEPs has\n undoubtedly left a ‘hole’ for L\nocal \nA\nuthoritie\ns \nin the provision of\n market intelligence, guidance and expertise. \nA large part of the role YPO is seeking to offer within its representative category groups is the ability to network and share knowledge across Procurement teams to implement effective procurement strategies. Again, we are aware that this is not a national solution at present and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how this could be developed on a greater scale.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nWe are aware that spend analysis work is being undertaken on a project basis in the Y\norkshire \n&amp;\n \nH\number\n region\n although thi\ns is in its relative infancy so the delivery of quality procurement strategies has not been derived yet\n. AGMA authorities have a more permanent arrangement on spend analysis that supports any collaborative work that is undertaken. On a more national basis there is a void on how spend analysis can be joined up to derive procurement strategies and \nthere is \nno organisation\nal\n structure in place that could support this work.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3 It is recognised that in the current climate funding to address any deficiencies in this regard is an issue. However, it also needs to be recognised that during the last two to three years a great deal has been done to develop the capacity, capability and alignment of the PBOs and the Government Procurement Service to help address these issues. In any climate, surely a solution that builds on the infrastructure and expertise that already exists should be evaluated first to see how the vision and objectives of Local Government as a whole can be delivered. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1 Mitigating t\nhe risk of legal challenge is an inherent thread that appears to run through the procurement strategies and processes within Local Government and \nwhilst there appears to be a more litigious culture prevalent within suppliers to Local Government and the costs of a legal challenge, whether it is successful or not, can be significant to \nsome degree this approach detracts from the drivers of efficiency and value for money.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2 The revised EU Public Contracting Regulations appear to favour a more vibrant approach to contracting with changes proposed that will enable the delivery of Dynamic Purchasing Systems (DPS) and electronic catalogues. YPO recognises the benefits of these approaches when looking to deliver choice, value for money and innovation. We have actively encouraged the use of a DPS in categories of social care delivery and also categories like home to school transport, L&amp;D and reactive maintenance. We are in the process of establishing a DPS for Street Lighting Independent Connection Providers (ICPs) to take advantage of the recent de-regulation in that market.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 On the point of flexibility, as is highlighted in responses to previous questions, improved access to information on best practice is required. First of all, to ensure that contracts are scoped effectively to deliver current and future requirements and to deliver more effective contract management to ensure that service delivery is effectively managed to reflect changing circumstances\n&#xa0;\n \nHow is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective? \n&#xa0;\n5.1 YPO, like Local Authorities, operates within a highly scrutinised \nframework of governance\n that includes Standing Orders, Financial Procedure Rules and the EU \nPublic Contracting Regulations. In addition, YPO operates an open and transparent \ndecision making process\n that includes representation from the Officers and Elected Members of our Member Authorities. \n&#xa0;\n5.2 YPO is committed to good corporate governance and recognises the importance of operating effectively with the highest possible \nstandards of accountability\n. We will not accept any fraud or bribery by any persons and are committed to preventing such behaviour. In line with this commitment, we expect anyone with serious concerns about any aspect of our work to come forward. YPO encourages direct contact with Internal Audit at Wakefield Council (our host Authority) should anyone suspect that fraud, bribery or irregularity is taking place in relation to our activities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1 As is highlighted in the question above, YPO’s audit framework is robust in both area of policy control and achieving best value outcomes. In addition, to the internal audit programme, YPO is subject to annual scrutiny by the Audit Commission (now KPMG) to ensure financial probity. \n&#xa0;\n6.2 YPO conducts frequent benchmarking exercises so that we can ensure the goods and services we offer to Local Authorities represent value for money. Further, through the use of various savings methodology and indices, YPO compiles monthly savings reports to provide assurance of the value we obtain through our trading activity.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nThe Committee welcomes written submissions from contractors that have tendered to local authorities—both the successful and unsuccessful—and from interested parties with knowledge of any aspect of local government procurement for \ngoods and services in any area—from IT and office supplies to care management and building contracts—as well as collaborative procurement arrangements and from people with specialist procurement and contracting expertise. The Committee will not review individual contracts.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
