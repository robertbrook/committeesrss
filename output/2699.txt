[[[Written evidence from the UK Working Group on Arms (UKWG)]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 2 April 2013 the UN General Assembly adopted the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). This was a major achievement, the culmination of many years hard work, and the UK is to be congratulated for the leadership it has shown throughout the ATT process. Since the ATT opened for signature on 3 June, progress has been remarkable. In four months, 113 states have signed and seven have ratified the Treaty. If this momentum can be maintained, the UK Working Group on Arms (UKWG) estimates that the Treaty could enter into force by the end of 2014.&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This momentum is far from guaranteed, however, and the UK still has an important leadership role to play in terms of both encouraging other States to sign and ratify and assisting effective Treaty implementation by countries with less resources and/or less-developed arms transfer control systems. The second of these roles will be relatively resource-intensive and we urge the Government to prioritise funding for this work. We also encourage the Government to consider the ATT with regard to other policy decisions that are related to arms transfer; for example invitations to Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEi) arms fairs should not be extended to States or exhibitors from States that do not support the ATT. &#xa0;3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With regard to UK Government policy or practice at the national level, there have been several areas of concern over the last year. These include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This memorandum also examines problems at the EU level, such as:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]23&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should set out a timetable for providing additional information in relation to SIELs – including specific information on the nature of the end-user – in the Quarterly and Annual Reports. The Government should confirm that this information will ]]]

[[[The Government should also give an account of its further deliberations on the matter of the proposed Independent Reviewer to look into the operation of the licensing system and should further consult with parliament, the public and industry on this important issue.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]EU Common Position review  25&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]27&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK Government should encourage Member States to consult externally on the development of further guidance in the application and interpretation of the Common Position Criteria, including through publication of interim findings.

[[[&#xa0;]]]28&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK Government should treat the development and introduction of the online information-sharing EU database as a matter of urgency; ensure that its design allows for amendment into the future; and promote greater information sharing on specific licences approved.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)29&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK should make the strongest possible interpretative statement upon ratifying the Treaty, for example, making it clear that the UK will continue to regulate a comprehensive list of arms, equipment and munitions beyond the minimum scope allowed by the Treaty and calling on other States Parties to do likewise.]]]&#xa0;30&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should work proactively to ensure that as many States as possible are able to quickly sign, ratify and begin to properly implement the Treaty by providing assistance bilaterally, and through regional and global organisations, and by offering technical and legal assistance to all state signatories that may need it. In addition, the UK should be a significant donor for ATT implementation purposes, and should encourage other States to be likewise. ]]]

[[[The UKWG encourages the CAEC, and indeed all UK Parliamentarians, to use every opportunity to raise the ATT with counterparts in other countries, to make offers of assistance to other Parliaments regarding the role of Parliamentarians in the ratification process, in preparing any necessary implementing legislation and in scrutinising national implementation of the Treaty once it enters into force.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Trade fairs and advertising activities 36&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK Government should investigate, with a view to prosecuting, all companies involved in potential breaches of UK trade control regulations at trade fairs, and publish without delay the results of any investigations. ]]]&#xa0;37&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Given repeated breaches of UK trade control regulations at UK trade events, the UK Government should put in place more robust procedures to prevent further breaches, including a compulsory ban on any future activity (incl. trade fair attendance) in the UK for a company found to be promoting prohibited equipment.  ]]]&#xa0;38&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Syria]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;44&#xa0;&#xa0; The civil war in Syria continues unabated. Over 100,000 Syrians have died as a result of the war, while over 7 million have been forced to flee their homes, with 2 million becoming refugees in neighbouring countries. The number of deaths and of refugees has climbed as the fighting has intensified and spread. The conflict has been fuelled by transfers of arms, munitions and ammunition from Russia and Iran to the Government of Syria, and reportedly by transfers of arms to armed opposition groups from a number of sources including Croatia, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan and Turkey, financed by Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and supported by several intelligence agencies.&#xa0;45&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG is pleased that, with effect from 6 September, the Government established national controls on the export of equipment to Syria which could be used for internal repression (see paragraph 63 below). However, the reason this change was necessary was that three months previously the UK, along with France, changed the terms of the EU embargo on Syria to allow arms exports to the opposition. The UKWG is concerned at the UK Government’s role in the loosening of the embargo, and has concluded that the actual supply of arms to any of the warring parties would be very hard to justify under existing UK and EU legislation. A Saferworld/Oxfam report entitled Arms for Syria? concludes:&#xa0;Ultimately it is for governments to demonstrate that they can satisfy the demands of national arms transfer control requirements, of EU law, of UN Security Council resolutions, of international humanitarian law, and customary international law before any arms transfers take place. The balance of available information on the situation in Syria, when considered alongside Member States’ legal responsibility to apply certain restrictive criteria when deciding whether to transfer arms to opposition groups in Syria, indicate a number of serious obstacles which 14 governments would need to overcome before proceeding with any supply. Serious doubts arise, under both EU law and international law more generally, as to the legality of supplying arms to any warring party in Syria. The onus for showing that safeguards can and will be put in place to allay the concerns which arise lies very firmly with those who propose to supply arms. However, given the fluid and evolving situation on the ground in Syria and the fractured nature of the opposition, there is reason to doubt the likely efficacy of any safeguards that might be put in place to prevent misuse or diversion. &#xa0;46&#xa0;&#xa0; Current international concern focuses on the use of chemical weapons in contravention of the Syrian Government’s obligations under, inter alia, the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, there are also significant concerns with regard to the use of conventional arms by all parties to the conflict in contravention of international humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as customary international law and international norms concerning the protection of civilians, including the use of cluster munitions and incendiary weapons.&#xa0;47&#xa0;&#xa0; In the context of the chemical attacks in Syria in August and the international crisis which followed, the UKWG notes the exchange between Sir John Stanley and the Government over the licences granted for the export of items covered by the Australia Group Common Control Lists to Syria over the last decade. We understand the Government is compiling a detailed response to Sir John, which we hope will clarify the nature of these exports. Given the sensitivities of these exports, we would urge the government to demonstrate to the CAEC how it applied the Australia Group's detailed licensing risk assessment guidance in these particular cases.&#xa0;

[[[The Government should provide complete and transparent answers to Sir John Stanley’s queries regarding the provision of export licences for dual-use chemicals to Syria.]]]

[[[The Arab Spring and the UK policy review ]]]&#xa0;51&#xa0;&#xa0; On 13th October 2012, Foreign Secretary William Hague announced the outcome of the Government's review of the UK arms transfer control system in light of events in the Middle East and North Africa. Despite claims that review has led to more robust procedures, the UKWG has seen little evidence of an impact on actual decision-making. Moreover, there still appears a tendency for the Government to react to events after they have happened rather than to evaluate risks ahead of time, while undertakings to improve transparency in strategic exports have been abandoned (see paragraphs 87-100 below).&#xa0;52&#xa0;&#xa0; The Scrutiny of Arms Exports and Arms Control (2013) Report by the Committees on Arms Export Controls (the 2013 CAEC report) recorded that in 2012 the Government issued over £12 billion worth of standard individual export licences (SIELs) to the 27 countries identified as of most concern in the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office’s (FCO) 2012 Human Rights and Democracy Report along with five other countries that the CAEC identified as problematic on human rights grounds but which were not referenced in the FCO’s report. Eight countries from the FCO’s list are from the MENA region (Iran, Iraq, Israel, Libya, the Palestinian controlled territories, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen); a further three MENA countries (Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia) were identified by the CAEC in their 2013 report as problematic. In addition, many open licences—open general export licences (OGELs) and open individual export licences (OIELS) which place no upper limit on quantities/values of arms that can be delivered — were also issued for transfers to these countries.&#xa0;53&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG is not arguing that all of these licences are problematic (e.g. most of the licences, by value, for transfers to Iran are for components for civilian aircraft), however this data suggests little has changed in terms of UK licensing practice as a consequence of the Arab Spring or subsequent transfer control reviews (see paragraphs 75-78 below).&#xa0;54&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent publication and launch of Securing prosperity: A strategic vision for the UK defence sector by the Defence Growth Partnership makes it clear that Government, from the Prime Minister down, sees defence manufacture and export as a “key sector of the economy … a vital driver of opportunity and employment all over the country” and intimately connected to “deliver[ing] a long-term strategic vision to maintain our position on the leader board”.&#xa0;55&#xa0;&#xa0; When all of the above is considered in the context of some of the delegations and exhibitors invited to the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEi) arms fair held from 15 to 18 September in London (see paragraphs 126-132 below), the UKWG is concerned that the Government may be sending the wrong signals about its priorities, i.e. that perceived economic gain can take precedence over existing risks including those identified in the national Consolidated Criteria.&#xa0;Egypt&#xa0;56&#xa0;&#xa0; Licensing policy with regard to Egypt provides an interesting test case.&#xa0;57&#xa0;&#xa0; The 2013 CAEC Report recorded that for export licences to Egypt there were extant at the time the Report was published 88 SIELs worth £59,073,314 and 47 OIELs. &#xa0;58&#xa0;&#xa0; On 19 July, the Government announced that “in light of recent events which have led to deaths of civilians” they had revoked five extant SIELs for Egypt. On 23 August, in accordance with a 21 August decision of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, the Government announced it was suspending export licensing for Egypt of any equipment which might be used for internal repression—equipment which is not included in the UK Strategic Export Control Lists. One week later, the Government declared that it had suspended 48 licences for Egypt and added Egypt to the list of non-permitted destinations on four OGELs.  &#xa0;59&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government has presented this as an appropriate and timely response to the deteriorating domestic security situation in Egypt, but we disagree with this assessment. &#xa0;60&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2011, the Government argued that it could not have been expected to anticipate the Arab Spring and that rather than being criticised it should be commended for responding rapidly—by revoking over 150 licences for exports to a range of countries (including approximately 56 licences for exports to Egypt)—as circumstances changed. Regardless of whether this defence was valid in 2011—and the CAEC and others, including the UKWG, took issue with it at the time—it surely is not in 2013. We hoped that the Arab Spring would have functioned as a wake-up call on export licensing policy to the region (and indeed more broadly), yet only two years later the exact same pattern is being repeated.  The UK Government has shown little capacity to evaluate risk in advance (as required by the Consolidated Criteria) but instead is once again playing catch-up, firstly by revoking five licences, and then nine days later by suspending 48 licences, with the Government also “considering whether further extant licences should be revoked”. [Using the figures in the CAEC report as a base, there are likely to be approximately 80 still-valid licences for exports to Egypt.]  &#xa0;61&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to help external stakeholders better understand it’s actions, the Government should identify which licences it has revoked or suspended, explain why such decisions were taken for those but not for other licences, list extant licences, and explain why it saw fit to issue all of the revoked/suspended licences in the first place.  &#xa0;Equipment for internal repression &#xa0;62&#xa0;&#xa0; While the 21 August EU Council conclusions on Egypt might also be seen as an attempt (this time with EU partners) to correct previous licensing mistakes, a closer look at the details of these conclusions raises serious questions about the expected impact of the instruction to “suspend export licenses to Egypt of any equipment which might be used for internal repression”.&#xa0;63&#xa0;&#xa0; For situations where “restrictive measures” (such as arms embargoes) apply, the EU has developed an additional list of equipment that might be used for internal repression that goes beyond the standard EU Common Military List. Equipment on this additional list includes, for example, bombs and grenades not controlled by the Common Military List, and vehicles specifically designed to deploy mobile barriers. Before the EU embargo on Syria was amended in May (by way of Council Decision 2013/255/CFSP) this additional list was in operation (see Annex I of Council Regulation 36/2012), meaning that a licence for export of these items to Syria was required. Once the embargo was relaxed, however, the items on this additional list were no longer subject to licensing control. The UK Government has since introduced new legislation (Export Control (Syria Sanctions) Order 2013, entry-into-force 6 September 2013) which includes a list of items that could be used for internal repression so as to ensure that such goods cannot be exported to Syria from the UK without first being subject to a licensing procedure (for more on the Syrian case see paragraphs 44-50 above).  &#xa0;64&#xa0;&#xa0; In the case of Egypt, since no “restrictive measures” were in force at the EU level, licences for the export of items on the EU’s additional list of equipment that might be used for internal repression have never been required (note that EU Member States could have added such items to their national control lists, however the UKWG is not aware of any Member State having done so). With no pre-existing EU requirement for licences, the Council conclusions instruction to “suspend export licences to Egypt of any equipment which might be used for internal repression” is rendered effectively meaningless, as there would be no licences to suspend. The conclusions could even be seen as disingenuous, in that they give an impression of action when the substantive impact is negligible. With regard to the UK specifically, although the Government has accepted, in the case of Syria, that non-Military List items could be used for internal repression and should therefore be subject to licensing controls, it is notable that a comparable measure has not been introduce regarding exports to Egypt.&#xa0;65&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG understands from conversations with Government officials that for exports to Egypt of items that are on the Military List, decisions on whether they might be used for internal repression are based on factors such as the precise nature of the equipment and the identity of the end-user. Since these are considerations that routinely apply in standard export licensing, this suggests that the Government has not adopted any special provisions with regard to licensing the transfer of arms to Egypt, even in the wake of the heightened levels of violence and instability of the past three months. It would thus be helpful if the Government could clarify in detail the difference between the current policy for licensing arms transfers to Egypt and the standard application of the Consolidated Criteria. The UKWG believes that the Government should apply the same rules to Egypt regarding non-Military List items which might be used for internal repression as are currently applied with regard to Syria.  &#xa0;66&#xa0;&#xa0; It should be noted that this is an issue that has wider application than Egypt: the Government having recognised this equipment as particularly relevant to, and at risk of, being used for internal repression, the UKWG believes it should be fully controlled and so added to the UK Military List without delay, and that the matter should be raised with EU partners with a view to similarly extending the EU Common Military List. Furthermore, the Government should set out a specific list of equipment currently included in the UK Military List which can be categorised as at risk of being used for internal repression and advocate for a similar undertaking at the EU level so as to give meaning to any Council decision that makes reference to this issue in the future.  &#xa0;67&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, the UKWG believes that there are additional items which could be used for internal repression and which should also be incorporated within the UK and EU lists. This equipment includes, but is not limited to: handcuffs and other restraints; law enforcement striking weapons (including saps, police batons, side-handle batons, tonfas, sjamboks, and whips); protective equipment such as police helmets and anti-riot suits, and parts thereof; directed-energy systems including optical devices and laser dazzlers, microwave and millimetre wave devices; biometric devices used for border control, security or policing (including iris or retina recognition, face recognition, voice recognition, gait or body feature recognition, behaviour recognition); and telecommunications monitoring equipment.  Provision of training in this equipment should also be subject to control. The UKWG would welcome a discussion with the UK Government in this regard.&#xa0;

[[[Export policy toward the]]] 

[[[Middle East and North Africa (MENA)]]]&#xa0;75&#xa0;&#xa0; As highlighted above, and according to the UK’s most recent reports on Strategic Exports, the Government’s export policy across Middle East and North Africa (MENA) appears to have undergone little change since the Arab Spring of 2010-11. Indeed, far from having been disturbed by the turmoil that affected the entire region, the number and value of UK strategic export licences granted to countries such as Bahrain, Egypt, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) actually rose overall between 2008 and 2012: from 615 licences (547 SIELs and 68 OIELs) granted and 5 refused in 2008, to 1076 licences (968 SIELs and 108 OIELs) granted and 22 refused in 2012. In the case of Saudi Arabia, the UK Government granted 99 SIELs for arms exports worth £105.8 million in 2008, rising to 206 SIEL applications worth £1,750 billion in 2011, when regional unrest had reached unprecedented levels. Moreover in the case of Egypt, after dipping from £23.4 million worth of SIELs granted in 2008 to £7.7 million in 2011, this increased again to £18.8 million in 2012. As a proportion of the number of total UK export licences granted, licences to the MENA region increased from 9.5 per cent in 2008 to 30 per cent in 2012. By value, well over half of all UK arms exports for 2012 were to the Middle East.&#xa0;76&#xa0;&#xa0; This would seem problematic for at least two reasons. Firstly there is the risk of arms being used for internal repression. This has received considerable attention, to the point that the Government is now at least more willing to acknowledge the extent of this risk. Secondly, the overall security environment of the region has become extremely fraught over the last two years. Indeed, the conflict in Syria is widely regarded as having pushed the Middle East considerably closer to a major regional conflict, with other MENA states and actors seeking to advance their interests by supporting different parties to the Syrian conflict. As well as internal Syrian dynamics, the Sunni-Shia divide, the Arab Israeli conflict and the influence of Al Qaida-affiliated actors are all relevant here. Given the heightened risk of all-out regional conflict we would expect the UK Government to have tightened its approach to exporting arms into the Middle East. However, as highlighted above, the region continues to be a critical UK export market, with indications that this is seen in some quarters as more of a marketing opportunity than a reason for greater restraint (see, for example, paragraphs 126-132 below).  &#xa0;77&#xa0;&#xa0; It would be useful if the Government could provide the CAEC with its assessment of the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East and how this has changed over the last two years, while explaining the impact this broader security situation in MENA has had on its assessment of risk for prospective arms supplies to MENA states, including specific examples of licence applications granted or refused. It would also be helpful if the Government could explain how its arms transfer policies for the region are consistent with its objectives with regard to upstream conflict prevention as set out in its Building Stability Overseas Strategy.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation]]]&#xa0;78&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should explain whether and how its arms transfer licensing policy for the MENA region has changed since the beginning of the Arab Spring and how it is consistent with its assessments of conflict risk and with its Building Stability Overseas Strategy.]]]&#xa0;

[[[Export licence suspension mechanism]]]&#xa0;79&#xa0;&#xa0; As part of a package of changes proposed in the framework of the post-Arab Spring review of the UK defence and security export policy, the Foreign Secretary announced a new procedure to:&#xa0;Allow immediate licensing suspension to countries experiencing a sharp deterioration in security or stability. Applications in the pipeline would be stopped and no further licenses issued, pending Ministerial or departmental review.&#xa0;80&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG initially welcomed this initiative, as it could enhance the UK’s export control system’s capacity to respond more quickly to quickly changing circumstances by placing an immediate freeze on arms transfers that risk exacerbating instability; this would be especially useful in situations where the rapidly changing circumstances in the recipient country prevented adequate risk assessments from taking place.&#xa0;81&#xa0;&#xa0; However, in follow up discussions with officials, it is now clear that in its current form the suspension mechanism is not fit for purpose and requires radical overhaul. The fundamental flaw in the system is that it seems only to apply to new and pending license applications and not to extant export licences. This means that in situations where the Government has decided that an unfolding crisis makes it impossible to make a meaningful assessment of new license applications, existing licences could nevertheless continue to be honoured. For example, in a situation where the Government has decided to suspend license applications to a country's internal security units due to immediate concerns about the use of equipment in internal repression in a rapidly unfolding crisis, licences already granted to those same units would still be valid and transfers could continue. For the suspension mechanism to be meaningful, it must clearly apply to the whole arms transfer process and so must place an immediate freeze on all arms transfers, including all extant licences and any pending shipments due to take place.&#xa0;82&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG is also unclear about how the suspension mechanism is triggered and the thresholds that are used when deciding to apply it.  For example, despite the rapidly unfolding conflict and deteriorating security situation that took place in Mali in March 2012, the suspension mechanism appears to have not been used. In fact, to date, as far as the UKWG understands, it has only been used in response to the very serious situation in Egypt in August 2013. This suggests that the threshold that triggers the suspension mechanism has been set at a very high level, once armed conflict and instability have already reached crisis point; it therefore does not serve as the flexible response to rapidly developing and unfolding situations that we had expected.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations:]]]&#xa0;83&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[To be effective, the Government must significantly enhance and expand its license suspension process to capture all stages of the arms transfer process. As well as current licence applications, the suspension must also apply to all extant licences and deliveries pending. ]]]&#xa0;84&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should outline its criteria and the threshold for invoking the suspension process. This should include information about the sources and types of information used in making an assessment and how a judgement is made as to whether a particular country is experiencing a sharp deterioration in security or stability.]]]&#xa0;85&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The CAEC should ask the Government to explain how relevant Government departments are co-ordinated when a decision is taken to invoke the suspension mechanism, and in particular what systems are in place to co-ordinate export licensing with HMRC who remain responsible for oversight of all physical exports leaving UK territory.]]]&#xa0;86&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The CAEC should investigate why, despite serious deteriorations in security in Mali in March 2012, the Government has so far only used the suspension mechanism  once (in August 2013) in response to the current security crisis in Egypt. ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Transparency initiative reversal]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;87&#xa0;&#xa0; It was with alarm and dismay that the members of the UKWG read the 31 July 2013 Notice to Exporters 2013/18: Important Changes to the Strategic Export Control Transparency Initiative, in which the UK Government announced a decision to roll back from a number of significant commitments it had previously made in the field of transparency in export licensing in response to the events in the Middle East and North Africa. There had been little warning given of this decision other than Notice to Exporters 2013/14 of 15 May which announced the postponement by three months – to July 2013 – of the implementation of the proposed changes, and an oblique reference in Parliament by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to a decision to “dispense with some procedures relating to quarterly reporting”. Moreover, in a face-to-face meeting between Government officials and the UKWG on 11 July 2013, officials confirmed that the implementation of the Conclusions of the Transparency Initiative was proceeding as planned. &#xa0;88&#xa0;&#xa0; In his Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament of 13 July 2012 the Business Secretary asserted the following: &#xa0;Public confidence in the workings of the export licensing system is crucial. These measures will result in a significant increase in the amount and quality of information that the Government makes public about controlled exports. This will enable the public and Parliament to more effectively hold the Government to account in this important and sensitive area.  &#xa0;89&#xa0;&#xa0; One year after this statement however, without warning, the Government announced it was abandoning plans to require exporters to report quarterly on the volume or value of transactions under Open General and Open Individual licences, whether according to Control List classification or by giving a description of the items exported. Instead, exporters will merely be required to report, annually, on the number of times they have used an open licence, giving the country of destination and type of end-user. This continuing failure to provide information on the volume or value of UK exports of controlled goods under specific open licences means that Parliament and the public will continue to be deprived of access to key information on arms transfers that the UK Government was, until recently, prepared to collect and disclose. Moreover, it is difficult to understand why the Government itself no longer wishes exporters to provide regular information relating to exports and transfers under open licences when timely access to such information could assist the Government in making informed decisions on future licence applications. &#xa0;90&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government justifies its decision to significantly scale back reporting under open licences on the grounds that “[m]any companies have expressed concerns that this would place an unacceptable administrative burden on exporters”. However this is at odds with the published feedback from companies, communicated as follows in the Conclusions following the Review of Transparency in Export Licensing of July 2012: “Exporters generally accept the rationale for this initiative and are generally supportive provided that the administrative burden is kept to a minimum and that what they consider to be truly sensitive information is protected”. This gives the clear impression that exporters’ concerns could be handled appropriately and that the majority had accepted the proposals advanced by BIS. Indeed it is worth noting that exporting companies are already required to keep records of transfers made under open licences, so they already have this data available; the question would be one of packaging and delivery of this information to BIS. &#xa0;91&#xa0;&#xa0; In light of this turnaround, serious questions must be asked as regards the process that resulted in the decision to abandon so much of the proposed changes, particularly given the published responses from the defence industry and that significant time and resources were clearly expended within Government in order to deliver greater transparency. &#xa0;92&#xa0;&#xa0; Also in the Notice to Exporters 2013/18 the Government lists 21 separate OGELs that will be exempted from the new reporting requirements. Given that some of the licences relate to military and dual-use goods it will be important that the UK Government explains why the different licences listed have been exempted from the few additional reporting requirements that have survived.&#xa0;93&#xa0;&#xa0; Beyond the issue of reporting under open licences there has been little concrete information provided in recent months concerning the fate of the other proposals set out in the BIS transparency initiative. Of particular concern is the apparent lack of progress in providing additional information from SIELs, such as the nature of the end-user, in the Quarterly and Annual Reports. In the initial announcement of the BIS transparency review on 7 February 2012 the Secretary of State made the assertion that because export licence applications are currently made in confidence this makes it difficult to make additional information available in the Quarterly and Annual reports but that the Government was exploring ways of rectifying this. Thirteen months later, the notice to exporters of March 2013 refers only to the possibility of making additional information from SIELs available “under the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) 2000” with no mention of the provision of such information through the Quarterly or Annual reports.&#xa0;94&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG has long argued that additional licensing information, such as that identifying the type of end user, is essential to allowing informed scrutiny of arms transfer policy and practice on the part of Parliament and the public. It is therefore to be hoped that the UK Government is not also intending to back-track on this commitment.&#xa0;95&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, there has been no mention of the fate of the proposal concerning the possibility to appoint an Independent Reviewer to look into the operation of the licensing system since the Written Ministerial Statement of 13 July 2012 that pledged to return to the matter at a later date and the Government’s Conclusions following the Review of Transparency in Export Licensing of July 2012 that stated it would “conduct further research into the ‘Independent Reviewer’ role”. As we noted in our 2012 Memorandum to the CAEC, given the recent experience of the Arab Spring the UKWG believes that an independent reviewer could play a key role in assisting in the identification of potential problems within and lessons learned for the transfer licensing system, thereby enabling the UK’s systems to develop over time in anticipation of, as well as in response to, external developments.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations]]]&#xa0;96&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should reinstate its original plans to provide substantive information on transfers made under open licences, in line with the Conclusions that arose from the Review of Transparency in Export Licensing of July 2012.]]]&#xa0;97&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should also give a full explanation of how, why and when it made the decision to renege on its undertaking to provide substantive information on transfers made under open licences.

[[[The Government should set out a timetable for providing additional information in relation to SIELs – including specific information on the nature of the end-user – in the Quarterly and Annual Reports. The Government should confirm that this information will be such as to provide a meaningful level of information and that it will go well beyond generic descriptions such as “government”, “military” or “industry”.]]]&#xa0;100&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Government should also give an account of its further deliberations on the matter of the proposed Independent Reviewer to look into the operation of the licensing system and should further consult with parliament, the public and industry on this important issue.]]]&#xa0;

[[[EU Common Position]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[review ]]]&#xa0;101&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In our November 2012 memorandum to the CAEC, the UKWG set out a number of recommendations regarding the review of the EU Common Position. These built on the November 2011 collaborative NGO report Lessons from MENA: Appraising EU Transfers of Military and Security Equipment to the Middle East and North Africa. The recommendations included: establishing a regularly-updated list of ‘countries of concern’; operating a policy of ‘presumption of denial’ with regard to transfers to those states; and that licensing decisions should be less dependent on assessing past behaviour and instead take more account of future risk.  &#xa0;102&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While we maintain that such changes should still be implemented, this memorandum has a tighter focus in that it looks at only those issues that Member States have themselves decided should be subject to change, i.e. the review of two of the criteria and improvements in information-sharing among Member States.&#xa0;103&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 19 November 2012 the EU Council adopted Council conclusions on the review of Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP. The central ‘conclusion’ was that “the provisions of the Common Position, and the instruments it provides for, continue to properly serve the objectives set in 2008 and to provide a solid basis for the co-ordination of Member States' arms export policies”. The Council did however recognise that “further progress is achievable in the implementation of the Common Position and in order to maximise convergence among Member States in the field of exports of conventional arms.”&#xa0;104&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On this basis the Council committed itself to “the development of further guidance in the application and interpretation of the eight export criteria of the Common Position, the refinement of the information-exchange mechanism on specific destinations, the improvement of the denial notification and consultation mechanism” and noted that “the results of this second stage of the review process will be reflected, inter alia, in updates of the User's Guide accompanying the Common Position, and providing detailed guidance for its implementation”.&#xa0;105&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As with the first stage of the review, these follow-up activities are being conducted behind closed doors, an issue over which the UKWG has previously expressed its disappointment. Furthermore, we understand that, contrary to the commitments expressed in the Council conclusions, not all the Criteria are to be reviewed. So far only Criteria 7 (‘diversion’) and 8 (‘sustainable development’) are being reviewed, with the possibility that Criterion 2 (human rights) will be next.  The reasons for such a limited approach are not clear; given the issues thrown up by the Arab Spring the failure to review Criteria 3 (‘internal situation’) and 4 (‘regional peace and security’) is particularly perplexing.  &#xa0;106&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have been informed that Member States have provisionally agreed new guidance for Criteria 7 and 8 and that the EU Council Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports (COARM) has issued a revised User’s Guide incorporating these changes, with Member States expected to use the new guidance on a trial basis. It is, however, open for further revision and no new version of the User’s Guide will be published until this new guidance is finalised.&#xa0;107&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The other main aspect to the second part of the Common Position review, i.e. refinement of the information exchange, denial notification and consultation mechanisms, is apparently proceeding slowly, with Member States having different ideas of what is desirable or even feasible.   &#xa0;108&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG is frustrated by the pace of review, but more fundamentally by the fact that civil society has been unable to engage in any meaningful way with any aspect of the whole Common Position review process, including the review of Criteria 7 and 8. While we have been free to give our views, this has been without a proper understanding of what Member States have been willing to ‘put on the table’; thus the possibility for constructive discussion has not existed and our capacity to make relevant contributions has been hampered.  Even now the content of the provisionally-completed Criteria review remains confidential, though the rationale for this is unclear. Certainly it undermines EU Member States’ claims to a transparent system.  &#xa0;109&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With regard to the information-sharing mechanisms, we are pleased that Member States do seem finally convinced by the arguments made for several years by the UKWG and other EU NGOs and that they have decided to establish a real-time online information-sharing database, though we are once again disappointed by the time it is taking to complete this project.  We understand that as well as data on denials and consultations, Member States are considering sharing information regarding specific destinations—though it will be at the discretion of states as to whether and when they choose to use the system in this way. Unfortunately, as far as we know, the system will not provide for sharing information on specific licence approvals; it has long been our contention that as much can be learned from ‘difficult’ licensing decisions that resulted in an approval as from denials. We thus continue to encourage Member States to share information of this type and hope that the system being developed will be able to easily accommodate such changes in future.&#xa0;

[[[The UK Government should insist that, as required by the November 2012 Council Conclusions on the review of Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, all other criteria are reviewed, preferably starting with Criteria 2, 3 and 4.]]]&#xa0;112&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK Government should encourage Member States to consult externally on the development of further guidance in the application and interpretation of the Common Position Criteria, including through publication of interim findings. If this is not possible then the UK Government should itself hold consultations at the national level and incorporate the substance of these consultations into its discussions with other Member States.]]]&#xa0;113&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK Government should treat the development and introduction of the online information-sharing EU database as a matter of urgency; ensure that its design allows for amendment into the future; and promote greater information sharing on specific licences approved.]]]&#xa0;

[[[The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)]]]&#xa0;114&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) was adopted by overwhelming vote by the UN General Assembly on 2 April 2013, 155 in favour, 22 abstentions and 3 votes against. This came after the final Diplomatic (negotiating) Conference had failed to adopt the draft Treaty when Iran, Syria and North Korea blocked consensus. However, by utilising a clause in the Resolution that had mandated the final negotiations, a like-minded group of supporter States, including the UK, were able to take the draft Treaty text to the UN General Assembly for adoption by vote. The UKWG notes that while the UK initially opposed the relevant clause (OP7) in the Resolution, arguing against the Control Arms Coalition and more progressive states who had proposed it, they ultimately recognised the value of this inclusion and helped to utilise it to secure the vote.&#xa0;115&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ATT sets an important basis for global action to control the international trade in conventional arms. It is the first global legally binding instrument to control the arms trade, and creates a new global norm against which States’ practice will be measured by other States and by international civil society. It is not perfect, and civil society will continue to push for robust interpretation of its provisions, and encourages the UK, as a leader in this process, to ensure a very strong statement upon depositing their instrument of ratification.&#xa0;116&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ATT opened for signature on June 3, 2013, and at the time of writing has been signed by 113 States including the UK, and ratified by 7 States. The Treaty will enter into force ninety days after the 50th ratification. Assuming that the necessary EU procedural issues will soon be completed, EU Member States are likely to be able to ratify in late 2013, in which case entry-into-force could take place before the end of 2014. We welcome the fact that the UK has already commenced ratification proceedings in anticipation of EU procedures being completed, and urge the Government to maintain outreach to other States to sign and ratify as soon as possible. 117&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We particularly welcome the recent signature by Senator John Kerry on behalf of the US, and recognise the contribution by the UK government, as well as civil society campaigning, in encouraging the US to sign. US signature is very significant given their role as world’s largest arms exporter, and is likely to lead to other hesitant countries now joining the treaty. &#xa0;118&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is now vital that the Government does everything possible to strengthen the international norms embedded in the Treaty. The UK should make the strongest possible interpretative statement upon ratifying the Treaty, for example, making it clear that the UK will continue to regulate a comprehensive list of arms, equipment and munitions beyond the minimum scope allowed by the Treaty and calling on other States Parties to do likewise. &#xa0;119&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is widely acknowledged that many States will require technical, legal and financial assistance to be able to ratify and implement that ATT. For some the level of support required will be significant. Before the Secretariat, envisaged in the Treaty, comes into existence, providers of assistance will need to carefully co-ordinate work between themselves to avoid duplication. The UKWG urges the UK Government to work proactively to ensure that as many States as possible are able to quickly sign, ratify and begin to properly implement the Treaty. This assistance can be provided bilaterally, and through regional and global organisations. The UK Government should offer technical and legal assistance to all States which may need it as they sign the Treaty. In addition, the UK should be a significant donor for ATT implementation purposes, and should encourage other States to be generous in this regard. &#xa0;120&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government should take other States attitude toward the ATT into account in a range of arms-transfer related activities. For example, participation at DSEi or in co-production agreements with UK companies should be dependent on whether the State concerned has signed the ATT (see paragraphs 126-132), while a country’s ATT-status should be one of the most important factors making up assessments under criteria 1 (‘international obligations’) of the National Consolidated Criteria. Eligibility for inclusion among the eligible destinations on OGELs could be similarly dependent.&#xa0;121&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG also notes that Parliament has a role to play in raising awareness among parliamentarians worldwide of the Treaty and of what effective implementation will look like. We encourage the CAEC, and indeed all UK Parliamentarians, to use every opportunity to raise the ATT with counterparts in other countries, to make offers of assistance to other Parliaments regarding the role of Parliamentarians in the ratification process, in preparing any necessary implementing legislation and in scrutinising national implementation of the Treaty once it enters into force.&#xa0;

The UKWG believes that when deciding who can exhibit at DSEi, the UK Government should consider the international obligations and standing of the states in which potential exhibitors are based. In this regard we recommend that a company from any state that has not signed the ATT should be prohibited from attending any UK arms fair. At a minimum, any OGELs issued to allow companies to automatically participate at DSEi should exclude companies originating from non ATT signatory states.&#xa0;127&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK Government invited official delegations from 67 countries to DSEi in 2013; of these, eight were from countries that abstained or were absent from the UN General Assembly vote on adopting the ATT and who have not yet signed the treaty. The UKWG believes inviting countries that have not signed the ATT to such events undermines the UK Government’s support for universal adherence to the Treaty. &#xa0;128&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, Secretary of State for Defence, Phillip Hammond, reiterated at DSEi that selling arms is a Government priority while launching Securing prosperity: A strategic vision for the UK defence sector which sets out plans for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and BIS to work with the defence industry to “maximise the UK’s competitive advantage to boost British jobs, trade and growth”. That neither the Securing prosperity document nor Hammond’s speech make reference to the obligation to ensure the protection of human rights is of significant concern. &#xa0;&#xa0;129&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Moreover, nine countries identified in the FCO’s 2012 Human Rights and Democracy Report received official invitations to attend the 2013 DSEi; these are among the countries regarded as raising the most serious concerns for human rights. The UKWG is at a loss to understand how the Government can justify inviting such countries to an exhibition promoting the sale of a vast array of defence and security equipment and services. The UKWG is concerned that this demonstrates a serious lack of joined-up government in this field. Furthermore the UKWG is also concerned that this could be interpreted as a weakening of the Government’s support for the ATT given that it is effectively bringing together sellers from states that do not support the Treaty with buyers from states that by the Government’s own calculation raise significant human rights concerns. &#xa0;

[[[Trade fairs and advertising activities ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;133&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At DSEi 2013, two companies were ejected for promoting Category A goods—which includes cluster munitions and certain paramilitary goods that can be used for internal repression or torture. The DSEi compliance team failed to notice that Tianjin Myway International Trading Co (China) and Magforce International (France) were advertising electric shock weapons and leg cuffs in company brochures available to visitors and it was only after Caroline Lucas MP alerted organisers to the prohibited activities that the stalls were closed. These companies should be immediately investigated for potential breaches of UK Export Control legislation.&#xa0;134&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is very concerning that these recent events seem to be following a well-established pattern. In 2011 the UKWG called for an investigation into three companies that were displaying prohibited literature at the 2011 DSEi. In fact at every DSEi since 2005 MPs or NGOs have found companies in breach of regulations around permitted promotional activity.&#xa0;135&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG are disappointed to note that at no point to date have any of these companies been prosecuted for prohibited activities nor, as far as we know, has this even been seriously considered. This is despite the fact that Article 21 of the Export Control Order 2008 states: &#xa0;No person to whom this article applies shall directly or indirectly do any act calculated to promote the supply or delivery of any category A goods, where that person knows or has reason to believe that such action or actions will, or may, result in the removal of those goods from one third country to another third country.&#xa0;136&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition the UK Government’s own website states: “The controls on Category A goods cover any act calculated to promote the movement of such goods with no exemption for general advertising or promotion”.&#xa0;137&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is therefore somewhat puzzling that in a letter to CAEC regarding DSEi 2011 the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable, stated that “it is necessary to prove a link between the display of the brochure, and the eventual movement of the goods between two overseas destinations”. This is at odds with the wording of the 2008 Order which makes it clear that there is no need for an actual link and that Article 21 applies even if an eventual transaction doesn’t take place. Moreover, the UK Government’s own guidance on the promotion of Category A goods states: &#xa0;Unlike trading in category C and B goods, there are no exemptions for those whose sole involvement is in transportation services, financing or financial services, insurance or reinsurance services or general advertising and promotion (such as displaying category A goods at trade fairs or advertising them in periodicals) (emphasis added). Therefore, anyone involved in the provision of these services requires a licence.&#xa0;138&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Almost by definition, the display of Category A goods in promotional literature is calculated to promote supply of those goods, and so the display of catalogues containing Category A goods at UK trade exhibitions must surely constitute “general advertising or promotion”. Indeed in the Supplementary Guidance Note on Trade (“Trafficking and Brokering”) in Controlled Goods the UK Government expressly defines what it means by the terms “general advertising”: &#xa0;General advertising is where the advertising is not directed at one individual/company and is not intended to close a deal i.e. its main objective is to gain people’s interest. An example of general advertising may include a stand at a trade fair with promotional materials such as posters or brochures; or an advert in a periodical magazine.&#xa0;139&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It therefore seems clear that the Act is designed to prohibit such promotional activities in relation to Category A goods and it is not necessary to wait until an actual transfer has taken place for a criminal act to have occurred.  Such activities are covered by the Act and we call on the UK Government to fully investigate them. &#xa0;140&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG also believes that the repeated discovery of companies breaching the regulations around permitted promotional activity shows inadequate compliance checks both before and during the fair by the exhibition organisers and HM Revenue and Customs; it should not be the job of civil society or MPs to identify these breaches. &#xa0;141&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; According to Michael Fallon, the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise, the Export Control Organisation has agreed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Clarion Events, the organisers of DSEi, which sets out Clarion's roles and responsibilities. Given the clear and repeated failure of Clarion to exercise proper oversight of company compliance at the DSEi trade events and to enforce the contractual obligations of exhibitors, the MoU between Clarion and the Government should be scrutinised by the CAEC.&#xa0;142&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While promotional literature pertaining to cluster munitions was not found at DSEi 2013, companies were found to be promoting these weapons at DSEi in 2007, 2009 and 2011 and at Farnborough International Airshow in 2010. To prevent future promotion of cluster munitions, the Government should prohibit any state that has not signed and ratified the Cluster Munitions Convention, and any company that has not signed a written guarantee that they (or any subsidiary or partner) do not produce cluster munitions or their components, from attending any military or defence trade event in the UK.&#xa0;

[[[Cluster munitions and financing]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;148&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK Government is a State Party to the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions following the enactment of the Cluster Munitions (Prohibitions) Act 2010.  In a written Ministerial Statement dated 7 December 2009, the Government stated that the direct financing of cluster munitions is prohibited under the provisions of the Bill. Through this Statement, it also committed to work with financial institutions, non-governmental organisations and other interested parties, to undertake a thorough consultation and establish a working group, and to put in place a voluntary code of conduct to prevent indirect financing, and if necessary initiate legislation. No progress has been seen on any of these areas.&#xa0;149&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is of concern that the Government appears to be have rejected its previous commitment to end indirect investments in cluster-munition producers. In its official response to the CAEC's 2011-2012 investigations, published on 22 October 2012, it stated:&#xa0;Indirect financing – such as the purchase of shares in or the provision of loans to large multinational conglomerates that amongst often many other activities may be involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions – is not captured by the prohibitions of the Act. We consider this form of indirect financing an issue for individual institutions to consider under their own investment charters and social corporate responsibility agendas.&#xa0;150&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An increasing number of UK-based financial institutions continue to strengthen their policies on investments in companies involved in the production of cluster munitions including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Aviva, Co-operative Financial Services and HSBC. In discussions between financial institutions and members of UKWG, all companies have strongly supported the idea of a jointly-developed, industry-wide Code of Conduct to end indirect finance and have expressed disappointment that thus far, the Government appears to have abandoned previous commitments to help to facilitate its development.&#xa0;151&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is of importance that the Government engages with financial institutions and non-governmental organisations through a multi-stakeholder process to provide guidance. Financial institutions have indicated that they would benefit from government guidance and leadership on this issue to harmonise policies and practice.&#xa0;152&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Furthermore, at least nine UK financial institutions are understood to continue to invest in companies producing cluster munitions. &#xa0;

[[[Recommendation]]]&#xa0;153&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[We urge the Government to honour commitments made to end indirect financial support for cluster munitions and initiate a thorough and inclusive consultation process aimed at providing guidance to financial institutions on disinvesting from cluster munitions.  As a first step, we urge the UK Government to set up a multi-stakeholder meeting between relevant industry, NGOs and Government representatives to initiate work on this area.]]]&#xa0;

[[[Torture and end-use]]]&#xa0;154&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UKWG is disappointed at the decision by the UK Government to abandon its commitment to introduce new end-user controls on torture and death-penalty equipment. In a written response to the CAEC the UK Foreign Minister stated in October 2012:&#xa0;The Government continues to believe&#xa0;that list-based controls are more likely to be effective than horizontal end-use controls, which can have uncertain impacts on legitimate trade and be problematic to enforce.”&#xa0;155&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the 2008 review of UK export control legislation the introduction of new end-user controls was deemed a policy priority and one that received widespread and unanimous support from NGOs, the CAEC and defence industry representatives. We are dismayed that the UK Government has dropped this policy without consultation with the original stakeholders.&#xa0;156&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As previously stated we believe that end-user controls on torture and death-penalty equipment would both enhance a system of list-based controls and bring UK export control policy into line with its international legal obligations to prohibit torture and ill-treatment. End-user controls in this area were widely accepted to be an important safety net to allow the UK Government to take action on areas of trading activity where there is universal agreement that involvement in such activities is unacceptable, By scrapping this commitment, the UK Government is sending a signal to would-be exporters that it will permit UK involvement in the facilitation of torture, ill-treatment and capital punishment as long as the equipment is not covered by an export control list. &#xa0;&#xa0;157&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; End-use controls may well have prevented the export of drugs subsequently involved in lethal injections in certain US penitentiaries in 2010, without the initial recourse of judicial review of Government licensing decisions,  given it was clear that the exporter was aware that the drugs were being exported for use in executions. A torture end-use clause would also help by mitigating the danger of relying purely on list-based controls, which tend to be reactive in nature and slow to respond to new and emerging technologies or unforeseen items.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation]]]&#xa0;158&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UK Government should reverse its decision to abandon the introduction of new end-user controls on equipment for use in torture or for use in carrying out the death penalty.]]]&#xa0;

[[[3D printing]]]&#xa0;159&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One emerging issue for Parliamentary consideration is the emergence of 3D printed guns. This year has seen a number of firsts in the field, including the first functional printed firearm components, the first fully-functional printed pistol and rifle, and the first functional printed repeating gun. The technology is still nascent but rapidly advancing, and 3D printed weapons could potentially circumvent existing means of international arms control by existing solely as data until the point where they are created by the end user, who could be anywhere there is an Internet connection. &#xa0;160&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The U.S. State Department clearly views 3D printed guns as a threat to existing export controls, having requested that the designers of a 3D printed pistol remove the weapon’s design files from their website as a potential violation of the U.S. Arms Export Control Act. This reflects the distinct lack of clarity around the status of designs for weapons in national and international law relating to arms transfers. The UKWG would therefore encourage the CAEC to raise with the Government how it proposes to approach the potential availability of 3D printed weapons distributed internationally via the Internet.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation]]]&#xa0;161&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The UKWG is concerned about the advent of 3D printing technology and its implications for strategic export controls. We therefore urge the CAEC to raise this issue with the Government and to ask what action the UK is taking at international level to develop a clear and concerted response to this issue.]]]
