[[[Leonard Cheshire Disability believes that disability ]]]

[[[be at the heart of development. Disability must therefore be explicitly referenced in the post-2015 development framework.]]] With approximately a billion disabled people across the globe, it will simply not be possible to secure the optimum development outcomes unless disabled people are fully included and mainstreamed within all development programmes.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[To this end we believe that the UK Government must be at the forefront of pushing for disability to be referenced in the post-2015 development framework]]]. The UK is well placed to be a leading voice in this call, which could help ensure that millions of disabled people are fully included in development work.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recognise that there has been a willingness to pursue this agenda within the Department for International Development, particularly through a number of key programmes.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would however suggest that it is difficult to identify the extent to which mainstreaming of disability issues has actually happened across the Department.

We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute economically, and to participate fully in society.&#xa0;Leonard Cheshire Disability's International Department works through five regional offices in Africa and Asia. We support children with disabilities to get an education, adults with disabilities to earn a living, and all disabled people to access the rehabilitation, health and other support they need. We also campaign to put disability at the heart of international development, and support young disabled people to campaign for their rights through our Young Voices programme.&#xa0;In addition, the Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London (which is part of our International Department), undertakes world-class qualitative and quantitative research in the field of disability and international development. We focus on policy analysis, disability and poverty, livelihoods, inclusive education and disability in conflict-affected countries and in disaster and emergency situations. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategy]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Leonard Cheshire Disability recognises and welcomes the leading role that DFID has taken in the field on disability and international development during the past 15 years. This is evidenced by the production of the issues paper, Disability, Poverty and Development, (2000), which spearheaded the highly influential “twin track approach” to disability programming. DFID has also been proactive in commissioning four discrete research programmes on disability and international development issues, which has made a significant contribution to the growing body of knowledge in this field, including evidence that is now regularly used to support the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID has also produced a How to Note on Working on Disability in Country Programmes, written primarily for DFID country staff. However, since its publication in 2009, there is little evidence of the extent to which this has influenced DFID’s programmes and policies at country level.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the recent past, there has been an increasing commitment by DFID to incorporate and mainstream disability issues within its core programmes. The current Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development, Lynne Featherstone, has a personal commitment to disability issues. This is to be commended. However, it is important that this personal commitment becomes institutionalised within DFID, so that disability continues to be prioritised in international development, both within the UK Government, and also by other leading bilateral and multilateral donor agencies.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Notwithstanding these positive initiatives, at the programme level, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which DFID has indeed mainstreamed disability across its work. &#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It remains the case that the economic case for the inclusion of disability issues within the international development framework needs to be constantly made and reaffirmed. The evidence base for inclusion of disability issues, though growing, still needs to be strengthened.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A development of a coherent disability strategy by DFID would be very positive. It would embed a disability component into DFID’s work, and provide a clear set of priorities. This should be developed in collaboration with civil society institutions, including disabled people’s organisations. We strongly recommend that this consultation process includes the input from disabled people and their representative organisations in low and middle income countries. DFID’s future disability strategy should embrace the principles and commitments set out in the UNCRPD. It should also reflect the outcomes of The Report of the High Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda on the post-2015 development agenda and any future changes to the global development framework. &#xa0;3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to ensure that disability issues are systemically institutionalised within DFID, we recommended that a full-time senior civil servant is appointed in the department, whose primary role is to make sure that disability is included in all DFID policy and strategy initiatives including country programmes and DFID-funded projects with civil society institutions.&#xa0;

[[[Integration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sa]]]

[[[nitation, livelihoods, and empowerment) and its humanitarian work]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a strong link between disability and multi-dimensional poverty. It is not lack of funds alone but a lack of inclusion in important areas such as education, health services and social participation, as well as compounding factors such as gender, age and geographical location, that limit the opportunities for disabled people to overcome poverty. Research from the Leonard Cheshire Disability Inclusive Development Centre has recently termed this the ‘Disability and Development Gap’: disabled people who are not included in development efforts fall increasingly further behind non-disabled members of their communities as development efforts increase. &#xa0;3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Leonard Cheshire Disability endorses the twin track approach to disability service provision as outlined in DFID’s issues paper, Disability, Poverty and Development (2000). We therefore recommend that DFID finances specifically targeted disability programmes as well as enabling disabled people and their families to access mainstream public services and development initiatives (including water and sanitation, public health, education and social protection).&#xa0;3.10&#xa0;&#xa0; The evaluation strategy developed for DFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) gives a unique opportunity to generate strong evidence of what works and what does not. Leonard Cheshire Disability welcomes the effort made by GEC to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity of implementing agencies and to fund research initiatives. However there needs to be the right balance between the effort invested in generating the evidence and the direct response to the needs of disabled people.&#xa0;3.11&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID needs to develop a robust monitoring and evaluation framework at international and country level. This is in relevant in two areas: first, with regard to DFID’s five-year country operational plans; and second with regard to DFID’s programmes through civil society institutions. The framework should clearly measure and evaluate the specific impact(s) that DFID’s disability-specific and mainstream initiatives have on disabled people. It should at a minimum ensure that data is disaggregated by age, sex, category of impairment, and where possible, ethnicity, and geographical location (urban/rural divide).&#xa0;3.12&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also important that DFID actively engages and provides financial support for the empowerment of disabled people’s organisations in low and middle income countries. Therefore, DFID should fund the institutional development and strengthening of disabled people’s organisations. &#xa0;3.13&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to make disability-specific and mainstream programmes more inclusive, appropriate financial resources should be provided to support the design of innovative programmes at country level.&#xa0;3.14&#xa0;&#xa0;  We further encourage DFID to ensure that all key stakeholders receive Disability Awareness training and that disabled people routinely sit on project advisory boards. &#xa0;

[[[The strength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability]]]&#xa0;3.15&#xa0;&#xa0; Four examples are given below that demonstrate some of the innovative work that Leonard Cheshire Disability has undertaken globally. This is not a comprehensive list but instead provides some examples of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Cross-Cutti]]]

[[[ng Disability Research Programme]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.16&#xa0;&#xa0; The Cross-Cutting Disability Research Programme was a three-year initiative funded by DFID and managed by the Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre. The mandate was to work with other DFID-funded Research Programme Consortia (RPC) to mainstream a disability component into other international development research areas. Research was undertaken in collaboration with other RPCs in the fields of access for persons with disabilities to water and sanitation (Zambia and Uganda); maternal and child health (Nepal); mental health, stigma and multi-dimensional poverty (India); and urban agriculture (Kenya). One of the key lessons learned from this research programme was that disability often was not considered by mainstream RPCs. It is therefore essential to build the capacity of disabled people and their representative organisations on how to undertake and use research in their core campaigning activities.&#xa0;

[[[Leonard Che]]]

[[[shire Disability’s Young Voices]]]3.17&#xa0;&#xa0; Leonard Cheshire Disability’s Young Voices programme, supported by the European Union, provides clear evidence of the value of making young disabled people the agents of their own destiny within development programmes. Young Voices is a global network of over 1,200 young disabled campaigners from over 20 countries in the global South. Through the project, young disabled people gain the skills and confidence they need to engage with decision makers to effectively advocate and campaign to end the extreme poverty, discrimination and exclusion experienced by people with disabilities in lower income countries. The voices of young people with disabilities are often marginalised. Through their focused advocacy campaigns, Young Voices have contributed to changing both local and national discourses on disability and participated at an international level through the UN and UNICEF. Initiatives such as this can be a catalyst for building the next generation of the disability movement.

[[[Inclusive education]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.18&#xa0;&#xa0; Through our inclusive education projects across Africa and Asia, Leonard Cheshire Disability has supported over 10,000 children with disabilities to go to school. Our inclusive education work in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, supported by Big Lottery Fund, was recognised in ‘Best Practices for Including Persons with Disabilities in All Aspects of Development Efforts’ published by UN in April 2011. The project supported children with disabilities to access mainstream primary education and supported them to continue their education. Over 3,000 teachers were trained on accommodating children with disabilities in their classes. Preparatory classes for children with disabilities were organised prior to enrolment into mainstream schools, and an effective home-based education system was designed for areas where the terrain made it hard for children with high support needs to get to school. The project worked closely with schools to make them accessible; and with government officials to ensure that children with disabilities received any government entitlements due to them. The project also undertook advocacy and policy work, including the formation of parents groups and child-to-child clubs for children with and without disabilities to support meaningful inclusion. In total, over 2,700 children were successfully enrolled in their local primary schools. The project had a significant impact on changing attitudes towards disabled children’s rights to education; there are now more children with disabilities in local primary schools in the project locations. &#xa0;

[[[Livelihoods]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.19&#xa0;&#xa0; Leonard Cheshire Disability’s Livelihoods Resource Centres (LRCs) in Asia and Africa (supported by funders including Accenture and the European Union respectively) have been selected by the Zero Project as an example of ‘Innovative Practice’ relating to persons with disabilities and employment. LRCs act as ‘one-stop-shops’ for disabled people seeking employment, providing skills training, career guidance and links between employees and employers. There are now 22 LRCs in 9 countries across Asia and Africa. We have supported over 10,000 adults with disabilities into paid or self-employment, and provided training for nearly 50,000. LRCs are unique in providing the full range of support that disabled people need when seeking employment or starting their own enterprise. LCD partners with mainstream training institutions, ensuring disabled people get recognised qualifications. The training is also tailored to meet the needs of local employment markets, as well as people’s own interests and talents. Training provision in “soft skills” (including confidence building, decision making, and critical thinking) also supports the project’s success. In order to support self-employment, the microfinance model used by LRCs includes savings and insurance, known to be an effective poverty reduction tool.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The role of disabled beneficiaries in planning, managing and monitoring DFID policy and programmes]]]&#xa0;3.20&#xa0;&#xa0; It has long been recognised, especially in rural development and international gender studies, that the most sustainable and efficient outcomes of development initiatives occur when participatory approaches to policy and programme design are employed. Within the international disability and development sector, a good example of this was the negotiation process of the UNCRPD. &#xa0;3.21&#xa0;&#xa0; Adopting a participatory approach, if undertaking in a non-tokenistic manner, will incur financial and human costs – for example provision of sign language interpreters, physically accessible venues, covering transport etc. We recommend that explicit reference is made within the DFID disability strategy to the need to involve disabled people and their allies in the development of DFID-funded disability initiatives. It will also be important to explicitly state what processes and methodology will be employed to ensure such engagement.&#xa0;3.22&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that both disabled and non-disabled people have a legitimate role to play in relation to policy design, programme implementation and evaluation. &#xa0;3.23&#xa0;&#xa0; We encourage DFID to establish a working group, comprised of key individuals working in the disability and international development arena, who will provide strategic advice and guidance to DFID on this issue.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The financial costs and benefits of an increased emphasis on disability]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.24&#xa0;&#xa0; The financial and human costs of the continuing exclusion of disability in international development are substantial. In 2000, the World Bank estimated that the annual loss to global GDP of people with disabilities not working who were in a position to do so was between $1.37 trillion and $1,94 trillion. This figure is likely to have increased substantially since 2000.&#xa0;3.25&#xa0;&#xa0; In the International Labour Organization’s 2009 study entitled ‘The Price of Exclusion: The Economic Consequences of Excluding People with Disabilities from the World of Work’, the total annual cost of avoidable unemployment among disabled persons to national economies was estimated to be between 1% and 7% of GDP.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The UK’s role in ensuring post-2015 development goals consider disability issues]]]&#xa0;3.26&#xa0;&#xa0; The Millennium Development Goals made no explicit reference to disability issues. This was a significant omission. The post-2015 development framework must explicitly include disability. This includes not only the final set of goals but systematic inclusion of disability in the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms built into all targets and indicators.&#xa0;3.27&#xa0;&#xa0; We recommend that DFID takes a leading, strategic role in ensuring that disability issues are incorporated into the post-2015 international development framework.
