[normal]Written evidence submitted by Professor Michael J Kelly FRS [bold]FREng[bold] (IPC0013)[bold]1.
[normal]              
[normal]In 1868, 
[normal]the economist 
[normal]William Stanley Jevons FRS published ‘The Coal Question’.
[normal]  He was the Lord Stern PBA of his day.
[normal]  
[normal]He
[normal] noted th
[normal]at Britain was 
[normal]addicted to coal.  His main message was
[normal] 
[normal]it should abandon the industrial revolution forthwith, as the future social collapse when the coal ran out (i.e. about now) would be too horrible to contemplate.  He was ignored
[normal] and correctly so
[normal]: alternatives to coal
[normal] (
[normal]i.e. oil and gas) were discovered as were much greater reserves of coal.  Arguably the world is a much better place for most people today compared with their great-grandparents in terms of the adequacy and variety of food, the quality and warmth of homes
[normal] and the access to healthcare, education and transport.
[normal] 
[normal]  The IPCC 
[normal]is using the science in AR5 to make
[normal] similar claims today in the context of carbon dioxide emissions
[normal] versus human progress
[normal] as I now show.
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]The difference between living in 1800 and now is 
[normal]that each person in a developed country now uses about 
[normal]six
[normal]-seven
[normal] times as much energy per person per day.  Indeed using the per capita consumption of energy in 1800 as a unit, today we use approximately one unit on personal mobility on land, 
[normal]nearly 
[normal]another
[normal] unit on mobility by air and sea, and three units on the manufacture and distribution of all that we buy.  We still use a comparable amount of energy in heating a main room of our house, sourcing local produce and tools as we did 200 years ago.
[normal]   
[normal]Nearly
[normal] al
[normal]l
[normal] this improvement in the living standards of 
[normal]the 
[normal]seven times as many people on earth as in 1800 has been and continues to be possible 
[normal]with
[normal] the use of fossil fuels as the source of the extra energy.  Only of order 15% comes from biomass (i.e. using wood as
[normal] a fuel as throughout history
[normal])
[normal], nuclear and hydropower
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]only 
[normal]a negligible (&lt;1%) amount from renewable energy.
[normal]    Any recommendation to reduce carbon emissions by 80% without a
[normal] readily available and
[normal] 
[normal]mature 
[normal]non-carbon
[normal] 
[normal]so
[normal]urce of energy is actually 
[normal]more pe
[normal]rverse
[normal] now
[normal] than the recommendation of Jevons
[normal] in 1868
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The strength of the IPCC case that the world should severely curtail its carbon emissions
[normal] in short order
[normal] should be tensioned against other practical considerations.
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Empirical studies of the global
[normal] climate during the 20
[normal]th
[normal] century all 
[normal]suggest
[normal] another century like the last and a
[normal]nother
[normal] temperature rise of order 1C.  It is only the computer models that produce the higher temperatures
[normal] and the alarm
[normal].  In
[normal] the IPCC’s 
[normal]ARC, the 
[normal]consensus
[normal] rate of increase in temperature since 1950 has been revised down by a factor of two to a value of 0.1C/decade in agreement with the empirical results.  The computer models are acknowledged to have been predicting at least twice as much temperature rise as
[normal] observed over the last 25 years, and
[normal] they
[normal] have not predicted the present 
[normal]temperature 
[normal]statis
[normal] when the empirical models did, pointing 
[normal]to
[normal] the repeated plateaux/falls starting in 1880, 1940 and now 2000.  If the present temperature 
[normal]statis
[normal] continues for anothe
[normal]r decade 
[normal]or more, 
[normal]as the empirical models predict
[normal],
[normal] then the climate models are 
[normal]demonstrably and 
[normal]seriously deficient as tools to predict the future.  Should another downward reduction
[normal] in the rate of global warming
[normal] be needed in
[normal] the near
[normal] future
[normal] to accord with
[normal] real-world data
[normal], the whole edifice of ‘unmanaged man-made’ climate change will be seen as a hollow scare as based on our 
[normal]limited 
[normal]present scientific 
[normal]understanding, and 
[normal]any 
[normal]potential downsides will be centuries away with ample time for technological fixes.
[normal] 
[normal] In the terms of a ‘risk’ analysis, the amount we should be willing to pay in any form of insuranc
[normal]e premium should be coming down as a consequence of AR5.
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]At the
[normal] recent
[normal] 2-day meeting at the Royal Society entitled ‘Next Steps in Climate Science – the nex
[normal]t steps’ I got one of the key speakers Professor 
[normal]Jochem
[normal] 
[normal]Marotzke
[normal] of
[normal] Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Germany
[normal] to admit that he fully expected an upturn in the globally averaged temperature before 2020 on the basis of his models.  I was perturbed when 
[normal]h
[normal]e was
[normal] cautioned that he was making himself a hostage to fortune.   In mainstream science that happens all the time, and it precisely the test of prediction against data that is the test of a theory.  The more general understanding is that most scientists w
[normal]ould query the integrity and fitness-for-purpose of all of the models if they continue to miss the present hiatus should it continue for a period of 25 years.

[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]If we do spend trillions of pounds globally at redirecting human living and 
[normal]introduce 
[normal]a non-ca
[normal]rbon energy future, just what impact will it have on the future climate?  
[normal] Can we be sure that higher temperatures will actually be avoided?  If not
[normal],
[normal] the money spent on mitigation as opposed to adaption
[normal] would have been largely wasted in terms of opportunit
[normal]ies foregone to improve the human condition.  Is the science able to reassure us that mitigation really is value for money?
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]How sure are we that higher temperatures really will be as bad as made out?  The temperature rise to date has coincided with impr
[normal]ovements in the human condition.  How robust is the case that this will turn sour in the future?
[normal]  Over geological times there have been wider excursions in temperature and we are in what is historically a cold but interglacial period now.
[normal]8
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]If after all t
[normal]he analysis, the elimination of carbon dioxide emissions must be accelerated
[normal] (a stage I am not convinced we have reached by any means)
[normal], then we must tackle the challenge in a way that is likely to succeed, and not repeat the 
[normal]nonsenses
[normal] of recent decades whi
[normal]ch manifestly are not
[normal] succeeding 
[normal]and will not 
[normal]succeed to 
[normal]do the job.
[normal]9
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The rush, in response to the 1970s oil crises
[normal],
[normal] to install windmills and solar panels over square kilometres of the Mojave Desert 
[normal]in California 
[normal]in the 1980s should be a lesson to us now
[normal].  
[normal]They can be seen by 
[normal]googling
[normal] ‘abandoned windmills’ of ‘abandoned solar farms’.  
[normal]Once subsidies stopped, they did not produce enough electricity to pay for the
[normal]ir
[normal] maintenance.  
[normal]I am not persuaded that
[normal] the renewable tec
[normal]h
[normal]nologies 
[normal]are 
[normal]sufficiently more matur
[normal]e, robust and economic 
[normal]now than they were 30 years ago.  
[normal]10
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Renewable energy sources are intrinsically dilute at source.  One needs all 1000 square kilometres of the Fen Country (now producing food) to generate 
[normal]0.8-1
[normal]GW from biomass if we harvested and 
[normal]burned 
[normal]miscanthus
[normal],
[normal] a rapidly growing grass.  We already get 1.3GW from Sizewell B, the actual 
[normal]nuclear 
[normal]plant 
[normal]for 
[normal]which is less than one tenth of a square kilometre in area.  The factor of 10,000 in 
[normal]energy 
[normal]efficiency of the use of land is not something that 
[normal]can be closed by tinkerin
[normal]g with the renewable energy
[normal] efficiency
[normal].   Furthermor
[normal]e 
[normal]one 
[normal]can grow food or 
[normal]miscanthus
[normal] or cover the land with solar panels, but not do more than one of these
[normal] with the land at any one time
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]In 2050 most of the 9B population of th
[normal]e earth will live in megacities.  O
[normal]nly nuclear energy and the burning of fossil fuels with 
[normal]complete 
[normal]carbon capture and storage produce 
[normal]energy 
[normal]numbers that add up 
[normal]to make global sense, b
[normal]ut the latter technology (i.e. capture and storage) has not been demons
[normal]trated as effective and safe at anything like the scale needed.    Everything else
[normal], and especially renewable energy technologies,
[normal] is hubris as 
[normal]far
[normal] as energising megacities is concerned.

[normal]              
[normal]Business
[normal] as usual is already striving for sustainability as a matt
[normal]er of 
[normal]good 
[normal]commercial sense – witness the myriad bulky devices of 20 years ago that are now in a smart phone in the palm of one’s hand.  The case for drastic deployment of immature and uneconomic 
[normal]energy 
[normal]technologies is not made, and is 
[normal]actually 
[normal]making matt
[normal]ers worse in terms of both carbon emission
[normal] increases
[normal] and economic disrup
[normal]tion where it has been deployed 
[normal]as 
[normal]here in the EU in particular.

[normal]. 
[normal]              
[normal]Any policies that weaken economies will make matters worse and delay any changes that would 
[normal]ameliorate environment
[normal]al damage
[normal].  It was the strength of the UK economy, and not its weakness, that allowed London and other cities to be cleaned up in the 1960s.  The same process will happen in
[normal] the cities of
[normal] China in due course.

[normal]              
[normal]Much less panic by way of response is calle
[normal]d for even if the worst of the IPCC predictions came to pass, but it is 
[normal]much less likely
[normal] that they will, given the scale-back buried in several places in the IPCC 5
[normal]th
[normal] assessment
[normal] of the mean climate sensitivities.
[normal]15.
[normal]              
[normal]The most serious defect of the IPCC 5
[normal]th
[normal] assessment report, as published, was the 
[normal]truculent and 
[normal]obfuscatory
[normal] manner with which it admitted the temperature 
[normal]statis
[normal] since 1996, halved its estimate of the rate of global warming over the last 60 years, and when insisting that it was more certain than 
[normal]ever that man was playing a role, that that role is still small in the context of the last 150 years of climate change.  A scientific report written by neutral consultants would have been much more upfront, yes, and honest, about these facts.
[normal]16.
[normal]              
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]given that the Climate Change Act has the force of law, I would like to see a clearest possible statement of the legal consequences of the implementation of this Act going wrong: who takes legal responsibility if it proves that the expenditure in pursuit o
[normal]f the Climate Chang
[normal]e Act is shown to be ineffective, 
[normal]unnecessary
[normal] or counterproductive?
