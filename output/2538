[normal]So, in this one year alone, each of these 
[normal]925,000
[normal] acts of assistance would have needed to be preceded by a residence test administered by their solicitors
[normal] and verified and checked by the Legal Aid Agency
[normal], before any funding was available.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Community care[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Care leavers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Young people leaving care are entitled to support from social services in many cases which can include 
[normal]accommodation.  They are also entitled to have that support set out in a Pathway Plan.  We act in a large number of cases where the local authority is refusing to accept responsibility for support or has not provided a proper Pathway Plan
[normal].
[normal] A number of thes
[normal]e are set out below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]She was accommodated by social services in February 2012.  Social
[normal] services were well aware of the legislation, namely that she should in fact be accommodated under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, but they deliberately declined to do so, with the intention of avoiding duties to her as a care leaver, despite the obvi
[normal]ous need for it in her case, given the lack of familial support and the role that social services had to play in her childhood.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After extensive negotiations, the local authority conceded without the need to issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RT was left to fend for himself, and ended up being taken in by a landlady who was not able to provide him with appropriate care and support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Two years later we were approached in order to try to ensure that RT was receiving lawful support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This involved
[normal] going over the social services’ records for the preceding two and a half years, to identify what failures had been made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The level of work required was extensive and in no way feasible within an artificially capped limit on costs to be paid.  We were abl
[normal]e to successfully get a lawful support plan and care package in place for RT, in order to move him to an appropriate placement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A charity referred the case to us. We sought to get her support 
[normal]              
[normal]reinstated.  The local authority did not back down and (unsurprisingly) ran a delay argument.  We issued a judicial review, with detailed witness st
[normal]atements from the client, ourselves, and the charity dealing with the delay point.  Permission was refused on the grounds of delay. We renewed, and after a very tough hearing were able to persuade a judge to make an exception from the normal three month ru
[normal]le and grant permission.  The case then subsequently settled very favourably for our client, but in order to secure a favourable settlement, we settled on the basis of no order as to costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no way that a case such as this would be brought in the 
[normal]future if the current judicial review proposals are implemented, as no firm would run the risk of getting knocked out on permission and 
[normal]then 
[normal]not 
[normal]being 
[normal]paid at all, even though the underlying case was good. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Civil merits test – removing legal aid for borde[bold]rline cases[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alternative solutions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Some years ago, the Legal Services Commission   consulted on the possibility of restricting legal aid for judicial review to those firms and organisations that had a demonstrable track record of success and expertise or who had staff who could show this. 
[normal] 
[normal]While it was rejected at the time, the climate may now be right for the introduction of this to ensure that the Court’s time is not wasted by badly prepared applications and legal aid money is not wasted on frivolous applications
[normal]. This would resolve many o
[normal]f the issue the Government has said its proposals are intended to address.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Equality Assessment[bold] in the original consultation paper[bold]              
[normal]We do not recognise the assumptions lying behind th
[normal]e supposed “Impact Assessment”. 
[normal] We estimate that virtually all of our cl
[normal]ients in our recent education judicial review cases have protected characteristics and are vulnerable and some 70% of those in community care cases.  Even where the client does not have a protected characteristic, they are almost invariably  vulnerable as 
[normal]they will be young people who 
[normal]are or 
[normal]have been in care and are nearly always in extremely deprived and difficult circumstances.  
[normal]On the face of it these proposals seem discriminatory in themselves.  
[normal]The proposals on paying for work up to obtaining 
[normal]permission
[normal] would seriously affect their interests as it is highly likely that 
[normal]many
[normal] providers will be extremely reluctant to take on cases other than those that 
[normal]are
[normal] absolutely certain of success, and then only if the amount of work which is carried out, can
[normal] be done at half the current time levels.  In addition, many providers will simply be unable to act pro bono in effect in these cases.  Provision for this group which is already low, wi
[normal]ll
[normal] diminish further as local authorities realise that there is little e
[normal]ffective control over their actions.

[normal]“Habeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to "British subjects." Is it really limited to British nationals? Suffice it to say that the case law has given an emphatic "no" to the question. Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal 
[normal]protection of our laws. There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protection. This principle has been in the law at least since Lord Mansfield freed "the black" in Sommersett's Case (1
[normal]772) 20 St.Tr. 1 . There is nothing here to encourage in the case of aliens or non-patrials the implication of words excluding the judicial review our law normally accords to those whose liberty is infringed.”
