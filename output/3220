[normal]Written evidence submitted by the National Kidney Federation[bold]1.0 [bold]Introduction[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]My name is Nicholas Palmer and I work for the National Kidney Federation (NKF), the leading patient charity in the United Kingdom, as Head of Advocacy
[normal].
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]My role is to support patients and carers individually through advocacy, and 
[normal]collectively by working in partnership with NHS England, the Department of Health and other health related organisations, charities and industry.
[normal] I have a team of Advocacy Officers who cover the UK.
[normal] The NKF use the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group to c
[normal]ommunicate at a political level.
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]In support of my role I am a lay member on NICE (National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence) Guideline Development Groups (GDG’s), currently serving on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) update, and Anaemia Managemen
[normal]t in CKD
[normal];  and 
[normal]also 
[normal]acting as a lay member 
[normal]on the NHS England Clinical Reference Group (CRG) for Renal Transplantation.
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Furthermore, I am a member of the Strategic Clinical Network (Cardiovascular) in Thames Valley, South East Coast and London regions
[normal],
[normal] where I represent the int
[normal]erests of kidney patients, working with clinicians, patients and NHS England to improve the delivery and quality of renal services.
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Individually I am a member of the Guys &amp; St Thomas Kidney Patient Association.
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]After prese
[normal]ntation to the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group on 21st October 2013 
[normal]I have been a
[normal]sked by the NKF Chief Executive 
[normal]and Chairman, to make written representation to the Select 
[normal]Committee on the subject commonly referred to as ‘Bedroom Tax’ (otherwise known
[normal] as ‘under occupancy rules’, ‘spare room subsidy’ or ‘housing benefit reduction’
[normal] 
[normal]).
[normal]2.0 [bold]Objective[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The objective of this submission is to kindly ask that:
[normal]Renal[bold] p[bold]atients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of Housing Benefit are exempted from the ‘Bedro[bold]om Tax’.[bold] More precisely, where those individuals undertaking either Haemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis at home and are currently in receipt of housing benefit, and are using [bold]a [bold]spare room for storage and/or treatment, which would normally attrac[bold]t a reduct[bold]ion in housing benefit,[bold] are exempted from a reduction in their housing benefit.[bold]3.0 [bold]Supporting Statement[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]While some patients with CKD, on dialysis or with a transplant are able to lead normal lives, it is fair to acknowledge that r
[normal]enal patients on bene
[normal]fits are some of the most vulnerable people in 
[normal]our 
[normal]society
[normal] today
[normal]. It is not uncommon for them to have more than one long-term condition; the nature of 
[normal]CKD
[normal] means that many have a severely compromised cardiovascular system, suffer chronic mobility issues often caused by CKD or Diabetes; 
[normal]suffer depression; 
[normal]have hypertension 
[normal]or
[normal] hypotension, can generally be fatigued and suf
[normal]fer from bouts of acute anaemia – many
[normal] are therefore reliant on carers, family, friends and mobility devices to get around. Emotional support for these individuals importantly can also be lacking, and for those living alone the struggle to be 
[normal]heard
[normal] [bold]and 
[normal]battle a benefits system are a step too f
[normal]ar and they become drowned by a system that fails to see their need and recognise their dignity. I know this from the patients I and my Advocacy Team meet and talk to in response to their NKF Helpline calls.
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Many renal patients of a working age have lo
[normal]st their jobs through ill-health or have found a route back into work blocked by a restrictive treatment regime; others have found education or training cut short.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]There are three options for those patients
[normal] who reach Established Renal F
[normal]ailure
[normal] (ERF)
[normal]: 
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Conservative Care
[normal] is for 
[normal]patients, 
[normal]who are generally too frail
[normal],
[normal] and after detailed discussion
[normal]s
[normal] have decided that 
[normal]Dialysis
[normal] and
[normal] a Transplant
[normal] are not for them; Conservative Care 
[normal]event
[normal]ually leads to 
[normal]Palliative C
[normal]are and death. 
[normal] 
[normal]Dialysis and Transplantation are more commonly referred to as Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) an
[normal]d are the 
[normal]only 
[normal]two treatment options 
[normal]which extend the lives of individuals with ERF.
[normal] 
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Notably for some 
[normal]patient’s
[normal] 
[normal]dialysis is the
[normal] only treatment option
[normal] due to existing heart conditions or tissue type sensitivity.
[normal] There are two type of dialysis; Peritoneal 
[normal]Dialysis
[normal] which
[normal] 
[normal]is commonly undertaken at home
[normal]/work four times a day lasting 
[normal]about half an hour
[normal] each time
[normal],
[normal] and Haemodialysis under
[normal]taken within Hospital or ‘Satellite’ units requiring three visits per week with treatment sometimes lasting
[normal] between 4 - 5 hours each time,
[normal] together with travel it is not uncommon to be away from the home eight hours a day.
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]Against this background t
[normal]here is a supported move 
[normal]in the kidney community
[normal] (NKF Home Dialysis Manifesto)
[normal] 
[normal]to enable more patients to undertake
[normal] 
[normal]Home
[normal] 
[normal]Haemodialysis
[normal] (HHD)
[normal],
[normal] collectively
[normal] with Peritoneal Dialysis
[normal] (PD)
[normal] th
[normal]is is
[normal] referred to as
[normal] Home Therap
[normal]y, and
[normal] provide
[normal]s
[normal] an essential option o
[normal]f choice for dialysis patients
[normal] allowing many benefits:
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]There is support from NHS England and through
[normal] five 
[normal]Domains with their outcomes statement we can see that Domains one, two and four are directly related to 
[normal]Home Therapy
[normal]:
[normal]1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely
[normal]2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions
[normal]3 - Helping people to recover from periods of ill health or following injury
[normal]4 - Ensuring that people have a positive experience o
[normal]f care
[normal]5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment; and protecting them from
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]n terms of the Bedroom Tax
[normal],
[normal] it is the Home Therapies patients who are the prime focus
[normal] of this submission
[normal]. However,
[normal] 
[normal]the unfairness of such a tax
[normal] must not be forgo
[normal]tten against the
[normal] financial burdens that many renal patients are under who face further assessments when applying for 
[normal]Employment Support Allowance/Disability Living Allowance and now Personal Independence Payments. 
[normal]3.9
[normal]              
[normal]Benefits allow patients to ‘get by’ t
[normal]o enable a quality of life that many of us take for granted – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ is making that impossible for 
[normal]those
[normal] patients
[normal] affected
[normal] and forcing them to take decisions that will have a negative impact on their long-term health and outcomes such as decidin
[normal]g against having Home Therapy 
[normal](which has been reported widely to the NKF) 
[normal]–
[normal] this is causing 
[normal]actual harm to a choice of modality that we try s
[normal]o hard to encourage and promote; the 
[normal]potential
[normal] damage could be significant.
[normal]3.10
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] NKF
[normal] 
[normal]believe 
[normal]that seeking an 
[normal]exemption 
[normal]for Home Therapy patients is
[normal] a fair ask in light of 
[normal]existing 
[normal]exemptions 
[normal]for foster families, 
[normal]families with adult children awa
[normal]y on duty with the armed forces and severely disabled children.
[normal] We also feel that this is a very small request in light o
[normal]f the numbers affected and t
[normal]he range of benefits that Home T
[normal]herapy brings.
[normal]3.11
[normal]              
[normal]Let us not forget this is a tax on vulnerable people carrying out life-saving treatment in their own home, which can extend their life expectancy and without such treatment wou
[normal]ld be dead within two weeks.
[normal] We also believe that Home Therapy brings unquestionable savings for the ‘national purse’, a 
[normal]turn
[normal] of phrase often used to defend the reasoning for the ‘Bedroom Tax’. 
[normal]The next two sections will look at the benefits of the extra 
[normal]room and 
[normal]could be 
[normal]broadly classed as 
[normal]Health Economics.
[normal]4.0 [bold]Need for room[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The extra room 
[normal](which for HHD are specially adapted) 
[normal]brings 
[normal]benefits
[normal] for the individual patient
[normal] including
[normal]:
[normal]5.0 [bold]Benefits[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]There are many 
[normal]benefits 
[normal]that Home Therapy brings including cost savings, improved clinical outcomes and social benefits 
[normal]all
[normal] described below.
[normal]5.1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Reduced transport cost
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]Patients have a total of six journeys to make each week for 
[normal]hospital-based
[normal] or satellite haemodialysis. There 
[normal]are
[normal] none for HHD and therefore savings can be made. 
[normal]For example at Southend Hospital 2008/09 for 66 patients the total cost of transport to the Trust was £277,000; individually transport costs can be as much as £300 per 
[normal]j
[normal]ourney
[normal]. Patient transport costs which are picked up by each Hospital Trust 
[normal]can be
[normal] erased.
[normal]5.1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Reduced clinical cost
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]It is widely 
[normal]acknowledged
[normal] through research papers
[normal] 
[normal]and by physicians within the kidney community 
[normal]that the need for blood pressure medica
[normal]tion
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]phosphate binders, and 
[normal]anaemia treatment
[normal] 
[normal]can cease
[normal] with improved frequency of haemodialysis at home.
[normal] Hospital in-patient stays are less likely as are infections with the upside being patients are healthier getting more dialysis.
[normal]5.1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Hospital/Satellite capacity increased
[normal] - 
[normal]Home dialysis or home therapy frees-up capacity in satellite or 
[normal]hospital-
[normal]based dialysis units
[normal]. 
[normal]5.1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Cost saving per session of HHD
[normal] –
[normal]I
[normal] 
[normal]t is comparably cheaper after initial outlay
[normal] to have HHD
[normal], no nursing 
[normal]is time inv
[normal]olved and it has been reported that there can be a saving of £25.00 per session.
[normal]5.1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Healthier patients
[normal]Increased dialysis frequency
[normal] 
[normal]allows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.6
[normal]              
[normal]Social benefits
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]Looking
[normal] at all the costs and benefits as a society the best we can do for individual human beings is improve quality of life, reduce mortality and increase life expectancy – Home Therapy does this – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ prevents it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.0 [bold]Challenges[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]There have 
[normal]already been a number of challenges across the country to the ‘Bedroom Tax’ which highlights the dissatisfaction
[normal] felt,
[normal] but also the widely held view that this is a bad 
[normal]policy
[normal] affecting vulnerable individuals who
[normal]se
[normal] 
[normal]existing 
[normal]health problems 
[normal]mean they
[normal] already
[normal] struggle financially.
[normal] 
[normal]The United Nations have voiced their concerns while Local Authorities have taken measures to help people.
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]Westminster
[normal] - 
[normal]A housing association tenant in central London won an appeal against the imposition of the bedroom tax by 
[normal]Wes
[normal]tminster city council - 
[normal]the first such victory in England.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]blind
[normal] man
[normal] argued successfully to a tribunal that a room in his flat classified as a second bedroom had never been used as one and had always been where equipment helping him to lead a normal li
[normal]fe was kept.
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]Glasgow 
[normal]- 
[normal]A judge 
[normal]ruled that housing benefit officials breached the human
[normal] 
[normal]rights of a severely disabled woman after docking her benefits under the 
[normal]‘Bedroom T
[normal]ax
[normal]’
[normal]. The lady
[normal], who has M
[normal]ultiple 
[normal]S
[normal]clerosis and her husband were legally entitled to
[normal] a bedroom each because her condition was so severe she needed a specially adapted bed and bedroom.
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]United Nations
[normal] - 
[normal]The Gove
[normal]rnment's so-called ‘bedroom tax’
[normal] 
[normal]has been described as a 
[normal]"shocking" poli
[normal]cy "m
[normal]y immediate recommendation is th
[normal]at the bedroom tax
[normal] is abolished”, said a UN Inspector invited to the UK by our 
[normal]Government
[normal]. A
[normal] final report will be presented in Geneva to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014.
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]Leeds Council
[normal] - 
[normal]Leeds council has confirmed it will reclassify hundreds of rooms in council houses in a bid to help residents avoid the so-called 
[normal]‘Bedroom T
[normal]ax". Across the city 837 houses will have their bedrooms reclassified as non-specific 'rooms', the council said. Thi
[normal]s will allow residents to avoid their benefits being docked under what the government i
[normal]nsists is a ‘spare room subsidy’
[normal] not a tax.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.0 [bold]D[bold]iscretionary [bold]H[bold]ousing [bold]P[bold]ayment (DHP)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]As an organisation we know individuals can seek DHP to help bridge the shortfal
[normal]l between their reduced housing benefit and cost of rent. However we are aware of a number of negative issues concerning DHP
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]In the DHP guidance produced by the Department for Work &amp; Pensions Local Authorities (LA’s) have the power to give indefinite awards for DHP. The interpretation and use of the policy by LA’s is lacking and as a result the NKF is aware of individuals 
[normal]whose only option is dialysis (for optimal quality of life) being completely unfairly treated. Let us not forget dialysis is carried out in the home in order to secure the best possible care and that this reduces the cost to the 
[normal]‘
[normal]national purse
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] This has 
[normal]been reported to us by Welfare Officers in England who support kidney patients.
[normal] Simply put DHP is not working for our patient community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.0 [bold]Support[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]The NKF has strong links with Renal Social Workers
[normal] (RSW)
[normal] through their chair Bernie Boruch based at
[normal] the Manchester Royal Infirmary and she has forwarded a number of issues reported through the RSW Network
[normal] 
[normal]which offer a supportive case and include
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]NHS England
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] already made a supporting submission in favour of helping kidney patients 
[normal]to 
[normal]have relief/exemption from the ‘Bedroom Tax’
[normal] – this was made by the National Clinical Director for Renal Services, Dr Richard Fluck.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3
[normal]              
[normal]Furthermore the 
[normal]British Kidney Patient Association
[normal] (BKPA)
[normal] has seen an overwhelming demand on their counselling service associated with benefits and ‘Bedroom Tax’ 
[normal]in particular while grants applications have increased. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.0 [bold]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1
[normal]              
[normal]Nationally it has been reported that 
[normal]660,000 people 
[normal]have been affected
[normal] 
[normal]by the ‘Bedroom Tax’ 
[normal]- one third of social sector claimants
[normal]. However i
[normal]n terms of kidney patients we are looking 
[normal]small numbers, 
[normal]30 - 40 cases
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]here is potential harm to the very Home Therapy programme that we are trying to encourage
[normal] though. W
[normal]hile there is a wider crisis
[normal] across many sections of society
[normal] we plead leniency for o
[normal]ur patients wanting or having Home Therapy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.2
[normal]              
[normal]We ask that common sense prospers.
[normal]9.3
[normal]              
[normal]The policy
[normal] is intended to encourage (singles or couples) people to move into smaller properties in order to free up accommodation for larger families. 
[normal] 
[normal]A freedom of inf
[normal]ormation request published in the Independent in August highlighted the general problem of the tax and 
[normal]that 
[normal]96 
[normal]%
[normal] 
[normal]of those affected had nowhere suitable to move to.
[normal]9.4
[normal]              
[normal]In Birmingham 13,557 households were affected but there were only 368 suitable 
[normal]properties; while in Cornwall there were only 65 suitable properties for the 3,300 people eligible to be charged for under occupancy.
[normal]9.5
[normal]              
[normal]There has been insufficient, sustained building of affordable housing through successive governments over the last thi
[normal]rty years
[normal] which deeply flaws the policy to reduce housing benefit because of under occupancy.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.6
[normal]              
[normal]Finally, i
[normal]t cannot be right that some of the country’s most vulnerable people who currently have or are seeking to have treatment that improves their 
[normal]quality of life and costs the country less are effectively penalised financially or prevented from having Home Therapy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.7
[normal]              
[normal]This is simply wrong
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.8
[normal]              
[normal]We are talking about a very discrete group of patients with very specific needs, and I kindly ask that t
[normal]his committee recommend exemption for our specific group of patients from this damaging policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.9
[normal]              
[normal]Many patients who seek Home Therapy may never get the opportunity of freedom that a kidney transplant would bring; Home Therapy brings a freedom of sorts 
[normal]and in no way should it mean that patients face a financial levy for seeking it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.10
[normal]              
[normal]Therefore we kindly ask that renal patients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of housing benefit should be exempt from the ‘Bedroom Tax’.
