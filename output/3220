default              
defaultMy name is Nicholas Palmer and I work for the National Kidney Federation (NKF), the leading patient charity in the United Kingdom, as Head of Advocacy
default.
default1.2
default              
defaultMy role is to support patients and carers individually through advocacy, and 
defaultcollectively by working in partnership with NHS England, the Department of Health and other health related organisations, charities and industry.
default I have a team of Advocacy Officers who cover the UK.
default The NKF use the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group to c
defaultommunicate at a political level.
default1.3
default              
defaultIn support of my role I am a lay member on NICE (National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence) Guideline Development Groups (GDG’s), currently serving on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) update, and Anaemia Managemen
defaultt in CKD
default;  and 
defaultalso 
defaultacting as a lay member 
defaulton the NHS England Clinical Reference Group (CRG) for Renal Transplantation.
default1.4
default              
defaultFurthermore, I am a member of the Strategic Clinical Network (Cardiovascular) in Thames Valley, South East Coast and London regions
default,
default where I represent the int
defaulterests of kidney patients, working with clinicians, patients and NHS England to improve the delivery and quality of renal services.
default1.5
default              
defaultIndividually I am a member of the Guys &amp; St Thomas Kidney Patient Association.
default1.6
default              
defaultAfter prese
defaultntation to the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group on 21st October 2013 
defaultI have been a
defaultsked by the NKF Chief Executive 
defaultand Chairman, to make written representation to the Select 
defaultCommittee on the subject commonly referred to as ‘Bedroom Tax’ (otherwise known
default as ‘under occupancy rules’, ‘spare room subsidy’ or ‘housing benefit reduction’
default 
default).
default2.0 defaultObjectivedefault2.1
default              
defaultThe objective of this submission is to kindly ask that:
defaultRenaldefault pdefaultatients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of Housing Benefit are exempted from the ‘Bedrodefaultom Tax’.default More precisely, where those individuals undertaking either Haemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis at home and are currently in receipt of housing benefit, and are using defaulta defaultspare room for storage and/or treatment, which would normally attracdefaultt a reductdefaultion in housing benefit,default are exempted from a reduction in their housing benefit.default3.0 defaultSupporting Statementdefault3.1
default              
defaultWhile some patients with CKD, on dialysis or with a transplant are able to lead normal lives, it is fair to acknowledge that r
defaultenal patients on bene
defaultfits are some of the most vulnerable people in 
defaultour 
defaultsociety
default today
default. It is not uncommon for them to have more than one long-term condition; the nature of 
defaultCKD
default means that many have a severely compromised cardiovascular system, suffer chronic mobility issues often caused by CKD or Diabetes; 
defaultsuffer depression; 
defaulthave hypertension 
defaultor
default hypotension, can generally be fatigued and suf
defaultfer from bouts of acute anaemia – many
default are therefore reliant on carers, family, friends and mobility devices to get around. Emotional support for these individuals importantly can also be lacking, and for those living alone the struggle to be 
defaultheard
default defaultand 
defaultbattle a benefits system are a step too f
defaultar and they become drowned by a system that fails to see their need and recognise their dignity. I know this from the patients I and my Advocacy Team meet and talk to in response to their NKF Helpline calls.
default3.2
default              
defaultMany renal patients of a working age have lo
defaultst their jobs through ill-health or have found a route back into work blocked by a restrictive treatment regime; others have found education or training cut short.
default 
default 
defaultThere are three options for those patients
default who reach Established Renal F
defaultailure
default (ERF)
default: 
default3.4
default              
defaultConservative Care
default is for 
defaultpatients, 
defaultwho are generally too frail
default,
default and after detailed discussion
defaults
default have decided that 
defaultDialysis
default and
default a Transplant
default are not for them; Conservative Care 
defaultevent
defaultually leads to 
defaultPalliative C
defaultare and death. 
default 
defaultDialysis and Transplantation are more commonly referred to as Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) an
defaultd are the 
defaultonly 
defaulttwo treatment options 
defaultwhich extend the lives of individuals with ERF.
default 
default3.5
default              
defaultNotably for some 
defaultpatient’s
default 
defaultdialysis is the
default only treatment option
default due to existing heart conditions or tissue type sensitivity.
default There are two type of dialysis; Peritoneal 
defaultDialysis
default which
default 
defaultis commonly undertaken at home
default/work four times a day lasting 
defaultabout half an hour
default each time
default,
default and Haemodialysis under
defaulttaken within Hospital or ‘Satellite’ units requiring three visits per week with treatment sometimes lasting
default between 4 - 5 hours each time,
default together with travel it is not uncommon to be away from the home eight hours a day.
default3.6
default              
defaultAgainst this background t
defaulthere is a supported move 
defaultin the kidney community
default (NKF Home Dialysis Manifesto)
default 
defaultto enable more patients to undertake
default 
defaultHome
default 
defaultHaemodialysis
default (HHD)
default,
default collectively
default with Peritoneal Dialysis
default (PD)
default th
defaultis is
default referred to as
default Home Therap
defaulty, and
default provide
defaults
default an essential option o
defaultf choice for dialysis patients
default allowing many benefits:
default3.7
default              
defaultThere is support from NHS England and through
default five 
defaultDomains with their outcomes statement we can see that Domains one, two and four are directly related to 
defaultHome Therapy
default:
default1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely
default2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions
default3 - Helping people to recover from periods of ill health or following injury
default4 - Ensuring that people have a positive experience o
defaultf care
default5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment; and protecting them from

default              
defaultI
defaultn terms of the Bedroom Tax
default,
default it is the Home Therapies patients who are the prime focus
default of this submission
default. However,
default 
defaultthe unfairness of such a tax
default must not be forgo
defaulttten against the
default financial burdens that many renal patients are under who face further assessments when applying for 
defaultEmployment Support Allowance/Disability Living Allowance and now Personal Independence Payments. 
default3.9
default              
defaultBenefits allow patients to ‘get by’ t
defaulto enable a quality of life that many of us take for granted – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ is making that impossible for 
defaultthose
default patients
default affected
default and forcing them to take decisions that will have a negative impact on their long-term health and outcomes such as decidin
defaultg against having Home Therapy 
default(which has been reported widely to the NKF) 
default–
default this is causing 
defaultactual harm to a choice of modality that we try s
defaulto hard to encourage and promote; the 
defaultpotential
default damage could be significant.
default3.10
default              
defaultThe
default NKF
default 
defaultbelieve 
defaultthat seeking an 
defaultexemption 
defaultfor Home Therapy patients is
default a fair ask in light of 
defaultexisting 
defaultexemptions 
defaultfor foster families, 
defaultfamilies with adult children awa
defaulty on duty with the armed forces and severely disabled children.
default We also feel that this is a very small request in light o
defaultf the numbers affected and t
defaulthe range of benefits that Home T
defaultherapy brings.
default3.11
default              
defaultLet us not forget this is a tax on vulnerable people carrying out life-saving treatment in their own home, which can extend their life expectancy and without such treatment wou
defaultld be dead within two weeks.
default We also believe that Home Therapy brings unquestionable savings for the ‘national purse’, a 
defaultturn
default of phrase often used to defend the reasoning for the ‘Bedroom Tax’. 
defaultThe next two sections will look at the benefits of the extra 
defaultroom and 
defaultcould be 
defaultbroadly classed as 
defaultHealth Economics.
default4.0 defaultNeed for roomdefault4.1
default              
defaultThe extra room 
default(which for HHD are specially adapted) 
defaultbrings 
defaultbenefits
default for the individual patient
default including
default:
default5.0 defaultBenefitsdefault5.1
default              
defaultThere are many 
defaultbenefits 
defaultthat Home Therapy brings including cost savings, improved clinical outcomes and social benefits 
defaultall
default described below.
default5.1.1
default              
defaultReduced transport cost
defaults
default 
default–
default 
defaultPatients have a total of six journeys to make each week for 
defaulthospital-based
default or satellite haemodialysis. There 
defaultare
default none for HHD and therefore savings can be made. 
defaultFor example at Southend Hospital 2008/09 for 66 patients the total cost of transport to the Trust was £277,000; individually transport costs can be as much as £300 per 
defaultj
defaultourney
default. Patient transport costs which are picked up by each Hospital Trust 
defaultcan be
default erased.
default5.1.2
default              
defaultReduced clinical cost
defaults
default 
default–
default 
defaultIt is widely 
defaultacknowledged
default through research papers
default 
defaultand by physicians within the kidney community 
defaultthat the need for blood pressure medica
defaulttion
default,
default 
defaultphosphate binders, and 
defaultanaemia treatment
default 
defaultcan cease
default with improved frequency of haemodialysis at home.
default Hospital in-patient stays are less likely as are infections with the upside being patients are healthier getting more dialysis.
default5.1.3
default              
defaultHospital/Satellite capacity increased
default - 
defaultHome dialysis or home therapy frees-up capacity in satellite or 
defaulthospital-
defaultbased dialysis units
default. 
default5.1.4
default              
defaultCost saving per session of HHD
default –
defaultI
default 
defaultt is comparably cheaper after initial outlay
default to have HHD
default, no nursing 
defaultis time inv
defaultolved and it has been reported that there can be a saving of £25.00 per session.
default5.1.5
default              
defaultHealthier patients
defaultIncreased dialysis frequency
default 
defaultallows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.6
default              
defaultSocial benefits
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultLooking
default at all the costs and benefits as a society the best we can do for individual human beings is improve quality of life, reduce mortality and increase life expectancy – Home Therapy does this – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ prevents it.
default&#xa0;
default6.0 defaultChallengesdefault&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultThere have 
defaultalready been a number of challenges across the country to the ‘Bedroom Tax’ which highlights the dissatisfaction
default felt,
default but also the widely held view that this is a bad 
defaultpolicy
default affecting vulnerable individuals who
defaultse
default 
defaultexisting 
defaulthealth problems 
defaultmean they
default already
default struggle financially.
default 
defaultThe United Nations have voiced their concerns while Local Authorities have taken measures to help people.
default6.2
default              
defaultWestminster
default - 
defaultA housing association tenant in central London won an appeal against the imposition of the bedroom tax by 
defaultWes
defaulttminster city council - 
defaultthe first such victory in England.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultblind
default man
default argued successfully to a tribunal that a room in his flat classified as a second bedroom had never been used as one and had always been where equipment helping him to lead a normal li
defaultfe was kept.
default6.3
default              
defaultGlasgow 
default- 
defaultA judge 
defaultruled that housing benefit officials breached the human
default 
defaultrights of a severely disabled woman after docking her benefits under the 
default‘Bedroom T
defaultax
default’
default. The lady
default, who has M
defaultultiple 
defaultS
defaultclerosis and her husband were legally entitled to
default a bedroom each because her condition was so severe she needed a specially adapted bed and bedroom.
default6.4
default              
defaultUnited Nations
default - 
defaultThe Gove
defaultrnment's so-called ‘bedroom tax’
default 
defaulthas been described as a 
default"shocking" poli
defaultcy "m
defaulty immediate recommendation is th
defaultat the bedroom tax
default is abolished”, said a UN Inspector invited to the UK by our 
defaultGovernment
default. A
default final report will be presented in Geneva to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014.
default6.5
default              
defaultLeeds Council
default - 
defaultLeeds council has confirmed it will reclassify hundreds of rooms in council houses in a bid to help residents avoid the so-called 
default‘Bedroom T
defaultax". Across the city 837 houses will have their bedrooms reclassified as non-specific 'rooms', the council said. Thi
defaults will allow residents to avoid their benefits being docked under what the government i
defaultnsists is a ‘spare room subsidy’
default not a tax.
default&#xa0;
default7.0 defaultDdefaultiscretionary defaultHdefaultousing defaultPdefaultayment (DHP)default&#xa0;default7.1
default              
defaultAs an organisation we know individuals can seek DHP to help bridge the shortfal
defaultl between their reduced housing benefit and cost of rent. However we are aware of a number of negative issues concerning DHP
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultIn the DHP guidance produced by the Department for Work &amp; Pensions Local Authorities (LA’s) have the power to give indefinite awards for DHP. The interpretation and use of the policy by LA’s is lacking and as a result the NKF is aware of individuals 
defaultwhose only option is dialysis (for optimal quality of life) being completely unfairly treated. Let us not forget dialysis is carried out in the home in order to secure the best possible care and that this reduces the cost to the 
default‘
defaultnational purse
default’
default.
default This has 
defaultbeen reported to us by Welfare Officers in England who support kidney patients.
default Simply put DHP is not working for our patient community.
default&#xa0;
default8.0 defaultSupportdefault&#xa0;default8.1
default              
defaultThe NKF has strong links with Renal Social Workers
default (RSW)
default through their chair Bernie Boruch based at
default the Manchester Royal Infirmary and she has forwarded a number of issues reported through the RSW Network
default 
defaultwhich offer a supportive case and include
default:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultNHS England
default 
defaulthas
default already made a supporting submission in favour of helping kidney patients 
defaultto 
defaulthave relief/exemption from the ‘Bedroom Tax’
default – this was made by the National Clinical Director for Renal Services, Dr Richard Fluck.
default&#xa0;
default8.3
default              
defaultFurthermore the 
defaultBritish Kidney Patient Association
default (BKPA)
default has seen an overwhelming demand on their counselling service associated with benefits and ‘Bedroom Tax’ 
defaultin particular while grants applications have increased. 
default&#xa0;default9.0 defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
default9.1
default              
defaultNationally it has been reported that 
default660,000 people 
defaulthave been affected
default 
defaultby the ‘Bedroom Tax’ 
default- one third of social sector claimants
default. However i
defaultn terms of kidney patients we are looking 
defaultsmall numbers, 
default30 - 40 cases
default,
default 
defaultt
defaulthere is potential harm to the very Home Therapy programme that we are trying to encourage
default though. W
defaulthile there is a wider crisis
default across many sections of society
default we plead leniency for o
defaultur patients wanting or having Home Therapy
default.
default&#xa0;default9.2
default              
defaultWe ask that common sense prospers.
default9.3
default              
defaultThe policy
default is intended to encourage (singles or couples) people to move into smaller properties in order to free up accommodation for larger families. 
default 
defaultA freedom of inf
defaultormation request published in the Independent in August highlighted the general problem of the tax and 
defaultthat 
default96 
default%
default 
defaultof those affected had nowhere suitable to move to.
default9.4
default              
defaultIn Birmingham 13,557 households were affected but there were only 368 suitable 
defaultproperties; while in Cornwall there were only 65 suitable properties for the 3,300 people eligible to be charged for under occupancy.
default9.5
default              
defaultThere has been insufficient, sustained building of affordable housing through successive governments over the last thi
defaultrty years
default which deeply flaws the policy to reduce housing benefit because of under occupancy.
default 
default&#xa0;default9.6
default              
defaultFinally, i
defaultt cannot be right that some of the country’s most vulnerable people who currently have or are seeking to have treatment that improves their 
defaultquality of life and costs the country less are effectively penalised financially or prevented from having Home Therapy.
default&#xa0;
default9.7
default              
defaultThis is simply wrong
default.
default&#xa0;
default9.8
default              
defaultWe are talking about a very discrete group of patients with very specific needs, and I kindly ask that t
defaulthis committee recommend exemption for our specific group of patients from this damaging policy. 
default&#xa0;
default9.9
default              
defaultMany patients who seek Home Therapy may never get the opportunity of freedom that a kidney transplant would bring; Home Therapy brings a freedom of sorts 
defaultand in no way should it mean that patients face a financial levy for seeking it.
default&#xa0;
default9.10
default              
defaultTherefore we kindly ask that renal patients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of housing benefit should be exempt from the ‘Bedroom Tax’.
