"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nPolice Federation of England and Wales\n [PCC Progress \n20\n]\n&#xa0;\nIn response to your request for evidence on the progress to date of Police and Crime\nCommissioners, the Police Federation consulted with representatives in Joint Branch Boards. The information that I am supplying is the output of that consultation, rather than a statement of policy. \n&#xa0;\nThe key messages that emerge from this consultation are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI would welcome your comments on the findings.\n \n&#xa0;\nSteve Williams\nChair, Police Federation of England and Wales\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Main submission&#xa0;\n1. \nIn order to gather information relevant to the Home Affairs Committee’s Inquiry on Police and Crime Commissioners, (PCCs), a number of telephone interviews were held with Joint Branch Board Chairs and Secretaries across England and Wales. The following information demonstrates the experiences of Police Federation\n \nrepresentatives. \n&#xa0;\nHeadline findings: 2. Experiences range from excellent, “a breath of fresh air”, to the opposite end of the spectrum. In some cases the change from the Police Authority to PCC was seen as minimal, “a change from cream to magnolia”. In others, the PCC was seen as being much more intrusive than the Police Authority had been, with meetings that previously the Chief Constable would have chaired now being jointly chaired by the Chief Constable and PCC. Where concerns were expressed about the PCCs, this was most commonly related to interference in operational matters. \n&#xa0;\n3. The variation is largely attributed to the nature of the PCC role, being vested in a single individual. Hence one person’s motivation and willingness to engage in meaningful working relationships can have a disproportionate impact. Further, the size of the role was seen by some interviewees as being overwhelming. “The PCC means well, and wants to do the right thing, but the remit of the job is huge and he is pulled in different directions”. \n&#xa0;\n4. Police Federation representatives felt some of the topics for which PCCs are being held at least partially responsible are unfair: for example they felt PCCs could have little impact on crime reduction, especially in the current climate of austerity. \n&#xa0;\n5. The political nature of the role was seen as impacting to some extent in several ways. These included a feeling that the precept would not be increased in election years whether it needed to be, or not (impacting on operational policing); sticking to the party line on issues; and in some cases impacting on perceived willingness to collaborate with neighbouring forces whose PCC was of a different political party. \n&#xa0;\n6. There were reports of PCCs interfering in operational matters that were outside their remit. (Specific examples were given, but have not been included here, to maintain anonymity). The division between Chief Constables’ powers and those of PCCs is interpreted differently in different forces, suggesting this may need to be more robustly defined. Further, press reporting that refers to both Chief Constables and PCCs as “the Police Chief” is believed to blur the distinction in the minds of the public, which leads to confusion over accountability.\n&#xa0;\n7. While there are some PCCs who endeavour to communicate what they are doing and achieve, there was a general feeling that accountability and transparency have been reduced with the move to PCCs. There was a lack of visibility of the Police and Crime Panel. There was also a perception that despite expenditure on PCCs there has been as best no significant improvement over the Police Authorities, and at worst a decline in what is being achieved. \n&#xa0;\nEffectiveness &#xa0;\n8. Generally where the PCC had established a good working relationship with interviewees and other members of the police community the overall view was reasonably positive. Some interviewees reported meeting regularly with the PCC, both on a formal and informal basis. Some reported that the PCC had listened and acted on their advice, and gave specific examples where this had benefited the service. Where PCCs had not been willing to engage broadly, there were reports of what were believed to be errors of judgement that in some cases had had significant press coverage. Being interested and approachable were seen as positive factors that made the PCCs more effective generally. \n&#xa0;\n9. Overall, interviewees’ opinions ranged from “our experience has been only positive” to those who felt the PCC had been inappropriately intrusive on operational policing matters on at least some occasions. It was felt that there was no joined up approach to the way PCCs were working. Even where the comments about the local PCC were favourable, it was generally commented that there had been no significant improvement over the Police Authority, and yet a substantial amount of money had been spent on changing the system. \n&#xa0;\n10. A number of references were made to the political role of the PCC. Specific examples of how this was believed to impact on budget setting and choices of contractors, etc. were given. The view was expressed that there had been a (limited) public backlash against the political nature of the role, and that was why so many independent candidates had been elected. It was felt that people had chosen the “least bad” of the options. Those PCCs who were openly aiming for, or were believed to be aiming for, higher political positions were seen as more likely to be making decisions based on political interests. \n&#xa0;\n11. Where the PCCs had prior experience of either being a member of the Police Authority or of serving as an officer, this was often helpful, in that they had a clearer understanding of what would be feasible and were better able to make sound decisions early in the job. However this was not exclusively the case: examples were provided that suggest that some PCCs with prior experience found it difficult to let go of the reins of previous roles, and this caused an issue in terms of boundaries between operational policing and the PCC. \n&#xa0;\n12. \nCrime reduction: none of the respondents believed the PCCs had an impact on crime reduction, although some said they might potentially: it would be hard to see where they had specific impact, rather than effects being down to other factors. Some felt it was unfair to hold them to account for crime reduction, as reduced budgets might be a confounding factor. \n&#xa0;\n13. \nEffective police service: some interviewees reported their PCC was initially unhelpful in providing an effective police service, but over time and by gaining experience had become helpful. There were reports of PCCs stopping actions that had previously been effective (for example, discontinuing previously successful force collaborations) and choosing to do something different in the first few months, then retracting this and returning to previous mechanisms. Some interviewees noted that while their PCC could champion effectiveness, overall effectiveness was more to do with operational policing and the role of the Chief Constable. The role of the PCC was seen as more to do with saving money than with making the force effective. \n&#xa0;\n14. Several interviewees believed that the ways in which PCCs attempted to address force effectiveness were governed by the political nature of the role. For example, there were concerns that choices over strategic partners were related to political affiliations, and that prior to election PCCs had chosen outsourcing that would secure their nominations. \n&#xa0;\n15. \nPromoting local policing priorities: the degree to which the PCCs effectively promoted local policing priorities was related to their individual communication style. Those who tended to use social media such as Twitter to engage were seen as actively \ntrying to champion local policing. Likewise, where the PCC had been successful in using the local media this was seen as a positive. \n&#xa0;\n16. Some PCCs had developed particular policing interests, such as in domestic violence, and had set up community forums and consultations. This was seen as a positive measure. \n&#xa0;\n17. Conversely, some interviewees felt that the move to PCCs had negatively impacted on local policing and accountability, because where the PCC was not from a particular locality he had not understood local needs. For example, in some forces where there were both city and rural communities it was felt that the PCC had better appreciated the needs of the community from which he came, and in some cases had made decisions that served them better. This was contrasted with Police Authorities, whose make up was perceived to have enhanced local representation. \n&#xa0;\n18. \nHolding Chief Constables to account: with regard to PCCs’ ability to hold the Chief Constable to account, in general interviewees felt that they did not have visibility of this. Several stated that they had no reason to believe the PCC had had to do this over the last year. Where the general working relationship with the PCC was good, there was a confidence that he would be willing to address any issues with the Chief Constable. There were exceptions, and in particular it was felt that in some cases it had taken significant time for the relationship between the PCC and Chief Constable to settle down. There was a feeling that initially some PCCs had been interfered in matters that were the remit of the Chief Constable, and that this had caused initial conflict. It was stated that they had had to negotiate their terms of reference. \n&#xa0;\n19. \nSetting budgets and precepts: the PCCs’ impact on the effectiveness of setting budgets and precepts was believed to be limited. Force Heads of Finance were, in many cases, believed to have carried on business as usual. There were some concerns that PCCs would increase the precept in the middle years of their term, and would not be willing to do so in election years. In this way it was believed that operational policing might be affected by the demands of the political system. \n&#xa0;\n20. \nCollaboration agreements: most respondents felt that reasonable collaboration activities had been set up prior to the introduction of PCCs. For example, forces collaborated on specialisms such as firearms and dog handlers, and professional standards. For the most part, these were continuing as usual, and the PCC was supportive. There was concern in a small number of cases that the PCC had taken retrograde steps by pulling away from these collaborations initially, and that as a result some momentum had been lost. There was also concern that some decisions over partnering within local councils might have been influenced during the election phase by individuals’ need to secure candidacy. In some cases, although the PCC was seen as broadly very supportive of better partnering and collaboration, there was little visibility over whether the PCC was directly responsible for changes made, or whether in fact decisions were led by the force Head of Accounts, or Chief Constable. \n&#xa0;\nTransparency and Accountability &#xa0;\n21. Division of functions PCC and Chief Constable: the division between operational policing and non-operational matters appeared to be ill-defined. This has led to numerous examples of PCCs being seen as inferring with operational policing. Examples were given by respondents, but these have not been reported in full here for \nreasons of anonymity. While in some cases the PCC was perceived to have exceeded his remit intentionally, in several others it was perceived to be unintentional, and simply a function of the lack of clarity. There were several cases where the PCC was believed to have initially become involved in operational policing, but had receded from that position after some discussion with the Chief Constable. \n&#xa0;\n22. \nPolice and Crime Panels: In general, these were not seen to be effective. Visibility of their actions was poor. \n&#xa0;\n23. Some respondents noted that the Police and Crime Panel did not seem comfortable that they had the authority to do what they were supposed to. It was reported that members of some panels had resigned, when they realised they did not have the power they thought, and were unable to hold the PCC to account. In particular, the issue of the Police and Crime Panel being unable to influence appointments made by the PCC was raised. It was also reported that the Panel could only veto precepts once, and that as a result PCCs might play the system by initially asking for more than they needed. \n&#xa0;\n24. The view that the PCCs can be held to account to much less degree than the Chief Constable was expressed, with the Chief Constable being relatively easy to dismiss. Some respondents felt that the PCCs would only be held to account when the next elections are held. Respondents stated that they were unaware of any specific process by which PCCs could be held to account centrally (e.g. by the Home Office) and that although the Home Affairs Committee could hold them to account this was likely only to be as a matter of last resort. \n&#xa0;\n25. \nTransparency of and reporting by PCC: there appeared to be no formal or recommended process for PCCs to achieve transparency and accountability. As a result, the differences between individuals’ communications styles made for stark contrasts in the degree to which transparency was believed to have been achieved. \n&#xa0;\n26. In some cases, PCCs had made efforts to update people regularly using Twitter and / or blogs to do so. In others, there had been an initial set of blog messages, and then no updates for several months. The fact that officers could not see what some PCCs were doing meant that they felt there was no evidence of what the PCC did. \n&#xa0;\n27. At one extreme it was reported that the PCC had best been held to account by the local media, who had shown a lot of interest. At the other, respondents stated that the PCC had an “open door” policy for the Federation representative, which ensured that they, at least, felt they knew what was happening. \n&#xa0;\n28. Overall, the message that emerges is that the effectiveness of the PCCs has been patchy. Factors that influence this include the PCCs’ working and communications styles, their prior experiences, (e.g. of Police Authorities, and of local issues) and their political ambitions. The fact that the role is vested in a single individual means that any problems are not tempered in the way that they might be if there were a number of accountable individuals. The lack of clarity over the demarcation between the PCC and Chief Constable role is perceived to have caused problems. There is a perceived lack of transparency in some but not all areas. The Police and Crime Panels were not believed to have the proper powers to fulfil their role. \nPolice Federation of England and Wales\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
