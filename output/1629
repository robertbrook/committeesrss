[normal]is the voice of Britain at work. Our overall objectives are to raise the quality of working life and promote 
[normal]equality for all.
[normal] 
[normal]Th
[normal]is TUC response has been drafted in consultation with the 
[normal]Clean Coal Task Group (CCTG)
[normal], a
[normal] joint energy industry
[normal]/TUC 
[normal]body formed to promote clean coal technologies within the UK. Its terms of reference are: “To identify an appropriate po

[normal]”
[normal]Executive summary[bold]RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS[bold]Wha[bold]t types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? [bold]CCS technologies are being developed for both the power and industrial sectors
[normal]. The
[normal] most cost effective route map for CCS lies in the deployment of regional CCS capture networks
[normal] for power and industry
[normal] 
[normal]in the UK’s industrial heartlands, such as the 
[normal]Aire
[normal] Valley, and in cluster
[normal] initiatives such as the North E
[normal]ast Process Industri
[normal]es (NEPIC) p
[normal]roject
[normal],
[normal] focussed on petrochemical
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]The power sector leads CCS technology development, principally through well understood and developed processes – pre-and post-combustion and oxy-fuel technologies. 
[normal]The current CCS commercialisation programme is focussed 
[normal]on two options: at Peterhead, Scotland, a 
[normal]full-scale gas 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]project
[normal], potentially capturing 
[normal]a million 
[normal]tonnes 
[normal] 
[normal]of CO2
[normal] 
[normal] annually; 
[normal]and the 
[normal]426MWe White Rose demonstration project at 
[normal]Drax
[normal]. 
[normal]Oxyfuel
[normal] 
[normal]technology
[normal] has been developed in Europe by 
[normal]Alstom
[normal] and in the UK
[normal] by 
[normal]Doosan
[normal] Babcock and 
[normal]can be applied to both 
[normal]n
[normal]ew and 
[normal]retrofit
[normal]ted installations.
[normal] 
[normal]There are other full scale projects, such as 2Co Energy’s Don Valley project, in South Yorkshire, proceeding in parallel with the commercialisation programme that intend to ap
[normal]ply for a 
[normal]Final Investment Decision (
[normal]FID
[normal])
[normal] enabling 
[normal]Contract for Difference (
[normal]CfD
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]In the power sector, one of the three main ways in which greenhouse gas emissions from industrial heat demand can be reduced
[normal] are 
[normal]energy efficiency, fuel switching, and indust
[normal]rial CCS. 
[normal]As the DECC 
[normal]Heat Strategy
[normal] acknowledges, industrial CCS could be a key technology for the decarbonisation of industry sector, potentially allowing energy intensive industries to continue using fossil fuels while significantly reducing emissions. 
[normal]Much 
[normal]long-term industrial abatement potential lies in CCS technology
[normal] in i
[normal]ndustries which emit carbon from manufacturing process
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]- 
[normal]iron and steel, cement, oil refining and chemicals.
[normal]The TUC concurs with this view of the importance of industrial CCS. In 
[normal]an increasingly carbon constrained world, considerable first mover advantages are available from the early development of industry CCS. As DECC points out, industrial facilities which are located close to other industries or power stations and storage site
[normal]s are more likely to be able to implement CCS if they can share transport and storage infrastructure.
[normal] 
[normal]Industrial sectors need to develop and trial a range of capture technologies, for example:
[normal]Whilst we welc
[normal]ome the heat strategy, the TUC is concerned at the pace and scale of government support for industrial CCS. Rather than industrial and power CCS technologies developing in parallel, they appear to be moving forward in sequence. For example, there is no ind
[normal]ustrial mechanism in the Energy Bill to incentivise industrial CCS.
[normal]What contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?[bold]CCS contribution: a[bold]dvice from the Committee on Cl[bold]imate Change[bold]T
[normal]he Committee on Climate Change 
[normal](CCC) 
[normal]estimates
[normal] that the UK’s decarbonising power sector will require 
[normal]approximately 18-20GW of CCS for coal and gas by 2030.
[normal]The 
[normal]government’s independent advice from the 
[normal]CCC
[normal] provides an energy 
[normal]scenario 
[normal]to reach the UK’s 2030 energy decarbonisation target. The 
[normal]power sector currently accounts for around 25% of UK greenhouse gas emissions. 
[normal]An indicative generation mix to achieve 
[normal]a carbon intensity of 50-100g/KWh by
[normal] 2030 is 40% nuclear, 40% renewable, 15% CC
[normal]S, and around 5% unabated gas-fired generation. 
[normal]With 
[normal]power generation capacity of about 12
[normal]5
[normal]GW by 2030, 
[normal]this 
[normal]equate
[normal]s
[normal] to 18
[normal]-20
[normal]GW of CCS for coal and ga
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]Given the long lead times for major infrastructure projects such as these, and the fact none has yet ma
[normal]de its final investment decision, the UK needs to move swiftly if it is to have a realistic chance of achieving this target.
[normal]The 
[normal]CCC’s 
[normal]p
[normal]ower sector scenario for the 
[normal]F
[normal]ourth 
[normal]C
[normal]arbon 
[normal]B
[normal]udget was designed to develop a portfolio of low-carbon technology options, 
[normal]and includes cost-effective investment in mature low-carbon technologies together with investment in less mature technologies required to support learning and innovation.
[normal] The CC conclude that:
[normal] “The current proposal to support four CCS power generation proj
[normal]ects (in the Coalition Agreement, reconfirmed in the 2010 Spending Review), would result in a critical mass for potential roll-out from the early 2020s. It is important that a funding mechanism for the four projects is finalised and that these are tendered
[normal] in 2011 to facilitate early deployment
[normal].”
[normal]The CCC estimates that 
[normal]the power sector will capture a larger amount of CO2 per year than industry up until 2040, from when power and industry are projected to capture similar quantities annually
[normal]. 
[normal]They state that:
[normal] 
[normal]“There is a growing role for CCS in industry through the 2020s, which by 2030 reduces emissions by around 5 MtCO2....
[normal] 
[normal]To ensure that this technology is available for deployment from the 2020s, a policy approach is required which either funds demonstration
[normal], or ensures that demonstration elsewhere (e.g. under the EU’s CCS demonstration programme) will provide scope for timely deployment in the UK.”
[normal]CO2 Sense – regional CCS infrastructure[bold]From a regional perspective, 
[normal]a study by CO2 Sense of 
[normal]The national, regi
[normal]onal and local economic benefits of the Yorkshire and Humber carbon capture and storage cluster
[normal] shows that 
[normal]the successful development of a regional CCS infrastructure 
[normal]in the 
[normal]Aire
[normal] Valley
[normal] 
[normal]could capture 
[normal]approximately 60
[normal] 
[normal]million tonnes 
[normal]of carbon emissions 
[normal]pe
[normal]r year 
[normal]from power and industry
[normal] sources. The initial ‘core’ cluster 
[normal]would 
[normal]act as a catalyst for the establishment of a wider cluster. The core cluster consists of three elements:
[normal]However, 
[normal]the 
[normal]2Co
[normal] 
[normal]project was not shortlisted under the commercialisation programme, even though 
[normal]rank
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]first
[normal] in Europe under the NER300 programme
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]among the 
[normal]top ten global CCS project
[normal]s
[normal] by 
[normal]Bloomberg New Energy Finance
[normal]. To incentivise 
[normal]such 
[normal]CCS investments outside the scope of the commercialisation programme, the government will need to ensure 
[normal]the enabling Contract for Difference for CCS includes appropriate risk sharing for early projects
[normal]. It will also need to provide
[normal] sufficient capacity in the Levy Control Framework to 2020 for CCS capital investment.
[normal]T[bold]he UK Government’s expectations[bold]The Coalition agreement said: “We will continue public sector investment in carbon capture and storage (CC
[normal]S) technology for four coal-fired power stations.” But current ambitions for the CCS commercialisation programme 
[normal]will
[normal] reduce to “up to two projects” receiving final approval
[normal], according to DECC comments
[normal], and possibly only a single project
[normal].
[normal]The government
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]CCS R
[normal]oadmap
[normal] 
[normal](2012) 
[normal]does not provide 
[normal]targets for 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]deployment. 
[normal]Instead, 
[normal]it provides the plain statements of fact that the 
[normal]potential CCS storage capacity of the North Sea basin
[normal] is huge
[normal]; and 
[normal]that 
[normal]CCS technology is 
[normal]“
[normal]currently the only means by which fossil 
[normal]fuels can be maintained within the UK generation mix, whilst meeting our 2050 carbon targets.
[normal]” 
[normal]From the TUC’s perspective CCS is at a critical stage. The Coalition’s initial ambition of four CCS demonstration projects would appear to meet the minimum requ
[normal]irement recommended by the CCC. The
[normal] TUC therefore believe the
[normal] government needs to immediately return to its initial ambition for four CCS demonstration projects, and 
[normal]ensure these can be incentivised quickly through the Final Investment Decision enabling Co
[normal]ntracts for Difference (
[normal]CfD
[normal]) that should be available from the end of 2013. It needs to ensure that measures in the Energy Bill incentivise further power sector CCS projects under the 
[normal]CfD
[normal] process.
[normal] 
[normal]Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to [bold]export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?[bold]Yes. 
[normal]DECC acknowledges that C
[normal]CS represents a major green growth opportunity for the UK
[normal] stating that “
[normal]If CCS opportunities develop as anticipated, bene
[normal]fits for UK-based firms have been estimated to be between £3 - 6.5 billion a year by the late 2020s
[normal].”
[normal]However, the government has not developed a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and social benefits of CCS. The TUC believes that such researc
[normal]h would strengthen the case for CCS deployment.
[normal]DECC envisages 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCS Commercialisation Programme 
[normal](launched in April 2012
[normal])
[normal] as supporting “
[normal]a strong and robust supply chain in the UK, creating jobs and markets locally and nationally to serve the early CCS p
[normal]lant and later clusters of CCS activity. Playing to the UK’s business strengths and favouring projects clustering in regions reflects the Government’s ambition to capture opportunities for ‘
[normal]green 
[normal]jobs’ that will arise from an emerging market for CCS, and r
[normal]ecognises the concerns of UK industry about the development of CCS infrastructure.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the UK, 
[normal]the 
[normal]CO2 Sense 
[normal]study (see above) revealed that t
[normal]he Yorkshire and Humber
[normal] CCS cluster 
[normal] 
[normal]ha
[normal]s
[normal] the potential to generate, both directly and indirectly, an economic i
[normal]mpact totalling some £1.255 billion up to 2030
[normal]. Economic benefits are 
[normal]greatest during the overlap between construction and operation
[normal] 
[normal]in 2017 
[normal]when 
[normal]least 6,000
[normal] net additional FTE jobs and £245m net
[normal] 
[normal]additional GVA 
[normal]are realised
[normal]. 
[normal]Its long-term 
[normal]regional 
[normal]economic impact by 2050 
[normal]could exceed
[normal] £26 billion - sustaining and creating thousands of jobs across Yorkshire and the Humber.

[normal]Th
[normal]e development of CCS clusters/networks – enabling industrial sectors to link in to pre-existing transport and 
[normal]storage infrastructure - will ensure cost-effective decarbonisation of industrial sectors. This is particularly important as many of these sectors cannot afford the full cost of fitting CCS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A roadmap for coal[bold]A major potential benefit from CCS deployment
[normal] will be to secure the long
[normal]-
[normal]term future for UK coal mining
[normal] and its 9,000 employees.
[normal] 
[normal]Without investment in CCS there is no long term future for the UK coal industry. 
[normal] 
[normal]Actions taken now to invest in CCS 
[normal]and reform our electricity market can secure this core industry in a low carbon economy for the long term. Delays will drive investment and dependency on gas fired power without resolving the challenge of CO2 capture, whilst losing a once-only opportunity 
[normal]for global leadership in the vital CCS industry. 
[normal]The UK mines 
[normal]in 2012 mined 
[normal]over 1
[normal]7
[normal] million tonnes of coal a year, and 
[normal]its 
[normal]coal power stations generate over 
[normal]38%
[normal] of the UK’s electricity
[normal] 
[normal]compared with 
[normal]28
[normal]% from gas generators. At peak times, we turn to the e
[normal]xceptional flexibility of coal power for up to 50% of our electricity supply. Coal 
[normal]currently 
[normal]directly provides over 
[normal]5
[normal],000 jobs in deep and surface mines and ancillary functions, whilst coal power stations employ over 4,
[normal]000
[normal] staff, many in skilled quality em
[normal]ployment. 
[normal]The government should therefore develop a roadmap for UK coal mining alongside its EMR implementation plan, to provide security for UK coal investors and its workforce.
[normal]What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific[bold] and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? [bold]The
[normal] 
[normal]main barrier to developing CCS 
[normal]in this period 
[normal]appear
[normal]s to be the slow 
[normal]formation and implementation of government energy policy
[normal] to su
[normal]pport CCS
[normal]. The 
[normal]two key strands of government support for 
[normal]are EMR reforms and the CCS commercialisation programme. These two processes must work in parallel
[normal] 
[normal]to ensure the maximum momentum and technological advance. 
[normal]G[bold]overnment’s Electricity Market Reform (E[bold]MR)[bold]The EMR includes 
[normal]measures
[normal] to support all low-carbon generation with Contracts for Differences (
[normal]CfDs
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]providing for 
[normal]deployment of CCS in the power sector. 
[normal]Key tests for the EMR if it is to drive CCS investment include: 
[normal]The EMR has so far failed to provide clarity in any of these t
[normal]hree areas. 
[normal]The draft 
[normal]EMR 
[normal]Delivery Plan
[normal] 
[normal](July 2013) is unhelpful in its range of zero to 12GW of CCS by 2030, with 
[normal]even 
[normal]the upper limit almost half of the ambition set out by the Committee on Climate Change, of 18-20GW by 2030.
[normal]The delivery plan says: 
[normal]“B
[normal]a
[normal]sed on central demand and decarbonisation assumptions (100g CO2/KWh) 
[normal][the scenario] 
[normal]illustrates a generation mix that would be consistent with CCS costs and deployment circumstances being favourable compared to other technologies. In this scenario, three C
[normal]CS plants are built by the end of 2020, with commercial deployment of both gas and coal CCS throughout the 2020s- leading to deployment of around 12 GW CCS in 2030.
[normal]”
[normal]CCS commercialisation programme[bold]The latest CCS Commercialisation Programme is tasked with 
[normal]launching a process to ensure the general deployment of CCS for coal and gas by the 2020s. 
[normal]From an early commitment to four CCS projects, currently there may be support for only one or two. As a bare minimum, the government should rapidly conclude negotiat
[normal]ions at 
[normal]Drax
[normal] and Peterhead, with a view to plant
[normal] being operational
[normal] by 2018 at the latest. 
[normal]More than that, the government should retain its commitment to four demonstration projects and consider returning to other projects under development, offering them 
[normal]clear and speedy alternatives either through the CCS competition or via 
[normal]CfDs
[normal]. Sustained deployment is critical at this stage.
[normal]Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?[bold]The government’s 
[normal]approach lacks the necessary pace and scale. As noted above, currently the main drivers of CCS are reliant on effective government policy. The two key strands of government support for CCS are the EMR reforms and the CCS commercialisation programme. These 
[normal]two processes must work in parallel, not sequentially, to ensure the maximum momentum, technological advance and robustness of the programme against possible future project cancellations.  At present there is a strong perception that the government is resi
[normal]sting further CCS deployment until the commercialisation projects are underway.
[normal]Could the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this? [bold]Yes. CCS is acknowledged to be a crucial transitional technology for climate change mitigation. The UK has a crucial seedbed role to play, although there is a now a clear danger that other countries will move ahead more rapidly, so that the UK loses techno
[normal]logical and market leadership. 
[normal]In Canada, the Boundary Dam
[normal] CCS project has been completed, a 110 MW coal pow
[normal]e
[normal]r plant with 
[normal]retrofit 
[normal]CCS technology
[normal] due to start operating in 2014. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $1.24 billion, with $240 mi
[normal]llion from the federal government in 2011, of which about $180 million has already been spent. The provincial government is also supporting the project. Employment includes 20 at the R&amp;D stage
[normal], peak
[normal] construction employment of 1,500 and 41 operational emplo
[normal]yees.
