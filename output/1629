default.
defaultIn the power sector, one of the three main ways in which greenhouse gas emissions from industrial heat demand can be reduced
default are 
defaultenergy efficiency, fuel switching, and indust
defaultrial CCS. 
defaultAs the DECC 
defaultHeat Strategy
default acknowledges, industrial CCS could be a key technology for the decarbonisation of industry sector, potentially allowing energy intensive industries to continue using fossil fuels while significantly reducing emissions. 
defaultMuch 
defaultlong-term industrial abatement potential lies in CCS technology
default in i
defaultndustries which emit carbon from manufacturing process
defaultes
default 
default- 
defaultiron and steel, cement, oil refining and chemicals.
defaultThe TUC concurs with this view of the importance of industrial CCS. In 
defaultan increasingly carbon constrained world, considerable first mover advantages are available from the early development of industry CCS. As DECC points out, industrial facilities which are located close to other industries or power stations and storage site
defaults are more likely to be able to implement CCS if they can share transport and storage infrastructure.
default 
defaultIndustrial sectors need to develop and trial a range of capture technologies, for example:
defaultWhilst we welc
defaultome the heat strategy, the TUC is concerned at the pace and scale of government support for industrial CCS. Rather than industrial and power CCS technologies developing in parallel, they appear to be moving forward in sequence. For example, there is no ind
defaultustrial mechanism in the Energy Bill to incentivise industrial CCS.
defaultWhat contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?defaultCCS contribution: adefaultdvice from the Committee on Cldefaultimate ChangedefaultT
defaulthe Committee on Climate Change 
default(CCC) 
defaultestimates
default that the UK’s decarbonising power sector will require 
defaultapproximately 18-20GW of CCS for coal and gas by 2030.
defaultThe 
defaultgovernment’s independent advice from the 
defaultCCC
default provides an energy 
defaultscenario 
defaultto reach the UK’s 2030 energy decarbonisation target. The 
defaultpower sector currently accounts for around 25% of UK greenhouse gas emissions. 
defaultAn indicative generation mix to achieve 
defaulta carbon intensity of 50-100g/KWh by
default 2030 is 40% nuclear, 40% renewable, 15% CC
defaultS, and around 5% unabated gas-fired generation.

defaultGiven the long lead times for major infrastructure projects such as these, and the fact none has yet ma

default The CC conclude that:
default “The current proposal to support four CCS power generation proj
defaultects (in the Coalition Agreement, reconfirmed in the 2010 Spending Review), would result in a critical mass for potential roll-out from the early 2020s. It is important that a funding mechanism for the four projects is finalised and that these are tendered
default in 2011 to facilitate early deployment
default.”
defaultThe CCC estimates that 
defaultthe power sector will capture a larger amount of CO2 per year than industry up until 2040, from when power and industry are projected to capture similar quantities annually
default. 
defaultThey state that:
default 
default“There is a growing role for CCS in industry through the 2020s, which by 2030 reduces emissions by around 5 MtCO2....
default 
defaultTo ensure that this technology is available for deployment from the 2020s, a policy approach is required which either funds demonstration

defaultFrom the TUC’s perspective CCS is at a critical stage. The Coalition’s initial ambition of four CCS demonstration projects would appear to meet the minimum requ
defaultirement recommended by the CCC. The
default TUC therefore believe the
default government needs to immediately return to its initial ambition for four CCS demonstration projects, and 
defaultensure these can be incentivised quickly through the Final Investment Decision enabling Co
defaultntracts for Difference (
defaultCfD
default) that should be available from the end of 2013. It needs to ensure that measures in the Energy Bill incentivise further power sector CCS projects under the

defaultAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to defaultexport CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?defaultYes. 
defaultDECC acknowledges that C

default stating that “
defaultIf CCS opportunities develop as anticipated, bene

defaultHowever, the government has not developed a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and social benefits of CCS. The TUC believes that such researc

defaultA roadmap for coaldefaultA major potential benefit from CCS deployment
default will be to secure the long
default-
defaultterm future for UK coal mining
default and its 9,000 employees.
default 
defaultWithout investment in CCS there is no long term future for the UK coal industry. 
default 
defaultActions taken now to invest in CCS 
defaultand reform our electricity market can secure this core industry in a low carbon economy for the long term. Delays will drive investment and dependency on gas fired power without resolving the challenge of CO2 capture, whilst losing a once-only opportunity 
defaultfor global leadership in the vital CCS industry. 
defaultThe UK mines 
defaultin 2012 mined 
defaultover 1
default7
default million tonnes of coal a year, and 
defaultits 
defaultcoal power stations generate over 
default38%
default of the UK’s electricity
default 
defaultcompared with 
default28
default% from gas generators. At peak times, we turn to the e
defaultxceptional flexibility of coal power for up to 50% of our electricity supply. Coal 
defaultcurrently 
defaultdirectly provides over 
default5
default,000 jobs in deep and surface mines and ancillary functions, whilst coal power stations employ over 4,
default000
default staff, many in skilled quality em
defaultployment. 
defaultThe government should therefore develop a roadmap for UK coal mining alongside its EMR implementation plan, to provide security for UK coal investors and its workforce.

defaultCCS commercialisation programmedefaultThe latest CCS Commercialisation Programme is tasked with 
defaultlaunching a process to ensure the general deployment of CCS for coal and gas by the 2020s. 
defaultFrom an early commitment to four CCS projects, currently there may be support for only one or two. As a bare minimum, the government should rapidly conclude negotiat
defaultions at 
defaultDrax
default and Peterhead, with a view to plant
default being operational
default by 2018 at the latest. 
defaultMore than that, the government should retain its commitment to four demonstration projects and consider returning to other projects under development, offering them 
defaultclear and speedy alternatives either through the CCS competition or via 
defaultCfDs
default. Sustained deployment is critical at this stage.
defaultIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?defaultThe government’s 
defaultapproach lacks the necessary pace and scale. As noted above, currently the main drivers of CCS are reliant on effective government policy. The two key strands of government support for CCS are the EMR reforms and the CCS commercialisation programme. These 
defaulttwo processes must work in parallel, not sequentially, to ensure the maximum momentum, technological advance and robustness of the programme against possible future project cancellations.  At present there is a strong perception that the government is resi
defaultsting further CCS deployment until the commercialisation projects are underway.
defaultCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this? defaultYes. CCS is acknowledged to be a crucial transitional technology for climate change mitigation. The UK has a crucial seedbed role to play, although there is a now a clear danger that other countries will move ahead more rapidly, so that the UK loses techno
