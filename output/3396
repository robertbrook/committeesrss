defaultIntroduction to Cuadrilla
default&#xa0;
defaultCuadrilla has attracted much media focus on exploration of shale gas in the UK and is proud to be the first-mover in what could prove to be a very economically beneficial industry 
defaultfor the UK. In our view a UK shale gas industry could managed correctly, be instrumental in providing highly skilled jobs in 
defaultareas which badly need them, building energy security, 
defaultsupplying tax revenues for the exchequer as 
defaultNorth Sea revenues diminish, 
defaultmee
defaultting demand for energy for electricity, hea
defaultting and industrial use, and in 
defaultplaying an important role in the UK’s future energy mix. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCuadrilla is a small, specialist, British SME with 
defaultconsiderable expertise 
defaultin geology and unconventional

defaultering and drilling.
default&#xa0;
default We are in the vanguard of

defaultunconventional oil and gas exploration in Britain
default.
default Together with our partners Centrica and A.J. Lucas we hold a 1200 KM2

defaultWritten evidence
default1default.default defaultThe importance of gas to the UK’s overall energy needs and the potential role shale gas could play within it;default1.1
default Gas is an important 
defaultconstituent
default part of the UK’s
default energy mix and will continue to 
defaultbe so in terms of 
defaultelectricity generation
default, domestic 
defaultheating
default, cooking and industry
default for the foreseeable future
default.
default 
default1.2. 
defaultAs a method of electricity generation, gas is better for th
defaulte environment than coal and is crucial as a transitional fuel for the UK on its road to a low carbon economy. 
defaultThe Climate Change Committee 
default(CCC) 
defaultrecently 
defaultpublished its position on shale gas, stating that 
default‘t
defaulthe need to reduce our emissions implies a reductio
defaultn over time in the quantity of fossil fuels being burned. This is even more true if carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies do not prove viable. However, UK shale gas production could be compatible with meeting our emissions targets
default’. According to th
defaulte CCC, this is because 
defaultshale gas lifecycle emissions could be lower than those of imported LNG, a fact that has also been reinforced by DECC’s chief scientist.
default Therefore gas has a necessary role to play in electricity generation and can assist the UK in me
defaulteting its legally binding climate targets.     
default 
default  
default1.3
default 
defaultThe lesser discussed side of the UK’s gas demand is domestic heating, cooking and industry. 
defaultThe debate on Britain’s energy needs almost invariably defaults to the supply of electricity, the need to 
defaultdecarbonise our electricity generation and the thr
defaulteat of the “lights going out”. 
defaultIn the context of this debate it is very important to note that 
defaultover 
defaulttwo thirds of UK gas demand has nothing to do with electricity generation and is in fact used for domestic
default heating, cooking and industry.
default&#xa0;
default Over 90% of 
defaultUK homes use gas for heating. 
defaultIn the absence of a credible plan to replace this heating demand, then, irrespective of what happens in the electricity supply market, gas is going to have a major role to play in B
defaultritain’s energy supply for the next thirty years or more.  
default1.4
default Consequently, 
defaultg
defaultiven the decline in Britain’s reserves of gas from the North Sea and increasing dependence on imported gas in the form of LNG from Qatar and pipeline gas from Russia and Norway 
default,
default the debate should focus on not whether or not the UK will
default need gas but rather where 
defaultthat gas 
defaultwill 
defaultbe sourced from. 
defaultCuadrilla believes that shale gas could produce a significant amount of gas, reducing import dependency and improving security of supply.  
defaultThe UK is of course only entering the exploration phase for shale, so development models are at present hypothetical and reliant on a number of external factors. 
default1.5
default 
defaultCurrently the t
defaultotal UK gas demand
default is 
defaultsome 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) per annum. The British Geological survey has estimated that in the North of England alone the Bowland shale contains, most likely, 1,300 tcf of gas.  If just 10% of that gas could be recovered that represents over 40 years 
defaultof domestic supply. By 2030, without shale gas, it is forecast by DECC that the UK will be importing some three quarters of its gas needs.  
defaultThe Institute of Directors report published in May 2013 indicated that 
default76% of the UK’s gas is likely to be imported 
defaultby 2030, costing £15.6 billion. In the IoD’s central scenario, shale gas production could reduce gas imports to 37% in 2030, and the cost of imports could fall to £7.5 billion.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis would assist with the UK’s balance of payments and support energy security
default.
default2default. defaultThe potential for shale gas exploration and commercial level extraction in Wales;default2.1 
defaultCuadrilla does not have a licence to explore for shale gas in Wales. The British Geological Survey will be better suited to answering this question accurately. 
default3default.default defaultThe potential environmental and climate change impact of extraction and use of the gas; default3.1 
defaultCuadrilla
default strongly believe
defaults
default t
defaulthat hydraulic fracturing of 
defaultshale rock
default in the Bowland Basin
default, over 6,000 feet below the surface, can be conducted with minimum cost to the surrounding environment. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 Water management is important in this context
default. Despite some media reports to the contrary, there have been no proven cases of hydraulic fracturing
default fluid contaminating groundwater. Cuadrilla plans to use in Lancashire a fracturing fluid that will be non-hazardous to groundwater and 
defaultcontains
default very 
defaultfew chemical additives any of which will require the prior approval of the Environment Agency and
default will be 
defaultpublically disclosed. 
defaultThe water that flows back to the surface from the shale rock with the produced gas has also been assessed as non-hazardous by the Environment Agency although it does contain very low levels of naturally occurring radioactivity.  Initi
defaultally this water will be taken for treatment at EA approved waste treatment facilities but over time we would expect to be able to recycle flow back water and re-use it for hydraulic fracturing.  
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultWell integrity is 
defaultalso 
defaultvital, and much can be done at t
defaulthe design stage to ensure that a well is fit for purpose to prevent
defaultany loss of gas or liquid
default. Cuadrilla’s wells are designed to the highest international standards. 
defaultEach vertical well we drill has several layers of steel casing, the layers of which always 
defaultextend beyond the depths at which the aquifer is found. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultOur well designs are overseen by an independent well examiner, before being submitted to the HSE. Once the HSE has reviewed the design, and we have received all further planning applications and
default permissions, we are free to proceed with the construction of the well. We are confident about our well design.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultThe potential flaring of natural gas from shale is an area that has also been inaccurately reported on with descriptions of thousands of fl
defaultares lighting up the countryside.  Flaring is carried out in the exploration phase for a limited duration (typically 30 to 90 days), on a small number of exploration wells and with the volume to be flared per well restricted and regulated by both DECC and 
defaultthe Environment Agency.  This is because in the exploration phase wells are not connected to the gas grid.  During any subsequent production phase when a gas grid connection will have been established at each producing site then there should be no requirem
defaultent to flare as wells are drilled and produced.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default 
defaultWith regard to methane emissions and carbon footprint, 
defaultt
defaulthere is a growing scientific consensus that shale gas has a role to play in contributing to reduction of CO2 in the UK.  The 
defaultreport commissioned by
default the Department of Energ
defaulty and Climate Change and led by
default the department’s Chief Scienti
defaultst, Professor David Mackay
default, published on 9 September (
defaultPotential greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas extraction and use: A study by Professor David J C MacKay FRS and Dr.
default 
defaultTimothy J Stone CBE
default)  is very interesting in this regard.
default&#xa0;
default The r
defaulteport concluded that shale gas’s 
defaultoverall carbon footprint is comparable to gas extracted from conventional sources (e.g. the North Sea), lower than that of imported 
defaultLNG 
defaultand significantly (four to five times) lower than coal.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.7 The most recent research relating to the safety of shale e
defaultxtractio
defaultn was published by Public Health England in October. The 
defaultreport
default found that 
defaultf
defaultracking for shale gas is safe as long as operations are well-regulated and well-run
default and 
defaultthat the risks to public health from exposure to emissions from shale gas extraction are low
default. 
defaultThe report provides welcome reassurance to people
default about hydraulic fracturing 
defaultand should dispel scaremongering about its safety
default.

default.8
default 
defaultIn short there will be 
defaultsome 
defaulte
defaultnvironmental 
defaultimpacts 
defaultin relation to the industrial process, truck movements etc. These environmental impacts need to be viewed in context and not be exaggerated especially in relation to the possibility of water contamination, emissions or seismicity. 
default4. defaultWhether the current regulatory regime covering such activity is adequate;default4.1 The onshore oil and gas industry has a great deal of heritage in the UK. It is a fallacy posited by some that the UK lacks experience in the sector and that the regulatory system
default is not up to the ta
defaultsk. 
defaultIn the UK 
default2000 
defaultonshore 
defaultwells have since been drilled, with 200 hydraulically fractured. The UK is also home to Europe’s largest onshore oil field in Wytch Farm. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultCuadrilla is confident that the regulatory framework in the UK is 
defaultsufficiently robust to ensure safe and responsible exploitation of shale gas. T
defaulthere is a clear scientific and academic consensus, underlined here in the UK by the Royal Society and the Royal
default Academy of Engineering joint report (
defaulthttp://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/
default), and by other prominent academic experts that unconventional oi
defaultl and gas exploration and production can be carried out entirely safely in the UK.  Concerns that have been raised around water and air contamination and seismicity can all be managed by strong regulation and industry best practice. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultThe Government ar
defaultgues and we agree that the oil and gas regulatory process in the UK is already the strongest in the world. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultAs stated, Cuadrilla does not have a licence to explore for shale 
defaultgas 
defaultin Wales and currently has not undergone any financial modelling specific to Wales. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving said this, it is fair to say that if the
default geology is good and there is the right political and investment environment then the benefits for Wales in relation to energy security, job creation and capital investment could be substantial.
