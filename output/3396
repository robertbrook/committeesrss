[normal]Cuadrilla
[normal] 
[normal]appreciates
[normal] the opportunity
[normal] 
[normal]to give evidence 
[normal]to the House of 
[normal]Commons Welsh 
[normal]Affairs 
[normal]Committee as part of its inquiry into
[normal] 
[normal]Energy generation in Wales: Shale Gas
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] is pleased to make 
[normal]the following written submission
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The House of Lords Economic Affairs committee is running a concurrent inquiry into shale gas to which Cuadrilla has recently submitted evidence. There are some areas of mutual focus in the two inquiries and consequently some of the evidence below 
[normal]has also 
[normal]been provided to the House of Lords committee
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction to Cuadrilla
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cuadrilla has attracted much media focus on exploration of shale gas in the UK and is proud to be the first-mover in what could prove to be a very economically beneficial industry 
[normal]for the UK. In our view a UK shale gas industry could managed correctly, be instrumental in providing highly skilled jobs in 
[normal]areas which badly need them, building energy security, 
[normal]supplying tax revenues for the exchequer as 
[normal]North Sea revenues diminish, 
[normal]mee
[normal]ting demand for energy for electricity, hea
[normal]ting and industrial use, and in 
[normal]playing an important role in the UK’s future energy mix. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cuadrilla is a small, specialist, British SME with 
[normal]considerable expertise 
[normal]in geology and unconventional
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]oil and gas engine
[normal]ering and drilling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We are in the vanguard of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]unconventional oil and gas exploration in Britain
[normal].
[normal] Together with our partners Centrica and A.J. Lucas we hold a 1200 KM2 
[normal]exploration 
[normal]licence in the Bowland basin in Lancashire.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Cuadrilla plans to drill,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]hydra
[normal]ulically fracture and flow test a small number of exploratory wells to show how much of the huge quantity of natural ga
[normal]s in place in the Bowland shale
[normal] 
[normal]could be 
[normal]commercially recoverable.

[normal]Written evidence
[normal]1[bold].[bold] [bold]The importance of gas to the UK’s overall energy needs and the potential role shale gas could play within it;[bold]1.1
[normal] Gas is an important 
[normal]constituent
[normal] part of the UK’s
[normal] energy mix and will continue to 
[normal]be so in terms of 
[normal]electricity generation
[normal], domestic 
[normal]heating
[normal], cooking and industry
[normal] for the foreseeable future
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]1.2. 
[normal]As a method of electricity generation, gas is better for th
[normal]e environment than coal and is crucial as a transitional fuel for the UK on its road to a low carbon economy. 
[normal]The Climate Change Committee 
[normal](CCC) 
[normal]recently 
[normal]published its position on shale gas, stating that 
[normal]‘t
[normal]he need to reduce our emissions implies a reductio
[normal]n over time in the quantity of fossil fuels being burned. This is even more true if carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies do not prove viable. However, UK shale gas production could be compatible with meeting our emissions targets
[normal]’. According to th
[normal]e CCC, this is because 
[normal]shale gas lifecycle emissions could be lower than those of imported LNG, a fact that has also been reinforced by DECC’s chief scientist.
[normal] Therefore gas has a necessary role to play in electricity generation and can assist the UK in me
[normal]eting its legally binding climate targets.     
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]1.3
[normal] 
[normal]The lesser discussed side of the UK’s gas demand is domestic heating, cooking and industry. 
[normal]The debate on Britain’s energy needs almost invariably defaults to the supply of electricity, the need to 
[normal]decarbonise our electricity generation and the thr
[normal]eat of the “lights going out”. 
[normal]In the context of this debate it is very important to note that 
[normal]over 
[normal]two thirds of UK gas demand has nothing to do with electricity generation and is in fact used for domestic
[normal] heating, cooking and industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Over 90% of 
[normal]UK homes use gas for heating. 
[normal]In the absence of a credible plan to replace this heating demand, then, irrespective of what happens in the electricity supply market, gas is going to have a major role to play in B
[normal]ritain’s energy supply for the next thirty years or more.  
[normal]1.4
[normal] Consequently, 
[normal]g
[normal]iven the decline in Britain’s reserves of gas from the North Sea and increasing dependence on imported gas in the form of LNG from Qatar and pipeline gas from Russia and Norway 
[normal],
[normal] the debate should focus on not whether or not the UK will
[normal] need gas but rather where 
[normal]that gas 
[normal]will 
[normal]be sourced from. 
[normal]Cuadrilla believes that shale gas could produce a significant amount of gas, reducing import dependency and improving security of supply.  
[normal]The UK is of course only entering the exploration phase for shale, so development models are at present hypothetical and reliant on a number of external factors. 
[normal]1.5
[normal] 
[normal]Currently the t
[normal]otal UK gas demand
[normal] is 
[normal]some 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) per annum. The British Geological survey has estimated that in the North of England alone the Bowland shale contains, most likely, 1,300 tcf of gas.  If just 10% of that gas could be recovered that represents over 40 years 
[normal]of domestic supply. By 2030, without shale gas, it is forecast by DECC that the UK will be importing some three quarters of its gas needs.  
[normal]The Institute of Directors report published in May 2013 indicated that 
[normal]76% of the UK’s gas is likely to be imported 
[normal]by 2030, costing £15.6 billion. In the IoD’s central scenario, shale gas production could reduce gas imports to 37% in 2030, and the cost of imports could fall to £7.5 billion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This would assist with the UK’s balance of payments and support energy security
[normal].
[normal]2[bold]. [bold]The potential for shale gas exploration and commercial level extraction in Wales;[bold]2.1 
[normal]Cuadrilla does not have a licence to explore for shale gas in Wales. The British Geological Survey will be better suited to answering this question accurately. 
[normal]3[bold].[bold] [bold]The potential environmental and climate change impact of extraction and use of the gas; [bold]3.1 
[normal]Cuadrilla
[normal] strongly believe
[normal]s
[normal] t
[normal]hat hydraulic fracturing of 
[normal]shale rock
[normal] in the Bowland Basin
[normal], over 6,000 feet below the surface, can be conducted with minimum cost to the surrounding environment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 Water management is important in this context
[normal]. Despite some media reports to the contrary, there have been no proven cases of hydraulic fracturing
[normal] fluid contaminating groundwater. Cuadrilla plans to use in Lancashire a fracturing fluid that will be non-hazardous to groundwater and 
[normal]contains
[normal] very 
[normal]few chemical additives any of which will require the prior approval of the Environment Agency and
[normal] will be 
[normal]publically disclosed. 
[normal]The water that flows back to the surface from the shale rock with the produced gas has also been assessed as non-hazardous by the Environment Agency although it does contain very low levels of naturally occurring radioactivity.  Initi
[normal]ally this water will be taken for treatment at EA approved waste treatment facilities but over time we would expect to be able to recycle flow back water and re-use it for hydraulic fracturing.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]Well integrity is 
[normal]also 
[normal]vital, and much can be done at t
[normal]he design stage to ensure that a well is fit for purpose to prevent
[normal]any loss of gas or liquid
[normal]. Cuadrilla’s wells are designed to the highest international standards. 
[normal]Each vertical well we drill has several layers of steel casing, the layers of which always 
[normal]extend beyond the depths at which the aquifer is found. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 
[normal]Our well designs are overseen by an independent well examiner, before being submitted to the HSE. Once the HSE has reviewed the design, and we have received all further planning applications and
[normal] permissions, we are free to proceed with the construction of the well. We are confident about our well design.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 
[normal]The potential flaring of natural gas from shale is an area that has also been inaccurately reported on with descriptions of thousands of fl
[normal]ares lighting up the countryside.  Flaring is carried out in the exploration phase for a limited duration (typically 30 to 90 days), on a small number of exploration wells and with the volume to be flared per well restricted and regulated by both DECC and 
[normal]the Environment Agency.  This is because in the exploration phase wells are not connected to the gas grid.  During any subsequent production phase when a gas grid connection will have been established at each producing site then there should be no requirem
[normal]ent to flare as wells are drilled and produced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal] 
[normal]With regard to methane emissions and carbon footprint, 
[normal]t
[normal]here is a growing scientific consensus that shale gas has a role to play in contributing to reduction of CO2 in the UK.  The 
[normal]report commissioned by
[normal] the Department of Energ
[normal]y and Climate Change and led by
[normal] the department’s Chief Scienti
[normal]st, Professor David Mackay
[normal], published on 9 September (
[normal]Potential greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas extraction and use: A study by Professor David J C MacKay FRS and Dr.
[normal] 
[normal]Timothy J Stone CBE
[normal])  is very interesting in this regard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The r
[normal]eport concluded that shale gas’s 
[normal]overall carbon footprint is comparable to gas extracted from conventional sources (e.g. the North Sea), lower than that of imported 
[normal]LNG 
[normal]and significantly (four to five times) lower than coal.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 The most recent research relating to the safety of shale e
[normal]xtractio
[normal]n was published by Public Health England in October. The 
[normal]report
[normal] found that 
[normal]f
[normal]racking for shale gas is safe as long as operations are well-regulated and well-run
[normal] and 
[normal]that the risks to public health from exposure to emissions from shale gas extraction are low
[normal]. 
[normal]The report provides welcome reassurance to people
[normal] about hydraulic fracturing 
[normal]and should dispel scaremongering about its safety
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].8
[normal] 
[normal]In short there will be 
[normal]some 
[normal]e
[normal]nvironmental 
[normal]impacts 
[normal]in relation to the industrial process, truck movements etc. These environmental impacts need to be viewed in context and not be exaggerated especially in relation to the possibility of water contamination, emissions or seismicity. 
[normal]4. [bold]Whether the current regulatory regime covering such activity is adequate;[bold]4.1 The onshore oil and gas industry has a great deal of heritage in the UK. It is a fallacy posited by some that the UK lacks experience in the sector and that the regulatory system
[normal] is not up to the ta
[normal]sk. 
[normal]In the UK 
[normal]2000 
[normal]onshore 
[normal]wells have since been drilled, with 200 hydraulically fractured. The UK is also home to Europe’s largest onshore oil field in Wytch Farm. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]Cuadrilla is confident that the regulatory framework in the UK is 
[normal]sufficiently robust to ensure safe and responsible exploitation of shale gas. T
[normal]here is a clear scientific and academic consensus, underlined here in the UK by the Royal Society and the Royal
[normal] Academy of Engineering joint report (
[normal]http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/
[normal]), and by other prominent academic experts that unconventional oi
[normal]l and gas exploration and production can be carried out entirely safely in the UK.  Concerns that have been raised around water and air contamination and seismicity can all be managed by strong regulation and industry best practice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]The Government ar
[normal]gues and we agree that the oil and gas regulatory process in the UK is already the strongest in the world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]As stated, Cuadrilla does not have a licence to explore for shale 
[normal]gas 
[normal]in Wales and currently has not undergone any financial modelling specific to Wales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having said this, it is fair to say that if the
[normal] geology is good and there is the right political and investment environment then the benefits for Wales in relation to energy security, job creation and capital investment could be substantial.
