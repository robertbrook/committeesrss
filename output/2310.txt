[[[Consultation response: Education Committee Inquiry into residential care ]]]This letter is from the Children’s Commissioner and her Office (OCC) in response to the Education Committee’s Inquiry following the programme of proposed reforms to the regulation of residential care introduced by the Department for Education. This letter addresses the views of children and young people; the rights of children under the United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC);

[[[ ]]]and our response to the questions posed by the Committee.

[[[1.1 Introduction]]]Our response to the above consultation has been submitted and is available on our website. We will respond here to the specific questions posed by the Committee but will not reiterate in full our comments to the consultation. We will take a wider view, with reference to the rights of children under the UNCRC.The first report from the OCC’s Inquiry into Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups, requested by the Right Honourable Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, triggered the present set of proposed reforms and staff from this Office have been involved in the subsequent working groups which have developed these proposals. We welcomed the final report of the working groups on quality and out of area placement. Whilst we further welcome the proposed changes, we have also indicated some areas which we believe need strengthening. We suggest that it is essential to look at residential care within the overall context of provision for looked after children and not in isolation. All children need stability, love and belonging: the ‘permanence’ which is referred to often in research and reports. Residential care in itself and on its own, it is suggested, will not provide for such long term needs but it can make an important contribution to the overall plan for permanence and, if of high quality, provides a crucial option and the opportunity for meaningful relationships. Many young people have said that they wished to be in residential rather than in foster care, mindful of their experience of family life and the continuing role of their family relationships.

[[[1.2 The views of children and young people]]]There are important messages from children and young people and those who work on their behalf about ways to improve the care experience and build on what works for children.   Many children and young people benefit greatly from their care experience and it is important to them that they are not portrayed only in terms of the statistics − as failures academically or likely to enter the criminal justice system. However there is a need to make the best experience the usual experience for all children and to address the obstacles to this. Clearly, our response here cannot outline all the steps which could be taken to achieve this and we are aware of the important work recently undertaken by the ADCS, the Care Inquiry recommendations and other relevant research. As it may soon be part of our remit to address the rights of and to offer advice and assistance to this group of children, we are developing our perspective on these issues, together with the Children’s Rights Director and children and young people themselves.

[[[1.3 The rights of children under the UNCRC – how these apply to looked after children and to those in residential care in particular ]]]These are not intended to represent a full children’s rights assessment but as key points which underpin our suggestions below:

[[[Article 3: the primacy of the best interests of the child]]] − this underpins the need to find the right placement for each child according to an assessment of their needs. It follows that residential care should be a placement of choice and that the consideration of location should be led by need. Some children will require out of area placement for their safety and wellbeing: it is essential to be sure that such placements follow need and are not dictated by availability. It follows too that placement in residential care is not made as a last resort.

[[[Article 7: (concerning the child’s identity)]]] − ‘… the child shall have, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents’. It follows that whatever the placement, the child’s link to their family is supported. This work must include the extended family and will of course take into account any risks to the child. This would include work undertaken with the families of children who become looked after, so that when they return as care leavers, the problems which led to the separation have been addressed. 

[[[Article 12: the child’s right to express their views on matters that concern them and have those views given due weight]]] − it is important to children that their voices are fully heard in the planning for their care. Children have frequently – most recently though the Care Inquiry – said that they are not always listened to or involved in decision about their lives. They often also do not have enough information to understand the decisions or nature of the placements proposed. Children have also given consistent messages about their wish to have sustained relationships with those caring for and supporting them. We consider that anything that can be done to support systems which enable this should be a priority: formal guidance can play a part here as can effective inspection processes which take into account the views of children using services. We comment further below on the place of residential care in sustaining relationships and offering stability.&#xa0;

[[[Article 19: protection ‘]]]

[[[from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse]]]’ − in all placements the safety of children who are looked after must be addressed: we have proposed that meeting the safety needs of the child is included in both the care and placement plan. This is particularly, but not exclusively relevant to children at risk of, or who have experienced sexual exploitation.

[[[Article 20 s]]]

[[[pecial protection and assistance provided by the State for those separated from their families]]] − ‘when considering solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing and to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background.’ We consider that it is essential for the child’s background to be taken into account specifically but alongside all the other considerations which emerge from a full assessment of their needs.&#xa0;

[[[Article 34: ]]]

[[[States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse]]] − Article 9 of the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography also applies, which addresses the prevention of such offences, the protection of children who are especially vulnerable and provision assistance to victims. This has particular relevance to the findings of our Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups.

[[[Article 37:]]] 

[[[‘]]]

[[[The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time’]]] − we would refer to the House of Commons, Justice Committee, Youth Justice, Seventh Report of Session 2012–13. The decrease in the number of young people entering the criminal justice system for the first time was welcomed but it was noted that there is a need to ensure that looked after children benefit from changes in approaches to very minor offending.  The need was recognised for strategies which would prevent the criminalisation of looked after children for incidents which would not come to police attention if they took place in family homes.&#xa0;

[[[Article 39:]]] 

[[[‘]]]

[[[physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation, or abuse in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child]]]

[[[’ ]]]− it follows that all placements must provide for the emotional and mental health needs of young people which result from past abuse or neglect. We know that children who enter residential care are likely to have lived longer in abusive or neglectful environments, are more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and may have difficulties which are expressed in behaviour which is troublesome to others and which may be dangerous to themselves. This makes it all the more essential that all residential homes have a clear purpose and that staff are well trained and supported.

[[[1.4 Responses to the questions posed by the Committee]]]The Committee has posed two questions:We have indicated our support for the reforms. There are some which we do not think are sufficient and other measures which we believe are needed. We have said already that 

[[[these reforms need to be considered further in the context of care more generally]]] so that the place of residential care is considered in terms of meeting the needs of the individual child. Our comments are as follows.a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The provisions for improved training of residential staff are not strong enough. These children and young people need the most skilled workforce. High quality leadership is essential. We consider that the faster introduction of improvements in the required training for and in the support of residential staff should be given high priority.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a need to link any improvements with an overall strategy for tackling sexual exploitation and an effective child protection response. In particular we have argued for safety planning to be included in care planning processes.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We consider that more should be done to avoid completely the use of bed and breakfast for vulnerable young people and care leavers. This is already considered inappropriate but its use continues.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are not certain that adherence to one of the most important principles – that residential care must not be used as a last resort but must be the placement of choice to meet the child’s assessed needs – will be addressed by the current proposals. Although the expert group on quality made this point, it is not clear how the current consultation lends itself to influencing good placement planning.&#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commissioning of placements should be based on the identified needs of the looked after children population in an area. This involves undertaking an audit of the needs of looked after children as basis for commissioning high quality care which will meet these needs and some areas do this already. Joint commissioning would assist where costly specialist resources are needed. Support for such commissioning approaches will assist in enabling children’s placements to be led by their need, not by availability.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We consider that every care placement must address the emotional and mental health needs of children and young people, who will be there because of abuse, neglect and other problems in their lives. This means that all children must have access to counselling and other therapeutic help and that carers and staff are well supported in their role in this help. In respect of residential care, evidence- based and well established therapeutic models are very important. The purpose of such a placement should always be clear: we concur with leading researchers in this field that all children’s homes should have a specialist purpose. This can be for temporary stays while work is done to prepare and search for a foster placement; for therapy with a specific timeframe; or for a secure setting where children have need for that level of protection and therapeutic help would also be offered. We suggest that there should be requirements for specialist children’s homes to be approved on this basis, rather than a continuance of generalist provision or homes which make inflated claims about therapeutic approaches and skills.g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Looked after children and young people’s access to independent advocacy is central to their voice being heard and often to their protection. We consider that a clearer legal right to advocacy is of high importance. h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome the Government’s focus on the needs of care leavers and we support the case for extending support. It is well known that children living in their own families do not have to leave at 16 or at 18 and are often able to obtain extensive and long term support throughout their lives.  We consider it essential to facilitate the continuance of placements post 16 where this fits with the overall plan to meet the wishes and needs of the individual young person.i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would like to see an emphasis on enabling continuing relationships for children and young people who are looked after and that priority be given to seeking at least one adult who will remain in a child’s life into adulthood.j)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We consider that many of the recommendations from the background work to these reforms concern good practice in work with looked after children. This is already supported by helpful guidance and will have considerable relevance to the wider training agenda. Such good practice includes the need to listen to children; to sustain relationships which are important to them; to enable Independent Reviewing Officers to challenge delays and poor planning. We consider that such guidance is valuable in promoting consistent good practice principles which are based on sound research.We hope that the Committee will find these comments of assistance in considering the needs of children who are looked after and those most vulnerable.September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
