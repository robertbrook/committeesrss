"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Professor Robert Blackburn(QPC 10)&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;The Royal C\nonsent\n procedures currently operating in the legislative process have become an anachronism today and redundant of any practical \npublic \npurpose beyond royal ceremony. \nOver time a number of negative attributes associated with the procedures have arisen, am\nong them time and cost factors for officials and legal advisers, and press speculation \nover unjustified royal interven\ntion in the legislative process. \nIt is in everyone\n's interests that the Royal C\nonsent pr\nocedures are withdrawn.\n&#xa0;\nThe rules and procedures of the Royal Consent&#xa0;\n0\n1\n              \nThe consent of the Queen \nor the Pri\nnce of Wales where applicable\n \nmust be \nsought, granted and communicated to both Houses of Parliament, \nwhenever a matter tou\nching on the royal prerogative or \nCrow\nn property \nis affected, most \nnotab\nly the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall\n.\n&#xa0;\n0\n2\n              \nThe substance of the \nRoyal Consent \nis \nan \nagreement to the proposed legislation being considered and debated in each House of \nParliament, not that the Queen \nor \nthe \nPrince of Wales\n's\n where applicable \nnecessarily \nagrees or supports the content of the meas\nure itself.\n&#xa0;\n0\n3\n              \nThe Royal Consent is exercised \nautomatically \non the advice of ministers.\n  \n&#xa0;\n04\n              \nCurrent practice is that the Private Secretary of the Bill's sponsoring Minister sends a letter to the Private Secreta\nry of \nthe Queen or Prince of Wales as \nappropriate\n setting out how the prerogative or \ntheir property interests\n would be affected, together \nwith copies of the Bill.\n  \nIn the preparation of this \nletter\n the advice of Parliamentary Counsel \nis taken\n \nwho in turn \ntakes advice from\n the \nPublic Bill offices in the House of Commons and House of Lords.\n&#xa0;\n05\n              \nUnder Cabinet Office guidelines, c\nopies of this letter \nare sent to the Queen's solicitors, Messrs Farrer &amp; Co. in Lincoln's Inn, who advise the Royal Household\n, the C\nlerk to the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Secretary to the Duchy of Cornwall on \nthe implications of relevant Bills\n affecting \nroyal interests.\n&#xa0;\n06\n              \nThe \nRoyal \nConsent is \nthen \ncommunicated\n \nback \nto the sponsori\nng department by letter, and \nis communicated onwards \nto \nthe Commons and Lords\n b\ny \na minister in each House respectively \nwho \nis \nalso \na member\n of \nthe \nPrivy Council at an appropriate stage of the Bill.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe legal authority for the Royal Consent&#xa0;\n07\n              \nThe legal \nauthority for the \nrequirement for\n Royal Consent \nis simply parliamentary usage existing since time immemorial.  It is part of \"\nt\nhe law and custom of Parliament\", not common law or statute.\n  This means \nthat \nit is within the power of \neach House to determine\n the existence and \nprocess of the Royal Consent.  \n&#xa0;\n08\n              \nThis\n legal fact \nis \ncommonly misunderstood \nor \ntends to be \nobscured \nbecause the bulk of the communications involved are carried out by\n \nor for Ministers of the Crown and the Royal Household.  No doubt \ngovernment and \nroyal officials may feel some \nsense of\n ownership of the whole process, \nbeca\nuse \nit is \nthey\n who are doing much of the work\n and \nit is a\n Privy Counsellor who communicates the \nRoyal \nConsent to Parliament. \n&#xa0;\n09\n              \nWhether\n or not the content of a Bill does in fact affect the royal prerogative or the property interests of the Crown or Duchies of Lancaster or Cornwall is a matter for the ultimate judgement of the House authorities in Parliament, meaning in practice the Public\n Bill offices in the Commons and Lords acting in collaboration.\n&#xa0;\n10\n              \nSimilar \nprocess\nes\n \nfor Royal Consent \noperate\n in the legislative proceedings\n of the Scottish Parliament an\nd National Assembly for Wales. In each case this operates \nunder the authority of st\nanding orders required by the\n \nScotland A\nct 1998 and Government of Wales Act 2006\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nArguments for and against repeal&#xa0;\n11\n              \nThe \ncase for maintaining the Royal Consent is simply ceremonial, forming part of the public theatre surround\ning the monarchy today, enjoyed by many.  It is part of the \nwide-ranging \nconventional courtesies \nowed to the Queen and Prince of Wales, supporting their dignity an\nd national memories of the \nhistorical traditions of monarchy from centuries past when they pr\nesided over the operation of the state in all its forms, executive, legislative, and judicial.\n  Politically, the Royal Consent could be viewed as a harmless anachronism.\n&#xa0;\n12\n              \nHowever, there are negative aspects to the Royal Consent.  Firstly\n, there is an apparent \nconflict of interest in the Que\nen and \nPrinc\ne of Wales being involved in legislative \ndecision\ns\n affecting the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall respectively, since they derive benef\nits from these Crown properties.\n  \nThis is not to sugge\ns\nt that in \nreality\n they \never do seek to influence or block \nany such \nlegislative measures\n, \nbut the fact that the present situation provides the opportunity for them to \ndo so\n creates the public appearance of\n bias in the law-making process and feeds criticism\n \nof \nthe monarchy \nand cynicism about its neutrality \nin our public life.\n&#xa0;\n13\n              \nSecondly, there is a cost factor in\n maintaining this system of Royal Consent.  It is difficult to qu\nantify this in terms of time taken or financial calculation of the support services provided, \nbut it involves \nan \nextensive reading of documentation and letter writing by officials in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, \nthe Clerks of Legislation in both Ho\nuses of Parliament, the Queen's Private Secretary at \nBuckingham Palace, and \nliaison with \nthe Queen's Solicitors\n,\n \nMessrs \nFarrer\n &amp; Co.\n \n&#xa0;\n14\n              \nThirdly, the\n requirement for Royal Consent \nis a procedure that can be manipulated by the government to sabotage a Pri\nvate Members' Bill of which is disapproves.\n  \nA\n government is perfectly capable of killing off any legislative proposal of which it disapproves, by \nusing its majority to vote down the measure at second reading, or more likely by depriving it of the necessa\nry parliamentary time to make progress.  \nBut to use the Royal Consent as a procedural device for this end, perhaps to circumvent gover\nnment intra-party dissent that m\night\n embarrass ministers\n, could be seen as an unconstitutional misuse of process.\n  \n&#xa0;\n15\n              \nThere is also an inherent danger that a misguided future Monarch or Prince of Wales holding strong moral views on the subject-matter of a Bill \ncovered by the Royal Consent procedure \nmight believe he \nor she \nis entitled to imp\nose his opinion on \nthe matter.  \nNo one imagines the Queen would intervene in this way, but constitutional arrangements governing hereditary public offices should provide for whatever types of personality might succeed by accident of birth. \n&#xa0;\nRoyal Consent and Royal Assent contrasted&#xa0;\n16\n              \nIt is instructive to compare \nand contrast the Royal Consent\n taking place \nduring the legislative process\n with the Royal Assent\n taking place \nafter the Bill has completed all \nits parliamentary\n stages\n.  The Royal Assent \nas a requirement before a Bill becomes law \nis a \ncommon law prerogative \npower, \nand its \npersonal exercise\n \nis \nunchallengeable \njudicially or otherwise\n.  \nIt is therefore a formidable legal power in the hands of the Monarch personally.  However, as it well known\n,\n there has been no withholding of such Assent (otherwise known as a Royal Veto) since 1707 when Queen Anne refus\ned the Scotch Militia Bill.  In \npractice, this power has become obsolete, and its exercise today would be tantamount to a rejection o\nf parliame\nntary authority\n, to\ngether with the government, and would almost certainly \nprecipitate a forced abdication and/or the monarchy'\ns replacement by a presidency.  \n&#xa0;\n17\n              \nBy co\nntrast \nthe Royal Consent has no common law or statutory basis,\n and is essentially a mat\nter of parliamentary custom\n.  But despite its\n minimal \nstatus as law\n,\n it carries potentially much greater political significance than Royal Assent.  This is because it provid\nes the Monarch\n and Prince of Wales \nwith advance notice of what is being proposed\n by the government\n, and therefore \nthe opportunity to \nexpress an \nopinion \non the matter \nand \nexert \npressure on the g\novernment in the event that he or she \ndisagrees.  \nEven though the Queen's and Prince's spokesmen have rebutted \npress speculation \nthat any such \npressure has been brought in the past,\n the \nexistence of the Consent procedure is \nbound to continue arousing \nunwelcome suspicions \nof Prince Charles' involvement in matters of public policy and government affairs.\n&#xa0;\nKeeping the Queen and Prince informed&#xa0;\n18\n              \nIt is a principle of natural justice and good governance that \nbodies \naffected, or likely to be affected,\n by government legislative proposals should be consulted and given the opportunity to express opinions.  There is nothing objectionable per se about the Queen or the Prince being consulted on matters affecting the \ninterests of the \nCrown and \nroyal family, a\nnd indeed ministers should welcome their views.  \n&#xa0;\n19\n              \nHowever\n the \nprivileged and formal process of\n Royal Consent \nforming an essential element in parliamentary proceedings \nis \nunnecessary for this. \nThere \nare already national pro\ncesses of public consultation\n \nwhere property matters affecting the public at large, including the royal Duchies, are concerned\n.  It \nmight be \ncourteous for a government department to give the Queen's o\nr Prince's offices notice of \npending \npolicy decision\ns\n that significantly affected the \nCrown estates or \nthe royal \nDuchies, but \nthis does not justify what is effectively a scrutiny reserve and power of veto over parliamentary proceedings on a Bill.  \nAnd o\nn \nmatters of \nstate where the prerogative might be concerned,\n it is \nalready \ngenerally acce\npted that the royal Head of State \n\"has, under a constitutional monarchy as ours, three rights - the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\"\n,\n and \na \ndialogue of this kind \ntake\ns place \nevery week \nat the Queen's \nprime ministerial \nmeetings.  \n&#xa0;\nConclusion: implementing the change&#xa0;\n20\n              \nIf agreement were reached that the \nRoyal Consent should be abolished\n, then so far as the UK Parliament is concerned, \nbecause the existing \nrequirement is\n founded on parliamentary usage, not common law or statute, \nremoval of the need for Consent\n could be implemented\n by a simple motio\nn \nput and resolution passed \nto this effect in each House\n of Parliament.  \n&#xa0;\n21\n              \nThe statutory provisions and standing orders pro\nviding for the Royal Consent in the legislative proceedings of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly of Wales are expressed to apply to \"\na Bill containing provisions which would, if the Bill were a Bill for an Act of\n Parliament, require\" such Conse\nnt.  The effect of this is that were the UK Parliament to remove the requirement for Royal Consent, the similar requirements in these two devolved legislatures would lapse.\n&#xa0;\n1 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n*\n \nPhD, LLD, Professor of Constitutional Law, King's College London; author of

Qvorup, 2013). \n \nIn this memora\nndum, the Queen's and/or Prince of Wale\ns\n'\n Consent to legislation is referred to as the \nRoyal Consent.\n \nThe need for the Prince of Wales' consent is \nlimited to provisions af\nfecting the Duchy of Cornwall of which he is Duke, his role as Prince and Steward of Scotland, and matters arising that affect his titles or interaction with the Royal Household: see Office of Parliamentary Counsel, \nQueen's or Princ\ne's Consent\n, 2012, chapter 3.\n  This is endorsed by recent public statements: \n\"It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by Parliament to provide consent to those Bills which Parliament has decided would affect Crown interests. The Sover\neign has not refused consent\n to any Bill affecting Crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers\" (Buckingham Palace spokesman); \"In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any Bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, un\nless advised to do so by ministers.  Every instance of the Prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record\" (Clarence House spokesman): quoted in the \nGuardian\n, 15 January 2013.\n \nGenerally see the guidelines on the\n Queen's and Prince's consent published by the Cabinet Office: \nGuide to Making Legislation\n (2013) and \nQueen's or Prince's Consent\n (Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 2012).\n \nIt is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this pr\nivate firm of Solicitors.\n \nIn current practice, this is normally at Third Reading in the House of Commons, and at Second Reading in the House of Lords.  Although in practice it is usually the minister who announces the Royal Consent, any Member of the Commons or Peer in the Lords ma\ny communicate the Royal Consent so long as they are a member of the Privy Council.\n \nOn the nature of parliamentary p\nrocedure, see Robert Blackburn &amp;\n Andrew Kennon, \nParliament: Functions, Practice &amp; Procedures\n (2nd ed., 2003), pp. 247-253\n.\n \nThis legal \nfact is recognised by the senior legal adviser in the process, the office of Parliamentary Counsel, whose guidance states, \"The decision on whether consent is required\n is for the House authorities\" (p.1, para. 1.3) and \"The issue of consent is entirely a m\natter of House procedure\" (p.17).\n \nSection 22, paragraph 7 of s\nchedule 3 of the \nScotland Act 1998 and section 111(4) of t\nhe Government of Wales Act 2006.\n \nIt is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this private firm of So\nlicitors.\n \nProcedurally such backbench Bills can be introduced on a motion without first going through Royal Consent though subsequently they need normal approval to progress: an example of this where Consent was refused was \nthe Military Actions Against I\nraq Bill, 1998-99, \nCommons Hansard\n, 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147 (Tam Dalyell).\n An apparent example of this was the withholding the Royal Consent to the \nMilitary Actions Against Iraq Bill, 1998-99, \nCommons Hansard\n, 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147, prese\nnted by Tam Dalyell.\n \nExcept in the case of Scottish and Welsh legislation: see para. 10 above.\n \n\"It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by Parliament to provide consent to those Bills which Parliament has decided would affect Crown \ninterests.  The Sovereign has not refused \nconsent to any Bill affecting Crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers\" (Buckingham Palace); \"In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any Bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, unless advised to do so by minist\ners.  Every instance of the Prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record\" (Clarence House): quoted in the \nGuardian\n, 15 January 2013.\n \nWalter Bagehot, \nThe English Constitution\n (1867; Fontana ed. 1963), p.111.\n"
