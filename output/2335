[normal]Written evidence from Reprieve[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Export licensing of components for [bold]weaponised[bold] unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As you may know, Reprieve is a legal action charity which works to ensure respect for the human rights of prisoners, including those whose rights may be infringed by counter-terror operations effected by the US and other governments.  This work includes investigation and advocacy in relation to the use of UAVs by the US in non-war zones to carry out its so-called “targeted killing” programme, which violates international law and a number of internationally recognised human rights.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of this work, Reprieve has been investigating the adequacy of export licensing procedures in relation to components that are exported to the US for use in 
[normal]weaponised
[normal] UAVs, including the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper.  As has been widely reported, 
[normal]such UAVs are used by the US for military purposes and to carry out strikes in 
[normal]areas where there is no declared armed conflict, such as Pakistan and Yemen.  From our research and correspondence with the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), we have identified severe shortcomings in the safeguards in place to ensure that UK-manufactured products are not used in these unlawful targeted killings.  Our concerns are twofold:

[normal]Licences granted for export of components for [bold]weaponised[bold] US UAVs  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Reprieve has identified a number of licenses granted to UK companies for the export to the US of components which appear to be used on 
[normal]weaponised
[normal] UAVS such as the Predator and/or Reaper.  As you know, BIS 
[normal]maintains a “consolidated list of strategic and dual-use items that require export authorization” (August 2012) (the “Consolidated List”), which is intended to include all military and dual-use items requiring an export licence, and incorporates the UK Military List and the UK and EU Dual-Use Lists, among others.  In recent correspondence, BIS has confirmed that some licences have been granted for the export of goods which are intended for use by the US government in 
[normal]weaponised
[normal] UAVs.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As you know, when considering applications for export licences in respect of controlled goods, BIS has said that it applies the “Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria” (the “Consolidated Criteria”).  These criteria include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore, pursuant to the Export Control Act 2002, controls may be imposed for military equipment and technology if their exportation or use is "capable of having a relevant consequence". "Relevant consequences" include "the carrying out anywhere in the world of (or of acts which facilitate) (a) acts threatening international peace and security; (b) acts contravening the international law of armed conflict; ... (d) breaches of human rights". 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The US’s use of drones in non-war zones, such as Pakistan and Yemen, is inconsistent with these criteria.  In particular, it is in breach of the international law of armed conflict.   
[normal]Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by one state against another, other than in certain very limited circumstances.  The US’s use of drones in areas where there is no armed conflict, including Pakistan and Yemen, fall so far short of the international humanitarian and human rights law requirements for legality, that none of those exceptions – such as arguments of ‘state consent’ or ‘self-defence’ - could render them lawful.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where there is no declared armed conflict, only international human rights law applies to determine whether specific killings are lawful.  International human rights law permits the intentional use of lethal force when strictly necessary and proportionate. Thus, “targeted killings” as typically understood (intentional and premeditated killings) cannot be lawful under international human rights law, because this allows intentional lethal force only when necessary to protect against a threat to life, and where there are no other means of preventing that threat to life. There is little public evidence that the targeted killings carried out fulfil this strict legal test. 
[normal]The US is not involved in an "armed conflict" with either of these states.  
[normal]Moreover, 
[normal]even if there were 
[normal]a declared armed conflict, such that international humanitarian law applied, 
[normal]the legality of any drone strike must still then be assessed in accordance with fundamental principles including distinction, proportionality, humanity and military necessity.  
[normal]“Living Under Drones”, a study published by Stanford and NYU in September 2012, was based on interviews with more than 60 people in North Waziristan, Pakistan - many of whom were survivors of strikes, with others having lost family members.
[normal]  The report documents
[normal] substantial evidence to suggest that these criteria are not met by drone strikes in Pakistan – including the reported failure to distinguish between “civilian” and “militant” targets, the large number of people killed in strikes, and the timing of particular strikes, which do not appear to be in response to any particular threat.  In particular, an 
[normal]exposé in the 
[normal]New York Times revealed that 
[normal]the Obama administration considers “all military-age males [killed] in a strike zone” to be “combatants . . . unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.”
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also significant evidence of “double” tap strikes, whereby the same area is hit by successive missiles, meaning rescuers have been struck.
[normal]  The UN Special 
[normal]Rapporteur
[normal] on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
[normal]Christof
[normal] 
[normal]Heyns
[normal], has observed, “[I]f civilian ‘rescuers’ are indeed being intentionally targeted, there is no doubt about the law: those strikes are a war crime.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The level of concern about the US use of drones is such that Ben 
[normal]Emmerson
[normal], the UN Special 
[normal]Rapporteur
[normal] on human rights and counterterrorism, is currently investigating the legality and impact of US targeted killings in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.
[normal]  In May this year, the Peshawar High Court in Pakistan declared the strikes in that country to be war crimes, 
[normal]and ordered the Pakistani government to take a series of steps to stop future strikes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even aside from the legality of specific strikes, the constant presence of US drones has devastating human rights impacts on communities living in affected regions due to their inability to protect themselves and their families from a strike, which could happen at any time.  “Living Under Drones” reported that communities in North Waziristan are being terrorised by the constant presence of drones overhead, with as many as six of these hovering over a village at any one time.  Those interviewed said that the widespread fear of drones has led people to shy away from social gatherings and inhibited their willingness to carry out day-to-day activities and important community functions, including attending school or funerals.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is quite clear, therefore, that in addition to violating the right to life, the US’s use of drones in non-war zones infringes numerous human rights of those living in the affected areas, including the right to freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, to privacy, family life and a home, to education and to an adequate standard of health and well-being.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The impact of drones on children’s rights, in particular, was recently highlighted in the Annual Report of the UN Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict.
[normal]  This report noted an “increasingly worrisome number of reports of child casualties” in the course of drone strikes.  It further reported that the mixed use of armed and surveillance drones has “resulted in permanent fear in some communities, affecting the psychosocial well-being of children and hindering the ability of such communities to protect their children”.  In addition, the Secretary-General highlighted the impact on access to education, in some cases due to fear among children of drone strikes.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In light of the use by the US of 
[normal]weaponised
[normal] drones in violation of international law and human rights, it is of extremely concern that BIS, the FCO and MOD consider the grant of export licences for components to be consistent with the Consolidated Criteria.  Such a policy risks implicating the UK in the harm carried out by US drones, as well as severely damaging its international reputation.

[normal]Components for [bold]weaponised[bold] UAVs not requiring export licenses[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We are also aware of certain components being exported to the US for use in Predator and Reaper UAVs which do not appear on the Consolidated List, and as such do not currently require export licences.  This is clearly of great concern, because it undermines the entire purpose of the export licensing regime, in that components specifically intended for use on weapons capable of carrying out great destruction may be exported free from any governmental scrutiny at all.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have drawn this situation to BIS’s attention, asking the department to consider adding certain specific components to the Consolidated List.  However, BIS has indicated it does not intend to add such components to the list because this export control would operate solely at the national level and therefore could easily be circumvented and would have no effect on the export of these products from other parts of the European Union.  We do not accept that properly implemented controls could be easily circumvented purely because those same controls are not in place elsewhere in the EU.  Furthermore, we certainly do not consider that because these controls may not be implemented in other countries, BIS should refrain from doing so.  The UK should consider and put in place its export controls on the basis of its own priorities and international obligations, rather than adopting a passive approach which would result in the lowest standard of regulation being applied across all EU countries.
