"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (CCS05)&#xa0;&#xa0;Background&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nResponses to QuestionsRes\nponses have been provided to questions that are pertinent to PML’s research and expertise.\nWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? \n&#xa0;\nWhat contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?\nAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully dev\neloping CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?\n&#xa0;\nFor further information, please see \nhttp://www.pml.ac.uk/media/news_highlights/qics_update.aspx\n \n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? \n&#xa0;\nAre there any safety issues ass\nociated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? \nIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?\nCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in \nthis?\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat ar\ne the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
