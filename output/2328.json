"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport [WAS0037]&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIncreasing Women’s Participation in Sport&#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData from the Active People survey for the year to April 2013 shows 6.8 million (30.5 per cent) women (aged 16+) taking part in sport at least once a week, every week, at moderate intensity. This represents an increase of over 530,000 since 2005 when London won the bid to host the 2012 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Games. The gender gap is wide at over 1.7 million between women and men (over 40 per cent of men play sport each week) but it is also narrowing – in 2011 it was 2.2 million. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are investing heavily in increasing women’s participation in sport. As a result of this Government’s decision to restore the National Lottery shares to good causes, namely the arts, sport, heritage and the voluntary sector, sport is in a better financial position to fund new and existing programs. The combination of Exchequer and Lottery funding benefits both elite female athletes and grass roots initiatives for girls and women. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor elite sport, the Government will continue to invest in the run up to Rio 2016. The Prime Minister has identified a “direct link between elite success and participation in sport” and we are confident that the £335 million of funding for UK Sport ahead of Rio 2016 will be instrumental in achieving Olympic success and continuing to inspire a generation post-London 2012. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis funding will be crucial to retaining and building on the impact of the Olympics for women’s sport which showcased positive female role models such as Jessica Ennis-Hill and Ellie Simmonds. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, all of the UK Sport-funded elite athletes will offer up to five days per year to support grassroots sport. As role models, they can inspire girls and young women to take up sport. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are significant drop off points in the numbers of young people doing sport regularly, at 14, 16 and 18 and this is particularly stark for girls, with male participation at 18 at 65.9% doing sport at least once a week, compared to female participation at 41.0%.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government is therefore working at ways to engage young people, from an early age, in sport. We recently announced funding for primary school sport worth £150m per annum for the next two years. This will give primary school children the skills and opportunities they need to participate in – and develop a passion for – sport that they will take with them into secondary school and beyond.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunded by the Department for Education (£80m), the Department of Health (£60m) and DCMS (£10m) the new funding will see funds go directly into the hands of primary school headteachers for them to spend on improving the quality of PE and sport for all children. The funded is ring-fenced, subject to inspection by Ofsted and can only be spent on sport and provision in schools. No other funding for schools is ring-fenced.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government is further working towards making sport more accessible and inclusive for both girls and boys via the Sainsbury’s School Games competition. This is a voluntary framework for competitive school sport, inspired by the Olympic &amp; Paralympic Games, and an important strategy for creating a meaningful sporting legacy from the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is an inclusive programme encouraging girls and boys of all ages and abilities to take part in competitive sport. To date, around 60% of all English schools are actively engaged in the programme.\n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, the intra-school competition at level 1 of the School Games provides an opportunity for young people to engage in a range of sports at a slightly less competitive level, something which the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF) have identified as being an important factor in increasing girls’ participation in school sport. (Changing the Game, for Girls, WSFF). \n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn fact, data from the beginning of this year show that the School Games has successfully engaged with female participants, with girls’ participation exceeding that of boys’.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent research from the WSFF suggests that girls and women do want to play sport. Despite lower participation rates, there is greater demand from girls and women than from men, with 12 million women wanting to play more sport. Over half of this demand comes from women and girls who are currently inactive. The demand also exists for the under 16s – research shows that 74% of 15 year old girls would like to be more active (Changing the Game, for Girls, WSFF).\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs such, alongside school sport, we are also putting in place measures to increase female participation in sport through Sport England’s Youth and Community Sport Strategy\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSport England is committed to increasing participation in sport. This is reflected by an investment of over £1 billion in the strategy over 2012-17. As part of this, they are investing £100 million a year in 46 national governing bodies of sport (NGBs). This investment is focused on four outcomes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVirtually all of the 46 NGBs have a quantified target in each of these four areas. While there is no separate target for participation by women, in many sports (tennis and swimming are obvious examples) it is difficult to increase participation without having a good offer for women and girls.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSport England \nare\n also putting in place a number of projects specifically targeting women and girls. They are working with NGBs to establish a number of “girls only” satellite clubs - outposts of community sports clubs specifically targeting 11-25 year olds. 150 colleges will have a coordinator to make sport happen for students and they will also be specifically targeting female students to get involved. By 2017, every secondary school in England will have been offered a satellite community sports club providing expert coaching. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2011, 256,297\n&#xa0;\n young people aged 14-25 have attended a free or discounted 6-8 week sports coaching course, of which eight out of ten have been shown to have still been playing the sport three months later. This retention rate is significantly higher than other interventions. Generally speaking, a retention rate of 50% is considered untypically high, which highlights how successful the “Sportivate” scheme is in comparison with its 80% retention rate.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSport England have recently extended the age range of both their Sportivate and satellite club programmes from 14+ to 11+, giving all secondary school children increased opportunities to participate in sport outside of the school gates at local community sports clubs.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnother Sport England initiative aimed at engaging more girls and women in sport is the Place Based Pilot launched in Bury on 10 May 2013. With £2.3 million funding, this intensive campaign is focused on changing the sporting habits of local women and girls by targeting and engaging with the inactive. The four pillars to the main programme are: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAfter the first year the intention is for this scheme to be rolled out nationwide implementing the successes and discoveries gleaned from the pilot.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to Whole Sport Plan funding, Sport England put £8.2 million of Lottery funding into its 2010 Themed Round \nActive Women \nto support 20 projects to get more women from disadvantaged communities playing sport. At the end of last year, Active Women had engaged almost 30,000 women and was having a positive impact. \nReaching the target groups and retention had proved difficult however. With the Bury Pilot, the aim is to reach 45,000 women in Bury and retain 10,000 of them.\n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSport England is continuing to fund the WSFF, providing over £1 million for 2011-13. The WSFF provides specialist advice on women’s participation in sport to the NGBs, with a focus on:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, Government is starting to engage directly with the private sector. Statistics show that going to the gym is the second highest activity that women take part in on a weekly basis with 8.2% of women participating in at least one 30 minute gym session per week (Active People Survey October 2011 to October 2012). \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Culture Secretary held a summit of commercial gym operators in January of this year to look at their role in attracting and retaining women and girls in gym and fitness, extending the range of what is available for girls and women in gyms and how that might be improved and working in partnership to drive greater sports’ participation by this group. The roundtable discussions were held as part of the Government’s Body Confidence Campaign. This campaign was set up by Lynne Featherstone, then Minister for Equalities, in 2010 and is now led by Jo Swinson, Minister for Women and Equalities.  It works with an expert advisory group drawn from across industry and the third sector to promote:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2013 Body Confidence progress report has demonstrated the significant successes achieved to date while recognising there is still much to be done by outlining the on-going commitment to work across industry, government and the third sector to engage support, catalyse innovation and best practice, and ensure joined-up thinking. It will also work with a range of partners on issues including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Raising the profile of women’s sport in the media&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2012 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Games have been instrumental in raising the profile of women’s sport, not only by showcasing the successes of female athletes but also by highlighting a contrast with the media attention and sponsorship interest paid to women’s sport outside of the Games. \n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe sporting prowess on display during London 2012 demonstrated the potential for much greater media coverage of women’s sport: 371 British Women competed in the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games; 39% of all Team GB medals at London 2012 were won by women and 47% of Paralympics GB medals.\n&#xa0;\n28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGenerating and maintaining enthusiasm for sport among women and girls is crucial to sustaining the sporting legacy of the Games and media coverage is pivotal to that legacy being fully realised. This is indeed a Government priority, where we are encouraged by the good progress in securing coverage for women’s major sporting events, including very recent events over the summer.\n&#xa0;\n29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Culture Secretary wrote to national broadcasters in September 2012 about the importance of keeping the spotlight on our successful female athletes and their sporting accomplishments.\n We have urged all the major broadcasters to do more, and hosted a roundtable in January 2013 which bought together broadcasters, journalists, and women leaders in sport including representatives from the BBC, ITV, Sky, the Women’s Commission for the Future of Women’s Sport, the Daily Telegraph, the Times and Sunday Times and sports bodies including British Cycling, British Rowing, England Netball and the Football Association, to look at how we can improve coverage. We have seen some progress on this, particularly from the broadcasters.\n&#xa0;\n30.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcomed the BBC’s decision to broadcast all of England's UEFA European Women's Championship games in Sweden in July 2013, with live broadcasting of all of England's matches, both semi-finals and the final across BBC Two and BBC Three. The three NatWest Women's International T20 matches were broadcast live on Sky Sports with the latter two being played directly before the men's fixtures, and all seven fixtures were covered live on BBC Radio. \n&#xa0;\n31.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, the ECB chose the Women's Ashes NatWest ODI fixture on 20 August 2013 as its first non-televised fixture to be streamed live on its digital platforms. David Collier, Chief Executive of ECB, said: \"This is a further example of our commitment to increasing both the reach of women's cricket and our digital presence. The Women's Ashes Series presents a fantastic opportunity for us to inspire more women and girls to get involved with our sport, and we hope that the ECB's online services will provide a great boost for the women's game in England and Wales.\"\n&#xa0;\n32.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe netball coverage on Sky Sports and BBC Five Live Sports Extra’s ball-by-ball coverage of England’s games in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in February has also been a source of encouragement, not to mention BT Sport having acquired the rights of the Women’s Tennis Tour to broadcast as much as 800 hours a year of live tennis and expressed their intention to include more women’s sport as part of their schedules. The deal runs until the end of 2016 and includes coverage of 21 tournaments per year. Simon Green, head of BT Sport and member of our Advisory Group on Women and Sport, said: ‘This is our first women’s sport for the channels and we see a genuine opportunity to really develop the exposure for women’s sport with our new channels.’\n&#xa0;\n33.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is still more work to be done, however, and the aims of the initial roundtable with broadcasters are still high on our agenda, namely to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n34.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe continue to keep abreast of new developments and encourage examples of broadcasters acting upon these aims. We are encouraged by Sky Sport’s recent announcement to start a new weekly half hour show focusing on Women in Sport. \n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDCMS will be considering the commercial viability of increasing the media profile of women’s sport taking into account the impact that the quality of the sport, venue, timing and size of the audience has on a potential sponsor’s decision to offer funding as well as on a broadcaster’s willingness to increase its media coverage. \n&#xa0;\n36.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe January meeting with broadcasters noted that some sports had been very successful in promoting the women’s game to broadcasters. These included integrated sports (where men and women compete at the same event such as athletics) or those with an integrated sponsorship deal such as cycling.  Others such as cricket had attracted media partners through sustained engagement and by developing an offer that appealed to the broadcasters. \nThere was collective agreement that interesting stories and people attract media coverage and the sports had a bigger role to play in making these stories more easily accessible to the media. \n&#xa0;\n37.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvent organisers also have an important role to play (i.e. top sports presentation at London 2012 showcased minority sports in a far more engaging and informative light than usual). TV coverage is far more attractive to viewers if it showed full rather than empty stadiums. Nevertheless, many viewers want only “big eventers”, and not typically interested in non-Olympic type coverage such as World Championships, despite the roll call of participants and level of performance being virtually the same.\n&#xa0;\n38.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Commission on the Future of Women’s Sport, established by the WSFF in 2008 with Government and cross-party support, also released a report in 2011 which looked at the barriers to commercial investment in women’s sport as well as potential solutions (Big Deal? 2011: The case for commercial investment in women’s sport). Chaired by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, it brings together leading figures from sport, business, and the media to address the issues of leadership, commercial investment and profile for women’s sport in the UK. The report outlines 10 reasons to attract potential investors and sets out ways in which the various stakeholders can work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.\n&#xa0;\n39.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government has also made progress in identifying problems and putting forward solutions relating to the representation of women’s sport in the print media. DCMS organised a workshop on 16 May with the CEO and Head of Public Affairs of the Professional Publishers Association, alongside editors and representatives from magazines including Company, Grazia, Cosmopolitan, Bliss, Glamour, Now, Stylist and Closer, and National Governing Bodies of Sports most popular with women. \n&#xa0;\n40.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result of the networking opportunity provided by this event, the\n All England Netball Association have started \ntraining Vogue and Cosmopolitan on a weekly basis and these two teams are due to play each other in October. Another success story following the workshop saw Bliss magazine feature an article on netball in its August edition. The fact that these magazines are beginning to promote sport to female readers, where usually \nthey would be more reluctant to do so indicates a small but positive shift in attitudes towards the role and relevance of sport in media targeted at women.\n&#xa0;Increasing the number of women on the sport’s governing bodies&#xa0;\n41.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are also working to improve the representation of women at senior levels of sport management and attract a stronger field of women candidates for the DCMS appointments to our sports bodies.\n&#xa0;\n42.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent 2013 WSFF Trophy Women? \nreport\n has revealed that despite last year’s 1% increase on the 2009 figure for the proportion of female Board Members within NGBs and in senior management roles, women still make up only 22% of the total number of Board Members.\n&#xa0;\n43.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy way of response, Sport England and UK Sport are both encouraging the sports governing bodies to increase the number of women on their Boards, as part of our work to improve the governance in sport. In return for public funding we have made clear to sports that we expect them to have at least 25% women on their boards by 2017. UK Sport and Sport England are both leading by example on this with women in senior management positions within the organisations, both at Board and CEO level.\n&#xa0;\n44.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeyond the remit of Sport, following Lord Davies’s 2011 report on Women on Boards, unprecedented progress has been made in the area of leadership. Women now account for 17.4% (as at 1 March 2013) of directors on FTSE 100 company boards (up from 12.5% in Feb 2011) and 13.8% of FTSE 250 board directors (up from 7.8%) showing that the UK’s voluntary business-led strategy is having an effect (Women on Boards 2013).\n&#xa0;\n45.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, more needs to be done within the private and public sector not only to maintain momentum but also to ensure we see more women making their way up the management chain and making it to Senior Management and Executive Director \nlevel\n where progress is slow. \n&#xa0;\n46.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the past few months progress is now starting to be made within the FTSE 250. For instance, since March 2013 within the FTSE 250, 40% of board appointments have been women (compared to 12% in the FTSE 100) and 50% of new Executive Directors have been women (compared to 0% in the FTSE 100). We should also be able to expect updated numbers on this in response to one the Government’s recommendations that FTSE 350 Chief Executives set out the percentage of women they aim to have on their Executive Committees including Senior Management levels within their organisation in 2015 by the end of this month (September 2013). Not only will this be for the benefit of women but also to the economy and will also support our arguments to the EU Commission that quotas are not necessary and help us meet the Government’s 50% target for all new appointments to public boards being female.\n&#xa0;\n47.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations outlined in the June 2013 report by the Women’s Business Council, set up last year to advise Government on optimising women’s contribution to growth, have built upon the Government’s approach to this issue and proves that the lack of female representation is an issue that extends beyond the remit of sports boards. By way of response, in addition to a series of early actions for Government designed to address each of the four key areas identified by the Council, the Government has set up a Ministerial Taskforce to drive forward delivery of the Council’s recommendations which will publish an action plan in the autumn. \n&#xa0;\n48.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis area is one that will be addressed by the new Women and Sport Advisory Board, Chaired by the Culture Secretary. Its membership comprises experts from across sport, business and media, including Karren Brady, Clare Connor, Tracy Crouch, Simon Green, Helena Morrissey and Judy Murray. The inaugural meeting of the Board was 17 September, where they considered how to help drive forward work across these key areas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n49.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the Board develops, it will consider other potential areas around women and sport such as commercial opportunities, coaching and recognition. \n&#xa0;\n50.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough progress is being made towards increasing women’s participation in sport, raising the media profile and encouraging the inclusion of more women in senior management positions of sport boards, it is equally apparent that there is still more work to be done. The Government is actively looking at strategic ways to improve female sporting habits and change negative perceptions towards women in sport and will continue to constructively review and revise its work with this aim in mind. The new Board will have an important role to play in this area and \nwill present its initial findings next summer.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
