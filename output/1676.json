"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association (HOT47)&#xa0;The Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association (ADBA) is the trade association that represents the range of interests and matters related to the anaerobic digestion of organic materials (“AD”) across the \nUK\n. The organisation has over \n350\n members from acros\ns the AD industry, including farmers, local authorities, waste management companies, supermarkets, food processors, plant operators, energy and water companies, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, consultants, financiers and supporting service companies\n. \n&#xa0;1 What is anaerobic digestion?1.1 Biogas generated from the anaerobic digestion (AD) process can make a significant contribution to delivering affordable low-carbon heat, in both the domestic and non-domestic sectors.\n1.2 AD\n is fuelled most commonly \nby household food and garden waste, farm slurry, waste from food processing plants and supermarkets, and crop residues. These feedstocks react with micro-organisms to produce a biogas, which is approximately 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide, and digestat\ne, which can be applied to farmland to reduce the need for damaging artificial fertilisers.\n1.3 The AD process delivers a number of important strategic economic and environmental benefits for the UK. The sector could produce 40TWh of energy (equivalent to \nover 10% of domestic gas demand) of biogas based on the available feedstock in the UK, providing 35,000 jobs as well as supporting the development of a supply chain with very significant export potential.\n1.4 As well as the renewable energy generated, trea\nting organic waste through AD realises other significant environmental benefits, allowing critical nutrients in these wastes, such as phosphorus, to be returned to land to support food production. Large greenhouse gas emissions savings will also be achieve\nd through treating organic waste such as food waste through AD, rather than other options such as landfill or incineration. AD also helps to support farming operations, for example purpose grown crops (PGCs) for AD are grown as break crops which complement\n agricultural rotations and improve soil quality\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2 Role of AD in heat generation2.1 Biogas can be combusted in a CHP engine to generate heat and power or it can be upgraded to a renewable natural gas equivalent (biomethane) and injected directly into \nthe gas grid. \nThe first commercial-scale biomethane to grid project in the UK started injecting renewable gas in late 2012. \n2.2 \nAD \ntechnology \nhas helped businesses in a range of sectors \nreduc\ne\n their energy bills, as well as enhancing their sustainability \ncredentials. Farmers, food and drink processers and water companies are particular leaders in the field, \nas they can recycle organic wastes to generate the power and heat their businesses need\n.\n \nAs well as using the biogas to meet their on-site energy \nneeds, operators can also supply heat to nearby buildings or businesses.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3 Barriers to heat useIssues with the Renewable Heat Incentive3.1 There are few technological barriers to the greater use of renewable heat from the AD process – the viability of\n the technology has already been proven in the UK and across Europe. What is holding back the industry is the uncertainties around certain aspects of support under the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and the resultant problems this creates in terms of the a\nbility to finance infrastructure developments.\n3.2 At present the RHI only supports biogas projects with a thermal capacity up to 200kW thermal capacity. This means that the vast majority of biogas CHP projects are effectively forced to waste any heat they\n generate, as the cost of developing the heat infrastructure is prohibitive without RHI support. DECC have committed to addressing this issue and allowing support for biogas combustion levels at all levels, but delays to this \nhave not helped\n investment in \nbiogas CHP projects. We have submitted evidence to DECC on this point which we would be happy to share with the Committee if it would be helpful. \n3.3 Similarly, a lack of a preliminary accreditation mechanism under the RHI is also \nholding back\n the develop\nment of the biogas heat and biomethane injection market. DECC introduced a degression system from June 2013, which will see tariffs automatically reduced if budget spend under the scheme reaches pre-determined levels. \nUnlike the electricity Feed in Tariff\n,\n they have not introduced a preliminary accreditation model which would allow developers to \n‘\nlock in\n’\n a tariff rate once they have reached a certain stage in their project. \nThis provides a significant financial risk to project developers, especially for la\nrger plants which typically take at least a year to build. \nAccess to food waste3.4 \nT\nhe development of the whole AD sector is dependent on being able to access food waste from businesses and local authorities\n. O\nf \nthe total \npotential\n energy the industry could generate, over 60% comes from these sources\n. While the first priority when dealing with food waste should of course be to reduce the quantity generated, \nfor example by \nredistributing uneaten food whenever possible, there will alw\nays be a large portion of unavoidable food waste (\ne.g.\n vegetable peelings, teabags) that must be dealt with. \n3.5 Government confirmed in their 2011 \nWaste Review\n  that AD offer\ns\n the “greatest environmental benefit” of any food waste treatment\n \n– \nbut \nat present only 7% of food waste in the UK is treated through AD, while 35% is still landfilled.\n3.6 One of the key ways in which\n government can do this is through the introduction of separate food waste collections, which allow AD operators improved access to a less contaminated feedstock, while also improving the recycling rate for other dry recyclates.\n3.7 A ban on sending biodeg\nradable waste to landfill would also deliver similar benefits for the AD industry, as well as wider environmental and economic benefits. A recent \nGreen Alliance report\n  \ndemonstrated that UK \norganisations could save £508m in avoided landfil\nl costs and £693m could be generated in the value recovered from sending our food waste to anaerobic digestion. \n&#xa0;\n3.8 Scotland and Wales are far ahead of England in terms of supporting moves towards these more sustainable waste management practices. Under \ntheir \nZero Waste Plan\n, the\n Scottish Government has provided the \nlegislative framework to support rolling out food waste collections across all local authorities and businesses by 2015 and for banning \norganic waste to landfill by 2020.\n3.9 Wales has also made important progress in delivering more effective waste managem\nent through statutory waste recovery targets. Welsh local authorities are currently required to recover (this includes AD) 52% of municipal waste, rising to 70% by 2024, and \nwhere councils recycle source-segregated food waste using AD, it will fund up to 2\n5% of the council’s food waste treatment costs under 15 year guaranteed contracts. This has helped to facilitate a situation today whereby 88% of Welsh households have separate food waste collections, in comparison to just 13% of households in England. \n&#xa0;\nConsultation Questions1. There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?ADBA believes that \nproposals for \nsustainability criteria for biomass are generally fair – with the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) stipulating that AD plants t\nreating non-waste feedstocks must achieve a 60% reduction in GHG emissions.\n \nThe criteria also require generators of renewable heat to meet land use criteria, \nconsisting of general restrictions on the use of biomass sourced from land with high biodiversity or high carbon stock value such as primary forest, peatland or wetland. \nHowever, the \ngreenhouse gas \ncomparator for biomethane risks causing market distortion\ns. Biomethane projects will be required to make 60% savings on the EU fossil heat average. Compared to the EU energy mix in general this is a very stringent requirement\n.\n Sustainability \ncriteria for the Renewables Obligation are based on the carbon intensit\ny of electricity, which is much higher, so effectively a less stringent requirement. In the case of AD, projects have a choice of either generating electricity (and heat) or biomethane from their biogas, so this difference could risk the development of bio\nmethane injection projects in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nIn terms of the longer term development of European bioenergy sustainability criteria, leaked \nEuropean Commission proposals\n \nsuggest that future policy could exacerbate this problem. \nThe proposed criteria are very similar to those existing criteria under the RO and RHI, calling for 60% GHG savings over fossil fuel comparators, \nand the protection of peatland, land with high bio\ndiversity value and land with high carbon stock. Unlike the RHI however, the suggested comparator for biomethane injection is EU average emissions from natural gas, \nwhich has an even lower carbon footprint than the \nEU fossil heat average. This would lead t\no overly stringent criteria as natural gas is a relatively clean fuel in the fossil mix. \n&#xa0;\nThis also doesn’t take into account that biomethane to grid is one of the most efficient forms of bioenergy conversion, (\ni.e.\n the energy which can be generated per \nunit of land). Empirical data from the German Energy Agency has compared biomethane to other biofuels in terms of km driven per hectare of fuel production, which showed that biomethane was almost three times as land use efficient as bioethanol, biodiesel a\nnd rapeseed oil.\n In 2010 the Carbon Trust suggested that generating biomethane is the most effective option for biogas from a carbon perspective, assuming further decarbonisation of the electricity mix, though this does depend on the particular circumstanc\nes of a project. \nWe agree with the principle of land use criteria, but also believe that as well as seeking to minimise the negative environmental impacts of biomass, the criteria should take into account the wider benefits that each form of biomass can d\neliver through a comparable set of criteria.\n L\nand is needed to grow food, fuel and fibre, and all should be considered at national and international level. In the long term, sustainability criteria for financial incentives should consider land use in this \nway, and we believe that greater research and development funding is required into mechanisms for setting land use policy. \nFor now, sustainability criteria should go as far as possible to encourage energy production which integrates with good farming prac\ntice and other positive externalities, alongside efficient generation. For example, purpose grown crops (PGC) for AD typically integrate well into agricultural rotations, acting as a break or cover crop to help improve soil quality and yields, reduce chemi\ncal inputs to control persistent weeds and pests, and bring marginal farmland into use. The land used to grow PGC is not tied up for the whole year (or even whole decades), and during the rest of the time is available to grow crops for food. Unlike other f\norms of bioenergy, bioenergy generated through AD recycles the nutrients contained in the feedstock in the form of digestate, which can then be returned to the soil to improve soil quality, displace artificial fertilisers and support farming and food produ\nction. \n&#xa0;\nAny future criteria around indirect land use change (ILUC) must take into account these wider sustainability benefits that the growth of purpose grown crops for AD \ncan \nrealise. \n&#xa0;\n3. What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? As set out in our introduction, biogas is a flexible renewable fuel which can suit a variety of energy \nrequirements. As a constantly generated source of energy, biogas can be used on-site to meet existing power requirements, or exported for use to nearby businesses or organisations.\nBiogas can also be upgraded to biomethane and then injected into the gas gr\nid, playing a key role in helping to decarbonise the gas grid. Upgrading biogas to biomethane is around 98% energy efficient, and as biogas is a limited resource, this is an \nimportant part\n of the market that must be encouraged. \n&#xa0;4. Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?&#xa0;For biogas, a lack of support under the RHI for projects with a thermal capacity over 200kW \nhas \nclearly hamper\ned\n the financial viability of many projects. Almost all biogas projects in the UK use CHP engines, but without R\nHI support the vast majority are not able to develop the infrastructure to make use of the \nexcess \nheat generated and it is wasted. \n&#xa0;\nAssisting the conversion of existing biogas CHP plants is therefore a simple way of enabling the delivery of a significant \nquantity of renewable heat, particularly in the commercial sector.\n There is currently over 90MW of installed electrical capacity from the UK’s biogas CHP plants which have an electrical capacity over 200kW (outside the water sector), and given that the the\nrmal capacity of a CHP installation will typically be higher than its electrical capacity, there is clearly great scope for delivering renewable heat as a result of this simple change to the RHI outlined above.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
