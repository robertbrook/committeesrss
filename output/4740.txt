[[[ry]]]&#xa0;On behalf of the Local Government Association (LGA), I wanted to get in touch regarding the above inquiry which your Committee is undertaking. Specifically, I was prompted to get in touch following the evidence session you held on 4 November, when I understand witnesses referred to the LGA’s Hidden Talents project, information on which can be found online.&#xa0;This subject has more recently been brought into the work we are undertaking around economic growth, as part of our Rewiring Public Services campaign. The premise of the campaign is that, if we are to ensure a sustainable model of local government which can deliver reliable public services for the future, we need radical new approaches in order to survive the unprecedented financial cuts being imposed on local authorities – 43% across the current Parliament.&#xa0;Generating economic growth has a key role to play and as such has become central to our campaign. Local government is one of the few parts of the public sector that uses its resources to drive growth.  We need full financial autonomy to maximise those assets to invest in development, support business, and generate jobs.&#xa0;Local government regularly identifies the poor responsiveness of the skills system as one of the enduring barriers to local economic growth. The job opportunities for young people in most sectors vary between local economies. However, successive national skills systems have not been able to effectively respond to this demand.&#xa0;Councils can help improve the return on public investment into skills by empowering employers to take leadership over training. For instance, through the planning system, local authorities are perfectly placed to identify new developments, work with employers to identify their employment needs early on and equip young people with the skills to take jobs.&#xa0;However central government funding and performance management of colleges and training providers has side-lined councils and employers, making this kind of activity extremely difficult to deliver in practice. The LGA continues to recommend, through our Rewiring Public Services campaign, that the Government devolve the majority of 16 to 19 year old, and post 19 year old, skills and apprenticeship budgets to localities. This would enable partners to adapt skills provision to meet local employer demand, as well as to help drive longer-term local economic productivity.&#xa0;9 December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2 of 1&#xa0; Details of our work through the Hidden Talents project can be found at  http://www.local.gov.uk/hidden-talents Information on the campaign can be found at  http://www.local.gov.uk/campaigns
