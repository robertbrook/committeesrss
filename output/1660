defaultAppendix A:defaultWhy the Part L decision is flaweddefaultFirstly, at 
defaultconsultation stage the cost of the ‘halfway point’ policy was stated to be £453 million (i.e. it would cost house builders that amount to comply with it). This figure was based on out-of-date figures, for example the costs for installing solar PV have fall
defaulten by approximately 45% since this time. The real cost to house builders would in fact be £317 million. In the published changes DECC acknowledges the latest solar PV costs in the new non-domestic buildings analysis and yet the less ambitious target was st
defaultill preferred.
defaultSecondly, the benefits to private consumers were ignored. The Impact Assessment for options for the 2013 building regulations openly failed to take into account the benefits to consumers of the policy, contrary to the rules in the Treasury ‘
defaultgreen book’, which specifies that all costs and benefits
default defaultshould be assessed. This meant that benefits to consumers of fuel savings of £375 million were ignored.
defaultIf the
defaultse 
defaultfigures are used instead
default, 
defaultthey show that the halfway approach would benefit society by
default £58m (£375m benefit - £317m costs)
default as shown in the graph below:

defaultTo demonstrate th

defaultincreased deployment for
default GSHPs
default, the chart below shows the 2020 annual 
defaultresource costs rate per technology. Annual resource cost measures the annual net incremental costs of installing a renewable heating system instead of a conventional one. The costs take into account the annual operational benefits (if any) but exclude any 
defaultsubsidy
default, thereby identifying, in the absence of any market interventions, an underlying merit order of options available in meeting a particular policy objective
default. With sensible assumptions about price reductions
default from now to 2020
default, GSHPs are a valuable inves
defaulttment and provide a cheaper way of producing renewable energy than 
defaultsome 
defaultother technologies
default already supported by 
defaultG
defaultovernment through other schemes such as the Renewables Obligation
default. Ther
defaulte is therefore a strong case to increase the subsidies paid to GSHPs, ev
defaulten if initially that subsidy is higher than some other technologies used to meet the renewables target, in order to ensure their proper deployment as a cost effective means for the country overall in meeting the renewables target.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are therefore supportive of an approach to the tariff cap which considers both the 
defaultCarbon Floor Price (
defaultCPF
default)
default and 
defaultEmissions Trading Scheme (
defaultETS
default)
default as part of the calculation of the cap, as this brings the price of support up to levels which would be more ef
defaultfective for driving the uptake of GSHPs. GSHPs are an important technology to deliver Government Heat Strategy projections and drive EU targets, and it is therefore right to offer a level of support to drive the market for this technology, and in turn brin
defaultg the capital costs of installation down.

defaultAppendix C:defaultGdefaultround Source Heat Pumpdefault tariff reviewdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe below chart employs industry data to show the required tariff to achieve a 12% RoR. The chart shows that the average tariff for all heat output (8.4p/kWh) f
defaultalls slightly above the proposed range suggesting that the tariff needs to be at least at the upper end of the proposed range.
