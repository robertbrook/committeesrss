[[[ [FBB0043]]]]&#xa0;I like advert free radio and believe it should be preserved however I don’t see why a commercial station couldn’t bid for the money to provide advert free programmes.  It wouldn’t bother me if there were adverts in between shows.I think the current licence fee is completely wrong and the fact that a man from the state broadcaster can come to your door and threaten you with prosecution is cringeworthy.  Now that everyone has digital the television channels should be locked until a subscription is taken out, the subscription should be flexible, it should be possible to pay for a month or twelve months or a single event or programme.  The iplayer could have advertising, however if you are a subscriber you could enter a code and watch advert free.  Perhaps an online only subscription to watch live via the iplayer could be on offer cheaper than a main Television subscription.  The most important thing is to radically cut down the cost of the compulsory licence to just cover the cost of Radio, a small website and news.  All television should be supported by advertising or subscription.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
