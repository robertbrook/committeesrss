"&#xa0;\n Supplementary written evidence from Rt Hon Chris Grayling MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Ministry of Justice, following the evidence session on 16 October 2013&#xa0;Protocol 36 processWhile giving evidence to \nthe Justice\n Committee on 16 October 2013, I committed to providing you \nwith some additional information relating to Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions \nwith a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions (the \nProbation FD). For ease of reference, this measure is number 88 on the list of measures \nwithin the scope of the 2014 decision that we placed in the House library and further \ninformation on it can be found in Command Paper 8671.\nAs I explained while giving evidence, one of the key issues the Government had in mind \nwhen considering which measures to rejoin\n \nwas that those measures will permanently come \nunder the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) once we rejoin them. As you \nknow, many of the pre-Lisbon measures were political compromises in order to secure unanimity and as a result can be broadly drafted. If the UK Parliament enacted similarly \nbroad legislation UK courts would have to interpret that legislation were it ambiguous or \nunclear. Of course in the case of \nEU legislation, it would ultimately be the ECJ which would \ndecide how a measure should be interpreted. The key issue is what happens if the \ninterpretation of that legislation by the ECJ results in unwelcome outcomes for the UK which \nthe Government wants to address. If it was a UK law and a UK court then the UK Parliament \ncould respond. However, with an EU law and an ECJ judgment the - UK cannot act \nunilaterally to amend the law.\nWith this in mind, the Government assessed each measure and considered whether on \nbalance the UK should seek to rejoin it. In the case of the Probation FD, it has only been implemented by a limited number of Member States and we are not aware of it ever having \nbeen used to date. As such, at this stage it is very difficult to make an assessment as to how \nthe measure might or might not work.\nWhen I made this point while giving evidence I touched upon the measure's vagueness in\n \nrelation to deportation and committed to provide you with further detail on that point in\n \nparticular. Article 5 of the measure relates to the criteria for forwarding on a judgment and,\n \nwhere applicable, a probation decision. In our view it is entirely unclear in relation to its\n a\npplication to persons who have been returned to another Member State as a consequence \nof being deported and who did not consent to \nbe \nreturned but who are now lawfully and \nordinarily residing there. My view is that the better reading of this FD is that this does not \napply to deportees, as the provision implies that return should be a choice, but it is \nabsolutely not clear whether other Member States, the Commission and ultimately the ECJ \nwould agree.\nWhether or not it applies to deportees and in what circumstances could of course have potentially substantial consequences in terms of the Probation FD's usefulness, and impact \non the UK. If it doesn't apply to deportees then its usefulness (as a public protection \nmeasure allowing states to supervise incoming deportees who may present a risk) is \nobviously significantly curtailed. If it does apply to deportees then, although this may affect a \nrelatively small group of offenders, we are unclear as to what happens in the event an \nindividual is deported, the probation decision or alternative sanction is transferred, and \nthere is a subsequent breach. In particular, Member States may make a declaration that they will \nnot deal with breach locally, under certain circumstances, but will transfer jurisdiction back to the issuing Member State (and we already know from declarations made by some Member \nStates that some States will do this). As a result, if the person has already been deported, \nand the receiving Member. State then wishes to return jurisdiction on breach, I am not clear what the status of that deportation would be. Alternatively, the transferred order may be \nunenforceable, thereby entirely undermining the purpose of the FD. These are very \nimportant questions and until we have clearer answers it is not a measure that I consider the \nUK should seek to rejoin.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
