defaultBoth organisations represent the interests and ambitions of UK medical and dental schools as they relate to the generation of national health, wealth and knowledge through biomedical research and the professions of medicine and dentistry.

defaultThis submission

default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDifficulties related to working in STEM 
defaultclinical and non-cl
defaultinical 
defaultacademic careers are faced by both men and women. However, 
defaultwider
default issues affect the 
defaultretention and progression of women
default in academic STEM careers
default for example, limited 
defaultsenior women role models
default, women often having a greater proportion of teaching/pastor
defaultal student roles, limited opportunities for part-time/flexible working, 
defaultand 
defaultwomen taking on the major
defaultity of caring responsibilities. T
defaulthe cycle is self-perpetuating. 
default&#xa0;default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a 
defaultgendered conception of merit in clinical and non-clinical academia
default, especially
default one tha
defaultt values a full-time/long-hours
default uninterrupted career trajectory and research success. The achievements that women make are often unrecognised, as women are often too modest and do not market themselves enough, or reaching the same level of achievement either takes longer, or does not oc
defaultcur to the same level, due to career breaks, work-life balance and return to work challenges.
default defaultWomen Professors have increased by only 5% since 2004 (from 11% to 16%
default1
default), and more work is required to ensure gender balance at senior academic levels.
default&#xa0;default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe drain
default of women from academic medicine and dentistry represents a significant 
defaultloss of talent and expertise to the HE and research sectors
default, to the detriment of research innovation and leadership. There is some evidence that the number and proportion of wome
defaultn in s
defaultenior roles is increasing
default – however, this is o
defaultc
defaultcurring very slowly and needs urgent attention.
default&#xa0;default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMedical and dental school initiatives to support academic women are commended and should be sustained and expanded. Such initiatives support the goals and ambit
defaultions of the Athena SWAN charter for Women in Science, which UK medical and dental schools are working towards and several have achieved Silver or Bronze awards.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStructured clinical academic training pathways e.g. NIHR should be protected and marketed as a
defaultspirational.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a need to provide affordable, quality childcare. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe most recent data (2012) on
default academic medicine 
defaultand dentistry staffing levels shows that
default, as 
defaultfor 
defaultother STEM subjects, there continues to be a small proportion of women 
defaultProfessors (16%), particularly when compared with Senior Lecturer/Readers (32% medicine, 39% dentistry) and Lecturers (44%). Yet HESA data show that 54% of medical students and 59% of dental students are women. Progression from Lecturer grade is a key chal
defaultlenge for female academics.
default&#xa0;default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe number and proportion of women at each academic grade has increased since 2004 (Figures 1 and 2), with women professors increasing by 5% since 2004 (from 11% to 16%).

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWork-life balance: 
default4.1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn academic career is usually less well-defined than one in the NHS and is 
defaultperceived to be more stressful, particularly in the early career stages. It demands a significant investment of time, includ
defaulting out-of-
defaultprogram training, a
defaultnd contracts may be short-term 
defaultwithout clear progression routes. Success is dependent on factors such 
defaultas research grant income or proof of outstanding contributions to education. Promotion prospects are less attractive, as it takes longer to achieve equal clinical status, and there are fewer opportunities e.g. for on-call or private work.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany staff exper
defaultience busy workloads, often involving heavy teaching and administrative duties, which reduces the time available for research within core hours, leading to a long-hours culture. Part-time or job-share opportunities do not necessarily fit with the cultural 
defaultimage of ‘total commitment to the academic agenda’, and women tend to apply for jobs that they perceive to offer a better work-life balance.
default Moreover, it is difficult to maintain an active research programme
default with external funding and high-
defaultquality pub
defaultlicat
defaultions in a part-time or job-
defaultshare context for clinical or non-clinical academics.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are very few part-time opportunities, and virtually none at Clinical Academic Consultant level. Complex responsibilities in clinical, teaching and research roles – in a
defaultddition to family commitments
default -
default mean that even working full-time, women with clinical responsibilities tend to complete PhDs over 6+ years, or more if they have maternity leave. Women feel their career progression rates may be compromised unless they atten
defaultd networking, conferences or national meetings.
default Expectations have been increased with the impact of the 2014 REF.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe challenges of work-life balance in academia tend to be exacerbated for women with children or other caring commitments, who generally ta
defaultke on the majority of responsibilities.
default As one medical school reported ‘More often than not, very successful men will have partners or wives that have less pressured work roles and are thus better able to support them. The reverse is rarely true.’ 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack
default of confidence:
default4.2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen tend to wait until they meet all the criteria for promotion, whereas men tend to be more speculative in their applications. Consequently, women are less likely to submit themselves for consideration for promotion without encouragement
default or mentoring. Evidence from the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards
default and medical/ dental schools internal records show that when women do apply, they are just as likely to be successful.
default&#xa0;default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of opportunities:
default4.3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAppointments and promotions pro
defaultcesses are one of the four key barriers to a women’s progression.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSearch committees frequently comprise predominantly men, who may only consider their networks and potential female candidates may not be identified. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA requirement to move institution for
default career advancement may not fit with family commitments. Many early career researchers need to be geographically mobile, a disincentive, which inhibits continuity of employment rights.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport for moving from PhD to post-doctoral posts is often inadequate
default, and often dependent on the PhD supervisor communicating events, opportunities and helping to access funds for future roles.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a significant di
defaultsparity in the number of women o
defaultn fixed-term contracts with external rather than core funding compared 
defaultto their male counterparts.
default  The insecurity of fixed-term contracts, which often coincides with the timing of childbearing decisions, is another reason why women do not progress in their academic careers.
default  
default&#xa0;
default4.3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen can spend too much time on activities that benefit the 
defaults
defaultchool, for example being an admissions/year tutor, with less time to focus on research or teaching activities that warrant promotion or progression.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCareer breaks:
default4.4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCareer breaks in science acad
defaultemia can have a severe long-term effect on a career than in other professions. It takes time to build up a research group and facilities, its associated funding and a line of research showing results. This
default,
default and the fast-pace of research, means it can requi
defaultre a great deal of effort for women to get back on track.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a lack of fellowship schemes for female academic clinicians returning to pursue an academic career after having a family, 
defaultalthough 
defaultsome do exist for non-clinicians (e.g. Daphne Jackson an
defaultd Dorothy Hodgkin schemes).
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnconscious bias:
default4.5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSocial assumptions and norms around gender can have a huge impact. The assumed identity of an academic in STEM tends to be linked to masculinity, with resulting traditional perceptions that men are more suite
defaultd to the role. Women are 
defaultthen left in a contradictory situation, judged as being ‘unfeminine’ for having these traits, or unsuitable if judged to not have certain traits.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSeveral studies have demonstrated unconscious bias against women at interview and in
default the peer review process, whereby people similar to that of the recruiter are employed.
default This can result in a visible lack of women in senior academic positions. Without role models, it is difficult for young women to see academia as a viable option. With 
defaultfew women available to act as mentors, or sit on promotion committees, those who do can become overloaded, which then can inhibit their research achievements. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStudents can be biased in their perceptions of leadership, with medical school students of both
default genders reporting that men generally make better leaders. This bias requires challenging within the context of leadership/management/professionalism teaching on image and stereotype.
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA fu
defaultll-time clinical job is perceived to offer more job security, faster salary progression, no commitment to further examinations, more geographic flexibility and a better work-life balance. Other staff leave for a career in teaching, or industry which pays h
defaultigher and where promotion prospects are not linked to research income
default or publications,
default which currently is particularly challenging.
default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAcademic 
defaultSTEM loses highly trained and valuable employees who have invested a decade or more in their scientific development. The full range of academic excellence is lost. There are fewer female role models for aspiring clinical academics.
default&#xa0;default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a business 
defaultcase for mixed gender teams.
default Diversity of knowledge and social capital in teams is vital in production of new ideas.
default  
defaultA lack of women may have a significant impact on the robustness of policy decisions and research innovation
default.
default  
default&#xa0;default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverarching:
default7.1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities should establish working groups to continually review staff recruitment, progression, retention and practices that support and e
defaultnable women’s career progression. Many university departments are working towards or have gained an Athena SWAN award, which supports the advancement of women on 
defaultscience,
default 
defaultand several have now achieved Silver or Bronze awards.
default An example of good practice i
defaults the establishment of the Gender Equality Office within a School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWork-life balance:
default7.2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities should promote a culture of flexible working. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhere possible meetings, networking and other activities shou
defaultld be held within core hours.
default&#xa0;
default7.2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvocate flexible working to suit the individual and the specialty – for example, clinical work may be in a block of several months, or several days a week.
default&#xa0;
default7.2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities should adopt schemes that support female research staf
defaultf during pregnancy and on returning to work after a period of maternity leave. This should include protected time to concentrate on re-establishing a research portfolio, for example through reduced teaching and administrative workloads. Job applications sh
defaultould provide the opportunity for candidates to explain any career breaks.
default&#xa0;default7.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of confidence:
default7.3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMentoring and networking schemes should be in place for all early career research staff and postdoctoral students.
default&#xa0;
default7.3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPromote the visibility of women, 
defaultand 
defaultensure 
defaultthe abilities and achievements of women are highlighted i.e.
default through speakers, presentations and
default media representation.
default&#xa0;
default7.3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport and encourage women to consider applying for promotion. 
default&#xa0;
default7.3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPerformance and Development Review should include activity and guidanc
defaulte for promotion. Routes for promotion should be transparent and accessible. 
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of opportunities:
default7.4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPart-time working should not be a barrier to promotion or opportunities that lead to promotion. 
default&#xa0;
default7.4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen require 
defaultdevelopment opportunities in areas that lea
defaultd to promotion, with teaching administrative/pastoral roles distributed equitably. 
default&#xa0;
default7.4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTrainees require support and guidance as to next steps. Trainees can feel they are undertaking two jobs at once, this can lead to significant stress levels and drop-out. I
defaultmproved information and communication on internal jobs may help to increase opportunities for the PhD student to remain at the institution. 
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCareer breaks:
default7.5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCareer breaks require appropriate management, to reduce impact on research and avoid the attrition 
defaultof talented individuals. Sufficient time planning the break is required and support to retain links i.e. ‘Keep in Touch’ days or email updates. Funding for staff absence, to avoid overburdening colleagues and to assist the returner i.e. teaching assistance
default or conference attendance, requires consideration.
default&#xa0;
default7.5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIdentify or create funding streams where the eligibility criteria reflect the protean nature of academia i.e. ac
defaultceptance of bids from non-core/
defaultnon-permanent staff members.
default&#xa0;
default7.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRole models:
default7.6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCelebrate successf
defaultul women academics. Encourage women to accept offers to speak at conferences and engage with the media, so that women in STEM are more visible.
default&#xa0;
default7.6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHave events/online where women graduates can see/hear that it is possible to be a mother and an academic, inclu
defaultde local case studies, signpost support available before/following maternity leave.
default&#xa0;
default7.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnconscious bias:
default7.7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities should put in place positive measures to address the gender imbalance across senior roles, within 
defaultu
defaultniversity management and on senior execut
defaultive committees.
default&#xa0;
default7.7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecruitment and promotions processes should be transparent
default,
default unbiased, and based on merit, regardless of gender, ethnicity or background. 
default&#xa0;
default7.7.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnconscious bias training for staff conducting annual reviews, or recruitment panel.
default&#xa0;default8.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Athena SWAN Charter
default recognises and celebrates good employment practice for women working in science, engineering and technology (SET) in higher education, awarding departments with bronze, silver and gold awards. Departments
default within all UK medical and dental schools in the UK are working towards the higher levels of awards. A great deal of good practice has resulted from medical and dental schools working towards or gaining Athena SWAN awards, for example:
default&#xa0;default8.1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVisibility - visibl
defaulte women and men during open days, speakers for events and interviewers, events specifically to promote the achievements of women academics. 
default&#xa0;default8.1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport - to attend within working hours groups such as a Peer Support Group for Women Returning from Maternity Le
defaultave, International Staff Network Group, 
defaultWomen in Science, Engineering and Technology (WiSET), ‘SpringBoard’ workshops
default and formalised mentoring schemes and buddy schemes.
default&#xa0;default8.1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPromotion - workshops to identify and support women ready to apply for promotion, re
defaultsearch development support
default;
default an opportunities committee, to enhance academic careers for women.
default&#xa0;
default8.1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFamily-friendly policies - flexible working, career-breaks, return to work schemes following parental or adoption leave, provision of part-time posts with an ho
defaultnorary NHS contract, six month sabbatical for research on return to work, or a dedicated budget to support research whilst women on maternity leave.
default&#xa0;default8.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInternational good practice examples include the focus on institutional change on the National Science Fou
defaultndation’s ADVANCE programme in the US
default and the University of California, School of Medicine.
default The Canadian Council of Academies (2010)
default reported on the career trajectory of Canadian women researchers and advocated more flexible models for career progressio
defaultn.
default&#xa0;default9.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch Councils should ensure that consideration of gender issues is included in research funding application forms, as is required for EU grants.
default&#xa0;default9.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFunding for STEM programs should allow for universities and institutes to focus on institutional change, and encourage outreach and engagement activities.
default&#xa0;default9.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvocate that women should be adequately represented on decision-making panels.
default&#xa0;default9.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvocate unconscio
defaultus bias training for those in senior positions.
default&#xa0;default9.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvocate that undergraduate teaching should include a discussion on stereotypes, image and bias training to challenge false perceptions and encourage female students to view themselves as potential future leaders. 
default&#xa0;default9.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe MSC and DSC supports the commitment 
defaultof NIHR and other funding bodies for structured clinical academic training pathways, and urge that this investment be protected. There remains the opportunity to restructure the academic career pathway to avoid the bottleneck at postdoctoral level, and to 
defaultremove the time-based criteria for fellowships and progression/promotion assessments. 
default&#xa0;default9.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo address specific contractual issues relating to moving between the NHS and an academic career, the Government should review the current admission process to the 
defaultNHS 
defaultpension scheme, to allow joiners from clinical and allied health professionals employed by universities. 
default&#xa0;default9.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFamily-friendly policies are vital. Childcare should be affordable and high-quality to allow parents to return to work, with adequate provision for a
defaultffordable after-school care. Shared maternity/ paternity leave would enable flexibility. Improved support for women returning from career breaks is vital.
