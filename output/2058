defaultThank you for the opportunity to respond to the above consultation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Share Foundation is the Registered Contact for, and appointed operator of, the Junior ISA scheme for Looked After children, which was launched by the Department for Education in 2012. Over the past eight months we have opened c. 35,000 Junior ISAs on the basis of data provided by every Local Authority in England and Wales, 60% of Northern Irish health trusts, and 22% of Scottish Local Authorities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPrior to our appointment we were in discussions with HM Treasury following our proposal to take over the administration and Registered Contact role for the Child Trust Funds administered by the Official Solicitor for Looked After children without anyone in a position of parental responsibility. We had made additional voluntary contributions to these accounts over the preceding five years. We put these discussions

defaulton hold
default’
default 
defaultduring the early stages of implementing the Junior ISA scheme, but are now ready to re-open them.
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral Commentsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThere is a strong logic for bringing together the administration, financial education and voluntary fundraising roles to encompass all accounts held on behalf of Looked After children. Not only would there be economies of scale in relieving the Official Solicitor of this work, but also: 
default&#xa0;
default1. The financial education resources we have developed for Junior ISA recipients would be more widely available; and 
default2. We would be able to include accounts previously held as Child Trust Funds as beneficiaries of both unrestricted and geographically restricted voluntary fund-raising.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe see the proposed voluntary transfer of Child Trust Funds to Junior ISAs as a significant opportunity to achieve the integration of administration of these accounts for Looked After children and young people. Since the Registered Contact for the Child Trust Funds is the Official Solicitor, and since all such accounts are held for children under the age of 16, a decision could be made to voluntarily transfer all such Child Trust Funds into Junior ISAs administered by The Share Foundation.
defaultThere is, of course, a second category of Child Trust Funds for Looked After children 
defaultwith
default someone in a position of parental responsibility. These could of course remain where they are, but The Share Foundation would be happy to offer voluntary Junior ISA transfer facilities for these too: in which case they would also benefit from inclusion for allocation arising from our voluntary fund-raising 
defaultprogramme
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecific Questionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultTurning to the questions posed in the consultation document: 
default&#xa0;
default1. Yes, the transfer of funds from a Child Trust Fund to a Junior ISA should be permitted;
default&#xa0;
default2. We do not envisage any significant impact upon the viability of the wider Child Trust Fund market, provided that a number of simple alignment provisions are made to CTF regulations: including the removal of life-styling and the rollover into adult ISAs at age 18;
default&#xa0;
default3.  The approach will provide a workable basis for the transfer of funds from Child Trust Funds into Junior ISAs; 
default&#xa0;
default4. The Share Foundation will need to consider relatively minor changes to its system in order to be able to accommodate accounts transferred from the Official Solicitor: considerably less than would be needed to accommodate CTF administration. However we anticipate that the overall cost to Government will reduce significantly. Meanwhile the cost of charges to account holders would not change significantly as a result of the transfer; 
default&#xa0;
default5. We concur that voluntary transfer of Child Trust Funds to Junior ISAs, which in the case of accounts held for Looked After children will be driven by the Official Solicitor as Registered Contact, is the best course of action; 
default&#xa0;
default6. There would need to be much greater alignment between Child Trust Funds and Junior ISAs before a full merger could be considered; 
default&#xa0;
default7. We agree with the step-by-step approach set out in Sections 3.12 to 3.13 of the consultation document.
