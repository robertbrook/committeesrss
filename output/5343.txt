&#xa0;Written evidence from Margaret Thomas (TWR0010)Dear Sir/Madam,Gatwick Airport – Dec 24th 2013.1.Although we appreciate these were clearly exceptional circumstances, it is abundantly clear that NO provision or fore-thought had ever been given to an event of this magnitude, no manual override for computer and power failure had ever been perceived, no alternative announcement facilities had been put aside to cover such an event and personnel were not aware or trained to deal with such an event and had no idea what to do next.2.At the time of writing this letter you find me and my family 

[[[at home]]]

[[[ at 19:00]]] on Christmas Eve, but unfortunately for my children, 

[[[WITHOUT]]], the provision for making their Christmas a memorable and special occasion, as we had planned and hoped for.3.We started our day at 03:00am.  Santa’s special presents duly packed and ready for the next day for Matthew 7 and Owen 8.  We arrived at the airport at 04:45 in plenty of time for our scheduled 09:00 take off flight to Sham El Sheikh on EZY8851.  Even with the delay for the road traffic accident on the M25/M23 just outside the airport and the extreme weather conditions, WE had managed to plan ahead and anticipate all the likely problems.  The car parking valet company were as good as their word and met us on time to collect our car and take it to a place of safety for the full duration of our holiday.  ALL PLANNED AND PERFECTLEY EXECUTED SO FAR……………YES!!!!!?  THEN…………………In steps Gatwick Airport and Easy Jet. 4.At 05:30 we joined the hordes in the 

[[[North]]] terminal, we are advised through a garbled message delivered by a” foreign tongued” person wearing what we presume to be a uniform and therefore representing the airport company a message, saying that the” power is down” but they will have it fixed shortly. We wait.5.At 08:00 we are advised that the 

[[[North]]] terminal is inoperable and we are advised to proceed to the 

[[[South]]] terminal, by internal train, where the whole operation will be managed and we will be “on our way soon.”We wait6.At 12:44 we are asked to check in our luggage at a make-shift Virgin Atlantic check in desk, run by Easy Jet.  Once checked in we ask our Easy Jet representative “What next?” he replied.  “Your guess is as good as mine, “Listen out for announcements”. We wait.7.At 13:50 we make our way to departures lounge in the 

[[[South]]] terminal.  Nobody in the 

[[[South]]] terminal has any idea on the 

[[[North]]] terminal Easy Jet flight situation.  By chance, we are informed by a fellow passenger  “all Easy Jet 

[[[North]]] terminal passengers should head for gate 95” -  to make their way back to the original starting point - 

[[[North terminal]]]……………..where we started at 05:30am!!!!!We embark on to the coach, duly allocated and as instructed by the uniformed airport personnel at gate 95. 8.We disembark the coach and are directed though the terminal buildings to the North terminal departure lounge.We wait.9.At 14:55 we happen to be in the vicinity of a loud speaking Easy Jet rep. - she announces that our flight is now CANCELLED and that we should make our way to the Sea food counter to await further instructions from a “Gatwick Servis Air” representative.  At this point we are told to exit the building through a STAFF ONLY EXIT, this we do.  We join another extensive queue for what we discover is an 

[[[incoming]]] Passport Control area.  After 45 minutes in this queue we are directed to a baggage reclaim area.  An “Evacuation Marshall” is waiting at the baggage carousel.  When asked what procedure we should follow to retrieve our luggage she responds with” I have NO IDEA! -there is no plan or procedure in place to resolve this type of situation and there are no representatives of Easy Jet available to help with retrieving our LOST luggage”.  With nobody available to turn to we, exhausted, resolve to exit the building retrieve our car and go home…………….without our luggage.  It is obviously “lost in the system”&#xa0;10.Starting on the laptop in the car before returning home we Check Online:-11. You are our holiday/dream makers.What do we do now?&#xa0;12. We await, with much anticipation, your response.January 2014&#xa0;
