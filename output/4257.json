"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummaryUK arable production is predominantly a monoculture based on cereals and specifically winter wheat. The lack of diversity in arable production places the UK farming sector at high risk t\no the impact of climate change. The intense weather conditions in 2012 turned the UK from a net exporter to net importer of wheat for the first time in over a decade. The HSBC Agriculture Forward Planning 2013 reveals that few farms would be profitable wit\nhout the single farm payment. The current CAP reform gives the opportunity to directly fund agroecology systems. The World Bank and the UNCTAD report that agroecology systems are one of the best ways of developing resilience to food production in an increa\nsingly unpredictable climate. Adoption of these practices within the UK with the emphasis on soil biota health and increased biodiversity should be an integral part of the National Adaptation Plan for Agriculture to climate change and food security. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK land usage shows only 20% of the land area is attributed to crop production. Half the country is under some form of grass be that pasture or moorland. The percentage of land under urban use is almost the same as under \nwoodland both being around 12% of the total UK land area. Only 1% of the UK is classified as fresh water.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHalf of the cropped area of the\n UK is under cereal production and of this wheat represents 60%. \nTherefore, a\n third of the UK cropped acreage is in one\n crop, wheat\n of which\n \n44% \nis destined for animal feed.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the last three years (2011 – 2013) 81% of the arable area of the UK has been in either cereals (66%) or oilseed rape (16%). \nHorticultural production of fruit and vegetables represents only 2% of a\nrable land and of this 98% is grown outside.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fact that such a high proportion of the arable area of the UK is in either wheat or oilseed rape is a high risk strategy when it comes to food security.  A large proportion of the arable area is at risk from\n a breakdown in disease or pest control, either from weather conditions preventing timely applications of pesticides or of resistance developing to \navailable products\n. \nHerbicide resistance is becoming a major factor in cereal production in areas where blac\nk-grass is endemic. Cereal disease resistance to the fungicides is well documented with the strobilurons no longer effective against Septoria tritici, a major fungal disease of winter wheat and triazoles also showing reduce activity. In the autumn of 201\n2\n the wet conditions were perfect for the build up of slugs in winter crops which became almost impossible to control with existing moluscicides. \n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe weather \nconditions in 2012 exemplified\n the vulnerability of UK agriculture with the current dependence on \nwinter crop production. \nThe harvest of 2012 \nafter \na dull, wet and cool growing \nseason saw average yields drop from 7.8 tonnes/ hectare to 6.7 t/ha, a drop of 14 percent on the five year average \n. \nYield losses were also attributable to an outbreak of Fusari\num ear blight in the UK wheat crop. A report by Fera showed that nationally the non-toxin producing Microdochium species (M. nivale and M. majus) were responsible for the majority of symptoms; with 93% of crops and 35% of ears within a crop infected by the\nse pathogens. High levels of contamination by Microdochium species will cause reductions in grain quality and yield and affect seed germination.\n Control from fungicides applied was almost non-existent as timely applications were almost impossible to achiev\ne, due to the wet conditions at \nthe time of \near emergence of these crops.\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe poor harvest was followed by a disastrous autumn sowing campaign. \nThe Farming Online autumn sowing survey showed that across the UK only two thirds of the planned area of wheat w\nas sown. The staggered sowing and unfavourable growing conditions also meant that only half of that sown actually established.  Figures from the NFU showed some 11.6m tonnes of wheat were harvested in 2013, down 10pc on 2012, \nfor although the y\nields per he\nctare improved dramatically\n in 2013 this was not \n enough to cover the shortfall\n in planted area\n.\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe net result of this change in climate was that the UK became \na net importer\n of wheat in 2013 for the first time in a decade\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK is 80% self-sufficient in indigenous food\n (Defra Food stats)\n.  B\nut this figure \nhides the fact that although we \nhave been \nself-sufficient in cereals and milk and \nover 80\n% self-sufficient in poultry we are below 60% self-sufficient in fresh vegetables and 20% of fresh fruit (Defra Food Matters). \nFruit and vegetables account for much\n \nof the UK’s food trade deficit\n. In 2007 \n24 countries supplied the UK with 90% of its fresh \nfruit and vegetables – the UK supplied 19%.  The majority (36%) of imported vegetables were supplied by countries within the EU. \n \nHowever, the figures for fresh fruit show we imported from 25 countries with 65% coming from outside the EU.\n  A recent report \nby PWC on the implications of Climate Change highlighted the dependenc\ne by the UK for imported food. A report by the World Bank also shows that \nnew results on the impact of climate change published since 2007 suggest a rapidly rising risk of crop yield red\nuctions as the world warms. Large negative effects have been observed at high and extreme temperatures in several regions including India, Africa, the United States, and Australia. For example, significant nonlinear effects have been observed in the United\n States for local daily temperatures increasing to 29°C for corn and 30°C for soybeans. These new results and observations indicate a significant risk of high-temperature thresholds being crossed that could substantially undermine food security globally\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe implications of climate change on the production of food sources outside the UK\n could have an impact on our supply of those food products we import. This is particularly the case for fruit and vegetables sourced from outside the EU.  \nThe countries we c\nurrently import from are considered at high risk of disruption to crop production. The risks are from high temperatures and droughts leading to lower yields and poorer quality. This will also result in diminished export opportunities from the countries con\ncerned. T\nhe UK animal feed industry’s reliance on \nimported soya and maize\n from the South America and the US could see rising prices as shortages of these commodities results due to droughts in these regions. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDr Jason Lowe, Chief Scientist at the met-offi\nce speaking at last month's event on UK climate change policy warned that in the longer term there’s a trend towards warmer wetter winters and hotter drier summers, summer droughts and more extreme weather events. \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe past three years weather has given u\ns a taster of how climate change can impact on UK agriculture. The increasing unpredictability of the climate and more frequent intense weather \nevents will test the resilience of any farming practice in play. \n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main factor that will influence any farms\n ability to adapt to climate change will be the condition of the soils on that farm. The soils will need to have high organic matter content to prevent erosion\n and \ncompaction, increase water holding capacity and supply nutrients.  Any \nadaptation plan to cl\nimate change \nmust include soil structural improvement.  \nA recent\n study on the soil biota and soil health across Europe identified that many of the soils in UK were at risk, the paper concludes that \nthe high score (i.e., high potential threats) of several a\nreas of United Kingdom and central Europe is determined by the combined effect of a high intensity agriculture, with a relatively high number of invasive species and an increased risk for the soils present there to lose organic carbon \n(\n2013 Blackwell Publi\nshing Ltd, \nGlobal Change Biology\n, \n19\n, 1538–1548). The reintroduction of livestock onto arable farms and the use of organic manures are seen as key ways in improving soil health.  \nOne system currently being promoted by two \nNuffield\n scholars is the practice of “mob-grazing”.  \nMob grazing is a school of 'natural farming' that seeks to mimic the movements of grazing plains animals on a farm scale. The approach is receiving attention around the world, thanks to pioneers who have put rem\narkable achievements down to mob grazing, and their claims that it can be used to replenish soils exhausted by monocropping or boost the health of pastureland. The Royal Agricultural Society of England is currently organising a series of workshops on this \nsubject.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe plan \nneeds to look at water storage through rain water catchment systems and more on farm reservoirs. Flood defences are \nalso paramount\n and although this is part of the Environment Agency's National Adaptation Plan, flooding of agricultural l\nand has not received enough attention. The influence of climate change on British agriculture will impact on food security for the UK. The UK Agriculture’s National Adaptation plan needs \nalso to look at the \ncurrent dependence\n upon a limited cropping or ani\nmal husbandry system \nwhich \nwill increase the risk of failure in a climate prone to extreme weather events.\n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe HSBC Forward planning in Agriculture 2014 highlights the importance of the SFP in maintaining \nfarm profitability. The budgets compiled by the HS\nBC for a series of farm enterprises, arable, livestock and mixed farms identifies that without the current level of support many farms would be unviable.  The current CAP reform offers the perfect opportunity to link support payments to better resilience o\nf farming systems by encouraging more diversity on farms and better soil management.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgroecology\n has been defined as the application of ecological science to the study,\n \ndesign and management of sustainable agroecosystems.\n&#xa0;3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn\n evolution to agro ecological \nwould provide many advantages, delivering food security and an increased resilience to climate ch\nange. Such strategies also offer greatly increased ecosystems services whilst providing a mechanism to sequestrate large amounts of both carbon and water back into the landscape\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey Points: \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Green revolution has transformed farming from what it was 60 years ago. Increased field scale, intensification of cultivation, agrichemicals, \nmachinery, seed technology and more has combined to create the present day system. However\n,\n there are some fundamental flaws in this approach and \nrecent evidence\n is showing that a further transformation of farming will be required.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClimate change challeng\nes farming models on several levels. Not least the monoculture approaches are extremely vulnerable to variable climatic conditions and potential pest invasions. Agro-chemical inputs are also of course all derived from fossil fuels: fertilizer, pesticides, \ndiesel for water pumping, farm machines and long supply lines are all extremely vulnerable to a rise in price for oil and of course their use also intensifies climate change.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLand management patterns, based on the simplification of the natural diversity h\nas also had significant impacts on wildlife and biodiversity which in terms can make crops more susceptible to pest invasion, without the natural self-regulation afforded by a healthy and diverse natural world surrounding our cultivated lands. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe key fa\nctor to resilience in a natural system is biodiversity. ‘There is no redundancy in natural ecosystems’ In other words loss of any species in a system erodes the resil\nience of the whole system. Agro\necology needs to\n,\n therefore \n, \nvalue the contribution of eve\nry species and not to concentrate simply the target species for production but to think far widely about cultivated an ecosystem.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgriculture of the type typified by the intensification of land use increases productivity but only in inverse relation to th\ne inputs required to drive the system. At worst agriculture pits us directly against natural principles and creates an ever increasing dependency of external inputs to maintain a productive system and at the expense of ecosystem function. Agriculture is ty\npically a net consumer of energy when all the inputs are factored in.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UNCTAD report, (supported by a great ma\nn\ny others) points to \nthe \npossibilities of agro-ecology, an evolution of our current systems to embrace much of our increased understanding of \nthe function of the natural world. Small scale farms with wildlife zones and interconnected wildlife corridors provide an intensely rich patchwork of ecology, much more akin to the natural world. Water retention habitat creation, humidification, natural pe\nst regulation and a multitude of other ecosystem functions can be integrated in to function and highly productive landscapes\n. One of the report’s conclusions was that climate change will drastically impact agriculture, primarily in those developing countri\nes with the highest future population growth, i.e. in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Against this background, the fundamental transformation of agriculture may well turn out to be one of the biggest challenges, including for international security, of \nthe 21st century. \n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPerhaps a key perspective in this discussion is whether agriculture and our whole approach to land management can be evolved to a) sequestrate far more carbon into the ground and\n,\n therefore\n,\n slowdown the onset of climate change b) to in\nsulate and mitigate the possible impact caused by more extreme and variable weather patterns and c) to guarantee a rich diverse landscape consummate with long term conservation, ecological and ecosystems services considerations.\n&#xa0;\n4.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nObservations of natural wo\nrld show that in many ways agriculture pits us directly against the ecology of the system. Nature builds diversity, builds soil and traps more water into a landscape, via increased soil carbon, wet lands and general rising biomass. Agriculture tends to sim\nplify biodiversity, accelerate the passage of water through a landscape and dry out soils and allow more soil carbon to be oxidised and therefore return to the atmosphere. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\nReferences\nwww.\nons\n.gov.\nuk\n/\nons\n/guide.../\nuse\nr.../publicati\nons\n/\nland\n-\nuse-in-the-uk\n.pdf\nhttp://climatechange.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/Turn_Down_the_heat_Why_a_4_degree_centrigrade_warmer_w\norld_must_be_avoided.pdf\nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/food/food_matters1.pdf\nhttps://www.gov.uk/go\nvernment/collections/agricultural-statistics-and-climate-change\nhttp://permaculturenews.org/2013/12/05/addressing-the-causes-of-land-degradation-food-nutritional-insecurity-and-poverty-a-new-approach-to-agricultural-intensification-in-the-tropics-and-subtropics/\nAn estimate of potential threat\ns levels to soil biodiversity in EU:\n Global Change Biology (2013) \n19\n, 1538–1548, doi: 10.1111/gcb.12159\nInternational Threats and Opportunities of Climate Change to the UK\n- \nPWC\nUK Food Security Assessment: Detailed Analysis.
