EIS 21
[normal]Written evidence submitted by David Highley[bold]Executive Summary:[bold]Adequate supplies of miner
[normal]als are essential for economic 
[normal]development. 
[normal]For its small size Britain is 
[normal]relatively
[normal] well endowed with mineral resources and their e
[normal]xtraction and use have played an important part in the historic development of the UK economy. The UK continues to have an economically 
[normal]significant
[normal] minerals industry, with oil and gas, and construction and in
[normal]dustrial minerals being important sectors. Although much diminished, coal still makes an important contribution to our energy mix. The contribution that these minerals make 
[normal]to
[normal] the national economy 
[normal]may
[normal] be considered 
[normal]in two
[normal] ways. First there is the primary c
[normal]ontribution they make in terms of added value and employment associated with 
[normal]their
[normal] extraction and processing; and then there is the secondary 
[normal]contribution they
[normal] make to the competitiveness of the
[normal] downstream
[normal] industries they support. Nevertheless, the UK 
[normal]also 
[normal]has 
[normal]substantial
[normal] and increasing 
[normal]foreign
[normal] dependence for minera
[normal]l supplies. This not only places
[normal] 
[normal]increasing 
[normal]demands
[normal] on the environments of ou
[normal]r trading partners
[normal] but potentially makes us more vulnerable to supply disruptions 
[normal]as global demand for minerals gr
[normal]owths driven by expanding populations and rising incomes. There will be a continuing demand for the products of the UK’s extractive industries for the foreseeable future.

[normal]For many years the British Geological Survey (BGS) has estimated the approximate value of UK mineral output (ex-works sales basis) for publication in the
[normal]ir
[normal] 
[normal]UK Minerals Yearbook
[normal].  This allows the relative importance of the differen
[normal]t mineral sectors to be compared over time.  
[normal]Data for 20
[normal]10 and 2011 are shown in Table 2
[normal]. In addition, t
[normal]he value, in constant prices, of the principal mineral sectors from 1970 to 2011 is shown in
[normal] Figure 1
[normal], and clearly portrays
[normal] the
[normal]ir relative
[normal] fortunes

[normal]  
[normal]Since 1970 UK mineral production has been dominated by
[normal] energy minerals, initially coal, but later oil and gas following the development of 
[normal]large 
[normal]of
[normal]fshore reserves from the 1970s. The 
[normal]value of coal production 
[normal]has declined in line with 
[normal]steadily 
[normal]falling output since the mid-1980
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]rapidly 
[normal]rising value of oil production up to 1984 was reversed by t
[normal]he slump in world 
[normal]oil 
[normal]prices at the end of 1985, and
[normal] again in 1988, and also the loss of production through the Piper Alpha tragedy
[normal].
[normal] Following rising oil prices since 2000, however, the value of UK oil productions has risen and was still £25.5 billion in 2011
[normal].
[normal] Despite falling oil and gas production since 2000, the value of both have held up well because of high prices.  Ultimately, however, as reserves are depleted their value will decline.

[normal]    
[normal]The value of construction and industrial minerals has also falle
[normal]n, reflecting the decline in the production of 
[normal]some 
[normal]industrial minerals such as kaolin, b
[normal]ut mainly because of the recently
[normal] significantly depressed state of the UK construction industry and its impact on aggregates production in particular. Although too sma
[normal]ll to show on Figure 1, the decline in the value of metalliferous minerals production is principally because of the demise of tin mining in Cornwall in the 1990s.

[normal]T
[normal]he value to the UK economy of minerals produced from indigenous sources is, however, de
[normal]rived not only from the minerals themselves but also the downstream 
[normal]industries and employment these support. Low cost construction and industrial minerals, in particular, serve as essential raw materials for the construction, cement, 
[normal]asphalt, 
[normal]concrete prod
[normal]ucts, 
[normal]inorganic chemicals, glass, ceramics, lime,
[normal] plaster products, 
[normal]and castings
[normal] industries were the value added may be several fold.   The economic benefits derived from the domestic extractive industries goes much further than the values indicated sugges

[normal]              
[normal]An overview of the contribution that the extractive industries make to the UK economy can be found in a report produced by the British Geological 
[normal]Survey in 2004
[normal]. 
[normal]Although t
[normal]he statistics are now somewhat dated, the principles that are presented 
[normal]in the report 
[normal]have not changed significantly, 
[normal]with the exception 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK has
[normal] become even more dependent on 
[normal]imports of minerals and mineral
[normal]–based products
[normal]. This report, together with a wealth of other information on the UK minerals industry, can be found on the British Geological Survey’s dedicated minerals website – 
[normal]www.mineralsUK.com
[normal] .  In particular I would refer
[normal] you to the series of 
[normal]Mineral Planning Factsheets
[normal], which provide succinct overviews of 
[normal]each of the 
[normal]economically important minerals extracted onshore in Britain, and also to the 
[normal]United Kingdom Minerals Yearbook
[normal] referred to above.

[normal]Conclusions[bold]. [bold]Adequate 
[normal]supplies of minerals are ess
[normal]ential for economic development. Whilst there has been a decoupling of economic growth with minerals consumption 
[normal]in recent years 
[normal]this may indicate that the economy is under investing
[normal] 
[normal]in infrastructure and housing and also forego
[normal]ing the value  added  by working and processing domestic (and imported) minerals in favour of importing higher value manufactured products containing embedded minerals. Moves to try and rebalance the economy and increased investment in 
[normal]housing and 
[normal]infrastr
[normal]ucture as economic growth improves and 
[normal]the population expands could reverse the declining trend in minerals consumption. 
[normal]Britain’s resource security and its longer term access to mineral supplies, both from domestic and overseas sources, will remain a key 
[normal]issue for the national economy for many years to come.
[normal] There will be a continuing demand for the products of the UK’s extractive industries for the foreseeable future and we should
[normal] make the best use of
[normal] our domestic mineral resources (and waste streams), where economically and environmentally feasible to do so.
