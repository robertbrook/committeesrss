"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Chartered Institution of Highways &amp; Transportation (LTD0037)&#xa0;\nCIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,500 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT memb\ners plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems and infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.\n&#xa0;\nCIHT welcomes the opportunity t\no submit evidence to the Committee’s call for evidence. CIHT responses are based on inputs from members of the CIHT who have experience from across the local government H&amp;T sector.\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;     \n \nInvestment in infrastructure to support UK economic \ngrowth is essential and business investor confidence that can be placed in the delivery of that infrastructure \nis \nvital. Uncertainty in this regard \ncould \nplace the UK at a competitive disadvantage in global markets.\n&#xa0;\n     \n \nClarity and certainty on the timi\nng of infrastructure investment comes less from change in the decision making process itself, but from having a clear vision of the strategic priorities for the UK.  The identification of those strategic infrastructure priorities has to be driven by an und\nerstanding of the key spatial priorities for the UK economy.\n&#xa0;\n   \n \nProgress with the preparation of the National Policy Statement on National Networks is therefore welcomed by the CIHT, providing the potential opportunity to set out a clear long-term framew\nork for the development of the country’s transport infrastructure.  However, it is essential that such a policy statement sits within a broader spatial strategy for the country, including, housing, jobs\n, environment\n and infrastructure. One that takes accou\nnt of, and builds upon, the economic strengths and potential of key sub-national areas.\n  CIHT will be responding to the government’s consultation in due course.\n&#xa0;\n Such a framework at the national level would provide a clear strategic framework within which\n detailed proposals could be developed by partners at the local level: for the purposes of this submission the argument assumes that the most appropriate ‘local level’ is the functional economic area.\n&#xa0;\n Such considerations become all the more pertinent with the establishment of the Local Growth Fund.  Lord Heseltine’s report ‘No Stone Unturned’ identified the critical importance for the UK to target investment in infrastructure to support economic growth\n and the need to prioritise that investment if the UK economy is to be globally competitive.\n&#xa0;\nQ1.               What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local decision making on transport expenditure?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach?  Are there better models?&#xa0;\n1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe government’s proposals to devolve decision making on expenditure ultimately fits in with their localism agenda – devolving power and responsibility from a national to local level.\n&#xa0;\n1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe over-ri\nding consideration for any decision making process is the need to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of the outcomes being sought.\n&#xa0;\n1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe timescales associated with the identification, development and subsequent implementation of major transport scheme\ns are lengthy: a factor that needs to be taken into account whenever reviewing the need for change to the decision making process for prioritising and allocating funding.\n&#xa0;\n1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithin the last five years the decision making process for allocating funds to inves\nt in transport infrastructure has undergone repeated and fundamental change – from the prioritisation of schemes on a regional/sub national basis, to centralised decision making, to devolution to Local Transport Boards and now to non-statutory partnerships\n led by the Local Enterprise Partnerships working in partnership with local authorities and other partners.\n&#xa0;\n1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChange to the decision making process is in itself not inherently a bad thing.  However, \nit needs to be remembered that\n any change temporarily adds\n inertia to the delivery process.  The \nChartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) is of the view that the \nprofession’s collective ability to improve the efficiency and speed of delivery of infrastructure is inextricably linked to the extent to which there is a degree of \ncontinuity\n and certainty\n in the \nbasis of the \ndecision making process.\n  The creation of the \nSingle Local Growth Fund should assist with certainty of the funding stream.\n&#xa0;\n1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevolution of decision making to the local level has been accompanied by a simplified approach to planning policy.  Whilst the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framew\nork has simplified the overarching policy framework, there remains an expectation within the profession, as to the need to retain and reference technical guidance and/or advice.\n&#xa0;\n1.7   \nThe establishment of Local Enterprise Partnerships\n (LEPs)\n, followed by \nthe opportunity for local partners to work on the development of City-Deal proposals, and now the prospect of Growth Deals, have led to the development of stronger working relationships between public sector organisations, the business community and academ\nia.\n  There remains a need to ensure the same level of duty to \ncooperate (\nconsider neighbouring authorities\n)\n applies to LEPs and Planning Authorities as the Traffic Management Act places on Local Highway Authorities to address cross boundary concerns\n&#xa0;\n1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch initiatives \ncan\n encourage the development of a single narrative for a functional economic area – \npotentially \nenabl\ning\n local partners to better articulate the inter-relationship between investment in transport infrastructure, \nenvironment, \nhousing and skills in support of economic growth across their area.  \nWhilst agreeing with the government’s move towards devolution, there is a danger that local response\n \ncould be very local and not joined up, leading to inconsistencies.\n \n  \n1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal partners \nshould be allowed to build upon this by continuing to be allowed to develop bespoke governance and working arrangements for their area that best reflect their local circumstances.  However, it is accepted that the governance and working arrangements should\n be subject to the approval of Government: to ensure that devolution of funding (with the potential for being held accountable to Parliament) is vested in an appropriately constituted set up.\n&#xa0;\nQ2              Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes?  What would the optimum delivery body look like?&#xa0;\n2.1  \nIt is difficul\nt to make a complete assessment \nof the new arrangements as not \nenough time has yet passed to make a proper evaluation. Some \nlocal bodies\n are also further ahead and working more effectively than others.\n&#xa0;\n2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CIHT argues that a discussion on the governance and working arrangements at the local level should differentiate between the forum in which decisions on investment priorities are made and the arrangements in place to deliver that investment on the grou\nnd.  \n&#xa0;\n2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe previous attempt to devolve decision making on the allocation of investment in major transport schemes – through the process of Regiona\nl Funding Allocations – enabled\n \nlocal \ndecision makers to use their knowledge to prioritise the available trans\nport funding \nand to \nco-ordinate\n that investment with the funds available for \nhousing and economic development.\n&#xa0;\n2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nCIHT argues that the \nimportance of adopting a co-ordinated approach r\ne\nmains as valid today as it did then – travel is a derived demand.\n&#xa0;\n2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA k\ney issue that needs consideration as part of this Inquiry is that of the av\na\nilability of the technical and political skills required to enable the decision making process to operate efficiently.  Local \nHighway\n Authorities continue to be the main repository\n for these skills within the local area.  It is therefore unsurprising that many Local Enterprise Partnerships look to their Local\n \nHighway\n Authorities to provide the technical support on transport related matters.  \n&#xa0;\n2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CIHT\n argues that the role of Local Highway\n Authorities\n and Integrated Transport Authorities\n in this regard should be acknowledged more explicitly across Government.  \n&#xa0;\n2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the absence of such acknowledgement, a consequence of the on-going financial pressures wi\nthin the public sector is the \nloss of existing \nskills\n.  This remove\ns\n capacity and capability within the authorities at the very time when there is an increased need for the public sector to provide strong leadership in the development and delivery of major transport schemes.  An added threat to the skills base is the contr\naction in size and scope of local authority activities.  Change of this type reduces the opportunities and capacity of local authorities to train and develop the skills required to maintain the skills base in the longer term.\n&#xa0;\n2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs is the case with many othe\nr professions, that of transport planning faces the challenges of an aging demographic.  As a professional body the CIHT is actively supporting the development of appropriate skills within the existing workforce as well as encouraging future generations to\n enter the profession.\n&#xa0;\nQ3              What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?&#xa0;\n3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA ‘light touch’ \nnational\n \nspatial strategy, supported by a National Policy Statement on National Ne\ntworks, \nwould provide such co-ordinated approach at the national level.  Th\ne CIHT argues that this \nwould have two immediate benefits.  Firstly it would reinforce the need for increased cross-Departmental working within Whitehall\n, in the process supporting \nthe establishment of \nthe Local Growth Fund.  Secondly, it would provide local partners with a clear context within which to develop their local proposals\n: proposals that reflect local priorities and which are outcome focused.\n&#xa0;\n3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe issue of transport scheme\ns that cross local authority boundaries has to be considered in the context of the issues that each scheme might raise.  Where a cross \nboundary scheme is of national significance in its own right, or forms part of a wider corridor approach that is of natio\nnal significance, it would seem appropriate for that to be reflected in the national framework.\n&#xa0;\n3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe key consideration for any potential scheme (not just ones that are cross boundary) must be an understanding of the outcome it delivers and how that relates\n to the agreed outcomes for the relevant functional economic area.   By focusing on the delivery of outcomes, schemes that cross local authority boundaries should not be disadvantaged.\n&#xa0;\nQ4              How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?&#xa0;\n4.1              \nI\nn a recent workshop hosted by CIHT on behalf of the DfT and HA and including Local Authorities and \nLE\nPs it became clear that there were\n \nsome \ngood\n or \nimproving\n working practice\ns\n between\n Local Authorities and the Highways Agency.\n&#xa0;\n4.2              \nIt is important that this relationship is maintained and improved upon once the\n Highways Agency becomes a GoCo\n, ensuring that a duty to cooperate and the economic growth agenda are covered by any new holistic performance specification. \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \n              \nImproved certainty of funding for the newly formed Highways Agency should assist local areas better understand, inform and \nrespond to the Agency’s plans.\n It should also improve local networks to meet the wider economic growth agenda.\n&#xa0;\n4.4   \nThe Agency should also have a better understanding on how it can and should involve local bodies.   Customers view the highway network as \na whole and local bodies\n,\n the HA and other stakeholders need to recognise this.\n&#xa0;\n4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany authorities are taking some if not all of the standard methodologies developed by the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme \n(HMEP),\n a sector led, DfT sponsored programme.  This is a positive trend and should be encouraged by all.\n&#xa0;\n4.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also important for the DfT to ensure that other government departments recognise the cross-cutting nature of transport and the cros\ns-sector benefits that can result from transport investment (e.g. health, climate change, education, air quality and access to key services).\n&#xa0;\n4.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst the establishment of LEPs has led to stronger working relationships between public and private sectors \nthere remains further room for improved and more effective working. \n&#xa0;\n4.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt will be essential that there is coordination and cooperation between local bodies.  Whilst there are some very good examples \nof good local working practices, there is a danger of unev\nen development and funding which could lead to inconsistencies. There can also be different skills levels and types between areas.  A higher skill level would be seen as a huge advantage to an areas ability to attract investors.\n&#xa0;\nQ5              Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities?  How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?&#xa0;\n5.1   \nOne aspect of private sector funding for transport that gives cause for concern is that secured throug\nh the planning system.  Whilst experience with the Community Infrastructure Levy is limited to date, there is a growing concern that the opportunity to \nsecure an appropriate contribution towards transport infrastructure through the planning system is becom\ning more difficult.\n&#xa0;\n5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis concern is compounded by the fact that up to 25% of Community Infrastructure Levy monies secured will be directed in accordance with the priorities identified by neighbourhood communities.\n&#xa0;\n5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is an inherent inflexibility \npresent within the Community Infrastructure Levy when compared with the previous S106 regime.  In the latter the need to secure an appropriate contribution towards transport infrastructure could be driven back into the land value if necessary.  That flexib\nility is lost as a result of the introduction of the Community Infrastructure Levy.\n&#xa0;\n5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailure to address the challenges associated with securing appropriate contributions for transport infrastructure through the planning system will inevitably increase the \npressure on other funding sources.\n&#xa0;\n5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA move from grants to competitive bidding rounds for pots of funding could be a drain on already scare resources\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ6               What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the Single Local Growth Fund have?&#xa0;\n6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevolution of decision making on funding must be accompanied by extending the scope for local partners to determine the basis on which their\n local priorities are arrived at\n.  Variations in approach to reflect local circumstances should b\ne encouraged, confident in the fact that the national spatial strategy provides \nan \nappropriate strategic context.\n&#xa0;\n6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe closer one can align policy making with responsibility for the allocation of funds, the \ngreater the opportunity to improve the efficiency\n and timeliness of the \ndecision making process.\n&#xa0;\n6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is essential that the local governance and working arrangements associated with the devolution of decision making and funding reflect the views of the public sector organisations, the business community a\nnd academia.  It is particularly important that the views of one sector do not dominant.  \n&#xa0;\n6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is essential that the allocation of funds from the \nSingle \nLocal Growth Fund is not overly focused on investment in new infrastructure to unlock development oppor\ntunities.  Public sector organisations, and in particular the Local Transport Authorities, will be keen to ensure that significant investment continues to be made in maintaining the existing transport infrastructure.  The CIHT has consistently argued the c\nase for investment in maintenance of the existing asset as being of equal, if not greater, significance when it comes to supporting economic growth in the round.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a danger that the \ndelivery could be fragmented and lack overall cohesion\n which coul\nd lead to inefficiencies of scale.  As mentioned in 4.5 the use of HMEP, encouraging sharing of learning/best practices and set ways of operating will help to drive efficiencies into delivery at a local level.\n&#xa0;\n6.6              \nB\netter forward visibility of public \nsector funding (\ni.e\n.\n five years plus) would enable local bodies to better develop a clear strategy and provisional programme and therefore lever private sector contributions and other joint funding to deliver a more secure programme of infrastructure schem\nes.\n&#xa0;\n6.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFlexibility of Strategic public sector funding to enable more contributions to schemes that are not on the strategic network but contribute to strategic objectives\n&#xa0;\nQ7.              How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure?  What scope is there for the use of alternative funding schemes?&#xa0;\n7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany Local Transport Authorities have established long-term contractual arrangements with private sector delivery partners who\n support them in fulfilling their statutory duties.  Increasingly Local Transport Authorities are exploring with these partners the opportunity to develop more innovative approaches to financing the delivery of major transport schemes.  \n&#xa0;\n7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe opportunity f\nor local partners to leverage in additional funding (as opposed to financing delivery of schemes with funding already secured) is again something that Local Transport Authorities are exploring.  The covenant of local authorities in the UK remains very attr\nactive to institutional investors.  Government support for innovative solutions led by Local Transport Authorities may enable additional funding to be leveraged more cost effectively than if led by the private sector.  \n&#xa0;\n7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch an approach could be seen as r\neinforcing the devolution of decision making and funding to local partnerships.  It could also be used to reinforce other Government initiatives designed to increase the extent to which funding raised locally is retained within the local economy.\n&#xa0;\nQ8              How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?&#xa0;\n8.1 \n \nThe lines of accountability are unclear.\n  CIHT believes that LTBs, LEPs should be democratically accountable and representative, it is essential that the develop\nment of local scheme priorities fits with existing statutory plans.\n Elected members from district councils and, in the metropolitan areas, the Integrated Transport Authorities, should have a clear and prominent role in the process.\n&#xa0;\n8.2 \n \nIn\n our view, encouragement should be given for membership of the LTBs to be extended to other bodies, as relevant, including the Highways Agency, Network Rail, local Chambers of Commerce, key transport operators, and representative bodies in relation to publ\nic transport \n&#xa0;\nConclusion              \nThe approach set out in this submission to \nestablishing the local governance and working arrangements, if \nsupported \nby Government \nthrough the publication of a ‘light-touch’ \nnational spatial strategy would provide clarity \nin terms of \nthe lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure.\n&#xa0;\nThe CIHT argues that clarity and stability in the decision making process is essential in order to provide certainty for scheme promoters to invest staff time and \nvaluable revenue funding in the development of proposals.  It is also essential in order to provide confidence to business investors who are looking for a modern and efficient transport system to support economic growth.\n&#xa0;\nConstant change to the decision ma\nking process in recent years has \nnot given scheme promoters and their delivery partners the confidence to \nmake the \ninvest\nment in scheme \ndevelopment that would enable th\ne \nrequired \nlong-term investment programme \nfor \nUK \nto come forward\n.  \n&#xa0;\nAs a consequence, w\nhen opportunities to secure funding from Government have arisen so the likelihood \nincreases that \nsome of that funding \nis \nallocated to opportunistic schemes simply because they are ready\n.  The existence of an agreed programme of investment determined locall\ny within the framework provided by a national spatial strategy would help ensure that the funds available are allocated to the most appropriate schemes.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nCIHT submit that the \nintroduction of the \nSingle \nLocal Growth Fund affords the opportunity to devel\nop a truly devolved decision making and funding arrangement.  However, in order to ensure that such an approach is efficient and delivers timely investment it is important that Government provides a ‘light touch’ national spatial strategy: one that is supp\norted by appropriate national policy statements.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n  \n&#xa0;\n"
