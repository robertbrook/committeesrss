defaultSubmission from Cllr Jack Scott, Cabinet Member for Environment, Recycling and Streetscene, Sheffield City Councildefault&#xa0;defaultLocal Government Procurement: defaultA Cabinet Member Perspectivedefault&#xa0;defaultBackgrounddefaultThe scale and pace of changes in local government present 
defaultsignificant challenges for Lead Members / Cabinet. In particular, the financial pressures faced by Local Authorities require more decisive and vis
defaultible leadership from Council
defaultlors
default. As Local Authorities seek to respond to unprecedented 
defaultchallenge the importan
defaultce of 
defaulteffective procurement, commissioning and contract management cannot be overestimated. It also poses unique challenges for Lead Members – coherent delivery of external work requires a fundamentally different set of skills and approach to managing in-h
defaultouse services. These are captured in the 
defaultsummary 
defaultnote below. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStrategic Political defaultCommissioningdefault&#xa0;defaultIn many large Metropolitan 
defaultDistricts
default, up to 60% of expenditure is now outsourced. As a result, procurement and commissioning 
defaulthave become vital components of delivering upon a political agenda and proactive place shaping.
default&#xa0;
defaultLead Members need to be 
defaultequipped to be 
defaultable to articulate the outcome (rather than outputs) a specific procurement will achieve and set it within a broader poli
defaulttical vision.
default&#xa0;
defaultEarly EngagementdefaultThe Commissioning Cycle often starts over six months before a formal procurement is issued. Lead Members need to be involved well in advance if they are to effectively steer and shape the procurement in accordance with their
default political priorities and vision. There are tales of Lead Members simply being ‘consulted’ for signing off a procurement, rather than directing the process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMarket IntelligencedefaultPrior to procurement, Lead Members need to understand the market for services
default they wish to procure themselves – it is insufficient to ask Officers to advise on this. 
defaultWhen undertaking procurement exercises, Lead Members 
defaultcan be 
defaultbeset 
defaultby provider interests – both external and internal to the Council. Lead Members need to be sufficient
defaultly agile to build effective personal relationships whilst avoiding accusations of bias or favoritism. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUser and Customer InvolvementdefaultAs part of developing a coherent and articulate political vision, Lead Members need to be skilled in engaging and involvin
defaultg users and customers and matching their expectations and requirements with political priorities and budget. 
default&#xa0;defaultFinancial Engineering and Performance MechanismsdefaultMany of the financial and performance products available in procurement are novel to Local Government, having been developed over the last decade or so. Particularly in the case of PFIs and working with banks, it is vital that Lead Members understand the l
defaultevers and performance mechanisms within contracts if they are to sufficiently understand the gearing of 
defaultcontracts to 
defaulthold providers to account. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInspiring Innovationdefault&#xa0;defaultLead Members should be 
defaultskilled 
defaultto push providers for innovation and provide incentives for 
defaulttaking a 
defaultbalanced risk 
defaultapproach. Without sufficient incentives and encouragement, outsourced projects can be stifled and hit their targets, whilst missing the point. This is particularly the case 
defaultfor long-term projects. 
default&#xa0;
defaultVisible Leadership and AccountabilitydefaultUltimately, Lead Members 
defaultshould
default recognize that they are responsible for the delivery or otherwise of contracted work. It is quite legitimate for Lead Members t
defaulto share 
defaultin 
defaultthe successes when 
defaultcontracts 
defaultwork well
default, provided they also take responsibility when contractors fail to perform. Lead Members also need to understand the balance between setting employment practice standards and recognizing providers are the employers.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefaultThe issues ra
defaultised above all merit 
defaultsignificant 
defaultfurther consideration. They highlight a clear need for Lead Members to develop new skill sets and approaches 
defaultin order 
defaultto 
defaultprovide 
defaultvoter
defaults with 
defaultconfidence, manage risk and generate innovation. Given the scale of the changes, L
defaultocal Authorities should provide specific training to cover these issues for all Councillors, not just Lead Members.
