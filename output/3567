[normal]Submission from Cllr Jack Scott, Cabinet Member for Environment, Recycling and Streetscene, Sheffield City Council[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Local Government Procurement: [bold]A Cabinet Member Perspective[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background[bold]The scale and pace of changes in local government present 
[normal]significant challenges for Lead Members / Cabinet. In particular, the financial pressures faced by Local Authorities require more decisive and vis
[normal]ible leadership from Council
[normal]lors
[normal]. As Local Authorities seek to respond to unprecedented 
[normal]challenge the importan
[normal]ce of 
[normal]effective procurement, commissioning and contract management cannot be overestimated. It also poses unique challenges for Lead Members – coherent delivery of external work requires a fundamentally different set of skills and approach to managing in-h
[normal]ouse services. These are captured in the 
[normal]summary 
[normal]note below. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Strategic Political [bold]Commissioning[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In many large Metropolitan 
[normal]Districts
[normal], up to 60% of expenditure is now outsourced. As a result, procurement and commissioning 
[normal]have become vital components of delivering upon a political agenda and proactive place shaping.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lead Members need to be 
[normal]equipped to be 
[normal]able to articulate the outcome (rather than outputs) a specific procurement will achieve and set it within a broader poli
[normal]tical vision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Early Engagement[bold]The Commissioning Cycle often starts over six months before a formal procurement is issued. Lead Members need to be involved well in advance if they are to effectively steer and shape the procurement in accordance with their
[normal] political priorities and vision. There are tales of Lead Members simply being ‘consulted’ for signing off a procurement, rather than directing the process. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Market Intelligence[bold]Prior to procurement, Lead Members need to understand the market for services
[normal] they wish to procure themselves – it is insufficient to ask Officers to advise on this. 
[normal]When undertaking procurement exercises, Lead Members 
[normal]can be 
[normal]beset 
[normal]by provider interests – both external and internal to the Council. Lead Members need to be sufficient
[normal]ly agile to build effective personal relationships whilst avoiding accusations of bias or favoritism. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]User and Customer Involvement[bold]As part of developing a coherent and articulate political vision, Lead Members need to be skilled in engaging and involvin
[normal]g users and customers and matching their expectations and requirements with political priorities and budget. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Financial Engineering and Performance Mechanisms[bold]Many of the financial and performance products available in procurement are novel to Local Government, having been developed over the last decade or so. Particularly in the case of PFIs and working with banks, it is vital that Lead Members understand the l
[normal]evers and performance mechanisms within contracts if they are to sufficiently understand the gearing of 
[normal]contracts to 
[normal]hold providers to account. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Inspiring Innovation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Lead Members should be 
[normal]skilled 
[normal]to push providers for innovation and provide incentives for 
[normal]taking a 
[normal]balanced risk 
[normal]approach. Without sufficient incentives and encouragement, outsourced projects can be stifled and hit their targets, whilst missing the point. This is particularly the case 
[normal]for long-term projects. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Visible Leadership and Accountability[bold]Ultimately, Lead Members 
[normal]should
[normal] recognize that they are responsible for the delivery or otherwise of contracted work. It is quite legitimate for Lead Members t
[normal]o share 
[normal]in 
[normal]the successes when 
[normal]contracts 
[normal]work well
[normal], provided they also take responsibility when contractors fail to perform. Lead Members also need to understand the balance between setting employment practice standards and recognizing providers are the employers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]The issues ra
[normal]ised above all merit 
[normal]significant 
[normal]further consideration. They highlight a clear need for Lead Members to develop new skill sets and approaches 
[normal]in order 
[normal]to 
[normal]provide 
[normal]voter
[normal]s with 
[normal]confidence, manage risk and generate innovation. Given the scale of the changes, L
[normal]ocal Authorities should provide specific training to cover these issues for all Councillors, not just Lead Members.
