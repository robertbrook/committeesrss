default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRobert Bosch Healthcare offers a wide ranging portfolio of care products for chronically ill patients and the elderly which helps to bring significant quality, efficiency and financial gains to the UK healthcare sector.
default 
defaultOur aim is to help people with long term conditions remain in their own homes and out of hospital wherever possible.
default 
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBosch’s telehealth spectrum ranges from 
defaultin-home 
defaultpatient terminals to comprehensive software allowing healthcare professionals to efficiently evaluate 
defaultrisk-stratified 
defaultdata coming from the patient terminals and other connected devices. Bosch Telehealth strives to improve 
defaultthe care and management of patients with long-term conditions 
defaultthrough systematic patient 
defaulteducation, behaviour modification support, daily 
defaultmonitoring 
defaultof symptoms and vital signs 
defaultand 
defaultpatient engagement techniques
default. The result is that health professionals are able to provide a higher quality of care for patients with chronic conditions, patients lead happier and healthier lives, and the cost of healthcare is reduced for funders. Robert Bosch Healthcare
default Systems
default, Inc. is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Bosch Group.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services
default and is represented in over 60 countries
default.
default The company was set up in Stuttgart in 1886 by Robert Bosch (1861
default–
default1942) as a “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering.” The special ownership structure of Robert Bosch GmbH guarantees the entrepreneurial freedom of the Bosch Group, making it possible for the company to plan over the long term and to undertake significant up-front investments in the safeguarding of its future. Ninety-two 
defaultper cent
default of the share capital of Robert Bosch GmbH is held by Robert Bosch 
defaultStiftung
default GmbH, a charitable foundation.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe respected health 
defaultthink-tank
default, 2020health, recently published the findings of its own study of a telehealth hub pilot in Yorkshire.
default 
defaultIt found that 
defaulttelehealth
default-enabled care co-ordination can reduce hospital admissions, provide care at home and improve patient outcomes.
default 
defaultIt noted that for every 100 patients using technology, 10 hospital admissions are averted each month – that's up to £2,000 saved per averted admission, representing a return on investment of 48%.
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Department of Health (DH) believes that at least three million people with long term conditions and/or social care needs could benefit from the use of assistive technologies and telehealth services.
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImplemented effectively these technologies can alleviate pressure on long term NHS 
defaultand social care 
defaultcosts and improve people’s quality of life through better self-care in the home setting.
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBosch believes that
default the
default key to achieving this goal is a more integrated approach to health and social care. Bosch support
defaults
default NICE’s new oversight role on social care and welcomes the opportunity to 
defaultmake a submission to the Health Select Committee on the management of long term conditions. 
defaultFor technology to work, it must be embedded in care pathways that are designed for patients with long term conditions. This means managing their conditions 
defaultacross the continuum of care 
default–
default 
defaultat home
default,
default in the community and in clinical setting
defaults
default.
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur experience has told us that:
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is particularly relevant to NICE’s proposed guidance on 
defaultm
defaultedicines management in home-based settings
default and 
defaultReablement
default.
default 
defaultBosch
default, whose systems support medication compliance,
default believes that this 
defaultproposed guidance 
defaultwill 
defaultplay a significant role in managing long-term conditions
default.
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 3millionlives campaign was launched on the back of the initial results from the Whole System
defaults
default Demonstrator
default (WSD)
default Project with the goal of bringing technology
default-
defaultenabled integrated care to 3 million people in the UK by 201
default5
default.
default 
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA key part of this strategy is the first Mandate between the 
defaultDH
default and NHS 
defaultEngland
default, published in November 2012, setting out the 
defaultrequirements
default for the
default health service in forthcoming
default years. 
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NHS Mandate is structured around five key areas where the Government expects the NHS 
defaultEngland
default to make improvements:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTechnology has a vital role to play in meeting th
defaultese 
defaultintrinsically linked objectives. The second stage findings of the WSD have unfortunately
default 
default‘muddied the waters’ in terms of moving the technology agenda forward.
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBosch was disappointed with the 
defaultsecond stage results of the
default WSD and its apparent limited effect on quality of life and psychological outcomes. Bosch 
defaulttelehealth 
defaultsystems have demonstrated, in more than 40 publications, that its content-driven telehealth intervention supports integrated care and 
defaultconsistently 
defaultproduces significant cost savings in addition to improve
defaultment
default in both clinical outcomes and the quality of care.
default 
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBosch Healthcare’s Health Buddy System (HBS) was not part of the WSD project and provides 
defaulta
default more
default integrated solution 
defaultthan the telehealth interventions used in the WSD.
default 
defaultWhilst many systems focus on vital signs monitoring, Bosch systems utilise 
defaultmore extensive education to support improved patient self-management, positive reinforcement of beha
defaultviour change which is personalis
defaulted to the patient
default.
default 
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst a significant study for telehealth in the UK, there are several mitigating factors that need to be considered
default when reviewing the results of the WSD
default.
default 
defaultFor example, 
defaulttelehealth
default devices and monitoring systems varied amongst the study sites and there were inconsistencies in describing exactly what the 
defaulttelehealth
default interventions were.
default 
defaultCrucially
default none of the systems used provided
default support for increased efficiency and effectiveness of clinician workflow
default or supported improved patient self-management
default.
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese latest results are understandably influencing the decisions of commissioners who are currently in the process of shaping
default 
defaultthe
default composition of future service delivery
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith a
defaultn
default ageing population on the one hand and ongoing budget restrictions on the other, the results have called into perspective an ever-more-urgent need to look at how to create a sustainable delivery model for the future.
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTherefore UK health and social care services must also look abroad for the evidence base to support a more integrated approach 
defaultto 
defaultmanaging long term conditions
default. 
defaultTo take the 
defaultexample 
defaultof a study from the USA 
defaultMedicare system (which has parallels with the NHS) that
default focussed on Congestive Heart Failure 
default(one of 
defaultthis Inquiry’s 
defaultterms of reference) 
defaultBosch found significant reduced mortality for patients through 
defaultthe use of its telehealth in combination with care coordination
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloping strategies to reduce readmission rates and improve outcomes for patients with HF has become a national health priorit
defaulty in the United States
default, as it has in other developed countries
default.
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultData for 623 matched pairs of Medicare HF beneficiaries were 
defaultanalysed
default. The results showed that care management combined with the Health Buddy System was associated with a 25 
defaultper cent
default reduction in all-cause mortality risk in beneficiaries with HF, who were offered the 
defaultprogramme
default and a 57 
defaultper cent
default reduction in mortality risk for those HF beneficiaries who actively participated in the 
defaultprogramme
default compared to the control studies
default.
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEmpowering patients does not only statistically influence health outcomes but has associated cost and social benefits too. Self-management helps reduce the cost burden on services through reducing the number of staff required per patient and in social terms the education component, common to many assistive technologies, greatly increases health literacy. The long term benefits of increased health literacy are exponential.
default5.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese "on the ground" results are, more often than not, the product of integrated delivery systems being put into practice through healthcare and industry partnerships that handle populations with high numbers of people with chronic conditions.
default5.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor technology to work, it must be embedded in care pathways that are designed for patients with long term conditions. It should comprise of a range of interventions 
default–
default including coaching and telecare. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBosch’s studies have demonstrated that, through giving patients an active role in their treatment, they can significantly influence their own health outcomes. Bosch believes that this will be vital to the future strategy of managing long term conditions.
