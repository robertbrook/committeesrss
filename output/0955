[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Robert Bosch Healthcare offers a wide ranging portfolio of care products for chronically ill patients and the elderly which helps to bring significant quality, efficiency and financial gains to the UK healthcare sector.
[normal] 
[normal]Our aim is to help people with long term conditions remain in their own homes and out of hospital wherever possible.
[normal] 
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bosch’s telehealth spectrum ranges from 
[normal]in-home 
[normal]patient terminals to comprehensive software allowing healthcare professionals to efficiently evaluate 
[normal]risk-stratified 
[normal]data coming from the patient terminals and other connected devices. Bosch Telehealth strives to improve 
[normal]the care and management of patients with long-term conditions 
[normal]through systematic patient 
[normal]education, behaviour modification support, daily 
[normal]monitoring 
[normal]of symptoms and vital signs 
[normal]and 
[normal]patient engagement techniques
[normal]. The result is that health professionals are able to provide a higher quality of care for patients with chronic conditions, patients lead happier and healthier lives, and the cost of healthcare is reduced for funders. Robert Bosch Healthcare
[normal] Systems
[normal], Inc. is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Bosch Group.
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services
[normal] and is represented in over 60 countries
[normal].
[normal] The company was set up in Stuttgart in 1886 by Robert Bosch (1861
[normal]–
[normal]1942) as a “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering.” The special ownership structure of Robert Bosch GmbH guarantees the entrepreneurial freedom of the Bosch Group, making it possible for the company to plan over the long term and to undertake significant up-front investments in the safeguarding of its future. Ninety-two 
[normal]per cent
[normal] of the share capital of Robert Bosch GmbH is held by Robert Bosch 
[normal]Stiftung
[normal] GmbH, a charitable foundation.

[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The respected health 
[normal]think-tank
[normal], 2020health, recently published the findings of its own study of a telehealth hub pilot in Yorkshire.
[normal] 
[normal]It found that 
[normal]telehealth
[normal]-enabled care co-ordination can reduce hospital admissions, provide care at home and improve patient outcomes.
[normal] 
[normal]It noted that for every 100 patients using technology, 10 hospital admissions are averted each month – that's up to £2,000 saved per averted admission, representing a return on investment of 48%.
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department of Health (DH) believes that at least three million people with long term conditions and/or social care needs could benefit from the use of assistive technologies and telehealth services.
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Implemented effectively these technologies can alleviate pressure on long term NHS 
[normal]and social care 
[normal]costs and improve people’s quality of life through better self-care in the home setting.
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bosch believes that
[normal] the
[normal] key to achieving this goal is a more integrated approach to health and social care. Bosch support
[normal]s
[normal] NICE’s new oversight role on social care and welcomes the opportunity to 
[normal]make a submission to the Health Select Committee on the management of long term conditions. 
[normal]For technology to work, it must be embedded in care pathways that are designed for patients with long term conditions. This means managing their conditions 
[normal]across the continuum of care 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]at home
[normal],
[normal] in the community and in clinical setting
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our experience has told us that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is particularly relevant to NICE’s proposed guidance on 
[normal]m
[normal]edicines management in home-based settings
[normal] and 
[normal]Reablement
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Bosch
[normal], whose systems support medication compliance,
[normal] believes that this 
[normal]proposed guidance 
[normal]will 
[normal]play a significant role in managing long-term conditions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 3millionlives campaign was launched on the back of the initial results from the Whole System
[normal]s
[normal] Demonstrator
[normal] (WSD)
[normal] Project with the goal of bringing technology
[normal]-
[normal]enabled integrated care to 3 million people in the UK by 201
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A key part of this strategy is the first Mandate between the 
[normal]DH
[normal] and NHS 
[normal]England
[normal], published in November 2012, setting out the 
[normal]requirements
[normal] for the
[normal] health service in forthcoming
[normal] years. 
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NHS Mandate is structured around five key areas where the Government expects the NHS 
[normal]England
[normal] to make improvements:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Technology has a vital role to play in meeting th
[normal]ese 
[normal]intrinsically linked objectives. The second stage findings of the WSD have unfortunately
[normal] 
[normal]‘muddied the waters’ in terms of moving the technology agenda forward.
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bosch was disappointed with the 
[normal]second stage results of the
[normal] WSD and its apparent limited effect on quality of life and psychological outcomes. Bosch 
[normal]telehealth 
[normal]systems have demonstrated, in more than 40 publications, that its content-driven telehealth intervention supports integrated care and 
[normal]consistently 
[normal]produces significant cost savings in addition to improve
[normal]ment
[normal] in both clinical outcomes and the quality of care.
[normal] 
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bosch Healthcare’s Health Buddy System (HBS) was not part of the WSD project and provides 
[normal]a
[normal] more
[normal] integrated solution 
[normal]than the telehealth interventions used in the WSD.
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst many systems focus on vital signs monitoring, Bosch systems utilise 
[normal]more extensive education to support improved patient self-management, positive reinforcement of beha
[normal]viour change which is personalis
[normal]ed to the patient
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst a significant study for telehealth in the UK, there are several mitigating factors that need to be considered
[normal] when reviewing the results of the WSD
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]telehealth
[normal] devices and monitoring systems varied amongst the study sites and there were inconsistencies in describing exactly what the 
[normal]telehealth
[normal] interventions were.
[normal] 
[normal]Crucially
[normal] none of the systems used provided
[normal] support for increased efficiency and effectiveness of clinician workflow
[normal] or supported improved patient self-management
[normal].
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These latest results are understandably influencing the decisions of commissioners who are currently in the process of shaping
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] composition of future service delivery
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With a
[normal]n
[normal] ageing population on the one hand and ongoing budget restrictions on the other, the results have called into perspective an ever-more-urgent need to look at how to create a sustainable delivery model for the future.
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Therefore UK health and social care services must also look abroad for the evidence base to support a more integrated approach 
[normal]to 
[normal]managing long term conditions
[normal]. 
[normal]To take the 
[normal]example 
[normal]of a study from the USA 
[normal]Medicare system (which has parallels with the NHS) that
[normal] focussed on Congestive Heart Failure 
[normal](one of 
[normal]this Inquiry’s 
[normal]terms of reference) 
[normal]Bosch found significant reduced mortality for patients through 
[normal]the use of its telehealth in combination with care coordination
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Developing strategies to reduce readmission rates and improve outcomes for patients with HF has become a national health priorit
[normal]y in the United States
[normal], as it has in other developed countries
[normal].
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Data for 623 matched pairs of Medicare HF beneficiaries were 
[normal]analysed
[normal]. The results showed that care management combined with the Health Buddy System was associated with a 25 
[normal]per cent
[normal] reduction in all-cause mortality risk in beneficiaries with HF, who were offered the 
[normal]programme
[normal] and a 57 
[normal]per cent
[normal] reduction in mortality risk for those HF beneficiaries who actively participated in the 
[normal]programme
[normal] compared to the control studies
[normal].
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Empowering patients does not only statistically influence health outcomes but has associated cost and social benefits too. Self-management helps reduce the cost burden on services through reducing the number of staff required per patient and in social terms the education component, common to many assistive technologies, greatly increases health literacy. The long term benefits of increased health literacy are exponential.
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These "on the ground" results are, more often than not, the product of integrated delivery systems being put into practice through healthcare and industry partnerships that handle populations with high numbers of people with chronic conditions.
[normal]5.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For technology to work, it must be embedded in care pathways that are designed for patients with long term conditions. It should comprise of a range of interventions 
[normal]–
[normal] including coaching and telecare. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bosch’s studies have demonstrated that, through giving patients an active role in their treatment, they can significantly influence their own health outcomes. Bosch believes that this will be vital to the future strategy of managing long term conditions.
