[[[Introduction]]]Although the Public Administration Select Committee is only considering ‘crime statistics’, it is impossible to understand the true situation without also considering ‘incident data’. In many cases, calls from members of the public are initially recorded as ‘incidents’ only some of which are later recorded as crimes. It is this ‘cradle-to-grave’ process that provides opportunities to influence if/when incidents are recorded as crimes – and of those that are recorded as such – the specific type of crime that is recorded.

[[[Why is police incident and crime ]]]

[[[data important?]]]

[[[Public &amp; Officer Safety]]]If you cannot fully understand the risks presented by the number/type of incidents or crimes being committed – then how can you accurately assess the risk(s) to both the public and the officers patrolling that area?

[[[Intelligence lead policing]]]This is a phrase often used to explain how police target certain groups or areas and it can be exceptionally effective. However, it is also true that if you fail to include all of the data or, you include data that you know to be inaccurate, your results will be flawed and skewed as a result.

[[[It is the basis of majority of crime performance measures]]]The police performance landscape has (quite rightly) changed over the years, but perhaps the easiest way of understanding how this can affect policing is to read a very  insightful book by Steven D Levitt and Stephen J Dubner ‘Freakonomics’ One of their key conclusions is that&#xa0;‘people respond to incentives’&#xa0;. Perverse incentives such as the performance-related pay of ACPO officers to ‘reduce recorded crime’ might inadvertently encourage fewer crimes to be recorded by officers although the number of victims is not actually reduced. As you will see this has a serious effect on the quality of service provided to victims of crime and in the long-term has a serious and detrimental effect on public confidence.

[[[Police &amp; Crime Commissioners - holding Chief Officers to account]]]This represents a sea change in policing and accountability. Notwithstanding the low level of turnout at the recent elections, PCCs are now in office and represent a real opportunity to guarantee greater accountability.It might be prudent at this point to remember that it can often be advantageous to present police performance as something overly complex. The national police landscape is changing and if the future were to include reducing the number of forces and decreasing the number of Chief Officers then it is quite understandable that they would want to present themselves in the most flattering light.&#xa0;Survival is a very powerful incentive.

[[[Accountability]]]

[[[ and ]]]

[[[vulnerability]]]Police and Crime Panels (PCPs) have been introduced in each force area to examine the actions and decisions of their respective PCC. Whilst the PCC holds the Chief Officer to account – the PCP supports and challenges the work of the PCC.Once again, they are reliant upon the accuracy of the data – and the risks it identifies. If either the data and/or the analysis are flawed then the assessment of risk cannot be accurate and they will be unable to discharge their function(s) effectively. Whilst every tragedy offers opportunity to ‘learn lessons’ it may not be long before prosecutions are brought against Chief Officers and PCCs under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 in relation to their failing to ensure that effective policies and procedures are in place to prevent a death. Failing to ensure accurate information is made available to officers and the public is an obvious vulnerability given the results of so many previous audits.The difference between these two figures is often referred to as&#xa0;

[[[‘the dark figure of unrecorded crime’]]]&#xa0;and it can represent a significant number of victims. Not only can this lull the public (and PCCs and PCPs) into thinking that crime is falling when it may not be – it also means that those victims whose crimes are recorded as something other than a crime (e.g. lost property) are not dealt with in accordance with the Victims Charter where victims of crime receive a prescribed response to assist them to deal with the trauma of their crime.

[[[Understanding the totality and nature of demand]]]It is often suggested that 70% of police activity relates to non-crime issues and only 30% is directly related to crime. The nature of policing is changing and each police service will have differing demands placed upon it, however, unless there exists an accurate understanding of what that demand actually consists of – then there is little hope of having the appropriate resources in the right place at the right time to meet that demand.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Preventing Critical Incidents]]]This knowledge of the totality of demand extends to preventing critical incidents by identifying pre-cursor events that when looked at as a series or a pattern, provide an insight that the situation may be deteriorating and present opportunities to intervene – and potentially save lives. There is no shortage of high-profile news stories that highlight the fact that police had been aware of the situation at a certain address for a number of weeks/months/years. The numerous calls had been logged and most (if not all) of the crimes may have been recorded, however, nobody ‘joined-up-the-dots’ to reveal that things were deteriorating until the day things got out of hand, resulting in a tragedy.

[[[Value for Money]]]Unless you understand the true picture of performance, you are denied the opportunity of being able to agree a baseline, make improvements upon it and demonstrate how you are providing greater value for money.Few would be convinced that recording the crime of theft by pickpocketing as ‘lost property’ would be a sensible approach – nor would recording attempted burglary (where the suspect has attempted to force a window with a crowbar) as ‘Criminal Damage to a dwelling’. Inaccurately recording crimes does not present value for money.Conversely, accurate crime recording allows you to understand the true situation and then put strategies in place (e.g. PCCs Policing Plan) to improve things. If you don’t agree, consider this; Two patients go to see their doctor. One tells him exactly what the symptoms are and gives a full account of how he is affected. The other fails to tell him about some symptoms altogether and only describes other symptoms as less serious than they really are. Which of the two patients stands a better chance of being cured?

[[[Productivity]]]A term often used in industry and is now increasingly being used within the police service. It can consider things such as how many officers/staff are employed on ‘front line’ duties compared with how many perform ‘back-office’ functions. Both are essential but it is the proportions that are important at a force-level.It is also clear that demographics have a part to play. Areas and populations change and so their demands change too. Is the police service responsive to those demands or is there a formula used to decide levels of policing that has not changed for years? Are some officers and police staff horribly overworked, whilst other are comparatively under-employed? Do some areas of the police service appear to perform well because of their resources – or in spite of them??

[[[Determining local policing priorities]]]Setting local priorities will be determined by a number of issues – not least of which must be the views of constituents, however, there must also be an understanding of the (accurate) levels of priority crimes and Anti Social Behaviour (ASB). The importance of accurate crime recording is rehearsed above so I shall not repeat it here.

[[[Strategic &amp; tactic]]]

[[[al planning]]]The only way in which a PCC or PCP will be able to determine success against the Policing Plan will be if there is an accurate picture of crime to begin with. It may be that the only way to do this is to ensure that things are being done in accordance with the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) the National Standard of Incident Recording (NSIR) and the National Standard of Crime Recording (NCRS)

[[[3.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Past and present audit regimes]]]The audit regime(s) that examined incident and crime data has steadily reduced over the years, possibly influenced by ACPO who view the standards described above as an ‘unnecessary bureaucracy’ rather than the essential checks and balances that support good governance and ethical crime recording. Requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the action taken (or not) by forces in response to ‘Areas of Improvement’ identified by audits might prove both interesting and embarrassing in equal measure.The emergence of PCCs has added a new dimension; the very public spat between the PCC for Gwent and his Chief Constable (that resulted in her departure) appears to be rooted in the accuracy of crime recording in that particular force. I’m confident that other PCCs will now be facing something of a dilemma; do they accept without reservation what their ACPO team regarding crime performance tells them, or do they offer a challenge? Unfortunately few are ex-Police Officers (

[[[NB]]] the PCC for Gwent is an ex Detective Superintendent) and so may be in danger of (a) being in awe of senior Police Officers who have previously ‘ruled’ without challenge (b) lacking the necessary expertise to ask sufficiently incisive and detailed questions to illicit a genuinely informative response.

[[[The incident-to-]]]

[[[crime continuum]]]I

[[[ncidents reported to Police]]]Police are informed of ‘incidents’ by a variety of means – by telephone, in person, by letter, via email etc. Rather predictably, most come in via telephone and callers are answered by either police staff or police officers – usually in call-centre type set ups. Obviously each force has its own communications arrangements; however, this is usually where the NSIR comes into play. After listening to the caller, the call-taker has to decide (on the information provided) which category the incident reported best fits into. The current categories are; Transport, Anti-Social Behaviour, Public Safety &amp; Welfare and Administration.A simple way of hiding incidents that allege crimes is to 'hide' them in another category (Anti Social Behaviour is a firm favourite). By doing so, any audit is much less likely to find them and so conclude that the force has in fact failed to record thousands of crimes. If you are to believe the eminent criminologists, it is these types of issue that can seriously erode the quality of life for victims and escalate into something much more serious. 

[[[The PASC is advised to take a close look at Anti Social Behaviour recorded on force incident recording systems - they are VERY likely to contain a large number of unrecorded crimes.]]]Crime recording is the domain of the Force Crime Registrar (FCR) whilst incident recording is that of the Force Incident Registrar (FIR). If the incident appears to relate to a crime ‘I’ve just seen two guys breaking into a car’ then the call-taker should create this as a ‘Crime-Related Incident’ (CRI) to identify this as a potential crime that may require recording. One of the regular audits carried out by forces is the difference between those crimes opened as a CRI but not resulted with a crime being recorded as you might expect. These audits have been conducted both internally and externally for a number of years and make interesting reading.It is obvious that those victims who do not have their incident recorded as a crime receive an entirely different service to those that do. The service promised to victims is often enshrined in the force’s ‘Victim’s Charter’.

[[[Whether and When to record as a crime]]]An incident will be recorded as a crime if on the balance of probabilities, the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law AND there is no credible evidence to the contrary. What this means is; is the incident more likely than not the result of a criminal act? In most cases the belief by the victim (or a person reasonably assumed to be acting on behalf of the victim) that a crime has occurred is sufficient to justify its recording.If a victim is asked if it is&#xa0;possible&#xa0;that the wallet fell out of his deep inside pocket on his zipped jacket – he may say that it would be possible if he did cartwheels downhill – but as he did not – the crime of theft (pickpocketing) should be recorded rather than recording the incident as ‘lost property’. If the incident is not recorded as a crime in the first place then that clearly makes it much easier to show a potential reduction in the number of crimes recorded. The number of actual victims remains the same – the only real difference is that the victim who had their crime recorded as Lost Property is denied the attention assured under the Victims Charter. Some victims just assume that their loss has been recorded as a crime – that may not always be the case. Lost property registers teem with unrecorded crimes.

[[[Classification of Crimes]]]Once a decision has been made to record a crime the specific type of crime chosen should be determined by applying the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) given the information available at the time of recording e.g. is it a Theft or a Burglary. At this point it is probably worth pausing and considering the importance of the type of crime being recorded. Certain crimes are also identified as ‘priority crimes’. Reducing priority crime is always difficult (catching a burglar in the act is very rare indeed and best left to television drama) but crimes such as Residential Burglary and Robbery (often referred to as ‘mugging’) are both very traumatic to victims. Faced with the prospect of reducing the number of this type of crime is a very daunting prospect. Careers have taken off (and crashed and burned!) on the success, or otherwise, of these attempts. One method that the more unscrupulous might employ is this; faced with having to record a crime – a decision is taken to record a less serious crime than the one alleged. If we believed certain crime records we could be forgiven for thinking there was a group of particular individuals so intent on damaging sash windows with a chisel, they are willing to scale scaffolding, climb drainpipes, and risk life and limb purely to inflict damage on softwood and paintwork. Unsurprisingly, Criminal Damage is not a priority crime.Another example might be recording ‘Theft’ rather than ‘Robbery’. The latter depends upon force being used – or at least the threat of it – in order to commit the offence. Looking at the number of recorded thefts where an injury to the victim is recorded might prove interesting. These types of crime are sometimes referred to as ‘leakage crimes’ i.e. they have leaked out of one type of crime classification into another.

[[[Priority Crime Intervention Teams/Gatekeepers]]]Given the potential abuse of mobile phone insurance policies (false claims made to get a new phone) it is reasonable that some questions are asked of certain victims to verify their allegations. However, it is quite possible that some of these teams/gatekeepers have undergone ‘mission creep’ and their roles have expanded into something quite different. Rather than challenge those who appear to be making a false allegation (based upon something substantial e.g. the location of the offence is covered by CCTV but nothing remotely matching their version of events was recorded) they often ring back victims and begin to challenge whether or not the crime actually occurred or by attempting to persuade the victim that a less serious crime than that originally alleged has been committed e.g. challenging whether or not force was used during a street robbery. If the victim shows any sign of deviating from their story the crime is often ‘downgraded’ to a simple theft – which is NOT a priority crime. Result; Robbery statistics are reduced.

[[[No-Criming]]]This is the method via which crimes that have been recorded as crimes are then ‘cancelled’ out. The HOCR provides a strict set of criteria for allowing police to do this;• The crime was committed outside of the jurisdiction police force in which it was recorded (i.e. transferred to another force and no-crimed in the original force so it doesn’t ‘count’ against their figures)• Following the report of an incident which has subsequently been recorded as a crime, additional verifiable information is available which determines that no notifiable crime has been committed (e.g. man seen climbing through a window by a neighbour – police are called and report a residential burglary – however this was subsequently discovered to be the householder who had forgotten their key)• the crime as alleged constitutes part of a crime already recorded.• if the reported incident was recorded as a crime in error.• the crime was one of Fraud by misrepresentation but the offender has been dealt with already.You may not be surprised to hear that many crimes are ‘no-crimed’ outside of these criteria thereby not only ‘cancelling’ crimes (including serious crimes such as Rape) which artificially reduces crime figures – but much more importantly – denies victims the aftercare and attention they would receive during an appropriate investigation.

[[[Registrars]]]The FIR and FCR could be described as the conscience of the Chief Constable. They identify issues that might impact upon the ethics and accuracy of crime and incident recording. They should (according to Home Office guidance) be the final arbiters regarding incident and crime recording – many are regularly over-ruled by their ACPO team.Very few work directly to their Chief Constable (or PCC) and most have a number of line managers between them and the chief officer. I’m sure that this is not an effort to provide plausible deniability.

[[[How would I cheat?]]]• Only record a crime if I had to.• If I have to record a crime – record the least serious crime possible.• If I can ‘cancel’ (no-crime) the crime – do so.

[[[The British Crime Survey]]]The Home Office asserts that the BCS can provide a better reflection of the true level of crime than police statistics since it includes crimes that have not been reported to, or recorded by, the police. The Home Office also claims that it measures crime more accurately than Police statistics since it captures crimes that people may not bother to report because they think the crime was too trivial or the police couldn't do much about it. The BCS also provides a better measure of trends over time since it has adopted a consistent methodology and is unaffected by changes in reporting or recording practices. (Wikipedia)Until recently the British Crime Survey and Police Recorded Crime followed roughly the same trajectory, however, they now appear to have parted company.
