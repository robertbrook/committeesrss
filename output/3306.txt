[[[.]]]The results of reducing the qualifying period for the Right to Buy (and the preserved RTB and Right to Acquire) from 5 years to 3 years in England on eligibility for the RTB are likely to be as follows:More households will be eligible to take-up the RTB.There will be a significant effect on eligibility. In 2011/12, the English Housing Survey showed that 15.6% of English social renters had been living in their homes for up to 2 years, and thus would be ineligible under current or proposed roles (see reference below). 40.1% of English social renters had been living in their homes for 2-10 years. (There is unfortunately no published breakdown for the critical 3-5 year period).  A subgroup of these, probably fewer than 20% of the total, would have been living in their homes for 3 years but not for 5 years. 44.3% had been living in their homes for over 10 years, and were thus legible for the RTB. Perhaps an additional 20% would have been living in their homes for 5-10 years, and also be eligible. Thus at present perhaps 65% of all tenants are eligible under the 5 year rule, and an additional 20% would be made eligible under the 3 year rule – an increase of about a third in numbers eligible. This might mean an increase in eligibility of 0.7m households, from 2.5m households to 3.2m households (there were 3.8m social renting household sin England in 2011/12).  (These figures should be treated as very rough estimates).This will not be a once off-effect as  at any one point there will always be more households who have lived in the same home for 3 years than there will be who have lived in the same home for 5 years.  This would only be untrue if turnover rates changed dramatically over time.The impact on eligibility will vary by region and by landlord, as turnover rates vary.However, eligibility for the RTB does not necessarily transfer into take-up. As noted, 44.3% of social renter households had been living in their homes for over 10 years, and have thus been eligible for the RTB for over 5 years, but have not yet exercised their Right to buy (and may never do so in many cases). Take-up requires households to both want to buy and to be able to afford to buy. The Survey of English Housing shows consistent enthusiasm for home ownership as a potential future tenure amongst a large majority of social and private renters (although this does tend to wane when there are problems in the owner occupied market, eg since 2008). However, DWP data show that in 2011/12 43% of social renters were living in poverty (after housing costs) (Tunstall et al. 2013). The English Housing Survey showed that in 2011/12, only 8.0% of household reference persons (roughly equivalent to heads of household) in social renting were in full-time work. While other members of households may have been in work, this indicates the likely difficulty raising a mortgage even for the RTB cost of their home for most social tenants.If we assume that the newly eligible have the same full-time employment rates as the average for the tenure, and that those in full-time employment are potentially able to secure a mortgage to take-up the RTB, we might expect to see 8% of the newly eligible potentially able to take up the extended RTB. This might amount to 56,000 households (8% x 0.7m). This is likely to be an upper limit, and would not all occur immediately after the introduction of the policy.This figure is an upper limit as not all those households with the household reference person in full-time work would be able to secure a mortgage: some may be on low wages and amongst those tenants  living in poverty. In addition, not all of those both newly eligible and potentially able to take-up the RTB will do so. For example, they might prefer to continue paying a sub-market rent or to buy a different home. Another way of thinking about likely take-up is to look at the whole life of the Right to Buy to date. Over this period, total annual take-up (amongst eligible and ineligible tenants) has varied markedly, peaking with house price booms, but in most years was only a few percent of all tenants. Because of a process of socio-tenurial polarisation since the 1970s, social tenants today are on average less likely to be in employment and more likely to have low incomes than throughout the life of the Right to Buy. This has been combined with a rise in general house prices and in the prices tenants are asked to pay for RTB homes.IN addition, contextual factors are likely to limit take-up. Currently it is a particularly difficult time for buyers without equity, and although RTBers face lower prices, this still means that take-up amongst newly eligible is likely to be lower than in the past for RTB. In addition, take-up of the RTB has tended to track patterns in the overall housing market. Thus, in current conditions (dependent on region), take-up is unlikely to be high in the short term.In 2012/13 take-up was a total of 5,000 households, only a tenth of a percent of the total group of tenants. This suggests increasing eligibility by perhaps a third might leave take-up at well under one percent of all tenants per year, and still under 10,000 households per year.However, it is important to note that the impact on eligibility will vary by region and by landlord, and might change if mortgage conditions change.Rebecca TunstallDirector of the Centre for Housing PolicyUniversity of York&#xa0;September 2013ReferencesEnglish Housing Survey for 2011/12:https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212496/EHS_HOUSEHOLDS_REPORT_2011-12.pdf1&#xa0;
