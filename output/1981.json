"&#xa0;\nUNISON – Written evidenceIntroductionUNISON is the UK's largest public service union with more than 1.3 million members. Our members are people working in the public services, for private contractors providing public services and in the essential utilities. They include frontline staff and managers, working full or part time in local authorities, the NHS, the police service, colleges and schools, the electricity, gas and water industries, transport and the voluntary sector.\nUNISON’s response is focused on a number of clauses that is of particular concern to the union and its members. These are Clause 1 ‘Health and Safety at work: general duty of self-employed persons’, Clause 2 ‘Removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations’, and Clauses 58-61: ‘Exercise of regulatory functions: economic growth’. \nClause 1: Health and Safety at work UNISON shares the concern of the TUC that this proposal will leave workers at greater risk of injury, ill health and abuse at work. By restricting coverage of the Health and Safety at Work Act and taking those self-employed who pose no risk to others from its scope, it will increase the risk of fatality and injury, and the ill-health rate. It is also opposed by the health and safety professionals’ body, IOSH, who labelled it a ‘short sighted and misleading move’ and pointed out that it would not support business. It will simply cause unhelpful confusion and uncertainty. \nClause 2: Tribunals’ powers to make wider recommendationsUNISON strongly opposes Clause 2 of the draft Bill which would remove the power of Employment Tribunals to issue wider recommendations to employers found to have unlawfully discriminated. This power provides a key additional remedy to unlawful discrimination cases, meaning that where the victim had left the workplace (as they do in 72% of cases), the Tribunal would be able to address the problem of discrimination more generally or prevent it from recurring. If a key objective of anti-discrimination legislation is to eliminate it from workplaces, then UNISON considers this power to be vital. \nThe Government claims that it is addressing “employer fears about inappropriate or excessive recommendations” but has not produced any credible evidence to support this. \n&#xa0;\nIn 2012, there were 19 cases where Tribunals issued wider recommendations. In 15 of those cases they recommended training on equality and diversity. In seven cases, respondents were asked to address equality issues generally or to review policies. Consideration of these cases reveals them to be proportionate and reasonable suggestions to address serious cases of discrimination. For example:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUNISON also shares the TUC’s concerns about the Government’s Impact Assessment of August 2012:\nClauses 58-61: Exercise of regulatory functions – economic dutyThese clauses impose a new duty on some bodies that exercise certain regulatory functions, to the desirability of promoting economic growth. UNISON believes that these clauses are not only unnecessary but also potentially damaging and in some cases likely to compromise the independence of some regulatory bodies such as the HSE or the EHRC, both of which are required under EU legislation to operate at arm’s length from the Government in the exercise of their statutory functions. \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
