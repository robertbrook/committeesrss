[normal]cycling

[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he threat of an

[normal] is a major disincentive to cycling. 
[normal]

[normal]dates from 1992
[normal] the rate of incident remains below the thre
[normal]shold of Highways Authority reaction too 
[normal]often, it’s as if the cyclist is expected to bear the risk as a normal cost.  
[normal]In
[normal] our research 
[normal]incidents, and their locations, 
[normal]suggest a more important role for segregation

[normal]Description: - 
[normal]“
[normal]FIFTY regular cyclists in Oxford kept a diary over
[normal] 
[normal]14 days in early June 1992 
[normal]and recorded 404
[normal] 
[normal]incidents which made them feel at risk. 
[normal]This[bold] [bold]constituted a rate of 0.9 incidents per cyclist per[bold] [bold]day of cycling[bold]. Fear was mostly induced by
[normal] 
[normal]other road users. Cars were blamed in 45.3 per
[normal] 
[normal]cent of the incidents, followed by buses (14.6 per
[normal] 
[normal]cent), vans (8.4 per cent) and other cyclists (6.4
[normal] 
[normal]per cent). Buses make up less than 5 per cent of
[normal] 
[normal]the city-centre traffic but were involved in 27 per
[normal] 
[normal]cent of the incidents rated as 'moderately to extremely
[normal] 
[normal]threatening' by the cyclists. 
[normal]Seventy-one[bold] [bold]per ce[bold]nt of the incidents took place in 'straight[bold]-[bold]ahead'[bold] [bold]sit[bold]uations with only 19 per cent at [bold]junctions and roundabouts[bold]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Discussion[bold]: [bold]The finding that, for this group of regular cyclists,
[normal] 
[normal]threatening incidents on the roads were experienced at the
[normal] 
[normal]rate of nearly 
[normal]one incident per cyclist per day cycled,
[normal] 
[normal]suggests that there is likely to be a considerable disincentive
[normal] 
[normal]to cycling. 
[normal]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The picture of risk derived from the diaries deviates somewhat from local accident figures. It is not clear what weight should be given 
[normal]to the official statistics on accidents as it is well accepted that cycle accidents, including those involving serious injury, are massively under-reported 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The discrepancies between the figures obtained from the diaries and those of police record data ar[bold]e reminders of the subjectivity of accident notation and witness testimony[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If a cyclist swerves to avoid
[normal] [bold]an unexpected pothole, an 
[normal]ensuing accident
[normal] with an offside
[normal] [bold]vehicle could be attributed either to 
[normal]cyclist error
[normal], to motorist
[normal] [bold]error or to road conditi
[normal]ons.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The diary figures also deviate from national accident figures produced by the Department of Transport, which give more emphasis to vehicles turning left and right, and less emphasis to parked vehicles[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its document Pedal Cyclist Casualties-1, 
[normal]the Department of Transport does warn the reader about the possible unreliability 
[normal]of their
[normal] data due to the underreporting of cycle accidents to the police
[normal], which
[normal] form the basis for their figures.  Furthermore, local figures may well differ from national fi
[normal]gures because of variations in traffic density and type, and local provision (or lack of provision) for cyclists. Also it must be noted that the diarists in the study reported here were over 23-years-old and were experienced and regular cyclists. As such t
[normal]hey were likely to anticipate the infamous problem areas for cyclists - that is, junctions and roundabouts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However
[normal] 
[normal]it is possible that cycle proficiency education has overestimated[bold] 
[normal]the risk to cyclists at intersections and roundabouts and[bold] 
[normal]underestimated the risk in straight-ahead situations. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Hospital[bold]-[bold]based[bold] [bold]studies of cycle accidents not only suggest a much[bold] [bold]larger number of accidents but also a different pattern of[bold] [bold]accidents than that indicated by police records. It is[bold] [bold]interesting to note [bold]that an Australian study examining the[bold] [bold]characteristics of fatal, as compared to total, bicycle accidents[bold] [bold]finds that fatal accidents are less likely to be at[bold] [bold]intersections than a[bold]re non-fatal accidents.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We were not expecting the result concerning the locati
[normal]on of 
[normal]incidents and subsequently undertook a broader study with a balance of diarists representing a typical traffic mix.
[normal]  
[normal]A diary study of the risk perceptions of road users[bold], HEALTH[bold], RISK &amp; SOCIETY, VOL. 3, NO. 3, 2001, SISSONS JOSHI, SENIOR &amp; SMITH. pp26
[normal]1 – 279
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal](from 
[normal]Discussion[bold], p 274)
[normal]Data from our previous study suggested that junctions and roundabouts were not perceived
[normal] 
[normal]to be as numerically hazardous by the cycle diarists as would be expected from their
[normal] 
[normal]prominence in local and national accident figures. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A similar picture emerges from this study[bold] [bold]in which only 35.4% of incidents reported by cyclists, and 37.5% of incidents involving[bold] [bold]cyclists reported by other vehicles, occurred at junctions, excluding rou[bold]ndabouts.[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This
[normal] [bold]contrasts with Oxfordshire Road Casualty figures (Oxfordshire County Council, 1993),
[normal] [bold]which report that 68% of cycle accidents occur at junctions. It is well known that cycle
[normal] [bold]accidents are under-represented in accident figures (Mills, 1989)
[normal] but we are addressing here
[normal] [bold]the pattern rather than the absolute number of accidents. National figures (Department of
[normal] [bold]Transport, 1992) also suggest that at least two-thirds of cycle accidents occur at junctions.
[normal]  [bold]We suggest that these official figures almo
[normal]st certainly relate more to the classification of
[normal] [bold]accidents than to the nature of what is happening on the road. The police STATS 19 records
[normal] [bold]classify an accident as occurring at a junction irrespective of whether the manoeuvre of either
[normal] 
[normal]vehicle concerned i
[normal]nvolved the junction or merely happened in the vicinity of a junction.
[normal]  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]With this query in mind, we asked the Department of Transport’s Directorate of Statistics to[bold] [bold]analyse national pedal cycle casualty figures by cross-tabulating cyclists’ actions with [bold]the[bold] [bold]actions of those involved in accidents with them. Of the 25,421 cycle accidents in 1991,[bold] [bold]13.8% involved cyclists turning right or left and a further 28.9% involved other vehicles[bold] [bold]turning right or left. This suggests that only 42.7% of cycle accidents i[bold]nvolve turns at[bold] [bold]junctions, which is considerably closer to estimates in the diary data than the usual two-thirds[bold] [bold]figure quoted[bold].
[normal] [bold]The major manoeuvre of other vehicles which cyclists reported in the current study was[bold] [bold]being overtaken too closely in a straight[bold]-ahead situation[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is notable that an Australian
[normal] [bold]study, examining the characteristics of fatal as compared to total cycle accidents, finds that
[normal] [bold]fatal accidents are less likely to be at intersections than are non-fatal accidents (Hoque,
[normal] [bold]1990). 
[normal] 
[normal]Our data
[normal] also accord with the British Medical Association’s (1992) review, which
[normal] [bold]comments that most adult cyclist fatalities are caused by a vehicle approaching from
[normal] [bold]behind 
[normal]—which presumably includes errors in overtaking. The Highway Code (Department of
[normal] [bold]Environmen
[normal]t, Transport and the Regions, 1999b) inf
[normal]orms motorists that they should 
[normal]‘give
[normal] [bold][cyclists] at least as much room as you would give a car’ (p. 18), although the accompanying
[normal] [bold]illustration suggests a less generous margin of overtaking than did the illustration 
[normal]in the 1993
[normal] [bold]edition (Department 
[normal]of Transport, 1993). The cyclists in our study clearly felt that they were
[normal] [bold]not given the margin they required by passing motor vehicles, particularly buses. It is possible
[normal] [bold]that buses overtake cycles with no narrower a margin
[normal] than cars do, but threaten cyclists more
[normal] [bold]on account of their greater size. A film record would be needed to establish whether cyclists’
[normal] [bold]perceptions of risk relate more to the size, speed or position of the passing vehicle.

[normal]([bold]from
[normal] Conclusions [bold]Page 277)
[normal]…
[normal]  
[normal]However, while the successful shared use of public space will depend partly on road users’
[normal] 
[normal]attitudes and behaviour, 
[normal]it will also depend on the imaginative implementation of road design[bold] [bold]that can protect the vulnerable from the manoeuvres and speed of the le[bold]ss vulnerable. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Indeed,
[normal] 
[normal]in his analysis of accident causation, 
[normal]Wagenaar (1992) points out that risk-taking behaviour[bold] 
[normal]can be located predominantly at the strategic end of the system—that is, amongst the[bold] 
[normal]decision makers who structure the system. This [bold]implies that the nature of the risk environment[bold] 
[normal]lies in the hands of those who plan our roads rather than those who use them.[bold] 
[normal]Experience in the Netherlands reveals the extent to which engineering solutions can provide
[normal] 
[normal]a safer space for cyclists and walker
[normal]s
[normal] (Preston, 1990; Tolley, 1990).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The likelihood of risk on the highway being 
[normal]located
[normal],
[normal] significantly
[normal],
[normal] as 
[normal]the outcome of planning the road, and/or the degree to which politicians 
[normal]understand, 
[normal]demand or manage the engineering outcomes is a stark conclusion 
[normal]regarding
[normal] the risks perceived, and imposed on vulnerable road users.  
[normal]3.5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]But also hopeful because the production of these outcomes could be changed with rapidity.  As has been the case in Germany, the Netherlands etc.
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The predominant response in our British 
[normal]experience is twofold,
[normal]3.6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The pitifully small modal share taken by 
[normal]cycling
[normal]3.6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The belief among many people cycling that ‘defensive’ cycling has to be learnt, to cope with conditions on the road.
[normal]3.6.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This then has the added problem that 
[normal]these ‘coping’ cyclists in som
[normal]e way define how cycling should be done.  
[normal]This
[normal] presents a b
[normal]arrier to using a bike for many;
[normal] for the overwhelming majority reported in the ESPRC - UW&amp;C research, who do not expect to
[normal],
[normal] and who will not
[normal],
[normal] ‘battle’ with motorised traffic.
[normal]3.6.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For many years divisio
[normal]n
[normal]s
[normal] within cycling advocacy between vehicular cyclists and those who favour better infrastructure 
[normal]are
[normal] deeply unhelpful. Advocating for the wishes of existing cyclists, a minority outlier population, is not the way to make cycling appeal to wider swathes of 
[normal]the population. This does of course result in a tension, as it is not unreasonable for cycling advocacy groups to represent their members, but it is a tension that can I think be fairly easily resolved. There is no need for a dichotomous approach, and it i
[normal]s perfectly feasible to support the needs of existing cyclists while also pushing for decent infrastructure, as well as wider factors that support less confident cyclists.
[normal]3.6.2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In practice and even with years 
[normal]of 
[normal]experience it feels simply impossible to 
[normal]con
[normal]sistent
[normal]ly
[normal] take a ‘vehicular cyclist’ approach.  I base this comment on personal experience and observation of others.  
[normal]E.G. travelling from Paddington Station to Smithfield, and return, t
[normal]here are many situations where the ambiguity of the road makes it dif
[normal]ficult to avoid being in a narrow space alongside
[normal]/between
[normal] moving vehicles.
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What is illustrated by this section is the gulf between highways practice and a highways 
[normal]environment where cycling is enabled by the physical environment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The thinking and presumption/expectations of much of the 
[normal]Britain 
[normal]has been deeply 
[normal]influenced
[normal] by 
[normal]thinking
[normal] about the road environment 
[normal]dating 
[normal]from WW11
[normal], then
[normal] the influential
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]Traffic in Towns
[normal]’
[normal] report of 
[normal]‘
[normal]63, which effectively promoted car use at the 
[normal]expense of urban demolition, segregating motorised movement from the life of the urban area.  Residential Road Layout Guidance
[normal] followed, ‘DB32’ of 1977 
[normal]-
[normal] 2007, cementing
[normal] the idea that residential areas should be quiet and free from extraneous traffic
[normal] using
[normal] culs-de-sac
[normal].  A comforting concept but one which was both a travesty of the original Radburn, NJ, where the density is around 4 Dw
[normal]ellings
[normal]/
[normal]A
[normal]cre, as well as a de-facto 
[normal]effect of
[normal] 
[normal]limiting
[normal] walking 
[normal]- 
[normal]by distancing retail 
[normal]and other destinations in
[normal]to separate ag
[normal]glomerations;
[normal] ma
[normal]king
[normal] 
[normal]bus travel difficult to support;
[normal] and result
[normal]ing in a bleak, high-
[normal]speed environmen
[normal]t in which to cycle.  The model
[normal] presented by Stevenage and Milton Keynes 
[normal]has
[normal] been found not 
[normal]to 
[normal]support cycling because the provision is 
[normal]added
[normal] after
[normal] 
[normal]layout
[normal] 
[normal]concept 
[normal]design
[normal] rather than 
[normal]part of
[normal] it
[normal].  
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A layout 
[normal]conceived 
[normal]for 
[normal]the 
[normal]car
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]convenience whilst moving 
[normal]is most unlikely ever to be convenient or desirable for cycling whereas the ‘traditional city’ London in large part for instance, is connected and with a ch
[normal]oice of destination on offer and where the bike is frequently the most convenient and quickest travel mode
[normal].  The withdrawal of DB32 and 
[normal]replacement
[normal] by 
[normal]‘
[normal]Manual for Streets
[normal]’ in 2007
[normal] is an important milepost in urban design.  A connected system
[normal],
[normal] where most roads will inevitably be ‘quiet’, where connectivity can reduce the need to use a car, and where the bike performs competitively in convenience and quickness, is posited in the current guidance.  But at the point of publication tw
[normal]o unfortunate 
[normal]problems appeared:
[normal] 
[normal]4.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] Banking crisis led to house-building collapsing and thus practice and debate using the new guidance has faltered
[normal], and
[normal] in addition 
[normal]4.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] guidance ‘left open a door’, to the 
[normal]continued, 
[normal]inappropriate 
[normal]reference to
[normal] DMRB, 
[normal]‘
[normal]Design Manual fo
[normal]r Roads and Bridges
[normal]’ 
[normal]the Highways Agency’s 
[normal]design guide
[normal].
[normal]  It was not until the publication of 
[normal]‘
[normal]Manual for Streets 2, wider application of the principles’ 
[normal](
[normal]2010
[normal])
[normal], that DMRB’s inappropriateness is substituted. 
[normal]4.2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I fear that the freely available MfS has a wide
[normal]r distribution than the expensive MfS2.  
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The consequence of the ubiquity of DMRB in practice is that thinking about users and facilities is ‘controlled’, to some significant extent, by concern over vehicular speed, volume and avoiding congestion of motor 
[normal]traffic.  In comparison the German Roads Guidance, RASt06 (which I translated into English
[normal] for the publisher
[normal]) has
[normal],
[normal] since the early 1980s
[normal],
[normal] taken the ‘revolutionary’ view that 
[normal]‘
[normal]the place’ and the activities taking place alongside any road 
[normal]are
[normal] primary conside
[normal]ration
[normal]s
[normal] in the road design process.  The German approach was itself heavily influenced by Dutch thinking and practice 
[normal]during
[normal] the 70s and in 1981 West
[normal] 
[normal]Ger
[normal]many 
[normal]‘adopted’ Dutch 
[normal]guidance
[normal] as they rewrote their own 
[normal]manual.
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following the Times newspaper campaign 
[normal]and the existing interest of the current Government
[normal],
[normal] a range of
[normal] new
[normal] funding 
[normal]resources
[normal] have been provided.  In the case of the Cycle Safety Fund I wish to adumbrate a case in Oxfordshire of quite atrocious inability to design a fitting response and worse still, being able to comprehend and react to external criticism.
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Here is the body of a 
[normal]recently published letter
[normal] of a group of local experts: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We learn from Oxford Times Letters (2/01/14) that the County is pressing on with its unbelievable design for the Wootton Road roundabout, Abingdon:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/opinion/letters/10902309.New_cycle_route_is_both_risky_and_ill_conceived/
[normal] This
[normal] follows my objection 17/10/13 that the design, using special ‘Cycle Sa
[normal]fety Fund’ grant, was without merit:
[normal] 
[normal]http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/abingdon/10734790.Fresh_look_at___300k_cycle_safety_project/
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since then we’ve met officers on site, submitted a comprehensive report and further criticised a slightly modified scheme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yet 
[normal]"The cabinet member… informed the meeting that the only place in Oxfordshire the council could identify as qualifying for a 
[normal]Government grant was this area on Wootton Road. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Openly admitting that the scheme was flawed he continued, overruling safety concerns in order to spend the money before the April deadline."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When budgets are shrunk and e.g. schools are crying out for zebr
[normal]a crossings for their pupils, this is a debacle. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To willfully misspend £300,000, including misusing c£200,000 of DfT’s Grant in the process, is tantamount to theft. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is it possible that County Transport Planners and Engineers are so diminished by cuts t
[normal]hat there is inadequate management will and design skill? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Little response has followed the consultation.  A ‘Cyclox’ member produced a better scheme, earlier on, only to be ignored. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The design is an incompetent response to a problem, which is real enou
[normal]gh. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A County defence that an expensive and poorly located Toucan crossing ‘has to remain, or DfT would withdraw funding’, is spurious.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is irresponsible to spend money just because its there, it belongs to us all. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Perhaps the money should be given 
[normal]back to DfT/Treasury, or at least leave requested to produce an effective scheme.  In my understanding of the DfT assessor's comments, a rethink was called for anyway.  It is not too late to do something effective; it’s the will that is lacking.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]hilst the
[normal] concern here could be 
[normal]dismissed
[normal] as parochial, the case will be repeated through the hundreds of schemes receiv
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]such 
[normal]funding
[normal], why? :-
[normal]4.5.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An officer is charged with developing a response to an accident problem but perhaps with little expectation of funding
[normal].
[normal]  A
[normal] Government fund appears
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It i
[normal]s grasped even though the design is 
[normal]perhaps simplistic
[normal] if worthy
[normal].  Essentially
[normal],
[normal] rather than 
[normal]moving
[normal] away from 
[normal]the
[normal] ‘DMRB’ style roundabout
[normal] 
[normal]on the periphery of an urban area 
[normal]- 
[normal]with people travelling by 
[normal]bike
[normal] to nursery, school,
[normal] college 
[normal]etc.
[normal], a proposal to partly remove cycl
[normal]ists from the road has ensu
[normal]ed.  
[normal]However
[normal], 
[normal]cost engineering has removed the potential benefits and attractiveness of the 
[normal]design, which
[normal] is now decimated.  An inappropriate single Toucan remains, adding cost and inducing delay.
[normal]  Whilst I am sure th
[normal]is
[normal] problem was, or became 
[normal]recognised
[normal] within the Engineering 
[normal]Dept.
[normal] of Oxfordshire 
[normal]County
[normal] Council, there was no will to 
[normal]jetison
[normal] the design 
[normal]and 
[normal]tim
[normal]e 
[normal]already 
[normal]expended 
[normal]in order
[normal] to reconsider the problem, which 
[normal]remains
[normal] soluble.
[normal]4.5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Even generous central support is 
[normal]squandered
[normal] in this example.  ‘Localism’ has resulted in wastefulness.  
[normal]4.5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What is needed is some kind of ‘Roads Ombudsman’
[normal], to act as a design revi
[normal]ew
[normal]er.  The CABE-
[normal]Design Council system needs
[normal] to 
[normal]be 
[normal]replicated
[normal] for Highways design.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The argument, even fear, expressed by many campaigners that such segregated provision is too difficult, costly or controversial is falsely based.  
[normal]5.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If one takes time to understand the development of facilities to be found in continental countries it can be seen that by adopting the concept of a 
[normal]safe, 
[normal]physically segregated (but on-line) provision
[normal],
[normal] the attainment of the concept may be achieved in a numb
[normal]er of ways, 
[normal]using
[normal] normal processes.  
[normal]Making
[normal] cycling provisions that enable use by anyone is not rocket science.  Any highways engineer could do it
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]as demonstrated in Cologne where 
[normal]the City Engineer told a group I led
[normal]: “the politicians 
[normal]wanted peopl
[normal]e to be able to use a bike, so this is what we have done …”.  
[normal]5.1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Compared with the 
[normal]massive 
[normal]funding used to effectively enthrall the population to the car, costs can be negligible.  
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Essentially 
[normal]one
[normal] start
[normal]s
[normal] with 
[normal]the 
[normal]idea
[normal] of 
[normal]direct, coherent, continuous provision and 
[normal]initially 
[normal]separated by (mandatory) lines, (
[normal]with 
[normal]parking control
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]outside
[normal] of these mandatory lines
[normal]).
[normal]  Physical segregation 
[normal]can then
[normal] follow as road
[normal] 
[normal]renewal
[normal] take
[normal]s
[normal] place.
[normal]  
[normal]5.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The busiest roads are replaced in cities on 
[normal]approximately 10-20 year cycles. 
[normal]W
[normal]ithin a generation or t
[normal]wo, we coul
[normal]d 
[normal]reach
[normal] Denmark's 
[normal]situation now and 
[normal]approach
[normal] the Netherlands' 
[normal]level of provision
[normal].  
[normal]5.2.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]30 year period
[normal] of the now withdrawn 
[normal]‘
[normal]cul-de-sac and dis
[normal]tributor road’ thinking from 1977 
[normal]has been 
[normal]re
[normal]markably effective
[normal] around the country, 
[normal]and thus 
[normal]the country’
[normal]s
[normal] main routes could be transformed 
[normal]in a similar timespan
[normal].  Only thinking is demanded.
[normal]5.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inevitably some special attention will need to applied to major junctions with their tonnes of concrete, but even these need repair, remodeling and rethinking over time.  The period required seems ‘long’ 
[normal]in prospect
[normal], but the renewal process is 
[normal]happening co
[normal]ntinuously,
[normal] 
[normal]within the 
[normal]span
[normal] of a few Parliaments the transformation could be complete.
[normal]5.2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Changing the new towns and 70s-onwards estates and their distributor road
[normal], if desired,
[normal] is a big design task, 
[normal]some regeneration projects
[normal] 
[normal]mostly involving turning houses a
[normal]round
[normal]!
[normal]  But for London and most of 
[normal]Britain
[normal], making cycling possible for all could be achieved for 
[normal]the proverbial 
[normal]peanuts
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]And
[normal] if we started 'now'
[normal],
[normal] with the decision to make cycling prov
[normal]isions that were useable by all it could become a reality in reasonable
[normal] time.
