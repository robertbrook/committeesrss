"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence submitted by Terumo BCT (BTO0015)&#xa0;On behalf of Terumo BCT – \na global leader in blood component and cellular technologies. It is the only company with the unique combination of \napheresis\n collections, manual and automated whole blood processing, and pathogen reduction coupled with leading technologies in therapeutic \napheresis\n and cell processing. \n&#xa0;\nTerumo BCT’s goal is to make even safer, higher-quality transfusions available to more people, unlocking the potential of blood and cell therapies. It also helps to bring even more treatment options to patients through advanced blood therapies and supports researchers in developing cellular therapies that may fundamentally improve health care. \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the opportunity to answer the call to provide written evidence to the UK Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee \ni\nnquiry on Blood, Tissue and Organ screening\n and hope that it will prove useful in the further development of the safety and security of the UK blood supply.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOther threats, such as the risk to the safety and security of the UK blood supply from both known and unknown pathogens, are also important to consider in this Parliamentary discussion. \nThe UK provides a good example of how a government can work with policy makers, stakeholders, business and society in combating safety threats to the national blood supply, including those from emerging pathogens, such as \nWest Nile virus (WNV), Malaria, tick-borne Encephalitis, and Dengue fever. Such cooperation can also help assist with other blood supply issues, such as boosting the \nblood donor base amongst the Black Minority Ethnic (BME) community. \n&#xa0;\nSummary of Terumo BCT’s written evidence\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Are UK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs sufficiently evidence-based? Is NHS Blood and Transplant overly restrictive about who can donate, or should greater precautions be taken to further reduce risk?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs the Government and its scientific advisory structure sufficiently responsive to the threat posed by emerging diseases being transmitted through blood and blood products, tissues and organs?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nSerious Hazards of Transfusion Report and Summary, website address:    \nhttp://www.shotuk.org/shot-reports/report-and-summary-2010-2/\n.\n \nMore information on the Standing Advisory Committee on Transfusion Transmitted Infection (SACTTI), go to the NHS Blood and Transplant website: \nhttp://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/index.asp\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) Work Plan for 2012-13 can be found here: \nhttps://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/transparency/files/2012/04/SaBTO%E2%80%99s-Work-programme-PDF23K.pdf\n.\n The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 provides a similar framework in Scotland.  \n"
