"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Merseyside Cycling Campaign and Wirral Pedestrians' Association (CYS0017)&#xa0;Proposals to eradicate fatal and serious injuries to Merseyside pedestrians and cyclists&#xa0;\nMerseyside is not a safe place for children or adults to walk or cycle \n&#xa0;\nThe reason is the danger to children and adults from motor vehicles, which is particularly bad in Merseyside. \n&#xa0;\nAre serious injuries to pedestrians and cyclist acceptable?Around 300 Merseyside children are injured by motor vehicles each year, as pedestria\nns or cyclists.  That is nearly one each day.  Some 60 of these injuries to children are classed as serious - more than one each week.  In addition, 800 adult pedestrians or cyclists are injured every year.  \n&#xa0;\nFor children injured by dangerous dogs, gang v\niolence, parental abuse or sexual abuse, society does not regard any number other than zero as acceptable - and yet 300 children injured by motor vehicles \nattracts\n little attention.  \n&#xa0;\nMany road safety professionals now argue for a Vision Zero approach - w\nhere the only acceptable number of fatalities or serious injuries is zero.  This has driven the Swedish road safety programme for some time [1], is supported by the OECD [2], and is the basis of London's 2013 \nSafe Streets\n plan [3].  \n&#xa0;\nA key part of Vision \nZero is a Safe System approach where it is recognised that all road users - pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicle drivers - will make mistakes from time to time, and provision is made to minimise the consequences of these mistakes. \n&#xa0;\nWhat are the health impacts of unconstrained road dangers in Merseyside? \n\n \nthe\n 2012 pedestrian casualty rate (deaths or serious injuries) was the worst in Great Britain [note 4]\n \n\n \nthe\n 2012 cyclist total of deaths or serious injuries was at a 16-year high [note 5]\n \n\n 52% of \ndeaths or serious road injuries in Merseyside occur in pedestrians or cyclists [note 6]\n \n\n \nindependent\n mobility for those without a car is compromised\n \n\n \nthe\n fear of vehicles deters many adults from cycling\n \n\n \nparents\n prohibit primary school children from \nwalking or cycling independently\n \n\n \nchildren\n and adults take limited exercise, increasing diabetes, adult heart disease, and cancer\n \n\n Liverpool and Birkenhead fail to meet EU legal air quality standards.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the economic effects? \n\n \nan\n unhealthy wor\nkforce, from lack of exercise, which increases sickness absence\n \n\n \npoor\n workforce mobility since most job-seekers do not own a car, and road conditions limit access to the cheapest (i.e. active) travel modes\n \n\n \nadded\n costs to health and social services of injury, chronic ill-health and disability.\n&#xa0;\nAction neededEvery day, as pedestrians and cyclists, we see dangers to vulnerable road users that are not being addressed.  When these dangers have been reported to \nthose in authority, responses have too often shown indifference, prevarication and inaction.  Yet simple solutions exist that are far more straightforward than providing 24-hour care to just one of the pedestrians or cyclists rendered brain-damaged or para\nplegic by motor vehicles.  \n&#xa0;\nWe therefore present a range of measures that, had they been already implemented, would have avoided many deaths and much ill health.  Continued inaction in the face of this epidemic on our roads can only result in further avoi\ndable deaths and disability.  We do not think that this is acceptable. \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome \n\n \ncomments\n on how this vision can be improved\n \n\n \nexpressions\n of support or of a willingness to work in partnership\n \n\n \ncommitments\n to take action.  \n&#xa0;\nOutline proposals to eradicate fatal and serious injuries to Merseyside pedestrians and cyclists&#xa0;\nMPs and Ministers should \n\n \nallocate\n spending of £10 per person per year on each of walking and cycling immediately, increasing to £20 per person per year.  Funding could be dive\nrted from or shared with other transport funding, by reappraising current priorities\n \n\n \nintroduce\n presumed liability (increased legal protection for pedestrians and cyclists) [7]\n \n\n \nfacilitate\n enforcement of road safety laws by returning fines to the enfor\ncement agencies\n \n\n \noutlaw\n \nsatnav\n speed camera location warnings which undermine compliance with the law\n&#xa0;\nThe Department for Transport should \n\n \nbase\n policies and strategies on evidence\n \n\n \ncommission\n research to define and improve best practice, with emphas\nis on known risks such as lack of compliance with speed limits and use of phones\n&#xa0;\nThe Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner should \n\n \nacknowledge\n in the Merseyside Police and Crime Plan that Merseyside is not a safe and secure environment for children o\nr adults to walk or cycle and include appropriate measures\n&#xa0;\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers should \n\n \nplace\n the highest priority on a commitment to reducing dangers to pedestrians and cyclists\n&#xa0;\nMerseyside Police should \n\n \nobey\n speed limits and other road safety laws, except in emergencies\n \n\n \nproperly\n enforce speed limits and other road safety laws, including parking prohibitions [note 8]\n&#xa0;\nPolice collision investigators and the Merseyside Crown Prosecution Service should \n\n \nreconsider\n the standards of behaviour that are expected from drivers \n \n\n \napply\n appropriate penalties to address and deter dangerous driving\n&#xa0;\nMerseyside councillors and council officers should \n\n \nprioritise\n safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists since these are the most vulnerable road users\n \n\n \nadopt\n a Safe System approach in road design that accepts that road users will make mistakes\n \n\n \ncollaborate\n with related organisations, including the \nachievement of Public Health targets through improving transport infrastructure\n&#xa0;\nAll decision-makers should \n\n \nview\n the dangers to pedestrians and cyclists at first hand by personally walking and/or cycling through high risk road infrastructure\n&#xa0;\nMedia and motoring organisations should \n\n \nprovide\n robust and accurate information that avoids sensationalism and bias \n \n\n \nacknowledge\n the equality of pedestrians’, cyclists’, and car users’ rights to road safety\n&#xa0;\nCompanies (including bus and taxi operators and parcel delivery services) should \n\n \ncommit\n to employees obeying speed limits and other road safety laws\n \n\n \nsign\n up to a Legal Driving code of conduct\n \n\n \naddress\n the added risk of HGVs by implementing educational, technical and strategic measures\n&#xa0;\nIndividuals should \n\n \ncommit\n to obeying speed limits and other road safety laws\n \n\n \nview\n car crime (‘routine’ speeding, close passing of cyclists, red-light running, phone use, etc) as a risk to pedestrians and cyclists with the same gravity as they view shoplifting or assault\n&#xa0;\nWirral Pedestrians Association and Merseyside Cycle Campaign\n are very willing to assist with these measures.\n&#xa0;\nReferences and notes&#xa0;\n[1] \nVision Zero: Adopting a Target of Zero for Road Traffic Fatalities and Serious
