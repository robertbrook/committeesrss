[normal]I am pleased to respond on behalf of the Royal Society to the Committee’s inquiry on Horizon Scanning in Government Departments. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Horizon scanning is an important strategic tool for government decision making. 
[normal] 
[normal]The importance and value of independent exp
[normal]ert advice and objective evidence-based assessment was demonstrated at the meeting of G8 science ministers and presidents of national academies in June 2013 (which was jointly hosted by the 
[normal]Royal Society) where the issues of horizon scanning and global ch
[normal]allenges were discussed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome government’s increasing interest in horizon scanning and the recent cross-cutting government review of this area. In considering the role and practice of horizon scanning, we encourage government to continue to addres
[normal]s the following challenges:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Often horizon scanning considers difficult but important problems such as climate change or energy security that cross departments, cross disciplines, have timescales longer than the l
[normal]ifetimes of governments, do not present a single decision moment and where it is less obvious that science can help. 
[normal] 
[normal]These sorts of problems were recently identified as particularly challenging for policymakers and scientific advisors by the former Govern
[normal]ment Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Sir John Beddington FRS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]National academies play an important role in assisting the horizon scanning efforts of government as part of a network of partners including academia, industry and charities. We bring a 
[normal]combination of strengths, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An important role of a national science academy is to bring emerging knowledge that has major potential public and national implications to the attention of government.
[normal] 
[normal] Its capacity to do so stems from the much gre
[normal]ater breadth and depth of knowledge represented by its fellowship than is directly available to government through its civil service. 
[normal] 
[normal]Recent examples include our recent publications on “Shale Gas Extraction” (with the 
[normal]Royal Academy of Engineering), “Scie
[normal]nce as an Open Enterprise” and the “Ownership and Governance of NERC Centres”. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Royal Society, along with its sister national academies, is well placed and willing to play this role.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Royal Society has made significant contributions to debates arou
[normal]nd issues that are the target of horizon scanning such as geoengineering, shale gas and nanotechnology. 
[normal] 
[normal]Our 2012-2017 strategic plan identified providing scientific advice for policy as one of our priorities. Horizon scanning forms an important component 
[normal]of this activity and in the future we will be seeking a greater role in responding to rapidly evolving, high public interest, policy issues.
