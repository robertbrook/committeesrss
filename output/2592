[normal]Written evidence submitted by Carers UK[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK is deeply concerned about the impact 
[normal]on carers 
[normal]of 
[normal]changes to housing costs as a result of the Welfare Reform Act
[normal]. 
[normal]We have 
[normal]growing evidence that these measures are pushing carers and disabled people into financial crisis
[normal] and putting them at risk o
[normal]f eviction and 
[normal]long-term poverty
[normal] and debt
[normal]. 
[normal]We fear the situation of carers and dis
[normal]abled people is likely to further worsen
[normal] as other changes
[normal],
[normal] including reductions in spending on disability benefits
[normal],
[normal] are overlaid onto the current changes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our evidence also
[normal] shows that the localised and discretionary mitigation measures that the Government argues should protect carers and disabled people who need support are failing 
[normal]due to
[normal] 
[normal]insufficient guidance and f
[normal]unding from central Government
[normal]. We believe that the 
[normal]Government 
[normal]should, across a number of the changes, exempt carers and disabled people, rather than relying on local discretion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK 
[normal]has been highly critical of
[normal] the Government’s
[normal] failure to adequate
[normal]ly
[normal] assess 
[normal]in advance the impact of these policies, in
[normal]dividually or cumulatively, on carers and disabled people
[normal], 
[normal]or to respond to emerging evidence from Carers UK and other stakeholders with urgent additional mitigation measures. Families cannot wait for the results of the Government’s medium 
[normal]term evaluation
[normal] 
[normal]of these policies, and Carers UK urges the Government to immediately begin a review of the impact of changes to support with housing costs 
[normal]on families as part of a cumulative impact assessment of the impact of the Welfare Reform Act. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK welcomed
[normal] the early, if
[normal] very
[normal] limited
[normal],
[normal] exemptions for tenants or tenants’ partners who needed overnight care provided by a non-resident (for example a care worker), and 
[normal]the Government’s later concession on rooms 
[normal]for
[normal] disabled children 
[normal]unable to share with siblings. However we identified a number of groups of disab
[normal]led people and carers who 
[normal]would be considered to have ‘spare’ accommodation and would face a shortfall in their rent, despite having a clear need for that
[normal] accommodation. 
[normal]For these families, the additional accommodation is essential, not spare – 
[normal]yet
[normal] they are still affected by the policy.
[normal] These include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Because of their need for the additional space, the set of options 
[normal]suggested by the Government
[normal] to families affected are not appropriate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the fact that t
[normal]hese options are highly inappropriate for many carers and disabled people, they continue to be suggested 
[normal]as options to
[normal] these families – this contributes to feeling that both the Government and local councils 
[normal]have little understanding of 
[normal]their needs and cir
[normal]cumstances. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, the policy fails to take regard 
[normal]of the 
[normal]implications 
[normal]of 
[normal]moving disabled people or carers, 
[normal]who 
[normal]may have infrequently used
[normal] ‘spare’
[normal] bedrooms
[normal],
[normal] but where 
[normal]a move away from local support networks could bring considerable
[normal] social
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]public spending
[normal] costs
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]If disabled people and carers r
[normal]ely on local friends, relatives
[normal], community and voluntary support to 
[normal]meet or support
[normal] care needs, then their ability to live independently or continu
[normal]e to care could be significantly 
[normal]affected if they move
[normal] away from thes
[normal]e support networks.
[normal] The loss of support and independence may result in considerable knock-on costs to 
[normal]health and social care services and undermines
[normal] the community ‘asset-based approach’ which the Government is building into the Care Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK was
[normal] deeply disappointed that Government did not implement exemptions for 
[normal]the circumstances outlined above and we do not accept 
[normal]that discretionary housing payments (DHPs)
[normal] 
[normal]are an appropriate 
[normal]mechanism to protect
[normal] families in these circumstances. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DHPs 
[normal]are designed to 
[normal]provide
[normal] temporary support for transition or crisis periods. 
[normal]Whilst Government has suggested that 
[normal]councils
[normal] are able to make indefinite awards
[normal],
[normal] our evidence indicates that 
[normal]uncertainty about the stability of DHP funding from central government means that 
[normal]councils
[normal] are 
[normal]making maximum awards of one year
[normal] and
[normal] often for much shorter periods. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If families have a clear
[normal] need for the additional accommodation they will still go through the process of that accommodation being classed as ‘spare’, seein
[normal]g their Housing Benefit reduced
[normal] and having to apply every year (if not more frequently) for discretionary payments to cover t
[normal]he shortfall. 
[normal]Not only is this illogical
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]bureaucratically wasteful, but it is causing 
[normal]huge distress amongst 
[normal]families 
[normal]who are often already struggling with the mental and physical pressures of caring, ill-health and disability. 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment
[normal] has
[normal] shown little recognition of the impact this process would have even on families who are successfully awarded 
[normal]DHPs
[normal]. 
[normal]The f
[normal]amilies affected fear the loss of their homes, have to complete lengthy and detailed application forms for discretionary payments and o
[normal]ften wait for months for a decision which may only gi
[normal]ve them temporary security. The pressure this is putting on families affected is
[normal] huge
[normal], particularly 
[normal]for those who will need the additional space long-term, or indee
[normal]d for the rest of their lives. T
[normal]he know
[normal]ledge that 
[normal]they will have to conduct this process over and over again simply to remain in their homes is debilitating
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For example, a
[normal] carer, who cares full-time
[normal] for
[normal] his wife who has a mental health condition
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and who had been waiting three months for a 
[normal]D
[normal]HPs
[normal] decision
[normal],
[normal] said:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“She can’t 
[normal]leave the house normally
[normal], 
[normal]and now she
[normal] 
[normal]doesn’t even
[normal] feel safe 
[normal]there
[normal]. 
[normal]Since this happened she has gone
[normal] completely
[normal] 
[normal]downhill. 
[normal]She is 
[normal]panics 
[normal]every time
[normal] she thinks about it
[normal],
[normal] which is every day. I can’t ever show it to her, but 
[normal]I’
[normal]m struggling to hold it together 
[normal]mysel
[normal]f with this weighing down on us. We cannot cope with this 
[normal]pressure for
[normal] the rest of our lives.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government has suggested 
[normal]on different occasions 
[normal]that the DHPs also enable councils to make an effective assessment of need
[normal] on a case-by-case basis.
[normal] 
[normal]In a letter responding to 
[normal]a Carers UK
[normal] submission 
[normal]to
[normal] Downing Street
[normal] on this policy
[normal], the Government states tha
[normal]t discretionary payments afford
[normal] local authorities 
[normal]‘
[normal]the discretion to support those most in need’ and that blanket exemptio
[normal]ns would not have delivered ‘the range of flexibilities needed to cover every individual circumstance’
[normal]. 
[normal]However Carers UK’s evidence indic
[normal]a
[normal]tes that many DHP claims are being assessed in financial terms ra
[normal]ther than on an 
[normal]assessment of need related to disability. We have heard from families where the council 
[normal]recognised their 
[normal]care and support needs through the allocation of properties with additional rooms
[normal], but turned the same families down for DHPs to pay for those rooms on
[normal] financial 
[normal]ground. Examples included 
[normal]being turned down 
[normal]because their spending on food exceed
[normal]ed
[normal] £3.50 per person per day, or
[normal] because
[normal] other items of household expenditure 
[normal]were
[normal] considered non-essential. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is also
[normal] increasing evidence that the discretionary funds available are insufficient to 
[normal]meet
[normal] disabled people
[normal]’s
[normal] an
[normal]d carers’
[normal] needs. 
[normal]Since
[normal] April 2013
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]£25 million in funding
[normal] has been made available to local authorities to mitigate the imp
[normal]act of the change to size criteria on disabled people.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]DHPs
[normal] Guidance Manual states that ‘
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]extra funding is intended to provide additional help to disabled claimants living in properties where significant adaptations have been made
[normal]’ and that ‘the 
[normal]allocation of the additional funding for disabled people broadly reflects the impact of this measure and the additional funding needed to support this group’
[normal].
[normal] Carers UK has not been able to determine the basis on which the Department for Work and Pensions
[normal] calculated the size of this fund or the rationale behind 
[normal]using
[normal] ‘
[normal]significant adaptations’
[normal] as a proxy for need related to poor health or disability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe this fails to recognise the reality of many health conditions, disabilities and caring scenario
[normal]s. There
[normal] are a wide variety of circumstances where an additional room is needed, unrelated to adaptations. 
[normal]For example,
[normal] 
[normal]carers of 
[normal]partners with early-onset dementia or post-traumatic stress disorder who wake up not recognising thei
[normal]r partners and who can la
[normal]sh out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he DHP
[normal] Guide does state 
[normal]DHPs should be considered where
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] long term medical condition 
[normal]‘
[normal]creates dif
[normal]ficulties in sharing a bedroom’. 
[normal]However 
[normal]it is clear from examining
[normal] a selection of local authority procedures
[normal] and from carers’ experiences that a number 
[normal]of councils
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]using the guidance to specifically link
[normal] eligibility for discretionary payments
[normal] to adaptations
[normal]. 
[normal]In addition, if the value of the DHP funding has been calculated in relation to the number of people 
[normal]with adaptations
[normal],
[normal] then extension of the payments to individuals with different needs 
[normal]will result in a shortfall.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he Government’s impact assessment
[normal]s
[normal] indicat
[normal]ed
[normal] that 420,000 disabled people would be affected
[normal] by the change in size criteria. However, on the b
[normal]asis of an average shortfall of £14 a week, this 
[normal]fund would support fewer than 40,000 disabled people to stay in their homes 
[normal]for a year (the duration of the £25 million fund)
[normal]. T
[normal]his represents
[normal] fewer than 1 in 10 of 
[normal]the disabled people
[normal] affected. 
[normal]Estimates fr
[normal]om the National Housing Federation showed that approximately 100,000 disabled people affected 
[normal]have home adaptations
[normal], so the discretionary pot would not cover even this smaller group.
[normal]4.5

[normal]T
[normal]o examine carers’ experiences of accessing DHPs, in 
[normal]July 2013
[normal] Carers UK interviewed 
[normal]a 
[normal]sample
[normal] 
[normal]of carers affected
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of the 
[normal]101 
[normal]car
[normal]ers interviewed, 
[normal]8% were
[normal] exempt 
[normal]as a result of overnight care and disabled children’s exemptions
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]56% had applied for discretionary payments from their local council to cover the shortf
[normal]all.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK has been heavily promoting advice and information encouraging carers to apply for discretionary payments if they 
[normal]were
[normal] affected. 
[normal]However, only
[normal] just over half of 
[normal]those interviewed 
[normal]had
[normal] applied for 
[normal]DHPs
[normal]. Many were aware of DHPs but had not applied for a variety of reasons – some had been informally told by 
[normal]council
[normal] officers ‘not to bother
[normal]’
[normal] applying because insufficient funds meant they were v
[normal]ery unlikely to get any support;
[normal] others 
[normal]had been told support wa
[normal]s only temporary so
[normal] had decided against
[normal] completing
[normal] application forms 
[normal]for just a few weeks or months of support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]O
[normal]nly 23% of those interviewed had received a discretionary payment – of those, 
[normal]just under half
[normal] were rec
[normal]eiving support for a full year
[normal], and 
[normal]just
[normal] over half
[normal] had received temporary support for between 3-8 months
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For those who had either not applied for DHPs, whose applications had been turned down
[normal] or whose DHPs had expired,
[normal] the impact of paying the shortfall in rent was extremely serious
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]75% were
[normal] cutting back on essential spending like food and heating.
[normal] 
[normal]For example:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Zara cares full time for her husband who has Huntington’s Disease
[normal] and has herself herself suffered two strokes.
[normal] Her husband’s illness means his
[normal] sleep is constantly disturbed and they 
[normal]were allocated a home with a 
[normal]second bedroom 
[normal]to allow
[normal] Zara the spac
[normal]e to get the respite she needs. It is now
[normal] considered ‘spare’ 
[normal]and they face
[normal] £15 a week shortfall in their rent on top of £2 a week 
[normal]from the
[normal] replacement of 
[normal]Council Tax benefit – 
[normal]in total
[normal] £884 
[normal]more a year. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The couple applied for 
[normal]DHPs
[normal], and were initially declined because
[normal] 
[normal]their local authority stated expenditure on items like postage stamps, spectacles and savings to buy a vacuum cleaner
[normal] were non-essential
[normal]. Following an appeal
[normal],
[normal] they were awarded 12 weeks of DHPs which has now run out. They have made a second application (unable to apply unti
[normal]l
[normal] the previous DHPs expired) and 
[normal]await
[normal] a decision. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They cannot now afford their bills. 
[normal]Zara 
[normal]is restricting herself to one meal a day and 
[normal]cannot reduce the bills by cutting down on food for her ill husband – his condition means he loses weight rapidly and to maintain his health he must have a high calorie diet.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of 
[normal]carers paying the shortfall
[normal],
[normal] 1
[normal]7% 
[normal]were 
[normal]in arrears and 8% were p
[normal]aying by getting into debt
[normal]. These
[normal] include 
[normal]a couple caring for a disabled daughter who use their box room so that one of them can get a full night’s sleep whilst the other can get up when needed to provide night
[normal]-t
[normal]ime care. They cannot afford to pay the shor
[normal]tfall in their rent created by this room being considered spare and have been in arrears since April as a result. They 
[normal]are at risk of eviction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These [bold]examples[bold] illustrate that the Government’s mitigation measures are woefully inadequate and that carers and[bold] their families are facing devastating consequences. The failure of the Government to respond to warnings [bold]in advance of this policy o[bold]r [bold]to mounting evidence [bold]which has borne[bold] out these warnings is reprehensible – it is exposing vulnerable people to[bold] financial crisis and[bold] [bold]long-term [bold]poverty[bold]. Even those who qualify for discretionary support face insecurity and the risk of losing their homes for the duration of their disability or caring responsibilities – often for life. Carers UK continues to call for t[bold]he Government to [bold]urgent[bold]ly[bold] [bold]exempt carers and disabled people from the size criteria changes. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK believes that the exclusion of carers from the protected groups within Council Tax 
[normal]locali
[normal]s
[normal]a
[normal]tion
[normal] and inclusion
[normal] of
[normal] carers within the household benefit cap are inconsistent with the rationale for both policies. The Government has 
[normal]stated that both changes are designed to apply to ‘workless households’, improve work incentives, promote behaviour chan
[normal]ge and discourage long-term benefit claims
[normal]. None of these aims should apply to carer households, 
[normal]and the fact that they do contradicts the Government’s assertion that
[normal] ‘the 
[normal]one thing 
[normal][they]
[normal] are not looking to encourage is a change in the carer's behaviour so that they stop caring
[normal]’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Localisation of Council Tax support:[bold] 
[normal]Carers UK argued that carers should be a protected group alongside pensioners
[normal],
[normal] as Council Tax Benefit was replaced by loca
[normal]l reductions schemes
[normal]. 
[normal]However
[normal] Government did not accept this recommendation and
[normal],
[normal] furthermore, the guidance issued to local authorities made no mention of caring responsibilities in relation to vulnerable groups who should be prioritized for support through
[normal] local 
[normal]schemes.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his omission is a further example of a failure to 
[normal]recognize 
[normal]the pressures and limitations that caring places on families’ ability to work, and continues the insulting and misguided suggestion that carers are ‘workless’. It exposes carers t
[normal]o considerable extra costs when they have limited or no capacity to increase their incomes through work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carers UK has not yet completed detailed analysis of the impact of localizing Council Tax support on carers, which will form part of our Caring &amp;
[normal] Family Finances Inquiry, to be published in December. 
[normal]However we are concerned by growing evidence from research and our Adviceline that many 
[normal]councils
[normal] 
[normal]are not protecting carers.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a snapshot example,
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]Hertfordshire
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]of the
[normal] 10 district councils in the
[normal] county
[normal], s
[normal]ome are protecting disabled people, some are protecting those on benefits with children under 5 and some are protecting several vulnerable groups.  However currently only one district council in the county is proposing to protect carers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our e
[normal]vi
[normal]dence gathered in relation to the changes to the social sector size criteria highlights not only that the localisation of council support is resulting in carers losing support and having to pay more, but that different cuts to financial support are combini
[normal]ng to put even greater pressure on carers and their families. Of the carers affected by the changes to the size criteria who we interviewed, 
[normal]29% were also facing additional Council Tax payments as a result of the abolition of Council Tax Benefit. 
[normal]Families 
[normal]who 
[normal]face a rent shortfall of as much as £1200 a year
[normal], as a result of the size criteria changes, are also having to pay
[normal] a further £300 
[normal]a year 
[normal]in Council Tax charges. This would be a difficult financial burden for most families to manage, but those already 
[normal]seeing reduced incomes and additional costs as a result of disability and caring
[normal] are less likely to be able to cope.
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Household benefit cap: [bold]During the passage of the Welfare Reform Act Carers UK urged the Government to exempt households including individua
[normal]ls with entitlement to Carer’s Allowance from the household benefit cap. Whilst 
[normal]exemptions were put in place 
[normal]for 
[normal]Disability Living Allowance claimants, war widows, and famil
[normal]ies claiming Working Tax Credit this fails to protect significant groups of carers.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] [bold]As a result of the definition of a ‘household’
[normal], 
[normal]carers caring for 
[normal]disabled children under 18 and disabled partners would be exempt (as the eligibility for disability benefits would
[normal] fall within their benefit unit). H
[normal]owever carers caring for 
[normal]adult disable
[normal]d children or other adult relatives
[normal] would be affected by the cap as, even if the person they cared 
[normal]for lived in the same property, 
[normal]the exemption from the benefit cap would only include the benefit unit of the disabled adult and would not protect other adul
[normal]ts within the household. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This

[normal] and illogical – as a full time carer of a disabled child aged 17 years old would be protected from the cap, but the same carer would be affected as soon as their child turned 18. A full time carer of a disabl

[normal]Carers UK believes [bold]it is deeply unfair for carers to both be subject to the household benefit cap and subject to [bold]new Council Tax charges. D[bold]oing so sends out a very negative message about the value the Government places on caring[bold] and may[bold] lead to family finances collapsing and caring becoming financially untenable.[bold] We continue to call on the Government to exempt Carer’[bold]s Allowance from the cap[bold] and to reconsider adding carers as a protected group within Council Tax reductions schemes. At the least, new guidance should be issued to councils on making carers[bold] a[bold] priority group for support within local reductions schemes.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]30 September  2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
