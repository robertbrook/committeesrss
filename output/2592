defaultCarers UK is deeply concerned about the impact 
defaulton carers 
defaultof 
defaultchanges to housing costs as a result of the Welfare Reform Act
default. 
defaultWe have 
defaultgrowing evidence that these measures are pushing carers and disabled people into financial crisis
default and putting them at risk o
defaultf eviction and 
defaultlong-term poverty
default and debt
default. 
defaultWe fear the situation of carers and dis
defaultabled people is likely to further worsen
default as other changes
default,
default including reductions in spending on disability benefits
default,
default are overlaid onto the current changes. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur evidence also
default shows that the localised and discretionary mitigation measures that the Government argues should protect carers and disabled people who need support are failing 
defaultdue to
default 
defaultinsufficient guidance and f
defaultunding from central Government
default. We believe that the 
defaultGovernment 
defaultshould, across a number of the changes, exempt carers and disabled people, rather than relying on local discretion.

defaultCarers UK 
defaulthas been highly critical of
default the Government’s
default failure to adequate
defaultly
default assess 
defaultin advance the impact of these policies, in
defaultdividually or cumulatively, on carers and disabled people
default, 
defaultor to respond to emerging evidence from Carers UK and other stakeholders with urgent additional mitigation measures. Families cannot wait for the results of the Government’s medium 
defaultterm evaluation
default 
defaultof these policies, and Carers UK urges the Government to immediately begin a review of the impact of changes to support with housing costs 
defaulton families as part of a cumulative impact assessment of the impact of the Welfare Reform Act.

default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCarers UK welcomed
default the early, if
default very
default limited
default,
default exemptions for tenants or tenants’ partners who needed overnight care provided by a non-resident (for example a care worker), and 
defaultthe Government’s later concession on rooms 
defaultfor
default disabled children 
defaultunable to share with siblings. However we identified a number of groups of disab
defaultled people and carers who 
defaultwould be considered to have ‘spare’ accommodation and would face a shortfall in their rent, despite having a clear need for that
default accommodation. 
defaultFor these families, the additional accommodation is essential, not spare – 
defaultyet
default they are still affected by the policy.
default These include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBecause of their need for the additional space, the set of options 
defaultsuggested by the Government
default to families affected are not appropriate. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the fact that t
defaulthese options are highly inappropriate for many carers and disabled people, they continue to be suggested 
defaultas options to
default these families – this contributes to feeling that both the Government and local councils 
defaulthave little understanding of 
defaulttheir needs and cir
defaultcumstances. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, the policy fails to take regard 
defaultof the 
defaultimplications 
defaultof 
defaultmoving disabled people or carers, 
defaultwho 
defaultmay have infrequently used
default ‘spare’
default bedrooms
default,
default but where 
defaulta move away from local support networks could bring considerable
default social
default 
defaultand 
defaultpublic spending
default costs
default. 
default 
defaultIf disabled people and carers r
defaultely on local friends, relatives
default, community and voluntary support to 
defaultmeet or support
default care needs, then their ability to live independently or continu
defaulte to care could be significantly 
defaultaffected if they move
default away from thes
defaulte support networks.
default The loss of support and independence may result in considerable knock-on costs to 
defaulthealth and social care services and undermines
default the community ‘asset-based approach’ which the Government is building into the Care Bill.

default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCarers UK was
default deeply disappointed that Government did not implement exemptions for 
defaultthe circumstances outlined above and we do not accept 
defaultthat discretionary housing payments (DHPs)
default 
defaultare an appropriate 
defaultmechanism to protect
default families in these circumstances. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDHPs 
defaultare designed to 
defaultprovide
default temporary support for transition or crisis periods. 
defaultWhilst Government has suggested that 
defaultcouncils
default are able to make indefinite awards
default,
default our evidence indicates that 
defaultuncertainty about the stability of DHP funding from central government means that 
defaultcouncils
default are 
defaultmaking maximum awards of one year
default and
default often for much shorter periods. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf families have a clear
default need for the additional accommodation they will still go through the process of that accommodation being classed as ‘spare’, seein
defaultg their Housing Benefit reduced
default and having to apply every year (if not more frequently) for discretionary payments to cover t
defaulthe shortfall. 
defaultNot only is this illogical
default and
default 
defaultbureaucratically wasteful, but it is causing 
defaulthuge distress amongst 
defaultfamilies 
defaultwho are often already struggling with the mental and physical pressures of caring, ill-health and disability. 
defaultG
defaultovernment
default has
default shown little recognition of the impact this process would have even on families who are successfully awarded 
defaultDHPs
default. 
defaultThe f
defaultamilies affected fear the loss of their homes, have to complete lengthy and detailed application forms for discretionary payments and o
defaultften wait for months for a decision which may only gi
defaultve them temporary security. The pressure this is putting on families affected is
default huge
default, particularly 
defaultfor those who will need the additional space long-term, or indee
defaultd for the rest of their lives. T
defaulthe know
defaultledge that 
defaultthey will have to conduct this process over and over again simply to remain in their homes is debilitating
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, a
default carer, who cares full-time
default for
default his wife who has a mental health condition
default,
default 
defaultand who had been waiting three months for a 
defaultD
defaultHPs
default decision
default,
default said:
default&#xa0;
default“She can’t 
defaultleave the house normally
default, 
defaultand now she
default 
defaultdoesn’t even
default feel safe 
defaultthere
default. 
defaultSince this happened she has gone
default completely
default 
defaultdownhill. 
defaultShe is 
defaultpanics 
defaultevery time
default she thinks about it
default,
default which is every day. I can’t ever show it to her, but 
defaultI’
defaultm struggling to hold it together 
defaultmysel
defaultf with this weighing down on us. We cannot cope with this 
defaultpressure for
default the rest of our lives.
default”
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment has suggested 
defaulton different occasions 
defaultthat the DHPs also enable councils to make an effective assessment of need
default on a case-by-case basis.
default 
defaultIn a letter responding to 
defaulta Carers UK
default submission 
defaultto
default Downing Street
default on this policy
default, the Government states tha
defaultt discretionary payments afford
default local authorities 
default‘
defaultthe discretion to support those most in need’ and that blanket exemptio
defaultns would not have delivered ‘the range of flexibilities needed to cover every individual circumstance’
default. 
defaultHowever Carers UK’s evidence indic
defaulta
defaulttes that many DHP claims are being assessed in financial terms ra
defaultther than on an 
defaultassessment of need related to disability. We have heard from families where the council 
defaultrecognised their 
defaultcare and support needs through the allocation of properties with additional rooms
default, but turned the same families down for DHPs to pay for those rooms on
default financial 
defaultground. Examples included 
defaultbeing turned down 
defaultbecause their spending on food exceed
defaulted
default £3.50 per person per day, or
default because
default other items of household expenditure 
defaultwere
default considered non-essential. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is also
default increasing evidence that the discretionary funds available are insufficient to 
defaultmeet
default disabled people
default’s
default an
defaultd carers’
default needs. 
defaultSince
default April 2013
default,
default 
default£25 million in funding
default has been made available to local authorities to mitigate the imp
defaultact of the change to size criteria on disabled people.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultDHPs
default Guidance Manual states that ‘
defaultt
defaulthe 
defaultextra funding is intended to provide additional help to disabled claimants living in properties where significant adaptations have been made
default’ and that ‘the 
defaultallocation of the additional funding for disabled people broadly reflects the impact of this measure and the additional funding needed to support this group’
default.
default Carers UK has not been able to determine the basis on which the Department for Work and Pensions
default calculated the size of this fund or the rationale behind 
defaultusing
default ‘
defaultsignificant adaptations’
default as a proxy for need related to poor health or disability. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe this fails to recognise the reality of many health conditions, disabilities and caring scenario
defaults. There
default are a wide variety of circumstances where an additional room is needed, unrelated to adaptations. 
defaultFor example,
default 
defaultcarers of 
defaultpartners with early-onset dementia or post-traumatic stress disorder who wake up not recognising thei
defaultr partners and who can la
defaultsh out.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe DHP
default Guide does state 
defaultDHPs should be considered where
default 
defaulta
default long term medical condition 
default‘
defaultcreates dif
defaultficulties in sharing a bedroom’. 
defaultHowever 
defaultit is clear from examining
default a selection of local authority procedures
default and from carers’ experiences that a number 
defaultof councils
default 
defaultare
default 
defaultusing the guidance to specifically link
default eligibility for discretionary payments
default to adaptations
default. 
defaultIn addition, if the value of the DHP funding has been calculated in relation to the number of people 
defaultwith adaptations
default,
default then extension of the payments to individuals with different needs 
defaultwill result in a shortfall.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe Government’s impact assessment
defaults
default indicat
defaulted
default that 420,000 disabled people would be affected
default by the change in size criteria. However, on the b
defaultasis of an average shortfall of £14 a week, this 
defaultfund would support fewer than 40,000 disabled people to stay in their homes 
defaultfor a year (the duration of the £25 million fund)
default. T
defaulthis represents
default fewer than 1 in 10 of 
defaultthe disabled people
default affected. 
defaultEstimates fr
defaultom the National Housing Federation showed that approximately 100,000 disabled people affected 
defaulthave home adaptations
default, so the discretionary pot would not cover even this smaller group.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCarers UK has been heavily promoting advice and information encouraging carers to apply for discretionary payments if they 
defaultwere
default affected. 
defaultHowever, only
default just over half of 
defaultthose interviewed 
defaulthad
default applied for 
defaultDHPs
default. Many were aware of DHPs but had not applied for a variety of reasons – some had been informally told by 
defaultcouncil
default officers ‘not to bother
default’
default applying because insufficient funds meant they were v
defaultery unlikely to get any support;
default others 
defaulthad been told support wa
defaults only temporary so
default had decided against

defaultfor just a few weeks or months of support.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultO

defaultFor those who had either not applied for DHPs, whose applications had been turned down
default or whose DHPs had expired,
default the impact of paying the shortfall in rent was extremely serious
default.
default 
default75% were
default cutting back on essential spending like food and heating.
default 
defaultFor example:
default&#xa0;
defaultZara cares full time for her husband who has Huntington’s Disease
default and has herself herself suffered two strokes.
default Her husband’s illness means his
default sleep is constantly disturbed and they 
defaultwere allocated a home with a 
defaultsecond bedroom 
defaultto allow
default Zara the spac
defaulte to get the respite she needs. It is now
default considered ‘spare’ 
defaultand they face
default £15 a week shortfall in their rent on top of £2 a week 
defaultfrom the
default replacement of 
defaultCouncil Tax benefit – 
defaultin total
default £884 
defaultmore a year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe couple applied for 
defaultDHPs
default, and were initially declined because
default 
defaulttheir local authority stated expenditure on items like postage stamps, spectacles and savings to buy a vacuum cleaner
default were non-essential
default. Following an appeal
default,

defaultl

default&#xa0;
defaultThey cannot now afford their bills.

defaultOf 
defaultcarers paying the shortfall
default,
default 1
default7% 
defaultwere 
defaultin arrears and 8% were p

default. These
default include 
defaulta couple caring for a disabled daughter who use their box room so that one of them can get a full night’s sleep whilst the other can get up when needed to provide night

defaultare at risk of eviction.
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese defaultexamplesdefault illustrate that the Government’s mitigation measures are woefully inadequate and that carers anddefault their families are facing devastating consequences. The failure of the Government to respond to warnings defaultin advance of this policy odefaultr defaultto mounting evidence defaultwhich has bornedefault out these warnings is reprehensible – it is exposing vulnerable people todefault financial crisis anddefault defaultlong-term defaultpovertydefault. Even those who qualify for discretionary support face insecurity and the risk of losing their homes for the duration of their disability or caring responsibilities – often for life. Carers UK continues to call for tdefaulthe Government to defaulturgentdefaultlydefault defaultexempt carers and disabled people from the size criteria changes. default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCarers UK believes that the exclusion of carers from the protected groups within Council Tax 
defaultlocali
defaults
defaulta
defaulttion
default and inclusion
default of
default carers within the household benefit cap are inconsistent with the rationale for both policies. The Government has 
defaultstated that both changes are designed to apply to ‘workless households’, improve work incentives, promote behaviour chan
defaultge and discourage long-term benefit claims
default. None of these aims should apply to carer households, 
defaultand the fact that they do contradicts the Government’s assertion that
default ‘the 
defaultone thing 
default[they]
default are not looking to encourage is a change in the carer's behaviour so that they stop caring
default’. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocalisation of Council Tax support:default 
defaultCarers UK argued that carers should be a protected group alongside pensioners
default,
default as Council Tax Benefit was replaced by loca
defaultl reductions schemes
default. 
defaultHowever
default Government did not accept this recommendation and
default,
default furthermore, the guidance issued to local authorities made no mention of caring responsibilities in relation to vulnerable groups who should be prioritized for support through
default local 
defaultschemes.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis omission is a further example of a failure to 
defaultrecognize 
defaultthe pressures and limitations that caring places on families’ ability to work, and continues the insulting and misguided suggestion that carers are ‘workless’. It exposes carers t
defaulto considerable extra costs when they have limited or no capacity to increase their incomes through work. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCarers UK has not yet completed detailed analysis of the impact of localizing Council Tax support on carers, which will form part of our Caring &amp;
default Family Finances Inquiry, to be published in December. 
defaultHowever we are concerned by growing evidence from research and our Adviceline that many 
defaultcouncils
default 
defaultare not protecting carers.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a snapshot example,
default 
defaultin 
defaultHertfordshire
default,
default 
defaultof the
default 10 district councils in the
default county
default, s
defaultome are protecting disabled people, some are protecting those on benefits with children under 5 and some are protecting several vulnerable groups.  However currently only one district council in the county is proposing to protect carers.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur e
defaultvi
defaultdence gathered in relation to the changes to the social sector size criteria highlights not only that the localisation of council support is resulting in carers losing support and having to pay more, but that different cuts to financial support are combini
defaultng to put even greater pressure on carers and their families. Of the carers affected by the changes to the size criteria who we interviewed, 
default29% were also facing additional Council Tax payments as a result of the abolition of Council Tax Benefit. 
defaultFamilies 
defaultwho 
defaultface a rent shortfall of as much as £1200 a year
default, as a result of the size criteria changes, are also having to pay
default a further £300 
defaulta year 
defaultin Council Tax charges. This would be a difficult financial burden for most families to manage, but those already 
defaultseeing reduced incomes and additional costs as a result of disability and caring
default are less likely to be able to cope.
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHousehold benefit cap: defaultDuring the passage of the Welfare Reform Act Carers UK urged the Government to exempt households including individua
defaultls with entitlement to Carer’s Allowance from the household benefit cap. Whilst 
defaultexemptions were put in place 
defaultfor 
defaultDisability Living Allowance claimants, war widows, and famil
defaulties claiming Working Tax Credit this fails to protect significant groups of carers.
default&#xa0;default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default defaultAs a result of the definition of a ‘household’
default, 
defaultcarers caring for 
defaultdisabled children under 18 and disabled partners would be exempt (as the eligibility for disability benefits would
default fall within their benefit unit). H
defaultowever carers caring for 
defaultadult disable
defaultd children or other adult relatives
default would be affected by the cap as, even if the person they cared 
defaultfor lived in the same property, 
defaultthe exemption from the benefit cap would only include the benefit unit of the disabled adult and would not protect other adul
defaultts within the household. 
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis 
defaultis inconsistent
default and illogical – as a full time carer of a disabled child aged 17 years old would be protected from the cap, but the same carer would be affected as soon as their child turned 18. A full time carer of a disabl
defaulted partner would be protected but a full-time carer of a disabled sibling would be subject to the cap. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default Government
default’s impact assessments have predicted
default that of the 56,000 households capped in 2013/14, 
default5,000 households are expected to include a Carer’s Allowance claimant, and they will see 
defaultan average
default reduction in income of £105 a week.
default This will be devastating for many of the families affected who are often already struggling to make ends meet. 
defaultAgain, 
defaultCa
defaultrers UK

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCarers UK believes defaultit is deeply unfair for carers to both be subject to the household benefit cap and subject to defaultnew Council Tax charges. Ddefaultoing so sends out a very negative message about the value the Government places on caringdefault and maydefault lead to family finances collapsing and caring becoming financially untenable.default We continue to call on the Government to exempt Carer’defaults Allowance from the capdefault and to reconsider adding carers as a protected group within Council Tax reductions schemes.
