[[[Country Land and Business Association – Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction ]]]&#xa0;The CLA is the leading national organisation representing and supporting businesses and homeowners in rural communities and covering all aspects of land use and management. Our members live and work in the countryside and own and run more than 250 different types of business in rural areas including: agriculture, forestry, fisheries, renewable energy, food, conservation, access, tourism, recreation and other rural businesses. &#xa0;One aspect of the CLA’s work is the provision of advice to its members. The CLA deals with inquiries relating to public rights of way and also with housing, both of which are dealt with in the Draft Deregulation Bill. We are therefore well placed to understand the difficulties that arise in these areas. &#xa0;

[[[Clauses 12 – 18 and Schedule 6: Use of Land: Public Rights of Way]]]&#xa0;The CLA is a member of the Stakeholder Working Group on Unrecorded Rights of Way (SWG) which was set up in 2008 by Natural England and Defra to consider the particular difficulties arising from the process of recording rights of way which are not currently shown on the Definitive Map and Statement.  The SWG initially met over a period of some eighteen months and agreed 32 recommendations. These were published in its report, Stepping Forward, in March 2010. The SWG agreed that these were a cohesive package in relation to improvements in the recording of currently unrecorded rights of way and the consensus achieved was dependent on all of the recommendations being implemented in full. &#xa0;Not all of the recommendations of the SWG require primary legislation, but those that do are included as clauses within the draft Deregulation Bill. The CLA’s support for these clauses is dependent upon the other recommendations of the SWG being implemented. In particular, it is crucial that the 2026 cut-off for the recording of pre-1949 rights of way (introduced under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000) is brought into effect, as this is the rationale for the package of measures agreed by the SWG.  &#xa0;However, the SWG only considered one small aspect of rights of way and this was reflected in its report. Even if implemented in full, the SWG reforms will not redress the present imbalance in rights of way legislation.  &#xa0;We therefore believe that additional reforms should be included within the Deregulation Bill, which would meet the Bill’s intentions to reduce the burden of regulation by-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; freeing business from red tape;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; making life easier for individuals and civil society; and-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; reducing bureaucratic requirements on public bodies.&#xa0;

[[[Need for additional reform]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The SWG considered issues relating mainly to historic unrecorded ways. It did not consider issues arising from rights of way which are already recorded, or which are being claimed through alleged use. Authorities and individuals deal with numerous claims every year which relate to the alleged use by the public and result in a consequent claim for a public right of way. Section 31 Highways Act 1980 provides that a public right of way may be claimed after a period of twenty years’ uninterrupted use by the public “as of right”. After that period the landowner is “deemed” to have dedicated his land to the public as a right of way unless he can show that was not his intention. The SWG, and therefore the draft Bill, has not considered the regulatory burden imposed by this aspect of rights of way, and we submit that the Bill should include clauses to make life easier by reducing the burdens created on authorities and individuals by these types of claims.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[User Evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The issue of claims for rights of way being made based on use has not been addressed at all by the proposed reforms.  &#xa0;There is evidence of claims being made for rights of way where the user evidence has been overstated.  This is not necessarily deliberate: as the judge in the Betterment case noted: “a degree of commitment to a cause can unconsciously distort recollection”. Nevertheless, if users overstate evidence, whether consciously or not, this can lead to increased costs to both authorities and individuals. The process for collecting evidence is not clear, and therefore procedures are not easily adhered to. The resultant confusion places a burden on central and local government, as well as individuals. &#xa0;Refining the process so that it is easy to follow will reduce the scope for dispute, ensure that claims are well founded, and thereby reduce the overall burden to society. To improve the quality of user evidence in support of claims the following changes are required:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We recommend that the following clauses be inserted in the draft Bill: &#xa0;Wildlife and Countryside (Definitive Maps and Statements) Regulations 1993 SI 1993 No 12

[[[ ]]]Schedule 7 is amended as follows: after “I/We attach copies of the following documentary evidence (including statements of witnesses) in support of this application”, insert – “and each witness has completed their own statement and signed a statement of truth”. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Section 31 Highways Act 1980 is amended as follows: &#xa0;In subsection (1)  after “…20 years,” insert – “such that an objective landowner would appreciate that the public is asserting a right,”.&#xa0;

[[[Time Limit for Claims]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is essential that claims are brought within a reasonable period after use has been challenged. Currently claims can arise 30 years or more after the alleged use was challenged and judgments are having to be made about use that is alleged to have taken place 50 or more years ago.  &#xa0;There is an anomaly between the rights of way and village green legislation, which increases the burden on individuals and authorities.  Landowners are able to make deposits under section 31(6) Highways Act 1980 admitting the rights of way and, from 1st October, village greens over their land.  Following the submission of such deposit, there is a period of one year during which users may notify a claim of a village green. However, there is no such time limit in respect of rights of way. Consequently, authorities and individuals face on ongoing burden arising from potential claims; a burden that is contrary to the intention of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act which intended that the cut-off in 2026 should bring certainty and ensure that landowners did not face unexpected claims dating from use that took place many years previously.  &#xa0;Most aspects of law are subject to time limitations, and there is no justification for rights of way being an exception. Introducing a time limit would bring rights of way claims into line with village greens and would reduce the significant burden on individuals and authorities who have to attempt to investigate or defend claims which are decades old.  &#xa0;Introducing a time limit would also reduce the burden on authorities and individuals by reducing the likelihood of relevant parties/witnesses having died (which is a particular issue when cases are brought which relate to use which is alleged to have taken place many decades previously), or of ownership having changed.  &#xa0;Legislation required:&#xa0;(1)&#xa0;&#xa0; Section 53 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is amended as follows. Insert – “(5B) The modifications which may be made by an order under subsection (2) must be made within a period of one year from the date the use was brought into question.(5C) An application made by a person under subsection (5) must be made within a period of one year from the date the use was brought into question.(5D) “brought into question” is within the meaning of the Highways Act 1980 (c.31).”&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Extension of Powers to Authorise Structures]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We welcome Clause 16 which enables the extension of powers to erect structures to include byways.  However, we note that the current powers only enable authorities to authorise structures for agricultural purposes. This limitation causes real problems for householders who may wish to make a garden secure or businesses who wish to restrict vehicular access to a property for security reasons. This is because an authority has no power to authorise a structure, however much it may agree it is needed.   &#xa0;The powers should be extended to enable authorities to authorise structures for any landowner, on any type of path and for any reasonable purpose, including agriculture, security or protection of property.  &#xa0;There are numerous examples of paths passing through homes and gardens where a gate cannot currently be erected to ensure pets and children are kept safe, or the property kept secure.  The retention of discretion with the authority will ensure that the public interest is secured, and, by ensuring that rights of way can respond more flexibly to current needs, will reduce the adverse impact on the occupier and consequently the need to oppose an unrecorded right of way or to alter an existing right of way.&#xa0;Legislation required: &#xa0;(1)&#xa0;&#xa0; Section 147 of the Highways Act 1980 (which allows highway authorities etc to authorise the erection of stiles etc on footpaths or bridleways crossing agricultural land) is amended as follows: &#xa0;Delete paragraph (1) and insert - “(1A) The following provisions of this section apply where the owner, lessee or occupier of land in England represents to a competent authority in England as respects a footpath or bridleway that crosses the land, that for securing the use, or any particular use of the land, it is expedient that stiles, gates or other works should be erected on the path or way.(1B) The following provisions of this section also apply where the owner, lessee or occupier of the land in England, represents to a competent authority in England as respects a restricted byway or a byway open to all traffic that crosses the land, that for securing the use, or any particular use of the land, it is expedient that gates or other works should be erected on the byway.”&#xa0;

[[[Diversions and Extinguishments]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We support the introduction of a right to apply as proposed under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The extension of that right to all types of landowner, as proposed under Clause 17 would be a welcome and fair improvement. It would be wrong if householders and other non-agricultural businesses affected by public rights of way were excluded from the ability to seek a change. &#xa0;However, we do not support the unilateral “cost recovery” proposals within that clause which provide authorities with wide powers of charging without significant safeguards, such as the quality of the order making process and provision for the work to be competitively outsourced. In addition, it would be unfair for applicants to bear the costs associated with objections which are unfounded or spurious. If the clause is retained, significant safeguards will need to be included alongside provision for award of costs where there has been unreasonable behaviour.  &#xa0;If applicants for public path orders are required to bear costs, then we are unclear why commensurate fees have not also been introduced for those applying for modification orders.  While the provision of fees does not appear, on its own, to be particularly deregulatory, to regulate only one party in this way will have the opposite effect to that intended by the Bill. We note that the Macdonald report recommended users should pay a fee when submitting a claim. The situation is analogous to village greens where fees are already charged. There is no logic for the public purse bearing the full cost of rights of way claims. Recent measures have seen further fees introduced so that landowners can protect their land from claims of rights of way. It is inequitable to do this without also ensuring that applicants contribute towards the costs of their claims.&#xa0;Diversions should be subject to a presumption in favour of the diversion out of farmyards, gardens and other sensitive areas where privacy, safety or security is an issue.  In situations where no diversion is physically possible, the impact of the right of way on the occupier’s use of his land should be a legitimate consideration. Being unable to consider that impact creates an unfair regulatory burden that should be reduced under this Bill. &#xa0;Legislation required:&#xa0;Section 119 Highways Act 1980 should be amended as follows. Insert – &#xa0;“(6B) In considering whether to confirm a public path diversion order, the Secretary of State or council, as the case may be, shall have particular regard to the presumption that paths should not pass through farmyards, commercial areas, gardens or other land where privacy, safety or security is an issue.”&#xa0;Section 118 Highways Act 1980 should be amended as follows.  At the end of (2) insert – &#xa0;“...and having regard to the effect which the right of way has on land crossed by the path or way.”&#xa0;The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 should be amended as follows: insert-&#xa0;“The Secretary of State may make regulations in relation to land in England which make provision as to the fees payable in relation to(a)&#xa0;&#xa0; The submission of evidence discovered in relation to one of the matters specified under subsection 53 (3)(b) and subsection 53(3)(c); and(b)&#xa0;&#xa0; An application under section 53 (5).”

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Double Jeopardy]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]As the law stands now, a claim can be fought and won (often over a period of many years) and then the entire case can be reopened and examined again because of the discovery of new, or allegedly new, evidence. Dealing with claims costs authorities and landowners time and money, and dealing with the same, or substantially the same claim again, places an unacceptable burden on individuals and authorities. To reduce waste and resources, claims for paths which have already been examined and determined should not be re-considered. &#xa0;Legislation required:&#xa0;Section 53 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 should be amended as follows: insert-&#xa0;“(2A) The requirements under subsection (2) shall not apply in respect of any occurrence of the events specified in subsection (3)(c) in relation to a way on which an authority has already made a determination in respect of one of those events.”&#xa0;

[[[Improving Decision Making and Access to Justice]]]&#xa0;Barristers, or other independent and impartial legally trained experts, should determine contested orders, as is currently the case with village greens and with the Lands Tribunal. The need for impartiality and independence is crucial and must be seen to be so. &#xa0;In addition, it is a concern that the cost of defending a claim is so great that landowners are simply unable to afford suitable advice and are denied access to justice. If landowners decide to defend claims of rights of way, the costs of doing so can easily run to tens of thousands of pounds. For many people, that is an unaffordable cost.  &#xa0;There is no parity between the parties: applicants may spend time formulating an application and gathering evidence, but once the claim is made, the costs of pursuing that claim are borne by the public purse. Owners, on the other hand, do not have that luxury: they not only spend a great deal of time (often years) defending a claim, but also a great deal of money.  It should not be the case that only owners who can afford to do so are able to achieve justice. The law should recognise that in taking a public right there is an impact on a private individual, and there should be balance between the two. &#xa0;Implementing both the recommendations of the SWG and our further proposals outlined here, will help in achieving this balance, making the system less burdensome, more flexible, and easier to understand to the benefit of individuals and authorities alike. &#xa0;Case studies are attached in Appendix A. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Clause 20 – Reduction of Qualifying period for right to buy ]]]&#xa0;Whilst we appreciate that there are safeguards in place to limit Right to Buy in Rural Areas, many of our members aspire to build and retain affordable/sub-market rent housing in locations that may become strategic urban extensions or new towns.&#xa0;Unless wording is included in the deregulation bill that excludes right to buy from affordable/sub-market rent housing that has been delivered without public sector grant, the CLA does not support the reduction in the qualifying period from 5 to 3 years.&#xa0;

[[[Clause 21 – Removal of power to require preparation of housing strategies ]]]&#xa0;We do not object the removal of the requirement for Local Authorities to have housing strategies or prepare housing statements. However, Strategic Housing Market Assessments and Housing Needs Studies are vital evidence bases that must remain.&#xa0; In removing the requirement outlined at s21, we assume that (planning) guidance will require Local Planning Authorities, or preferably LEPS, to monitor, gauge and assess the Housing Market. &#xa0;Of course we would very much like the opportunity to come and talk to the committee in more detail regarding the Bill and if you need any further information, please contact our Public Affairs department. &#xa0;Charlotte Davies Public Affairs Adviser Country Land and Business Association &#xa0;The CLA are the rural economy experts.

[[[Appendix A ]]]Case Studies of Issues with Rights of Way&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;A claim was made for a right of way. Users claimed to have used a route for at least twenty years “as of right” (i.e. that the alleged right of way had been used by the public without permission, force or secrecy).  Access has been provided for a number of years on a permissive basis. A claim for a permanent right of way was made after the permissive access was closed for farm management reasons. &#xa0;The landowner proved that there was no public right of way. Of particular concern was the way in which the alleged claim was handled: the proper procedures were not followed with regard to the collection and acceptance of evidence – -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence forms were accepted by the authority, despite not being signed by the alleged witness-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Maps of the alleged route used were accepted by the authority, again without signature-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Notes of interviews with witnesses were not taken-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Witnesses were not interviewed if they provided evidence which did not support the claim: the authority therefore failed to thoroughly investigate the claims to see if the claims were justified-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence was poorly photocopied by the authority so that it was unreadable-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence was provided by the authority at the last minute; this meant there was not the required time to assimilate the information provided-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Inspectors, contrary to guidance, accepted evidence that had not been properly gathered&#xa0;Poor collection and verification of evidence means that cases are brought forward, at taxpayers’ expense, without the authority having gained a balanced view. &#xa0;The cost to the landowner in defending their land from this claim was tens of thousands of pounds. The cost to the taxpayer is not known as the authority has refused to disclose its costs. These costs represent a burden on individuals and society which could be significantly reduced by ensuring that the regulatory burden is reduced.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;A small field was purchased by the landowner in 2011 with the benefit of a section 31(6) declaration having been in place since 1997. The owner bought the land in the knowledge that there was no right of way, and that it had the protection of the owner’s declaration that there was no intention to dedicate a right of way. However, after the change of ownership a claim was made for a right of way. Because there is no time limit in place within which a claim must be made, the claimants were able to leapfrog the previous fourteen years and make a claim based on alleged use dating back to the 1970’s. As landowners are able to allow permissive access once a section 31(6) declaration is in place, there is considerable confusion within the user evidence about the use that took place within the most recent fourteen year period (and which therefore cannot give rise to a right of way), and that which is alleged to have taken place prior to that. This problem would not arise, with all the attendant costs for individuals and authorities, if there was a time limit within which claims could be brought, as evidence would then be fresh. &#xa0;&#xa0;A similar situation arises in the East of England where the householder owned a small property, one of an estate of houses. In 2010, a claim for a public right of way across the estate was made, crossing individual properties. It is known that signs prohibiting use have been in place for at least the previous 20 years. The claim therefore rests on use that may, or may not, have taken place during the 1970’s and potentially as far back as the 1950’s. &#xa0;Not only can recalling matter such as use, signs and the route followed be difficult after many years have elapsed, but key witnesses may have died complicating the process still further. &#xa0;The householder said: “We can recall one property owner who for many years challenged people on the alleged footpath. She also had a chain across her property, where the alleged footpath now goes. Unfortunately, she died a few years ago, aged over 90.”&#xa0;Allowing delays of many years before a claim is brought is also unfair to owners who have purchased a property and are unaware of potential use many years previously, and who would take comfort in the fact that signs were currently in place prohibiting use. &#xa0;&#xa0;A householder owns a small rural house and garden, but no adjoining land. A footpath runs past the house and across the garden. It is only occasionally used, but its presence means that the isolated rural property cannot be secured against intruders, the householder is unable to let dogs roam free in their own garden because they could “deter” people from using the footpath, and he cannot let his grandchildren use the garden because the authority does not have the power to authorise a gate. The householder is unable to divert the footpath because the only land he owns is his garden, and he finds himself in an apparently unresolvable situation where he can no longer enjoy his own property. &#xa0;&#xa0;A village householder has a right of way passing through his house and garden. He is unable to divert the path because of houses on each side. He cannot have his grandchildren to stay because he cannot secure the garden and is not permitted a gate. People walk through the garden and peer in the house windows. There is no respect for his property or his privacy, and he too is unable to enjoy his own home. &#xa0;&#xa0;A dairy farmer and his family have farmed land, first as tenants and then more recently as owners for over 110 years. There has always been a public footpath along the track to the farm and it has never been used by members of the public in vehicles. In 2009, convoys of vehicles started using the track. The highway authority stated that the status of the track had been changed in the mid-1980s.The owner was not notified of any proposed change at the time (although he should have been).The owner spent the best part of a year seeking information about this change in status and eventually discovered, following Freedom of Information Act requests, that the definitive map had been incorrectly altered as no modification order was made. The authority refused to correct the error and the farm was continued to be beset by convoys of vehicles and motorbikes coming through the middle of the farmyard buildings and livestock at all times of day and night.   &#xa0;The farmer says: “At this point I was not very well as the stress and upset that this terrible situation has caused was starting to take its toll on me. We are trying to run a dairy business and to have all this thrown in as well has been unbearable. To date our solicitor’s fees are up to £19,000 and my husband and I are at breaking point”&#xa0;“Nobody can help us with this. We have no rights. The law is totally against us and we have nowhere to go. There is no-one to support us or help us without huge amounts of money which we do not have.  I hope that changes happen quickly to help not just us but all the other farmers and landowners, big and small, that find themselves in this terrible situation with a legal system that is so out of touch with reality it is unthinkable”.  &#xa0;&#xa0;A farmer had a footpath across his field which had always been recognised and used as such.  He was therefore surprised and annoyed to find vehicles attempting to use it as not only was such use illegal, but the footpath was not wide enough for vehicles. He was even more surprised to discover that the highway authority admitted that they had made an error when listing the path on the definitive map and it should have been recorded as a footpath, but was actually shown as a byway. &#xa0;The authority made a modification order to correct the error. However, user groups objected, and the inspector decided that the authority admitting the error was not sufficient to overturn the presumption that the definitive map is correct.  &#xa0;The farmer was outraged that the authority admitted the error, but that the inspector has not corrected it. &#xa0;&#xa0;A householder has a public footpath along the drive to his property which then leads to other properties beyond it. A claim was made to upgrade the footpath to a bridleway. The procedures for making a modification order were shown not to have been properly followed by the authority. Despite this, the order process continued. The owner relied on the placing of signs and a section 31(6) declaration to show that the use claimed could not have taken place “as of right” within the twenty year period to 2006. The authority then simply leapfrogged the statutory declaration and signs to claim an earlier twenty year period, this time ending in 1998. &#xa0;The owner says: “A declaration is useless as authorities will simply leapfrog it until they reach a period of time it wasn’t in place. The costs of defending a claim are staggering – so far it has cost us over £60,000, which we can’t afford. No-one sets out to spend that sort of money. You get dragged into the process which goes on and on until you are broken.”&#xa0;&#xa0;A claim was made for a short section (around 70 metres) of bridleway through a stud farm based on alleged historic evidence of an old track. The way would go right through the middle of the yard and would have made continuing with the stud business impossible.  &#xa0;The case took over thirteen years to be resolved, leading to the owner suffering two heart attacks as a result of the stress.  The cost of defending the claim was over £500,000. &#xa0;The owner said: “This has ruined our lives and business”. &#xa0;&#xa0;A farmer cleared a boggy area of land and gave permission for a local rider to use it. Subsequently a claim was made for a byway with people alleging they had used the path on horses and motorbikes. The farmer spent £27,000 contesting the claim for the byway and was forced to agree the bridleway to prevent costs escalating further. &#xa0;&#xa0;The owner of a small orchard entered the land into a ten year environmental scheme. A number of improvements were made as a result of the scheme including clearing a large overgrown area which had once been an old road, but which had been formally stopped up (closed) a hundred years ago. &#xa0;Recently the owner received notice of a claim with users claiming that they had been walking the old road for at least twenty years and that it should be shown as a public right of way. The owner has submitted the report of the environmental adviser who has confirmed that it would have been physically impossible to walk the route during the period being claimed as it was completely impenetrable with scrub and brambles.  &#xa0;It is, of course, possible that the route has been walked in recent years, having been opened up under the environmental scheme.  However, the period for which the route has been physically available is considerably less than the twenty years being claimed.  &#xa0; “A degree of commitment to a cause can unconsciously distort recollection”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; “As of right” meaning that the use has taken place openly and without the use of force or by the permission of the landowner (the legal principle of nec clam, nec vi, nec precario).
