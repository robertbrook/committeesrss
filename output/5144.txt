[[[ and Declaration of Interest]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) is the&#xa0;leading international tobacco company.  Its products which include the world’s number one cigarette brand Marlboro are sold in&#xa0;more than 180 countries.  PMI operates in the UK and Ireland through its subsidiary Philip Morris Limited (“PML”).&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Fighting the illicit trade in tobacco is a top priority for PML.  We invest significant resources in combating the illicit trade, and cooperate with government and law enforcement at every level, both in the UK and internationally.  &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although the UK’s legal framework provides adequate penalties for tobacco smuggling, deterrence is weakened by the difficulty of detection, and relatively low tariffs linked to current sentencing guidelines.&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Smuggling and the illicit trade takes different forms:&#xa0;Cigarettes bearing trademarks that are manufactured without the trademark owner’s permission.Cigarettes that enter or are sold in a market in violation of fiscal/customs laws.Cigarettes that are produced in one market and primarily smuggled into and sold in another where they have no legal distribution.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It ranges from small scale smuggling (often involving criminals gangs), colloquially known as ‘ant smuggling’, to large container shipments involving organised crime.  Both the UK and Ireland face similar problems shaped by common drivers of supply and demand.  Irish ports are seen as a ‘back door’ to the UK and the illicit trade is frequently linked to paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.  &#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK and Irish illicit markets are intricately linked.  As plain packaging inevitably increases the ease of supply of illicit tobacco, the prospect of Ireland introducing this policy will inevitably impact the UK. &#xa0;Recommendations7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ factories in overseas free trade zones where local oversight is lax.]]]  These are frequently located in jurisdictions with which the UK and EU enjoy close ties, but provide a key source for organised crime groups including paramilitaries.  Political engagement by senior levels of government and efforts to leverage EU influence would complement the successes of HMRC’s overseas network of Fiscal Crime Liaison Officers.

[[[The UK must ]]]

[[[prepare]]]

[[[ a strategy to adapt to changes in the illicit trade arising from the Irish Government’s proposed introduction of plain packaging.]]]  This would include even closer cooperation between UK and Irish law enforcement agencies.  The illicit markets of both countries are closely related, and since plain packaging is highly likely to increase the supply of illicit tobacco into Ireland, the policy will inevitably impact the UK (in the same way that its introduction in Scotland would impact England and Wales).  &#xa0;11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Finally, the UK should limit further tax increases to inflation, and avoid any sudden or excessive rises.]]]  The UK (with Ireland) has the highest tobacco taxes in the EU.  Consumers’ resistance to ever higher taxes and their willingness to switch to easily available alternatives that are unlicensed, unregulated and untaxed lie at the heart of this problem.&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PMI has a global Illicit Trade Strategies &amp; Prevention team dedicated to fighting illicit trade with several initiatives:&#xa0;&#xa0;Scale of the illicit tobacco problem13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Illegal cigarettes are a global problem that requires global action.  While much of the UK’s contraband originates from within the EU, counterfeit and illicit whites are often sourced from a range of countries, including some within the EU, China, the Russian Federation, Belarus, the UAE and Ukraine.  Free trade zones in e.g., Singapore and Dubai also pose particular issues. &#xa0;14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 2012 KPMG Star Report estimated that the illicit market represented 16.4% in the UK (and the UK also experienced the largest annual increase in the EU).  OLAF estimates that illicit tobacco costs the EU €10 billion a year in lost revenue, while HMRC estimates the UK loss at nearly £2 billion.  The full cost is likely to be even higher than this due to broader consequences, notably:&#xa0;15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The illicit trade has changed rapidly in recent years, as acknowledged by a recent National Audit Office report. Cross-border smuggling of UK tobacco brands and to a lesser extent counterfeit have decreased relative to illicit whites which have risen rapidly. In 2012 the UK consumed an estimated 1 billion illicit white cigarettes, a 49% increase on 2011.  &#xa0;Co-operation with governments16.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PMI assists law enforcement at every level, from the local to international.  Globally, INTERPOL, with its presence across 190 countries is ideally placed to lead this effort.  In 2012 PMI pledged €15m to INTERPOL’s global initiative against illicit goods trafficking, ‘Fund for a Safer World’.  This programme seeks to dismantle the organised crime networks that traffic a range of illicit goods and identify the routes they use (which are often also used by human traffickers and drug smugglers).&#xa0;17.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PMI works closely with European authorities.  PMI signed a Cooperation agreement with the European Commission in 2004, to which the UK, Ireland and all other Member States are also party.  The agreement established regular exchanges of information between PMI, OLAF and the Member States regarding seizures of counterfeit and genuine cigarettes.  This information underpins Project Star, an annual EU wide study of tobacco consumption that PMI commissions from KPMG. The results are presented to both OLAF and representatives of all EU Member States and allows PMI and law enforcement to identify EU wide trends more quickly. The Cooperation agreement also established a range of supply chain control measures including enhanced ‘Know Your Customer’ checks, sales volume monitoring, and tracking and tracing obligations.&#xa0;18.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the UK PML participates with the rest of the industry and HMRC in an anti-illicit trade working group, and also invests significant resources in commissioning research and gathering intelligence on the nature and extent of the illicit trade.  PMI, along with other industry players, is party to an Intelligence Sharing Protocol with HMRC (with extensive intelligence sharing with HMRC’s FCLO network) and further work is continuing on finalising a broader MOU between HMRC and industry participants.&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]19.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The scale of tobacco smuggling, the difficulty of detecting it, the involvement of organised crime, and the wider costs to society make it essential that there is adequate deterrence.  &#xa0;20.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Detecting tobacco smuggling is often difficult as a significant proportion is imported into the UK by small scale smugglers, a method increasingly used by organised criminals with networks of ‘mules’.  This is especially true of the East European variants (both counterfeit and contraband). &#xa0;21.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The penalty for smuggling tobacco into the UK carries a maximum sentence of seven years. Additionally, counterfeiters face sentences of up to ten years for improper use of trademarks, and any criminal proceeds can be recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.   &#xa0;22.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, tobacco smugglers rarely face the maximum penalty, and Trading Standards have recommended that the Sentencing Guidelines issued to the courts be reviewed.  Since 2010/11 approximately 43.5% of sentences in England and Wales were non-custodial or suspended sentences, and in Northern Ireland this figure was much higher.  Indeed, a recent Court of Appeal judgment handed down in relation to excise evasion on tobacco backed the need for stronger sentencing. &#xa0;23.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Further inhibiting effective deterrence is the different approach to enforcement across the country.  One success story has been in Liverpool, where the city’s Trading Standards’ Alcohol and Tobacco Unit was set up in 2008.  Funded until 2015 by a further injection of £400,000, it has five full time staff and always prosecutes for illicit tobacco seizures, even for cases involving as few as 200 cigarettes.  This stance has seen a significant drop in seizures and positive test purchase operations from a peak in 2008-2009 when first formed.  However, this level of commitment is exceptional.

[[[in]]]

[[[ the UK and Ireland ]]]24.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The illicit trades in the UK and Ireland share many characteristics and are closely connected.  The 2012 KPMG Star Report estimated that the illicit market represented 16.4% in the UK (the highest annual increase throughout the EU) and 19.1% in Ireland.  It is caused by several factors including high profits for relatively low risk, well organised criminal networks, the relatively high price of tobacco (the UK and Ireland have the highest tobacco taxes in the EU), and increasing price sensitivity among consumers hit by economic hardship (which has led to a wider pattern of down trading to legal cheaper tobacco products).&#xa0;25.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In both countries test purchasing indicates that illicit tobacco is readily available through a variety of channels, including market stalls, pubs, retail outlets as well as door–to–door sales, private houses, and via online ads.  &#xa0;Small scale smuggling26.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK and Ireland are both vulnerable to small scale smuggling, facilitated by cheap and direct transport connections to eastern EU Member States with lower prices, large diaspora communities, and associated retail outlets that often act as distribution networks.  &#xa0;27.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the most popular means of small scale smuggling into the UK is via large van and minibus operators that make daily trips from the main Baltic cities to the UK.  Smugglers are able to load unaccompanied suitcases filled with contraband for a small fee.  These are dropped off at pre-arranged meeting points in the UK.  &#xa0;Larger scale smuggling28.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the other end of the spectrum criminals with sophisticated clandestine networks for importing and distributing illicit goods are attracted to smuggling tobacco by the relatively low penalties and chances of detection.  &#xa0;29.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Organised criminals are heavily implicated in the UK and Irish trades.  A recent annual survey of Trading Standards’ experience of IP crime has shown the strong link between illicit tobacco and organised crime.   Similarly during recent test purchasing fieldwork commissioned by PML, Trading Standards regularly pointed to the relationship between drugs trafficking and illicit tobacco. Indeed, Deputy Government Chief Whip Lord Newby recently stated in the House of Lords:&#xa0;“The people who smuggle cigarettes do, indeed, tend to smuggle other things, typically drugs, and sometimes even more dangerous things than that.  I do not have an exact breakdown, but a lot of this smuggling is carried out on a large scale by criminal gangs who are looking to smuggle anything they can with a high value, of which cigarettes typically are only one component.”&#xa0;

[[[The relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity]]]30.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Northern Ireland is responsible for a disproportionate share of the UK gangs involved in tobacco fraud, partly due to the activities of paramilitary groups.  One hallmark of their involvement is the prevalence of illicit whites, which tend to be imported in bulk and afford larger profits.  These accounted for 78% of the illicit tobacco acquired during recent test purchases, an exceptionally high figure.  &#xa0;31.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The role of paramilitary groups has been well documented.  In 2012 the PSNI and Garda warned that tobacco smuggling was generating significant sums of money for the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.  It helps fund criminal activity spanning drugs, firearms, human trafficking and bomb attacks.  &#xa0;32.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Tobacco products from the Far East are often smuggled into Northern Ireland and the UK after being landed at ports in Ireland.  These have been described as a ‘back door’ to the UK, making Ireland a “huge target” according to the head of Irish Customs’ criminal investigations branch. &#xa0;33.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In recognition of this dynamic, law enforcement from both countries work closely together.   The Cross Border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group (CBTFEG)

[[[ ]]]was established in May 2010 to combat cigarette smuggling within the island of Ireland.  It aims to identify and disrupt key criminal gangs involved in cigarettes smuggling on both sides of the Irish land border.  &#xa0;

[[[The possible impact of standardised]]]

[[[ (or plain)]]]

[[[ packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK]]]34.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Plain packaging risks fuelling the illicit tobacco trade, as 24 former senior police officers in the UK have warned.  Given that large scale smugglers view the UK and Ireland as a single market, any increase in the supply of illicit tobacco to Ireland will inevitably flow through to the British mainland. &#xa0;35.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Plain packaging fuels the illicit trade in three ways.  First, demand for branded contraband will increase.  Introducing plain packaging will not erase branded tobacco, it will just hand a monopoly to criminals who already provide a cheaper product.&#xa0;36.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Second, it will facilitate counterfeiting, as multiple experts have warned.  Economies of scale make it cheaper for counterfeiters to imitate a single plain packet design than multiple different brands.  &#xa0;37.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Third, by removing branding, the policy will weaken brand loyalty and hasten the current trend towards down-trading.   Making tobacco a commoditised product with competition based purely around price will play into the hands of organised criminals.  Legitimate brands will not be able to compete on price against untaxed and unregulated illicit whites.&#xa0;38.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Illicit whites are already a major and fast-growing problem, attracting the most price-sensitive smokers.  An empty pack survey in Q4 2011 found 68 different illicit white brands in the UK, but over 450 have been identified worldwide.  Popular demand is proven: plain packaging will make Ireland (and the UK) a target for increased supply.    Already ‘baggies’ (illicit unbranded cigarettes sold cheaply in sealed transparent plastic bags) and unbranded loose tobacco are common in many countries.  The situation in the UK and Ireland could easily deteriorate further. &#xa0;39.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If, as anticipated, plain packaging leads to price reductions and therefore increases in tobacco excise to compensate, the price difference between the legal and illicit products will increase. This will increase the profit for tobacco smugglers and further incentivize them to target the Irish market.  For the reasons discussed above, any increase in supply to Ireland will flow through to the UK.

[[[&#xa0;]]]40.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; New data on the illicit tobacco trade in Australia, the only country to have introduced plain packaging, will be available by the end of September.  PML intends to share this information with the Committee before the Inquiry closes.
