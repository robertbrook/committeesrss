[normal]Written submission from Scape (LPG 36)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The pur
[normal]pose of this submission
[normal] is to supply information and evidenc
[normal]e to the CLG Committee on Local Government Procurement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background [bold]to Scape[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape has been procuring on behalf of the public sector
[normal] for over 10 years
[normal].  It is a Local Authority owned and controlled company that specialises in construction as this is the biggest procurement category of spend in Local Government (Roots Review, 2009).  Scape’s 
[normal]procurement arrangements
[normal] have grown to 8 contracts
[normal] total
[normal]ling £4
[normal]bn in 
[normal]project value.  300
[normal] 
[normal]public sector clients use Scape delivering over 1200
[normal] 
[normal]projects. All procurement arrangements
[normal] are 100% market tested, 100% cla
[normal]im free, delivered savings of £200
[normal]M and offer the most efficient route to market in the UK
[normal] for LA’s.  Example of our services is shown below:
[normal]In March 2013 the LGA published LG Procurement: Rising to the Challenge and Scape sits on the NPS construction steering group, working with local and central government colleagues to help delivery efficiencies in procurement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In July 2013 the Government published the Construction 2025 - Industrial Strategy. Scape are already delivering the savings identified in the strategy and are pro-actively working with Government to support the rest of the industry to achieve similar efficiencies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape al
[normal]so sits on NIEP legacy group for the Built Environment (Local Governments national lobbying body for construction) 
[normal]and represent
[normal]s
[normal] the UK in Europe 
[normal](through CEEPuk, UK public sector employers representative in Europe
[normal]) leading procurement and local enterprise cross sector dialogue.

[normal] 
[normal]of local government construction expenditure but has plans to increase this to 15-20% over the next 2 years. If it were to manage all of it, overall cash benefits would be at least 20%, together with all the non-cashable benefits listed above. This means that local authorities, overall, are wasting upwards of £1bn a year on their construction activities and not achieving the consistency of quality and outcomes that taxpayers should receive. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Scape’s Submission of Evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Scape works with over 120 Local Authorities (LA) across the UK and can comment on the topics outlined in the call for evidence document from a unique perspective.  Scape has deliberately made this response document simple outlining Scape’s Recommendations (SR) for the CLG Committee perusal.  We would welcome the opportunity to explain in more detail the recommendations included in this report to the CLG Committee to help shape the future direction of Local Government procurement.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]General Statement[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Local Authorities in the majority are still procuring traditionally.  What I mean by this is that procurement teams are not making best use of procurement options available to them and this is down two main factors: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Resistance to change.  Change means work and it’s much easier to stay in the same routine using the traditional procurement process that you are familiar with. 
[normal]Also, people may be concerned that using Scape would put their jobs at risk. This will often be correct as councils would be able to move over £1bn a year expenditure on construction contracting and use it for front line services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Fear of failure.  When you try a new a procurement methodology there may be risks attached and sometimes even a ‘leap of faith’ is required.  This is seen in most cases as too risky by Local Government (LG). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR1: Local authorities need to stop trying to do their own contracting and contracts management for construction and use specialist organisations such as Scape which have the expertise to be able to deliver huge cash savings, better outcomes and can manage risks better.  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]If the CLG Committee takes on Board this recommendation then Local Government procurement for construction will be hugely improved and streamlined, with huge cash and non-cashable benefits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Call for Evidence – Scape’s Response[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are pockets of good practice in Local Government in relation to VFM and the local economic and environmental objectives but in general the approach is poor and not 
[normal]properly thought through.  If you are smart you can overcome these issues by high quality procurement, even though these objectives can be complex at a local level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How does Scape demonstrate Value for Money?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All Scape contracts
[normal] and associated costs
[normal] are
[normal] tested in the open market, using an OJEU compliant process, as part o
[normal]f a package of work at the initial 
[normal]procurement stage.
[normal]  Scape methodology is based on tendering nationally but delivering locally and utilises the supermarket analogy; Bulk buy to achieve value for money.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR[bold]2[bold]: Buy in bulk to achieve the best value from the market.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape uses a tried and tested process that drives out waste and make clients work more efficiently.  This can take time and involves some training but can achieve substantial savings.  North Somerset Council use Scape and have achieved a 75% improvement in productivity and £2.4m savings in two years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape have a robust and very efficient engagement / 
[normal]project delivery process which minimises unproductive costs and takes waste, in the form of unproductive duplication, out of the system. The Scape process develops design and project delivery solutions in collaboration with the client and 
[normal]ensures an 
[normal]integrated delivery team. 
[normal]See below:
[normal]Added Value[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]All Scape procurement arrangements
[normal] 
[normal]place
[normal] a greater emphasis on tendering works locally. If lowest cost is the main driver, then the client has the option to ask the contractor to select supply chain partners on this basis.  Local spend information 
[normal]is a key driver at Scape. Other local government arrangements give this less emphasis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape provides strategic support to clients at the start of a p
[normal]roject and manages the umbrella contract
[normal] throughout the lif
[normal]e of the project including a comprehensive 
[normal]performance
[normal] management framework 
[normal]which include
[normal]s an employment and skills plan and environmental targets for every project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR[bold]3[bold]: Make local spend[bold], improving the environment[bold] and local employment (including the use of SME’s) compulsory in Local Government through introducing contract commitments on every procurement exercise.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The simple answer to this is no – reference the ‘Key Benefits’ of using Scape (above).  Local Government uses 3 main methods of procurement:
[normal]Scape procurement arrangements are always collaborative in nature and save local authorities 14% on average compared with traditionally tendering.  So why aren’t all LA’s making best use of these arrangements?  See recommendation SR1 on page 3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PFI in principle looks a really good procurement option but the way the PFI have been procured to date has meant the focus of the procurement has moved away from delivery of a contract, building, service or function to how to leverage risk onto the successful PFI partner.  This is exactly the opposite how Scape procure; PFI is complex, Scape makes it simple; PFI is time consuming, Scape is quick; and finally PFI is in the majority of cases  unaffordable, Scape gives financial certainty.  However, private finance is essential to how local government procurement is funded in the future.  PFI is broken so what’s the solution?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR[bold]4[bold]:[bold] PFI needs to be scrapped and a new vehicle to access private finance made available that’s [bold]simple, quick and certain. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This is about education of procurement teams.  An example of how Scape delivers training and increase capacity across the UK is summarised below:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape has provided more client 
[normal]trai
[normal]ning to Leicester City Council than any other 
[normal]authority

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This training was free and made available so that LCC could increase certainty (time and cost) and reduce the
[normal]ir internal management costs
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, local authorities should always use specialist procurement organisations such as Scape rather than try to do their own procurement and reinvent the wheel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR[bold]5[bold]: Make training available (free of charge if possible) for procurement teams on modern methods of procurement.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of procurement expenditure, most Local Authorities have the information necessary to understand their procurement expenditure. However, they don’t know how to access it and analyse the numbers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Supplier spend analysis is patchy at best in Local Government and no consistent methodology is employed across the UK.  A simple template can be formulated on MS Excel that could be deployed across Local Authorities that gives procurement teams structured and consistent information that can be easily updated on a regular basis. There is no need to employ external providers of such services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR[bold]6[bold]: Formulate a supplier spend analysis template for LG procurement teams. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Risk management in Local government is not properly functioning not only in procurement, but across the Local Authorities as a whole.  Yes, again there are pockets of good practice but risk should be embedded into the daily activities of the LA’s and I don’t see this happening.  The main reason from my perspective is that risk management was turned into a tick box exercise through the CPA race for excellence.  The need to provide documentation to ‘jump through the hoops’ meant that the actual management of risk became a desktop function.
[normal]Scape manages risk through adopting a simple process that is embedded into our day to day activity.  The use of a live issues log means risks are identified at an early stage of every procurement exercise through Scape workshops with public authorities and bidder’s forums with the market that flushes out any issues.   The risks are then managed 
[normal]through a structured project management approach that take the identified risks and mitigates them through the life of the procurement.  This simple approach works every time and our track record of never having a legal challenge for over 10 years is evidence that supports this approach.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]SR[bold]7[bold]: [bold]T[bold]raining on risk management is [bold]not[bold] [bold]the answer, but education around engagement workshops and basic project management [bold]is needed. However, the best solution is to use specialist organisations such as Scape.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Client management functions vary widely across the UK and Scape works with some excellent client teams.  However, more needs to be done to ensure each client management function is fit for purpose and has the right balance of skills and expertise.  Part of the Scape service is to carry out an organisational diagnostic for LA’s that enables them to baseline where they are now and more importantly, where they need to be in the future.  There is no ‘one size fits all’ and it will depend of the vision and strategic objectives of the Local Authority.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Office of Fair Trading fined construction companies about £120m in 2009 (or thereabouts) for bid rigging in local government and (to a lesser extent) the NHS. My guess is that the cost to local government may have been several hundred £Millions. The fraud was easy to perpetrate because of most local authorities act independently of each other. Such a fraud would have been far more difficult to perpetrate and would have quickly been spotted had all construction contracts be let and managed by SCAPE.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sufficiently robust information is mostly not available to provide assurance of value for money. The failure of many local authorities to work effectively with specialist procurement organisations calls into question their ability to provide assurance of accountability and value for money. This lack of confidence that value for money is being delivered may be one reason why the government feels able to make such huge reductions in local government funding. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transparency is improving thanks partly due to the need to publish payments to suppliers and the disciplines of the EU procurement directives. However, the diversity of contract terms and conditions, processes and procedures weaken accountability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is surprising that audits have not forced local authorities to use organisations such as Scape, rather than trying to ‘do it themselves’ This may suggest that there is a weakness in auditing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR8: Local authorities should make maximum use of specialist organisations such as Scape. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]SR9: Guidance should be issued to all Local Authorities on how accountability for procurement should be managed to ensure consistency.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The value for money (VFM) issues is a serious one particularly in this financial climate and Scape deals with this issue on a daily basis.  Again this comes back to risk and the need for certainty.  There are some LA’s that will risk going to the market on a contract by contract basis to demonstrate lowest cost but this is not best value.  This is a barrier Scape overcome by using an evidence based approach to demonstrating VFM.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape’s VFM track record out performs any other procurement in the UK.  How do we know this?  By measuring efficiencies through a mature performance management framework.  This includes tangible and non-tangible benefit tracking systems that not only records the changes the LA have chosen but the options they have rejected, so for example, one LA client had the option of achieving a £1.8m saving but only £950k of the savings were acceptable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scape is in a fortunate position and supports Local authorities all the time to demonstrate VFM, for example on one our procurement arrangements we average 14% savings when compared to traditional tendering.  The breakdown to this is shown below:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SR10: All local authorities should use specialist collaborative organisations like Scape to secure Value for Money and provide assurance to Central Government that value for money is being delivered[bold]. 
[normal]Summary of Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Below are the summary recommendations that Scape believes will help inform this call for evidence.  Scape would relish the challenge of helping Government improve procurement practices and are happy to be part of the detailed discussions of the CLG Committee and any post work advisory group.
