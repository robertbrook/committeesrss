"FBA0008/13-14&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\ni\n              \nGrant Thornton UK LLP\n (Grant Thornton)\n \nacknowledges that t\nhe FBSC is \ncurrently \nconducting an inquiry into the draft \nFinance Bill 2014\n and\n, in particular, on \nthe rules for taxing partnerships\n. \nWe have\n considered the \nprovisions within the draft Finance Bill 2014 \nand \nare pleased to take the opportunity to respond to the call for evidence, with a view to supporting the F\nB\nSC\n's report.\n&#xa0;\nii\n              \nPlease note, the document\n focuses primarily on the draft partnership measures. \nT\nhe second \narea of questioning, regarding the general a\npproach to \nt\nax policy \nm\naking\n,\n \nhas been considered \nin the context of \nthe \npartnership\n measures\n, and the \nconsultation process endured to this point\n, as a\n specif\ni\nc\n example of how the \n'\nnew approach\n'\n is working\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nOur general comments on the propos\ned changes to the taxation of\n partnerships\n can be found in the response we \ns\nubmitted to the original consultation \nwhich was published on 20 May 2013\n. A copy of \nthe \nresponse is \navailable on our website:\nhttp://www.grant-thornton.co.u\nk/Global/Images/Partnership%20condoc%20GT%20response.pdf\n \n1.2\n              \nBroadly, \nthere are\n \nsignificant\n concerns over the measures\n, as set out in our response document, and\n voice\nd\n in \na \nmeeting with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) as part of the consultation process. \nFurther, \nthe draft legislation that now forms part of the Finance Bill not only fails to address these concerns, but has in fact created a number of new questions\n, not least over the subjective nature of what has been proposed\n.\n \nT\nhese concerns\n are set out\n,\n in general terms, below. Please note that we also intend to separately respond to the t\nechnical consultation on \nthe draft clauses to the\n Finance Bill 2014\n, and so will\n reserve comments on the specifics of the legislation for our Finance Bill representatio\nns.\n1.3\n              \nIn brief, \nit is \nfelt\n that\n the\n draft\n \nlegislation is not wholly appropriate because, fundamentally, it \nfail\ns\n \nto achieve the stated objectives for the following reasons:\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nA\n number of these issues \nhave arisen \nas a direct result of the apparent flaws in the consultation process.\n2.1.1\n              \nT\nhe subjective nature of the draft legislation\n is \na \ncause for concern\n. \nThis will unavoidably create uncertainty in the legislation and cannot, therefore, be considered \nan effective, nor indeed ap\npropriate approach to creating the law\n. \n&#xa0;\nIn particular, based on the draft legislation, there is real uncertaint\ny and confusion \nover \ncertain terms and definitions included in the legislation, such as how to define whether a member has 'significant influence' over a partnership's business function. \n2.1.2\n              \nSome further examples of subjectivity within the 'salaried mem\nber' provisions that are likely to give rise to \nconfusion \nare:\n&#xa0;\n2.1.3\n              \nT\nhe changes are intended to ensure that partnerships, and their members, are taxed as the Government intended. \nThis \nwill\n be difficult to achieve\n, \nhowever, \nas the lack of \ncertainty over the application of the new rules\n will arguably undermine the effectivene\nss of what has been proposed. \n2.2.1\n              \nA\n number of practical questions were raised during the consultation process. \nIt is noted\n that \nseveral\n of these comments have been considered in the draft legislation. Nevert\nheless, \nquestion marks remain\n \nover significant aspects of the new legislation including, for example,\n over \nthe practicalities of moving a 'salaried member' from being taxed on the current year basis, to the payroll. In fact, it would appear that little or \nno thought has been given to the \nimpact of \nthe individual members' \ncessation\n/overlap rules\n thus far\n. \n2.2.2\n              \nThere is\n also\n uncertainty, based on the draft legislation, as to whether actions taken by \nLimited Liability Partnerships (\nLLPs\n)\n to ensure that membe\nrs are not treated as salaried members – say, an increase in capital contributions to satisfy condition C – will be disregarded under anti-avoidance provisions, even where the member’s risk increases as a result.  \n2.2.3\n              \nFurthermore, the fact remains that \naffected businesses have only a matter of weeks to implement any necessary changes such as the introduction, in some cases, of a new payroll system for 'salaried members'.\n With only 10 weeks before the proposed commencement date, there is still very little\n guidance available on the transitional rules in particular, making the transition an unnecessarily confusing, and complicated task.\n \nIt should be noted that, far from being simply a case of someone's tax status altering, the \npotential\n changes go to the he\nart \nof\n \nthe\n culture of the business, and how an \nindividual's\n status in their field is conveyed. No business should be forced to rush such a cultural change with key personnel simply to speed up the implementation of new tax \nguidelines\n.\n Such \nforced change is\n not beneficial for either the individual impacted, or the firm's prospect of continuing to generate profit and therefore contribute taxes.\n2.2.4\n              \nThis situation is \nclearly not\n ideal, and is of course further complicated by the fact that businesses will be expected to apply the rules before the finalisation of the legislation, based on the fact that Finance Bill 2014 is unlikely to be published until the end of March 2014 before\n receiving Royal Assent sometime later in the summer (in line with previous years). \n&#xa0;\n2.2.5\n              \nIf, as is likely to be the case in the limited time available, many firms look to obtain additional amounts of capital from those current partners who do not meet \nthe criteria as laid out, this will require significant bank funding to the sector. \nIt is evident from discussions with the main banks active in the sector that \nwhilst\n they are willing to fund healthy businesses, they are \nbeing\n asked to:\n&#xa0;\n2.2.6\n              \nThis, at a time when the financial health \nof\n the sector is under significant st\nrain and causing the banks significant \nconcerns\n due to recent (and \non-going\n) examples of failures where the banks have been hit hard. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.7\n              \nWe do\n \nn\no\nt believe that the timescale as set out in the legislation allows the banks \ntime\n to undertake due process \nin reviewing these applications for additional capital loans and believe that as a result\n, the banks will have to either:\n&#xa0;\nNeither of the above is a desirable outcome for the UK economy.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.8\n              \nThis\n would appear to be\n an inherent flaw in the current policy, and \nwill \nonly \nserve to \ncreate \nfurther\n uncertainty. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.1\n              \nT\nhe 'tax information and impact notes' that accompanied the draft legislation\n commented\n that the measures will have a \"negligible impact on businesses\".\n&#xa0;\nH\nowever, h\naving to deal with complex, subjective leg\nislation is a drain on businesses’ time and resources. \nBy way of an example, 's\nalaried members\n'\n will not have the same employment rights as individuals with contracts of service, as the proposed rules are stated to apply for the purposes of the Income Tax \nActs. Businesses may find\n \nthat individuals are unwilling to become members in case they are treated as employees for\n the purposes of \ntax\n and \nN\national Insurance contributions (NIC),\n but without the employment protection that \nnormally comes with the addition\nal tax and NIC liabilities that accompany employment. This could impact on succession and limit an LLP’s ability to raise capital.  \n&#xa0;\n3.1.2\n              \nThe types of uncertainties referred to above will be a distraction also. \nIt is expected\n, therefore,\n that the full ex\ntent of the draft legislation will indeed have a detrimental effect on UK busin\ness\n, and would question how it has been concluded that this is not the case. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.3\n              \nIt may also be noted\n that the potential impact of the measures is more wide ranging than even HMRC previously envisaged. This was clearly evidenced by the fact that the expected yield from the measures increased significantly from the original estimate. \n3.2.1\n              \nThe original consultation document set out the Government's belief that the existing rules surrounding the taxation of members of a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP\n),\n are effectively open to abuse. It is stated that this produces \"unfairness in the tax s\nystem\". \n&#xa0;\n3.2.2\n              \nIndeed, achieving 'fairness' was a recurring theme throughout the proposals, and understood to be fundamental to the introduction of the new measures. However,\n \ni\nt is generally felt that the wide ranging effect of the draft legislation is, i\nn fact, somewhat\n \nheavy handed and disproportionate. Furthermore, \nit is likely that\n the measures will, in fact, put partnerships at a disadvantage when compared to other business vehicles available, such as a company, for example.  \n&#xa0;\n3.2.3 \n              \nOther examples\n \no\nf where the draft legislation\n \n(in respect of the new salarie\nd member status) \nwill give rise to potential 'unfair' outcomes include\n \n&#xa0;\nIt is questionab\nle\n, therefore, \nwhether\n the proposed legislation can be said to achieve the objective of 'preserving fairness'.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.1\n              \nThe introduction of complicated new legislation (and some 55 pages of guidance) \nalso sends out a mixed message with regards to the coinciding agenda \nto simplify\n the UK tax administration.\n \nAs stated\n above\n, the new legislation will create additional uncertainty and add another layer of complexity for businesses to have to deal with.\n3.3\n.2\n              \nAs stated in our response to the original consultation, \na much simpler solution existed in that it \nwould be possible for HMRC to challenge the status of members simply by \nremoving any perceived presumption of self-employment and using existing case law.\n However, the intention is to remove that perceived presumption and then introduce new legislation that is unsatisfactory (examples as to why being set out above). \n3.3.3\n              \nThis point comes into sharp focus when one considers that HMRC will have to continue \nto use existing case law when looking at LLPs formed outside the UK and traditional partnerships.  \n3.3.4\n              \nIronically, and not strictly a tax point, for the purposes of pension auto-enrolment, the test to determine who is within the ambit of the rules is wh\nether the individual is either an employee or a worker. As stated above\n,\n salaried members of LLPs will not be employees for all purposes and will not satisfy the employment test. It is understood that the tests, as recommended by the \npensions\n regulator, as\n to whether an individual is a worker are the existing employed/self-employed tests. \n3.3.5\n              \nFurthermore, a\ns these are essentially anti-avoidance measures, questions may be raised as to whether the GAAR \ncould\n/should\n \ninstead \nbe applied to counteract the resp\nective tax advantages \nthat the draft legislation is intended to counteract\n. \n&#xa0;\nWhile it is suggested in the con\nsultation document \n(at paragraph 3.55) that the use of profit and loss allocations\n, in particular,\n may be outside the scope of these rules, it is \nunderst\nood\n that any uncertainty could be removed by the provision of specific guidance on the point in question.\n&#xa0;4.1\n              \nHMRC's \nTax Consultation \nFramework,\n sets out the five stages to tax policy development:\n&#xa0;\nStage 1 \n              \nSetting out \nobjectives and identifying options.\nStage 2 \n              \nDetermining the best option and developing a framework for implementation including detailed policy design.\nStage 3 \n              \nDrafting legislation to effect the proposed change.\nStage 4 \n              \nImplementing and monitoring the c\nhange.\nStage 5 \n              \nReviewing and evaluating the change.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nReferring specifically to the original consultation document, it was set out that \"while there are some aspects of detailed policy design that are still open, this consultation is at stage 3 and is \nabout ways to achieve the objectives stated in the consultation document while ensuring that the proposals do not have unexpected impacts.\"\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nFirstly,\n only inviting comments from professional advisors (and other stakeholders) at this late stage will (ev\nidently) give rise to practical issues\n. \nUnfortunately, it would now appear that\n the introduction of the new rules will be rushed into place\n,\n without proper consideration. This should not be the case when introducing new law. This approach will inevitably g\nive rise to \nineffective\n legislation\n,\n to the detriment of both the businesses affected, and to the integrity of, and general confidence in, the UK tax administration.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nFurthermore, \nit simply cannot be said that the consultation period has sufficiently d\nealt with a number of the 'unexpected impacts' that have arisen. As stated above, question \nmarks remain over the practical implications of the introduction of the new rules in particular\n, while \nthe significant uprating of the expected revenue yield (as ide\nntified in the Autumn Statement 2013 documentation) is clear evidence that HMRC had failed to fully appreciate the implications of what had been proposed. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nHowever, in this case, \nit would appear that \nHMRC \nhas chosen to\n ignore\n \nthe \nevident \nfailings in i\nts approach\n. Indeed, rather than accept that the under estimate was as a result of any apparent flaws in the proposals\n,\n and seek to correct the position, as \nmight otherwise \nbe expected during an on-going consultation process, there would seem to be somethi\nng of a congratulatory tone to the announcement regarding the \nadditional £1.9 billion in revenue it now expects to recover. \n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nIn summary, the subjective nature of what has been proposed puts serious doubt over whether the \nlegislation, as d\nrafted, will operate as intended. \nIndeed, the significant uncertainty arising as a result of \nthe proposed new rules\n could effectively act to undermine \nthe Government's overall objective of ensuring a \nbalanced,\n and competitive tax system.\n \n5.2\n              \nAs such, \nit \nis\n strongly \nrecommended that\n the Government reconsider the proposals and, at the very least, consider delaying the introduction of the new rules to allow \nfor a further period of consultation and analysis of all possible impacts.\nJanuary 2014\n1&#xa0;"
