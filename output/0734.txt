[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1.1              UCL is a leading research-intensive UK university, with c4,500 researchers across the spectrum of academic disciplines producing more than 9,000 research publications annually.&#xa0;1.2              We are committed to sharing our expertise, knowledge, discovery, insight and analysis in order to improve the UK’s economic, social, intellectual and cultural circumstances, and do so primarily through scholarly outputs, education, public engagement, translational research, commercial and social enterprise activity, and engagement with public policy and professional practice. &#xa0;This Submission to the Committee has been prepared by members of the UCL Communicating Climate Science Policy Commission:&#xa0;1. Evidence from climate science shows that the modern world is founded on a false assumption - that it can be powered by fossil fuels with impunity. Reworking this “ultimate stranded asset”, whilst adapting to the climate disruption to which past human activities have already committed us, represents a massive challenge. It requires myriad tailored actions on the part of a large fraction of the peoples of the world in their personal, professional and public lives, at all levels, and in all sectors, of society. &#xa0;2. There are many barriers to galvanising the appropriate and necessary actions. Key steps are to convince both a critical mass of individuals with influence, and the general public, to recognise the priority and urgency of the issue, and to motivate them to not only act within their remit, but to establish the framework and vision within which massive devolved action can take place. &#xa0;3. While a majority of the general public broadly accept that climate change is occurring, and that human activity plays at least some role in this, the severity of the threat and the urgency of individual and collective action, as well as exactly what we need to do, is not widely appreciated. Neither is the extent to which individual and collective action is needed to prevent serious climate disruption. &#xa0;4. Increasing public scepticism about climate change, as well as diminishing concern about its effects - as noted in the Select Committee’s Terms of Reference - have been well documented in public opinion research, both in the UK and internationally. However, recent survey data indicate that these beliefs and attitudes may have stabilised (e.g. Shuckburgh et al, 2012; Leiserowitz et al., 2012). &#xa0;5. Many reasons have been put forward to help account for the period of increasing scepticism, and scepticism about the issue more generally. These include the technical nature of the evidence, a high degree of disconnection between people’s daily lives and the problem (“not me, not now”), issue-fatigue, the impact of the global financial crisis, distrust – especially following “ClimateGate”, “false balance” in the coverage by the media, and the deepening politicisation of the issue (see Pidgeon, 2012 for a review).&#xa0;6. While surveys of representative samples of influential figures and groups are not available, observation of their rhetoric and actions strongly suggests that, in general, these have no greater understanding of the urgent need for action than the public, and possibly less. &#xa0;7. There is copious evidence for a well-funded, well-organised and resolute campaign by vested interests to undermine the credibility of climate science and climate scientists, and to sow doubt and confusion about the subject, with a view to delaying or preventing action to address it (see Oreskes and Conway, 2010 for example). &#xa0;8. Scientists are generally unfamiliar with mischievous challenges, or forms of attack operating outside academic rules of engagement, and they are ill-equipped to deal with them.&#xa0;&#xa0;9. We are delighted with the Select Committee’s enquiry. At University College London (UCL) we have recently established a policy commission on the communication of climate science, which we explain more about below. The commission is Chaired by Professor Chris Rapley CBE, who has developed satellite instrument techniques to study the Earth, and has directed the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, the British Antarctic Survey, and the Science Museum. His focus of interest at UCL is the communication of climate science and the psychology of climate change dismissal. The membership of the commission draws on a wide range of expertise from the psychosocial and behavioural sciences, both within and without UCL. The commission is keen to work with the committee to advance our overlapping interests.&#xa0;10. The Committee’s Terms of Reference focus on indications of increasing UK public scepticism about climate change as well as diminishing concern about its effects, and a consequent risk that, should these trends continue, “democratic governments are likely to find it harder to convince voters to support costly environmental policies aimed at mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate change”. Specific questions raised include issues of public understanding of climate change, trust, the role of government departments, government scientific advisors, publicly funded scientists and the media as communicators of climate science, and the link between public understanding and the development of effective climate and energy policy.&#xa0;11. These are important areas of inquiry. However, they betray some assumptions that merit further consideration. &#xa0;12. Firstly, there is no single “public” to consider when it comes to climate-related policy. Although the views of the general public can be important, especially during policy implementation (for example during the planning process), the views and conversations of influential individuals and “elites” in business, politics, the media and in major public sector organisations such as the health service, security services and local government, can be critically important during policy formulation. Little information is available as to the understanding and views of these groups, nor of their trends, and it would be helpful if this were rectified.&#xa0;13. Secondly, more than two decades of social and behavioural science investigating science-society relations tell us that a ‘deficit model’ of communication, in which experts treat non-experts as “empty vessels” to be filled with facts, is flawed. Where the assumption was once that indifference or scepticism result from a lack of knowledge and understanding, it is now appreciated that the one-way delivery of information does not in itself solve the problem. Ex cathedra statements from scientists are rarely sufficient to persuade or compel particular viewpoints or actions. &#xa0;14. Even the use of traditional debate can be unhelpful, since the objective is combative - to win the argument - not to move the discussion forward. The “rules of engagement “ can differ markedly between proponents constrained to an academic approach of impartiality and truth-seeking, and those adopting the tactics of political barnstorming and rhetoric, placing the scientists at a disadvantage. &#xa0;15. Dialogue is more effective, since it is collaborative, assumes that all participants have something to offer, seeks to find common ground, explores assumptions, aims to discover new possibilities, and - above all - recognises and accommodates the reflexive nature of communication.&#xa0;16. The use of dialogue is especially pertinent in the case of climate change since the “unwelcome messages” of climate science have the capacity to arouse emotions of anxiety, fear, guilt, loss, interdependency, and helplessness. The insights of the cognitive and behavioural sciences show that these can drive reactions of dismissal (using intellect and knowledge to justify this), disavowal (the simultaneous belief of two contradictory facts), or discounting (in which the facts are accepted but arguments are used to justify a low level of attention or action). Anger towards the messenger is a common consequence.  &#xa0;17. In such circumstances, narratives that “make one self feel better” are attractive to the listener. These may focus on undermining the science (temperatures have flat-lined / carbon dioxide is plant food / it’s the Sun), or the scientist (incompetent / dishonest / seeking funding and influence; perpetrating a conspiracy / hoax), or authorities and governments (it’s a way to control you / it’s a way of raising taxes). Ideas such as these offer the means to ease emotional stress, to undermine belief in the need for action, and facilitate the task of those who would maintain the status quo. Unless the approach to public understanding takes account of these emotional stresses, it is likely to fail. &#xa0;18. In addition, reactions to information and the position adopted on a topic are influenced by personal disposition, cultural values, and pre-existing world-views, narratives and beliefs. &#xa0;19. An understanding of the mental processes by which people use narratives to make sense of the world and deal with the feelings generated is thus central to “effective” engagement with the subject. A substantial body of knowledge exists on these topics. We provide a bibliography of selected references at the end of this document.&#xa0;20. Currently there are four central approaches to climate change engagement; behavioural, socio-cultural, psychosocial and social innovation (resilience and systems theories). Each provides a lens and makes valuable contributions to how we understand and implement effective practices. Our view is that an integral approach, combining the power all four lenses, would achieve greater impact.  With this in mind, psychosocial researchers, recognizing the inseparability of psychological, affective and social dimensions, are beginning to interface with climate researchers in new ways (i.e. UCL Energy Institute Workshop, Psychosocial Dimensions of Climate Change, convened November 2012), illuminating how understanding affect can inform effective communications. &#xa0;21. Digital technology offers new research opportunities to understand how narratives form, spread through networks, change and sometimes co-ordinate to create a prevailing climate.&#xa0;22. It is our experience that awareness and knowledge of these important results from the social and behavioural sciences are uncommon amongst natural scientists. Yet they constitute the main body of climate expertise, and are the primary means by which the climate science narrative is conveyed. A central hypothesis of the UCL policy commission, to be tested by experiment, is that a deeper awareness and understanding of how the human brain makes sense of the world would assist both climate scientist communicator and their audience to achieve a more fruitful exchange of knowledge and ideas.&#xa0;23. There are a wide range of people and groups who can offer relevant experience, insights and knowledge in the art of effective communication, including marketeers, journalists and programme makers, and the arts, music, and theatre communities. By partnering with these, climate science experts can attract and engage an audience with scientifically rigorous and defensible material in ways that can disarm unhelpful psychological and cultural defences. &#xa0;24. An example is the Science Museum’s “atmosphere” climate science gallery. This provides an immersive, yet rigorous learning experience, designed to engage, inform and allow people to make up their own minds. It has been highly successful, having been visited by over 1.7 million people, with much positive visitor feedback. The associated “climate changing” series of events allows the more controversial aspects of the subject to be explored, including “dialogue events” in which non-experts and experts discuss issues constructively together.&#xa0;25.  Thirdly, the profound policy implications of climate change mean that public discussion often constitutes policy debate masquerading as science.  Under such circumstances, science is used as a weapon to promote the interests of a particular agenda. This confusion between the science and the politics bedevils the public dialogue. Scientists’ understanding of the public and policy is as important as the public and policymakers’ understanding of the science, and all too often both are lacking. &#xa0;26. This raises the question of the role of climate scientists. Pielke (2007) identifies four idealised roles – namely (i) pure scientist (pushing forward the frontier of knowledge and understanding to the highest professional standards of competence and behaviour), (ii) science arbiter (explaining the meaning of facts and evidence, since these can often be interpreted in many ways), (iii) issue advocate (alerting society to issues and their implications – such as risks and threats) , and (iv) honest broker of policy alternatives (in which the scientist works with other experts to map out and evaluate options for action and recommend which may be most appropriate). He warns against the danger of “stealth advocacy” in which the science is inadvertently or deliberately expressed in a manner which narrows the policy debate. It is important for a scientist to understand and make clear the role they are adopting in any given circumstance.&#xa0;27. Finally, increased awareness and understanding alone are insufficient to achieve action. Michie et al (2011) have sought to develop a rigorous and comprehensive methodology to underpin the design of effective behaviour change interventions. Their “Behavioural Change Wheel” identifies capability, opportunity and motivation, and subdivisions within each, as essential factors in achieving targeted results. Climate awareness can be especially challenging, since the nature of the desired behaviours are often knowable only through detailed analysis by those directly involved, and are not amenable to top down instruction. The objective therefore is to promote and incentivise an overall behavioural culture in which specific behavioural changes are identified and pursued. The nature of climate change mitigation or adaptation is that to be effective they require myriad interventions by people at all levels and within all sectors of society, worldwide. We are confronted with the ultimate collective action challenge.&#xa0;28. In light of the above, our response to the question “Does the Government have sufficient expertise in the social and behavioural sciences to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policies?” is “almost certainly not!” To which we would add our opinion that further research and the communication of results in this area is at least as important as continued work in investigating the workings, state and likely future trajectory of the climate system, notwithstanding the importance of the latter to underpinning well-judged practical interventions to mitigate, adapt to and remediate climate disruption.&#xa0;29.This forms the basis of the approach we have adopted with the UCL policy commission on climate science communication, where we are focussing firmly on the insights available from the social and behavioural sciences. The mission of the initiative is “To explore and recommend how climate scientists can more effectively communicate with policy-makers, businesses and the public”. Specific issue being investigated are (i) the role of climate scientists in contributing to public and policy discourse and decision making on climate change, (ii) the insights that social and behavioural scientific research and professional practice provide into how people process and assimilate information and how such knowledge offers pathways to achieve more effective engagement and action, and (iii) the approaches climate scientists can adopt to more effectively execute their roles. The main output of the policy commission will be a short final report which will seek to provide an analysis of practical value to climate scientists, communicators and policy makers alike. The commission may also produce short policy notes on specific aspects of their discussions. The timescale for completing the commission’s work is the autumn of 2013.&#xa0;30. In closing we offer the following observations: &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changing human behaviour requires that people know what to do and how to do it. It also requires the necessary skills and the opportunity. Finally, it requires a sufficient desire or need. One factor contributing to this is understanding why the behaviour is important, but other factors matter too. So that the behaviour becomes ‘the norm’. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changing the behaviour of influential elites and the general public will require interventions on all these fronts. Improving public understanding is important, but it is only one small part.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Climate scientists need to do more than repeat their messages and complain that they are not being heeded. To play a fuller role in shaping the future they need to work with psychosocial and behavioural scientists to arrive at engagement strategies that go beyond the “information deficit” approach, to motivating and enabling those developments to occur.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst recognising the role and impact of the messenger, the audience, the process adopted to communicate climate science and so forth are important, opportunities exist to communicate the issue through other schemes, policies, and practices. The aim is to build a context around climate that is relevant to different audiences, different messengers and different political contexts. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK’s Green Deal policy is an example of a missed opportunity. The policy seeks to increase uptake of energy efficiency measures in UK homes to reduce carbon emissions and increase the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock. This is aligned with the government’s commitment to tackle climate change. Yet no mention of it exists in the communication and marketing of the policy to the numerous public’s involved (e.g. householders, Green Deal Assessors, Green Deal providers, energy companies). Aligning the aim of the Green Deal with how it links to global climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would help people “join the dots, make up their own minds, and lessen perceptions of a lack of government resolve and leadership.&#xa0;
