[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How will HCPC take account of the role of public health specialists, 
[normal]carrying responsibility at a strategic level for protecting and enhancing the public's health, in differentiating an existing approach based largely on the regulation of practitioners who work individually with clients?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c) When will HCPC commence consultation with UKPHR in particular and the wider public health community as a whole to address the many complex issues that will arise on a change of regulator?
