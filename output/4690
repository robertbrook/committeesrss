[normal]Undue pressure / intimidation of school leaders and governing bodies to convert[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The process of converting to an academy has placed a high demand on the energies of governors, the head
[normal] 
[normal]teacher and other senior leaders and it has distracted them from focusing on improving
[normal] the quality of teaching and learning.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another significant barrier to improvement has been the amount of time the headteacher has been involved 
[normal]in the discussions about transferring to an academy. Given the headteacher has been without a deputy headteacher or any senior leader for most of the autumn term her time has been too stretched. Lengthy and time-consuming meetings with parents, unions, sta
[normal]ff and external agencies have taken leaders’ and governors’ focus away from school improvement and building capacit
[normal]y to improve within the school.
