"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Unlock Democracy* (Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) (FDC 35)&#xa0;\nUnlock Democracy\n* \n(Merseyside &amp; West Cheshire) welcomes any movement towards more open and accountable strategic political leadership for the \nproposed Liverpool City Region (LCR). Our City Region is emerging as an economic, social and cultural entity, a political reality. But we contend that its governance structures have failed to keep pace. We agree that the current arrangements are weak and lack tran\nsparency. Reform is to be welcomed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the DCLG consultation document on the proposed LCR\n,\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultati\nons/proposal-to-establish-a-combined-authority-for-greater-merseyside\nwe contend that\n \nthe arrangements for scrutiny are too vague. In the Annex paragraph 24 (Scrutiny Arrangements) it states that the Combined Authority \nmay establish joint overview and s\ncrutiny arrangements. Further in the Draft Statutory Instrument: \nCommittees 4- (1) The Combined Authority \nmay appoint one or more committees as an overview and scrutiny committee\n…\n We propose that the wording be amended to \nshall appoint. \n&#xa0;\nIn \nthe LCRCA docu\nment \"\nOutline of the potential role of a LCRCA\", the \nproposed \nScrutiny Arrangements paragraph 9\n&#xa0;\nare at the top of page 15. Please see below in bold a link to the document\n “Proposal for the organisation of Scrutiny\". The DCLG received this document when the\n six authorities in the LCRCA submitted their proposal\n.\n We regard this to be a very good \nfour page \ndocument, on the second page of which we draw your attention to paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 \n“Structures and Processes of Scrutiny at the City Region Level”. \nProposal for the organisation of ScrutinyThe composition of the scrutiny panel, however, could be overwhelmingly dominated by one political party. W\ne are ke\nen, therefore, to see that the scrutiny structure for the proposed \"City Region Cabinet\" includes \na specific guarantee of representation for opposition voices.\n \nThis safeguard is especially important when, as is the case at the moment, the political leaders\n of the six authorities (the LCR Cabinet members) might be drawn from the same political party. In this regard, \non the third page of the document \n“Proposal for the organisation of Scrutiny\", there is sub paragraph 3.2 (ii) \n\"Cross Party&#xa0;Representation\", whi\nch addresses this issue of \nrepresentation for opposition voices.\n&#xa0;\nO\nur vision is one of a more democratic Local Governance model, with the necessary provision of checks and balances, scrutiny and transparency. That is\n:\n a Liverpool City Regional Mayor, with\n a system of representation similar to that implemented in London, i.e. the existing six Local Councils, a Liverpool City Regional Assembly \n(\nsimilar to that of\n&#xa0;\nthe Merseyside County Council, which was abolished in 1986\n)\n, all of these would preferably be el\nected with a proportional electoral system, as adopted in Scottish Local Government.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe group would be pleased to respond to any questions and would welcome any opportunity to elaborate on these points.\n&#xa0;\nOn behalf of the Merseyside and West Cheshire Un\nlock Democracy Group*,\n&#xa0;\nGeoffrey Woodcock (Chair)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n*\nAbout us:-\n Unlock Democracy, of which we are a local group, is a national organisation which campaigns on voting and constitutional reform.
