"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mr Gary PowellFurther submission to the CLG Committee in respect of its inquiry into the work of the Local Government Ombudsman.This submission is a response to the following request from the Clerk of the Communities and Local Government Committee, received on 6 \nNovember 2013:\n“\nThank you for your submission in response to the Committee’s further inquiry into the work of the Local Government Ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\n The Committee has considered it and have asked me to write to you.\n&#xa0;\n You make a number of assertions about the Ext\nernal Review of the LGO carried out last year by Richard Thomas CBE, Jim Martin and Dr Kirkham of Sheffield University, specifically that it lacked independence and objectivity and was an “adulatory whitewash”. Furthermore, you make allegations that the pr\nocess was dominated by Dr Kirkham, whom you describe as a “propagandist” for the LGO. These are serious allegations which from the contents of your submission and from the 2005 article you cite do not appear to be supported by detailed evidence. Before dec\niding what action to take in respect of your submission, the Committee would be grateful for a further submission setting out in detail your evidence to \nsubstantiate these contentions.”\nThe fact that the Committee has writte\nn to me stating\n that they \nbeliev\ne \nmy accusations of an External R\neview whitewash and of Dr Kirkham being a pro-LGO propagandist “\ndo not appear to be supported by detailed evidence” \nin my submission\n, is a matter of some surprise:\n both to me, and to my successor as Director of Local Govern\nment Ombudsman Watch. In both 2005 and 2012, both the current Director and I sent the \nCLG \nCommittee, and its predecessor, submissions in which we accused the LGO of being a biased and dishonest organisation that deliberately deceived the public and manipul\nated statistics. Neither the current Director nor I received any request from the Committee in response to those submissions claiming that our assertions were not “supported by detailed evidence” and requesting further submi\nssions setting out in detail fur\nther\n evidence to substantiate our contentions. \nThe contentions we made in the 2005 and 2012 submissions about LGO bias, dishonesty and general maladministration were surely no less “\nserious allegations” \nthan my accusation that the External R\neview has been\n an “adulatory whitewash” and that Dr Kirkham is a “propagandist” for the LGO\n,\n yet, as I have said, I was not asked for any further submission to set out in detail my allegations then. I therefore wonder what is so different in this case. Perhaps it was th\ne case that the Committee felt that the allegations I made in my 2005 and 2012 submissions were already well substantiated by the evidence I had provided. However, if this is the case, then one must ask why the Committee did not take the accusations seriou\nsly and has all but ignored the evidence provided by LGO Watch over the course of \nalmost \na decade: in particular, \nevidence of \nthe manipulation by the LGO of the Ipsos-MORI Customer Satisfaction Survey data, and the fact that the survey results were still d\namning of the LGO even after the manipulation had taken place. \nThe submission I have recently submitted is the first one in which I have expressed criticism of the Committee itself; and I remain convinced that the Committee shares \nresponsibility for the w\nay the LGO has been allowed to betray the good citizens of this country with impunity, supported by taxpayer\n funding. The Committee remains\n the only institution that could properly call the LGO to account, and its inaction and unwillingness to \ntreat with \nproper \nrespect \nand seriousness \nthe compelling evidence presented to it by concerned citizens \nstruggling to make their discoveries and experiences heard, \nhas been lamentable. \nIt is not the job of private citizens to do the work of the CLG Committee: the co\nre members of LGO Watch have already spent a colossal amount of time and energy on gathering evidence and \non \ntrying to encourage politicians to listen to it and penetrate the carapace of political indifference and collusion; and we do not have a fraction o\nf the time or resources available to either the LGO or the Committee.\nIn my \nprevious submission, there is sufficient\n \nprima facie\n evidence that the External Review was a whitewash and that Dr Kirkham’s enthusiasm for the LGO, and his damage-limitation inter\nvention following the aborted 2005 evidence session, marked him out as an individual whose colours as a sympathiser with the LGO as it currently exists\n,\n were firmly nailed to the mast, and who was therefore a totally inappropriate person to have been selec\nt\ned to carry out an independent External R\neview of the LGO. The Committee is in a position to investigate the quality and extent of Dr Kirkham’s historical relationship with the LGO, and whether\n he was likely to approach the R\neview from a neutral and objec\ntive perspective. All I can do is point to the evidence in his 2005 \npublication – including both what he said, and what he did not say -\n \nand just as import\nantly, point to the context of \nhis publication. If the Committee is minded to ignore \nprima facie\n evid\nence provided by a private citiz\nen who does not share\n its \nextensive \nresources to investigate, then there is little more I can do. \nA Committee that is genuinely concerned\n that\n an external review of the LGO be truly independent should surely be at \nleast a l\nittle concerned that the very\n individual whose contributions clearly dominated the Review [\"Richard Kirkham undertook the bulk of the research and drafting of this Report for which his colleagues are most grateful.\" (p4)] is the only \nnon-LGO employee\n on th\ne LGO \nWatch website with his own page:\nhttp://ombudsmanwatchers.org.uk/articles/friends_of_the_lgo.html Dr Kirkham’s page \nis \nentitled, \n“Friends\n of the LGO: Dr Richard Kirkham\n,” and\n \nit\n was set up in 2009, therefore long before he was commissioned by the LGO to conduct the External Review. Not only this, but I have discovered there is also a whole page \non the Local Government Ombudsman Discussion Forum \n(no connection with LGO Wa\ntch) \nhttp://www.amv3.com/forum/index.php\n \ndedicated to Dr Kirkham, with posts dating from 2007, (searchable under “Kirkham”). This is \nclear \nevidence that Dr Kirkham has been considered for several years by\n LGO Watch supporters \nand other critics of the LGO \nto be a pro-LGO propagandist who, for reasons best known to himself, chooses to disregard and dismiss evidence of LGO bias presented by real complainants, and to present the LGO to the public, as an appare\nntly impartial academic, in a way that \ndoes an injustice both to\n the facts \nreadily \nat his disposal\n, and to the potential to gather facts from real complainants\n. He has been regarded as a pro-LGO propagandist by LGO Watch activists since he came to our attention in \n2005 on the publication of his article, \n“A Complainant's View of the \nLocal Government Ombudsman,”\n published in the “Journal of Social Welfare and Fami\nly Law,” Volume 27, Issue 3-4, pp. 383-394, in December 2005.\nDr Kirkham’s article was published \nsubsequent to\n the ODPM Committee Evidence Session where, for the first time in the history of the LGO, the institution was facing ques\ntions as to its impartial\nity,\n honesty\n and efficacy\n. LGO Watch had been set up in 2003, and we provided detailed evidence \nto the Committee \nof how complainants to the LGO were being treated unfairly, and of how the LGO was manipulating its Customer Satisfaction Surveys\n, whose result\ns were still nonetheless \nquite damning of the LGO, even after they had been manipulated. On the morning of the Se\nlect Committee evidence session on \n15 March 2005,\n \nJad Adams\n’s\n \n“\nThunderer\n”\n column\n was published in the Times,\n criticising the LGO \nhttp://thetim.es/RfRqGd\n. The LGO hit back with a PR campaign, and on 26 April 2005, a sympathetic interview with the Ombudsman was published in the Times \nhttp://thetim.es/Re3Xya\n. \nThen came Dr Kirkham’s article in December, which \nto the astonishment of LGO Watch, \nbore the title\n, “A Complainant’s View of the Local Government Ombu\ndsman.\n” \nWe were astonished because\n Dr Kirkham gave absolutely no indication in his article that he had eve\nr been a complainant to the LGO, and absolutely no indication that he had even spoken to any complainants to the LGO in order to find out their perspective. \nThe title of his article bore the\n clear\n hallmarks of \nbelonging to \nthe LGO’s 2005 damage limitation\n exercise: it was complainants who had provided the evidence to the Committee of LGO maladministration and dishonesty, and now Dr Kirkham had published a sympathetic article on the LGO in which he claimed to represent the perspective of complainants, when \nin fact \nhe was not one, when he casually dismissed the evidence provided by real complainants to the Committee, and when he did not make any effort to contact any real complainants at LGO Watch to ask for our perspective for the purposes of researching his\n article. His contribution was one that clearly fell far below acceptable standards of academic objectivity. Not only that, but where in his article Dr Kirkham did refer to evidence that we as complainants had provided to the Committee, \nthat was \npublished \nin the ODPM Committee’s report, he did so selectively, completely ignoring the detailed analysis of and commentary on the MORI Customer Satisfaction Survey that we had provided to the Committee. Surely any academic claiming to write an objective article fr\nom the perspective of a complainant should have taken a close interest in the very instrument that had provided evidence of \ncomplainants’ views: \nthe MORI Customer Satisfaction S\nurvey, and the analysis of it provided in the LGO Watch submission. Instead, th\nis is glossed over, and Dr Kirkham dismisses the accusations made by real complainants to the Committee by making various unfounded blanket assumptions about them in time-honoured straw man par\nadigm fashion, which I shall explore below\n. \nIn Dr Kirkham’s 20\n05 article, he makes reference to the \nevidence from\n dissatisfied complainants \npublished \nby the ODPM Committee following the 2005 Evidence Session on the Role and Effectiveness of the LGO. He is clearly aware of the \nevidence presented by LGO Watch and our \nsupporters of LGO bias and maladministration\n, and refers to my submission in his\n ar\nticle, so it is a reasonable assumption that he read it.\n It was a requirement that those submitting evidence \nto the Committee \ndid not focus on the \ncontent and detail\n of thei\nr individual complaints, and that they instead presented a wider, more general picture of \nsystemic and procedural\n concerns. Several LGO Watch supporters had their submissions rejected because they did not meet this requirement. The LGO Watch submission was\n focused on evidence that the LGO was biased in favour of local authorities, and that its MORI Customer Satisfaction Survey indicated an alarmingly high rate of customer dissatisfaction with the LGO’s service that was even shared by 50% of those \nwhose comp\nlaints were successfully upheld by the LGO. The LGO Watch submission also focused on strong evidence that the LGO had manipulated the process of the Survey, whose outcome would have been even more damning of the LGO if this manipulation had not taken place\n. \nDr Kirkham decided to make no reference to this crucial evidence in the LGO Watch submission, despite there being a strong case to answer. Not only this, but in his 2005 article, he says:\n“There has never been any serious allegation that the LGO act in \nany other way but according to the highest standards of public conduct.”\n (ibid\n.\n, p 388).\nThis is surely an extraordinary thing to say. In this one sentence, Dr Kirkham dismisses the detailed evidence provided to the Committee of LGO bad practice as not bei\nng “serious”. So not only does he not bother to hear the views of real complainants – intelligent private citizens who had gone to great lengths to provide objective evidence, and who, unlike Dr Kirkham, were real complainants to the LGO – but he \nalso \nchoo\nses to dismiss our experience and our evidence out of hand in this cavalier manner\n as not being worthy of serious consideration\n. \nFurthermore, Dr Kirkham’s pivotal role in the research and drafting of the External Review should be considered very carefully\n in t\nhe light of this statement. He wa\ns sup\nposed to be an independent R\neviewer, looking into serious claims of systemic maladministration, bad practice and pro-council bias at the LGO. The work and evidence of LGO Watch, published after both the 2005 and t\nhe 2012 inquiries, has been instrumental in bringing about a more critical attitude towards the LGO on the part \nof the public and the Committee;\n and indeed, the evidence and material provided in the LGO Watch submission to the 2005 in\nquiry formed the basis\n of several of the questions asked \nduring the evidence session. \nThe evidence provided by LGO Watch – both via myself and the current Director – has not changed since 2005, albeit that new evidence has been added. This evidence was clearly rejected out-of-\nhand by Dr Kirkham before his started his External Review, as is \nso apparent from\n the above quotation from his 2005 article. In fact, it is astonishing that \nanyone who has publicly stated \n“There has never been any \nserious allegation that the LGO act in any\n other way but according to the highest standards of public conduct”\n should in any way be regarded as non-partisan enough to be charged with the tas\nk of conducting an independent External R\neview of the LGO. It is clear from this quotation alone that he was\n very sympathetically inclined towards the LGO \nlong \nbefore he was appointed as an External Reviewer. \nAt the beginning of his article, Dr Kirkham refers to the 2005 submissions to the ODMP Committee, and says, \n“In amongst these submissions, there were eve\nn proposals for the abolition of the LGO [...] To a certain extent, such criticisms misunderstand the purpose of public sector redress mechanisms and the remit of the Ombudsmen.” \nThis is the standard straw man a\nrgument. I was the only person\n calling for t\nhe abolition of the LGO as an alternative to radical reform\n in the 2005 \nODPM Committee \nReport\n on the LGO\n. I was not, and am not, someone who misunderstands the purpose of public sector redress mechanisms or the remit of the Ombudsman. When I was Director o\nf LGO Watch, I told many people who contacted \nme, and I told them \ntime and time again\n,\n that the LGO could only investigate complaints that fell within his jurisdiction, and that even then, he could only investigate complaints where there was \nprima facie\n ev\nidence of maladministration combined with evidence that not only\n had\n injustice been suffered, but \nsignificant \ninjustice. I was also fully aware that there was the restriction of time limits, of the local authority complaints procedure having to have been e\nxhausted, and of the necessity of no parallel legal action taking place \nin order \nfor a complaint to be considered\n by the LGO\n. There were some complainants who found these facts difficult to accept, or difficult to grasp, but I was \ncertainly \nnot one of them\n, and nei\nther was the current LGO Watch D\nirector. \nNowhere in my submissions or campaigning have I ever expected the LGO to act outside his legal jurisdiction, or \nrelax his criterion of\n requiring\n \nprima facie\n evidence of maladministration with significant injustice. In fact, these are criteria and restrictions that I fully support, not least for pragmatic reasons. When I was Director of LGO Watch, I was infinitely more concerned about grave injustices that aff\nected very vulnerable people\n and their families\n, that could actually hav\ne brought about the loss of their lives or their mental health\n, than about any other issues that compl\nainants were taking to the LGO; \nand these were the people I could not bear to sit \nback and see the LGO betraying. \nDr Kirkham was clearly referring \nin the above quotation \nto my own submission, as he \nmakes reference to “EV 26” after making his point\n. Yet nowhere in my submission is there the slightest shred of evidence that I \n“[misunders\ntood] the purpose of public sector redress mechanisms or the remit of the Ombudsman.”\n In fact, I gave very clear and detailed evidence that this\n was not the case. \nDr Kirkham\n’s approach was to\n refer to my statement\n about LGO abolition, and then to create\n a \nstraw man to attack, dismissing views that are very far from my own, and not giving me the courtesy of honouring and giving proper expression in his article to the real reason \nwhy I was suggesting abolition. This is surely not the kind of attitude that ins\npires confi\ndence in him as an independent and objective R\neviewer of the LGO.\nOn page 384, Dr Kirkham’s article continues with an exploration of the LGO’s need to make the public aware of \nthe LGO\n service. As he believes that the LGO behaves with such a high\n degree of probity, and dismisses the counterevidence as not being “serious”, he clearly does not appreciate the irony of how counterproductive it is to \nencourage\n more people \nto \nuse a service that is systemically biased against them. \nOn page 386, Dr Kirkh\nam explores the limitations of the LGO’s remit, including the point that the LGO is not allowed to look at the merits of a decision of a local authority taken \n“in the exercise of a discretion vested in that authority.”\n This again has always been something \nof which I \nand \nother senior members of LGO Watch have been very much aware, and \nthat we have never\n wanted to contest. Yet instead of exploring\n what our arguments actually were\n, and what merits those arguments \nmight \nhave, Dr Kirkham again decides to produce\n another straw man to attack:\n“Judging from many of the consumer complaints made to the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the failure of the LGO to review the merits of a local authority decision probably lies at the heart of muc\nh of the dissatisfaction that some members of the public experience with the LGO.”\nThe irrelevance continues on page 386, where Dr Kirkham writes about the disappointment of those whose complaints are not investigated by the LGO because they fall outside h\nis jurisdiction, or for other reasons to w\nhich I have referred above. What he presents as complainants’ objections\n bear no relevance to the arguments made by the current and previous Directors of LGO Watch in our 2005 and 2012 submissions: arguments that D\nr Kirkham ignores in favour of attacking arguments we did not and would not make. On page 387, Dr Kirkham writes about how important it is for the LGO to maintain an “\naura of independence\n”, and goes on to consider the option of judicial review.\nOn page 388 Dr Kirkham states that \n“[...] the public should be entitled to expect the highest standards of conduct and impartiality from the Ombudsman. Hence, it is a worry that in some quarters there is a perception that the LGO is too familiar with loca\nl authorities (Select Committee on the ODPM, 2004-2005, Ev 16-28). This perception has mostly been derived from the fact that two out of three present LGOs were Chief Executives of local authorities before moving to their present post (Local Government Omb\nudsman, 2005).” \nBut Dr Kirkham’s assertion is \nflawed, and posits a cause that is in fact an effect. It \nwas LGO Watch that claimed the O\nmbudsmen were too close to local authorities, but we did not derive this perception from the fact that the Ombudsmen wer\ne ex-council CEOs. We derived the perception that the Ombudsmen were too close to local authorities from the fact that we had observed so much pro-council bias, not \nonly in our own personal experienc\ne of complaining to them, but also in\n the evidence availa\nble in their annual reports, in the detail relating to their published Customer Satisfaction Surveys, and in the ongoing dishonesty and subterfuge we witnessed from their office as we conducted the \nongoing \nLGO Watch campaign. This was what caused the perce\nption that the Ombudsmen were biased in favour of local authorities. The fact that, in 2005, two of the Ombudsmen were ex-local a\nuthority CEOs merely provided a reasonable\n explanation as to why we were seeing such pro-council bias. \nIf Dr Kirkham had bother\ned to speak to us, we would have been very happy to explain this to him. \nOn page 389, Dr Kirkham writes about “silencing” critics of the LGO: \n“Improving the openness and transparency of the work of the LGO through regular public scrutiny would probably g\no a long way towards silencing critics of the post.” \nIt is \nperhaps revealing\n that Dr Kirkham has chosen to use the \nphrase\n “silencing critics” here\n,\n instead of an alternative such as “reassuring cri\ntics”. For an articulate writer who chooses his words so \ncarefully\n in the rest of his article, his clear wish to “silence” critics of the LGO rather than \nto \nsatisfy and reassure us\n, inadvertently \nreveals\n his priority and his solidarity with the priorities\n of the then beleaguered LGO. Suggesting we should be “sil\nenced”\n certainly\n does nothing to reassure me\n as to his impartiality when, \nfor the first time in its history, thanks to the Internet, the critics of the LGO had found a forum and a voice to challenge its institutional injustice. \nA voice Dr Kirkham wanted to\n “silence”.\nOn page 390, he writes about delays during LGO investigations:\n“Such delays have even opened up the LGO to allegations of maladministration!” \n“The ombudsman's 2011 Strategic Review, which it avoided publishing, suggested the bottom 20% of performers among the team handled some 10% cases. Some corporate functions within the ombudsman boasted staffing levels that were d\nifficult to justify and that a significant proportion of operational support existed only to provide basic administrative and office services.\nWe heard of cases sitting in the commissioner's office for 12 months. A body responsible for examining \nmaladministration was now being accused of maladministration because of its lethargic and cumbersome approach. The ombudsman's response wasn't encouraging. It was sketchy about plans for transformation and appeared to learn little from good\n practice\n in Sco\ntland and Ireland.\nThere is no doubt the ombudsman needs to dramatically improve, and though it must retain its independence the Department for Communities and Local Government and parliament itself must push for that change.”\nOn page 391, Dr Kirkham write\ns about the merits of local settlements, but omits to explore the effect on complainants of having a “local settlement” effectively imposed on them by the LGO should a local\n authority agree to it, but the complainant\n regard the remedy as inadequate: someth\ning that actually violates the definition of the word “settlement”, which normally implies agreement – perhaps with some compromise - by both or all parties concerned. Of course, in the case of complainants, the alternative to rejecting a “local settlement\n” proposed by the LGO is to have the investigation terminated and to get nothing at all. \nFor somebody who purports to be representing “A Complainant’s View” in his article, Dr Kirkham certainly doesn’t give the genuine and legitimate concerns \nof real compl\nainants \nmuch of a look\n-in. Instead, the straw men complaints predominate,\n which are far easier to defend against.\nDr Kirkham makes another controversial statement on page 392:\n“[...] the LGO are there to perform a number of roles and, of those roles, publi\ncly calling local authorities to account is one of the least important.” \nI am not convinced that the taxpayers who fund the LGO would have much sympathy for Dr Kirkham’s position on this matter. Surely one of the greatest checks and balances\n on the behavi\nour of a public authority, or of any person in public life, is the possibility of being publicly called to account. This is surely the essence of “accountability”. Admittedly, the priority of the LGO should be to provide a remedy for a complainant who has \nsuffered maladministration with significant injustice and harm at the hands of his local authority. But to suggest that calling local authorities to account for maladministration should be “\none of the least important roles”\n of the LGO is far too close for \ncomfort to a justification of what so many complainants\n have perceived to be one of the greatest concerns of the LGO: to prevent the public becoming aware of the extent and seriousness of maladministration committed by his colleagues in local authorities.\nFor the reasons I have set out above, I stand by my assertion that Dr Kirkham\n, who makes his living by writing about \nOmbudsme\nn, and who I do not believe the LGO w\nould have selected for\n the Review team if they had not been confident of his affinity,\n is a pr\nopagandist for the Local Government Ombudsman, and that\n the so-called External Review \nis a whitewash. \nThis is a long submission, and for reasons of time, I have concentrated on Dr Kirkham’s 2005 article rather than on the External Review Report itself. I \nwould expect a conscientious Committee to regard the detail that I have provided above as\n \nat the very least\n \nprima facie\n evidence of bias on the part of this particular External Reviewer, and to initiate its own investigation as a result. An unpaid private \ncitizen with a full-time job and family commitments should not be expected to do the job of the CLG Committee. On those occasions in the past when I have submitted evidence to the Committee and its predecessor of systemic LGO maladministration\n, it has rece\nived lip-service at best\n, and I am not at all confident\n that anything will change now in that respect.\nThe point must be made that inviting the LGO to commission its own “independent” External Review, especially as one \nof \nthe issues under investigation was\n to be the LGO’s fairne\nss, objectivity and probity, does\n not inspire confide\nnce that the Committee was \nserious about a genuine independent External Review taking place. I can see no reason why the CLG Committee should not \nhave appointed its own team of R\nev\niewers. The same applies to the Customer Satisfaction Survey that the LGO is expected to commission\n for itself\n. On the basis of how previous surveys of this kind have been manipulated by the LGO, detailed in my 2005 and 2012 submissions, the fact that \nthe \nLGO could\n yet again\n have the opportunity to produce a more favourable \noutcome than it merits\n, is something that could easily have been avoided if the CLG Committee \nitself \nhad commissioned the survey and ensured the LGO had no opportunity to \ninfluence it un\nfairly. \n \nExamples abound of LGO dishonesty with regard to surveys about them. There is even one very recent \nexample\n that I discovered while reading through the LGO’\ns recent R\nesponse to the\n Staff Satisfaction Survey, which I compared \nto the\n actual R\neport \non the results of that S\nurvey that had been circulated internally\n at the LGO\n, and leaked to LGO Watch by a mem\nber of LGO staff. In amongst the \ndamage limitation attempt that was the \nLGO’s response \nto the damning Survey outcome,\n the \nLGO stated:\n \n“39% believ\ne we provide a great service to our customers but 34% are undecided.” \nThere was no mention of any staff member disagreeing with the statement that they provided a “great service” to their customers.\nThis surely gives the impression that no-one had said th\ney positively disagreed with the statement. But the way this data has been presented \nin the LGO’s response \ndistracts from the fact that 27% of staff \npositively disagreed\n with the statement that the LGO\n provided a great service to their customers, of \nwhom\n 7% \nstrongly\n disagreed with the statement, resulting in a total of 61% of staff \neither disagreeing with the statement, or feeling unable to \nagree with the statement\n with any degree of confidence\n. This can only have been deliberate\n misrepresentation of thei\nr staff’s opinions\n, and it is so typical of the spin-doctoring with which the LGO attempts to dupe\n both the public and\n those principled politicians who would not tolerate the behaviour of the LGO if they were fully aware of what is happening.\nAlthough time\n does not permit me to analyse the Ex\nternal Review in the same way that\n I have analysed Dr Kirkham’s article, I do hope that the Committee will compare the very positive report the External Reviewers have gifted to the LGO\n,\n with the damning indictment of t\nhe LGO provided by the LGO’s own staff in their Staff Satisfaction Survey that was sent to LGO Watch by a member of LGO staff, and that I have shared with the Committee. The two simply do not match up. \nAn independent External Review should have been carri\ned out by people who are completely independent from the body being reviewed. The LGO were founder members of the British and Irish Ombudsman A\nssociation (BIOA). \nDr Kirkham \ncertainly \nwas a member of the BIOA\n in the recent past\n, \nand may well still be now, \na\nlong with the LGO. (\nPlease c\nlick on\n the\n link bel\now and scroll to near bottom:\n “Member of British and Irish Ombudsman Association” \nhttp://www.shef.ac.uk/law/staff/academic/rkirkham\n \n.)\nAs far as I am concerned\n,\n a professional association \ntends to function\n \nas \na union that exists for the benefit and support of its members. Accordingly, I do not see how one member of an association can be considered to be truly independent from another\n member where the investigation of professional good practice is concerned.\nAs far as the other two members\n of the Re\nview \nTeam \nare concerned, \nMr Jim \nMartin\n, as the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman,\n was also criticised by Scottish Public Services Om\nbudsm\nan Watch in similar ways to which LGO Watch\n criticised the LGO. \nHow could he therefore seriously be considered someone who would be likely to review the LGO impartially? As the SPSO, Mr\n Martin \nwas also almost certainly a member of BIOS, and perhaps still i\ns. \nMr Richard \nThomas was the Information Commissioner at one time, which is essentially just another name for an ombudsman. Legally\n,\n the LGO are also commissi\noners, of course. I am sure that Mr Thomas is very \nlikely to have been a member of\n BIOA when he \nwas a commissioner\n, and may \nwell \nstill \nbe\n a member\n. More importantly\n,\n he was in 2009 elected as Chairman of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council. \nThis Council is loaded with members who are \nOmbudsmen and 'friendly' \nacademics\n, albeit not \nDr \nKirkham:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Justice_and_Tribunals_Council\nIn 2010 the G\novernment wanted to abolish the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council\nhttp://www.public\nations.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmjust/965/96504.htm\nbut it has only recently folded:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Justice_and_Tribunals_Council\nI\nf the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council \nhad been\n doing their job\n properly, a component\n of which was to keep under review administrative justice\n, then the LGO, the SPS\nO and \nthe Public Services Ombudsman for Wales would have been improved a long time ago. Furthermore, if they were doing a good job, why did the Government abolish them? \nSo why would the CLG Committee expect the ex-C\nhair\nperson\n of the Administrative Justice\n and Tribunals Council to do something \nnow that \nhe \nhad \nfailed to do wh\nen he was the C\nhair\nperson: that is, to e\nffectively review the performance \nof the LGO?\nHowever one decides to\n describe the \nprofessional \nrelati\nonship between the LGO and the R\neviewers\n, it\n appears to be a \nvery incestuous \none. The\n BIOA, \nthe AJ&amp;TC, Ombudsmen, LGO-friendly academics: all the usual parties\n keep cropping up\n. A far cry from what looks like independent \nexternal \nevaluation from where I’m sitting. \nThe Committee asked me to provide \nfurther, \ndetailed evidence of bias and whitewashing in the External Review. I have prov\nided a great deal of\n evidence above, but any amount of evidence can be rejected as an indication of bias, if the person evaluating the evidence is\n,\n \nfor any reason, simpl\ny \nunwilling to see \nthe bias\n. Although a\n \nlegitimate \njudgment \nof bias will be\n based on \nreasonable \nevidence, it is ultimately a subjective interpretation: and those people who have vested interests in not seeing bias will always be able to say that, in their \nopinion, no bias is in evidence, and\n they may be skilled in selecting\n the counter-evidence t\nhey adduce to justify their position.\nWhere the behaviour of the LGO is concerned, and the behaviour of those who defend and protect it, there are values at play th\nat are profoundly opposed to the kind of values that reflect the best of British society. The culture of selfishness, of dishonesty, and of protection of vested interests at the expense of the poor and vulnerable, is one that is alien to \nwhat is best in Br\nitish culture;\n and no matter how much those entrusted with the power to change this situation let us down, there will always be good, decent citizens in this country willing to expose and chal\nlenge institutional wrongdoing, as well as a media that from tim\ne to time \nsucceeds in ensuring that\n such \nwrongdoing is exposed\n,\n and that those responsible for and complicit in it\n,\n are eventually held to account. \nGary Powell\nNovember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
