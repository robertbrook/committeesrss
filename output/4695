[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from Oil and Gas UK (HCS0007)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Oil &amp; Gas UK is the trade association that speaks for the whole sector and is the definitive source of information about the UK upstream. It serves as the 
[normal]gateway to industry networks and expertise.
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Offshore helicopter operations are routinely conducted in a hostile marine environment, hence the need to ensure that high levels of flight safety are pre-requisite.
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]No other country in which the oil and gas indu
[normal]stry operates puts more effort into improving its aviation safety performance through leadership, communication and co-operation.
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK industry recognises the importance of joined-up working and engages the workforce and trade unions in offshore helicopt
[normal]er safety awareness through offshore safety committees and onshore networks.
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 1992, six fatal accidents have claimed the lives of 47 offshore workers and flight crew and there have been 18 non-fatal accidents.
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, to determine how safe offshore h
[normal]elicopter flights are requires an understanding of all facets of offshore helicopter flight operations and rotorcraft engineering.
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Comparisons between the safety performances of countries should be considered in relation to the measure of success in strivi
[normal]ng to meet the primary objective of ensuring that everything that can reasonably be done to minimise the risks is being done.
[normal]1.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many safety initiatives have been funded and implemented by the oil and gas industry over the past 35 years.
[normal]1.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This includes project
[normal]s jointly funded by oil and gas companies with the regulators (CAA and Health &amp; Safety Executive), helicopter operators and other involved organisations (e.g. National Air Traffic Service (NATS), aircraft and equipment manufacturers).
[normal]1.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Helicopter Task G
[normal]roup (HTG) and Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) are the other oil and gas industry groups dealing with helicopter operations but they serve different purposes. 
[normal]1.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since the early days in the North Sea there has been almost constant regulatory evolutio
[normal]n. The current legislative basis for UK aviation flight operations and airworthiness are well established, of a high level, and kept under constant scrutiny by CAA.
[normal]1.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the regulatory spread of EASA continues to grow and increase its influence over UK 
[normal]aviation operations and airworthiness, etc. the UK Government should ensure that CAA resources and regulatory focus is properly maintained in order to reinforce CAA’s ability to continue applying high standards in UK aviation safety.
[normal]1.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HSE regulate and has 
[normal]the oversight for helicopter activities on offshore installations. They do this in conjunction with CAA via a Memorandum of Understanding. HSE’s offshore inspectors effectively provide oversight of safety improvements to do with helideck operations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Oil &amp; Gas UK is the leading representative body for the UK offshore oil and gas industry. It is a not-for-profit organisation, established in April 2007 but with a pedigree stretching back over 40 years.
[normal] 
[normal]Membership is open to all companies active
[normal] in the UK continental shelf
[normal] (UKCS)
[normal], from super majors to large contractor businesses and from independent oil companies to SMEs working in the supply chain.
[normal] Its predecessor was the UK Offshore Operators Association
[normal] (UKOOA)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our aim is to strengthen the l
[normal]ong-term health of the offshore oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom by working closely with companies across the sector, governments and all other stakeholders to address the issues that affect our business.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Health and safety is an important part o
[normal]f any industry, particularly in the offshore 
[normal]oil and gas 
[normal]sector, which is classe
[normal]d as a major hazards industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]O
[normal]ffshore helicopter operations are routinely conducted in a hostile 
[normal]marine 
[normal]environment
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]hence the need to
[normal] ensure that 
[normal]high levels of flight 
[normal]safety are pre-requisite.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]UK offshore oil and gas 
[normal]industry
[normal] is
[normal] 
[normal]committed
[normal] to continually improving
[normal] safety standards for all aspects of offshore helicopter operations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Few other countries in
[normal] which the oil and gas industry operates 
[normal]puts more effort into improving its 
[normal]aviation 
[normal]safety performance through leadership, 
[normal]communication and co-operation than the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Transparent reporting of 
[normal]UK offshore aviation 
[normal]safety performance
[normal],
[normal] and learning from accidents and incidents
[normal],
[normal] is achieved thro
[normal]ugh information sharing 
[normal]with International
[normal] 
[normal]and European 
[normal]industry 
[normal]aviation 
[normal]safety forums. The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]industry recognises the importance of joined-up working and engages the workforce and trade unions 
[normal]in offshore helicopter safety awareness 
[normal]through offshore safe
[normal]ty committees and onshore networks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The industry operates 
[normal]generally 
[normal]within a goal setting 
[normal]safety 
[normal]regulatory framework 
[normal]but also 
[normal]adheres to 
[normal]the prescriptive 
[normal]aviation 
[normal]requirements that apply to offshore helicopter operations. T
[normal]hrough 
[normal]the publication of robus
[normal]t aviation management guidelines, 
[normal]information dissemination, 
[normal]workshops and seminars, developing and delivering industry-w
[normal]ide initiatives and programmes 
[normal]and engaging with governments and other external organisations, the UKCS
[normal] is 
[normal]widely regarded as 
[normal]a global 
[normal]exemplar of good 
[normal]aviation 
[normal]safety practice.

[normal]In addition
[normal],
[normal] under Supporting Documents
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]this web page includes
[normal] Appendix 2
[normal] which 
[normal]provides a complete listing of the 72 reportable accidents involving helicopters serving the UK offshore oil and gas sector from 1976 to 2012.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 1976, commercial air transport helicopter flight sta
[normal]tistics and reportable accident 
[normal]data
[normal] for UKCS offshore operations ha
[normal]ve
[normal] been collected by the industry along with relevant reports obtained from the 
[normal]Civil Aviation Authority (
[normal]CAA
[normal])
[normal] Mandatory Occurrence Repo
[normal]rting (MOR) scheme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During this 
[normal]37-year period up to year-end 2012, more than 6
[normal]3
[normal] million passengers ha
[normal]ve been transported to and from 
[normal]offshore installations on the UKCS, with over 7.5 million flights made (secto
[normal]rs flown), consuming 
[normal]over
[normal] 3.5 
[normal]million flying hours. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regrettably, during this period, 12 fatal accidents have cl
[normal]aimed the li
[normal]ves of 115 offshore 
[normal]workers and flight crew. There have been 60 non-fatal accidents.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Health &amp; Safety Report 2013 provides a report that is representative of today’s offshore flight ope
[normal]rations using a fleet of modern 
[normal]helicopters. Data from 1992 to 2012
[normal] have been used for comparative purposes
[normal]. A
[normal]s a 
[normal]measure of current UKCS
[normal] activity, in 2012, just over 1
[normal]1
[normal]4
[normal],000 sectors were
[normal] flown, consuming 86,000 flight 
[normal]hours and transporting 
[normal]just short of
[normal] a million passengers offshore. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 1992, six f
[normal]atal accidents ha
[normal]ve claimed the 
[normal]lives of 47 offshore workers and flight crew and there have been 18 non-fatal accidents.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]U
[normal]se of this statistical
[normal]ly
[normal] 
[normal]small 
[normal]data 
[normal]set 
[normal]does not determine “how safe are offshore helicopter flights”. To reach a sensible conclusion this requires a much deeper understanding of all facets of offshore helicopter 
[normal]flight 
[normal]operations
[normal] and 
[normal]rotor
[normal]craft engineering
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Most important when assessing aircra
[normal]ft technical failures is to recognise that for helicopter types used globally in the same role, a major component failure resulting in a crash or ditching (as identified by the AAIB in their reports into the Eurocopter AS332L2 [G-REDL] fatal accident in 20
[normal]09 and two Eurocopter EC225 accidents [G-REDW and G-CHCN] in 2012), could have occurred anywhere in the world; regardless of where the helicopter was being flown, over land or sea.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Indeed, when offshore helicopter accident rates on the UKCS are compared w
[normal]ith the International Oil &amp; Gas Producers Association (OGP) Aviation Safety Committee’s (ASC) worldwide fatal and non-fatal reportable accident rates for the period 1995 to 2010 the data indicates that, averaged over this time, offshore helicopter operatio
[normal]ns on the UKCS carry significantly less risk than operations elsewhere in the world.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This 
[normal]important 
[normal]observation 
[normal]in the context of the UKCS helicopter safety record 
[normal]is independently supported by reference to 
[normal]Table 7.2 
[normal]- Overview over helicopter accidents in the North Sea (and Canada) in the period 1999-2009 on page 88 
[normal]in the Norwegian SINTEF Helicopter Safety Study 3
[normal],
[normal] dated 22 March 2010
[normal];
[normal] which explains why or why not 
[normal]the 
[normal]listed accidents could have occurred in the Norw
[normal]egian sector at the same time.
[normal] 
[normal]http://www.norskoljeoggass.no/en/Activities/HSE-and-operation/Helicopter-safety-/
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Paragraph 
[normal]7.3.6
[normal] in the SINTEF Report compa
[normal]res the Norwegian and UK sectors
[normal] and says, “
[normal]It is striking that the UK sector had ten accidents while Norway only had one accident in the
[normal] 
[normal]period 1999-2009, with comparable amounts of person flight hours. All fatalities in the North
[normal] 
[normal]Sea during the period 
[normal]have also occurred in the UK sector. The statistics show a significantly
[normal] 
[normal]different development between the UK and Norwegian sectors from the previous period. The
[normal] 
[normal]analysis has shown, however, that all accidents, in principal also could have occurred in
[normal] 
[normal]Norw
[normal]ay. This indicates that our low accident rate in the period could be a random result; this is
[normal] 
[normal]also supported by sensitivity analyses
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Equally, when assessing outcomes from these accidents
[normal],
[normal] it is very important to remember that the 100% survival rate for 
[normal]the two (2) 
[normal]helicopters that ditched
[normal] in 2012 (33 people involved) was attributable to the 
[normal]outstanding 
[normal]skills of the 
[normal]two 
[normal]flight crews
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]calm
[normal] weather conditions, 
[normal]the quality and effectiveness of passengers’ survival training and 
[normal]the 
[normal]aircraft and pe
[normal]rsonal safety equipment provided.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The AS332L2 non-fatal ditching accident whilst on the approach to BP ETAP 
[normal]in 
[normal]February 
[normal]2009 [G-REDU]
[normal] was attributed
[normal] by AAIB
[normal] largely
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]flight crew perceptual and procedural issues in the final approach
[normal]. There was no loss 
[normal]of life and the 18 people involved were all rescued.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the absence of completed investigations and a report by AAIB, it 
[normal]is 
[normal]inappropriate for O
[normal]il &amp; 
[normal]G
[normal]as 
[normal]UK to comment 
[normal]in detail 
[normal]or speculate 
[normal]about outcomes from the AS332L2 [G-
[normal]WN
[normal]SB
[normal]]
[normal] fatal accident off Sumburgh o
[normal]n 
[normal]23 August 
[normal]2013.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, 
[normal]AAIB published a
[normal] Special Bulletin
[normal] (S
[normal]7
[normal]-
[normal]2013
[normal]) 
[normal]on 18 October 2013 
[normal]which
[normal] state
[normal]s
[normal] that 
[normal]“
[normal]no evidence of a technical fault 
[normal]with G-WNSB 
[normal]has been found that could have been causal to the accident
[normal]”
[normal]. This 
[normal]find
[normal]ing 
[normal]resulted in the AS332L2 being 
[normal]allowed to return
[normal] to 
[normal]offshore 
[normal]service
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]following
[normal] the 
[normal]prompt and
[normal] 
[normal]collective oil and gas industry 
[normal]decision 
[normal](including Trade
[normal]s Union representatives
[normal]) 
[normal]on 24 August 
[normal]to 
[normal]temporarily 
[normal]withdraw the 
[normal]Super Puma 
[normal]helicopter type 
[normal](all variants) 
[normal]from service
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]key reason for
[normal] 
[normal]the UK having a better safety record in relation to helicopter operations relative to other countries 
[normal]is
[normal] that many parts of the world lack the regulatory, management and equipment sophistica
[normal]tion when compared with the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Also,
[normal] 
[normal]on the UKCS, helicopter operations are 
[normal]conducted in a hostile marine environment 
[normal]exclusively 
[normal]with 
[normal]t
[normal]wo-engine, two-pilot operations.
[normal] W
[normal]hereas, for example,
[normal] 
[normal]in the US Gulf Coast region there are a large number of small, single-engine helicopter and
[normal] 
[normal]single-pilot operations
[normal] conducted in relatively benign marine 
[normal]environments and a variety of onshore 
[normal]environments
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When attempting to make 
[normal]UK
[normal]C
[normal]S
[normal] 
[normal]aviation safety 
[normal]comparisons with other North Sea states it should be noted that the UK has the largest helicopter fleet size and significantly higher rates of utilisation and passengers carried
[normal] (e.g. twice the flight hours flown in Norway)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further
[normal], th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]other North Sea 
[normal]helicopter 
[normal]operations are principally conducted by 
[normal]subsidiaries of 
[normal]the same 
[normal]helicopter 
[normal]companies that provide the 
[normal]bulk of helicopter services on the UKCS; 
[normal]generally 
[normal]working to the same aviation rules
[normal] (
[normal]e.g. 
[normal]JAR-Ops 3)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]operating
[normal], 
[normal]maintenance
[normal] and 
[normal]flight 
[normal]safety 
[normal]requirements / 
[normal]guidelines
[normal],
[normal] pilot and engineer training regimes
[normal], etc
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ultimately, comparisons between the safety performances of countries 
[normal]should
[normal] be 
[normal]considered in relation to 
[normal]the
[normal] measure 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]success in striving to meet 
[normal]the prim
[normal]ary
[normal] 
[normal]objective of ensuring that everything that can 
[normal]reasonably 
[normal]be done 
[normal]to minimise the risks 
[normal]is being done. As outlined elsewhere in this submission, we believe that the UK has been and remains a global leader in helicopter safety.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is not unreasonable to say that having invested very heavily in replacing an ageing fleet of helicopters on the UKCS with the very latest technology rotorcraft available in the global marketplace, UK helicopter operators and the oil and gas companies al
[normal]ike are shocked 
[normal]and 
[normal]dismayed 
[normal]by the severity and outcomes of the accidents, in the past 
[normal]four 
[normal]years.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HTG was initially formed 
[normal]as the body tasked to focus on 
[normal]oil and gas 
[normal]industry responses
[normal] to the 2009 fatal 
[normal]helicopter 
[normal]accident. 
[normal]HTG was formed as a 
[normal]multi-agency working group comprising 
[normal]executive and senior 
[normal]representatives
[normal] from O
[normal]il &amp; 
[normal]G
[normal]as 
[normal]UK, oil and gas companies, the offshore contractors, the helicopter operators, CAA, HSE, Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, 
[normal]Grampian Police, 
[normal]Trades Unions (
[normal]RMT, 
[normal]Unite
[normal] and BALPA) and the offshore workforce.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HTG had full executive authority to maintain collective overview by all the stakeholders of the accident investigation outcomes and respond promptly to Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) findings and recommenda
[normal]tions; along with reviewing all the activities to do with providing accident victims family support, management of the emergency response, robustness of aviation management guidelines and workforce communications, etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To work 
[normal]quickly and 
[normal]effectively when
[normal] problems 
[normal]had been 
[normal]identified and solutions 
[normal]were 
[normal]being sought, HTG had full authority to initiate research and other studies to improve 
[normal]offshore 
[normal]helicopter safety. It did this in several areas such as pressing the aircraft manufacture
[normal]r
[normal]s to develop 
[normal](from a 
[normal]research project) 
[normal]and implement Advanced Anomaly Detection
[normal] (as production AAD systems)
[normal] to enhance 
[normal]the performance of Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) for improved fault detection in the major dynamic components (e.g. main rotor gearboxes
[normal] and tran
[normal]smission
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, s
[normal]ince 2012, all workers flying offshore have been provided with personal locator beacons, 
[normal]tested to a CAA standard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Subsequently,
[normal] after the 
[normal]HTG’s
[normal] role 
[normal]of oversight of the 2009 accident came to a logical end it was decided to 
[normal]contin
[normal]ue 
[normal]the valuable work that had been done to improve
[normal] workforce communication and engagement on helicopter 
[normal]passenger 
[normal]safety under a new group, the HSSG
[normal], within the industry 
[normal]lead 
[normal]safety body, Step Change in Safety
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]ollowing the 2012 / 13 accidents 
[normal]HSSG 
[normal]immediately 
[normal]undertook a similar role to 
[normal]HTG to provide 
[normal]collective 
[normal]industry responses
[normal] and provide the conduit for workforce communications and engagement
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, HSSG
[normal] membership
[normal] has become unwieldy in recent times so, HTG has been re-established as a sm
[normal]all 
[normal]executive management oversight group and 
[normal]HSSG
[normal] 
[normal]ha
[normal]s
[normal] reverted to its previous role.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ASTG continues to focus on resolving 
[normal]a wide range of 
[normal]technical 
[normal]and operational 
[normal]issues
[normal], 
[normal]progressing solutions and further developing and refining Aviation Management Guidelines in conjunction with all the stakeholders.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is already an abundance of legisla
[normal]tion and regulations relating to
[normal] offshore helicopter operations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since the early days in the North Sea there has been 
[normal]almost 
[normal]constant regulatory evolution. The 
[normal]current 
[normal]legislative basis for UK aviation 
[normal]flight 
[normal]operations and airworthiness 
[normal]are well 
[normal]established, of a high level
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]kept 
[normal]under constant scrutiny by CAA
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the regulatory spread of E
[normal]ASA continues to grow and increase its influence over UK aviation operations and airworthiness, etc. the UK Government should ensure that CAA resources and regulatory focus is properly maintained in order to reinforce CAA’s ability to continue applying hig
[normal]h standards in UK aviation safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal] key 
[normal]to future offshore helicopter safety improvements 
[normal]is for the UK to retain th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]well-established
[normal] high level of flight operations
[normal] requirements, 
[normal]airworthiness re
[normal]quirements and 
[normal]regulatory scrutiny by CAA;
[normal] regardless of the 
[normal]Directives issued 
[normal]by 
[normal]European Aviation Safety Agency (
[normal]EASA
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]EASA 
[normal]is seeking a baseline regulatory standard to satisfy all European states and in so doing is in danger of diluting the ‘gold standard’ that has been 
[normal]an overriding objectiv
[normal]e
[normal] in the UK
[normal], since the early days of aviation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]CAA is at the forefront of ensuring that UK aviation activities conducted by 
[normal]the offshore helicopter 
[normal]Air Operators Certificate (
[normal]AOC
[normal])
[normal] Holders working in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]remains
[normal] safe.
[normal] Likewise
[normal],
[normal] for oversight of airworthiness and air traffic services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HSE regulate
[normal]s
[normal] and has the oversight 
[normal]for
[normal] helicopter activities on offshore installations. They do this in conjunction with CAA via a Memorandum of Understanding
[normal].
[normal] HSE’s offshore inspectors effectivel
[normal]y provide oversight of safety improvements to do with helideck operations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is not immediately apparent that EASA
[normal] 
[normal]respond
[normal]s
[normal] vigorously or in a timely manner to the many recommendations that have made in AAIB reports into recent offshore accidents. For instance, there is little evidence of 
[normal]EASA 
[normal]progress with the 13 
[normal](
[normal]of 27
[normal])
[normal] safety recommendations 
[normal]put forward
[normal] 
[normal]in the 
[normal]report of the
[normal] 
[normal]AS332L2 non-fatal ditching accident in 2009 [G-REDU].
