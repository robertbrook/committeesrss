defaultSPENDING REVIEWS, BUDGETS AND

default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission will address one specific aspect of the Inquiry
default terms of reference
default: 
default&#xa0;
default“The Spending Review announced in June 2013 covers the 2015/16 financial year only. What discussions can take place in the final year of the current Parliament to prepare
default for the next Spending Review?
default 
defaultWhat scope is there for future Spending Reviews to more closely mirror the term of a Parliament?”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe submission will widen the scope slightly of this question, to include how Spending Reviews and the whole Finance and Suppl
defaulty system might be impacted by the changes introduced by the FTP Act.
default&#xa0;
defaultSPENDING REVIEWS AND BUDGETS
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is 
defaultvery 
defaultimportant to be clear about the status of Spending Reviews. They are simply ‘statements of intent’ by the government, in effect 
defaultthey have
default the sam
defaulte status as a White Paper. They are not authorised by Parliament and, apart from the short-lived Fiscal Responsibility Act of Feb 2010
default, Spending Reviews had no legal basis or force.
default&#xa0;
defaultEach SR only attains real force when it is implemented through subsequen
defaultt annual Budgets
default. One problematic issue has been that Budgets – and subsequent Supply motions – do not always follow what was set out in the Spending Review for the relevant year. Moreover Governments do not make it clear when they are deviating from the p
defaultlan set out in the preceding Spending Review.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the latter years of the Labour government, and under the Coalition, this situation has become even more complicated as governments have increasingly used the Pre Budget Report (or ‘Autumn Statement’) to mak
defaulte changes to both tax and spending policies
default, increasingly looking like a mini-budget
default.
default 
defaultAs 
defaultAlistair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2007 to 2010, remarks that “during my time as Chancellor I had to deliver what were in effect six Budgets”
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSPENDING REVIEWS – THE STORY SO FAR
default&#xa0;
defaultOn its election in 1997 the New Labour Government announced it was introducing multi-year ‘Spending Reviews’, the first of which would be published 
defaultin the following year
default (1998)
default. These would provide the public spending 
defaultframework for a 3-year period ahead.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe aims of this innovation were several:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe idea of Governments adopting a medium-term expenditure framework 
defaultis not 
defaultespecially 
defaultnew –
default the World Bank and IMF had
default been promoting this idea to developing countries for many years before the UK decided to experiment with 
defaultit. However few OECD countries had adopted such a reform at the time and there was therefore a great
default deal of interest in the British experiment.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs promised, Labour duly published its first “Comprehensive Spending Review”
default in J
defaultuly 1998, setting out departmental budgets for the next three fiscal years (1999-2000 to 2001-02).
default Since then there have been si
defaultx further Spending Reviews, four under Labour and two under the Coalition. These are set out in

defaultiscal year being April (
defaultFY
default) to March the following year. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPartly because there is no legislative basis to Spending Reviews, it has been very easy for successive governments to change the process to suit their needs. So far only two S
defaultpending Reviews (2004 and 2007) have 
defaultactually lasted for the period 
defaultoriginally specified. In four cases (1998, 2000, 2002, and 2010) the first year of the next Spending Review has 
defaultsuperseded
default the 
defaultlast year of the previous Review, cutting them short. A new g
defaultovernment in May 2015 could overturn most of the final fiscal year of SR2013 if it wished.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow far this ‘flexibility’ has proved useful or 
defaultundermined the purpose of Spending Reviews is obviously a matter of judgement. During the period of rising public 
defaultexpenditure
default between 1999 and 2004 the procedural irregularities 
defaultreceived scant attention and few complaints. Unsurprisingly those on the receiving end of public expenditure decisions didn’t complain about a little inconsistency as long as budgets were inc
defaultreasing.
default 
defaultThe period of the two Spending Reviews that did run to full term (2004 and 2007) saw spending stabilise and once the Global Financial Crisis started in 2008 the decision not have a Spending Review in 2009 was widely welcomed.
default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps to some surp
defaultrise the incoming Coalition government of 2010 opted to keep – and even in some ways extend – the use of Spending Reviews. SR2010 sought to plan public spending for an ambitious 4 years ahead (FY2011-2014).
default In the event, these plans only lasted 3 FYs, with the final year (2014) being revised in SR2013.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt could be argued that SRs were and are little more than aspirational, but that is not how they have been ‘sold’ by successive governments. Right from the 
defaultstart we were told that they fundamentally change the way in which Government’s could be held to account by Parliament and the public. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Coalition government has been, if anything, even more insistent that it is “sticking to the Plan”. 
defaultBut
default if SRs are m
defaulterely aspirational guidance
default,
default with no s
defaulterious intent to implement them, t
defaulthey would be no different from the ‘forward look’ years in the Public Expenditure Survey (PES) that preceded SRs from the early 1960s to 1997.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe aim of the Coalition 
defaultin
default using Spendi
defaultng Reviews was in some ways quite different from the previous government. In a period of austerity, and as they saw it potential fiscal crisis, they sought to use SR2010 as a way of reassuring bond markets that Britain had a credible plan for deficit reduc
defaulttion. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOf course, having a four-year spending plan would also allow public sector managers to more effectively plan necessary reductions in spending and services, but the over-riding concern seems to have been to have a credible deficit reduction plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultS
defaultR2013 
defaultis an interesting example – it 
defaultillustrates very well some of the issues the Committee is interested in exploring. It clearly became necessary
default a year ‘early’ for two
default reasons. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, the economic and fiscal assumptions that underpinned SR2010 turned 
defaultout to be substantially wrong. The economy more or less flat-lined between 2010 and 2013, with predictable consequences for the public finances. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, the Coalition government almost certainly came to the conclusion that a Spending Review published i
defaultn July 2014 (when it would have logically been due) would be far too close to the General Election for the two-Party Coalition to be able to reach agreement on detailed spending plans stretchin
defaultg well into the next Parliament. A three-year SR in 2014 would 
defaulthave covered FYs 2015-2017, meaning the two parties entering the GE on an agreed public spending platform. This seems highly implausible politically.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis latter consideration would apply to any future Coalition government in the final stages of a Parliam
defaultent and make the formulation of an agreed multi-year Spending Review highly unlikely – unless 
defaultwe move to a position where Coalitions continue into and through the GE process, which presently seems unlikely.
default&#xa0;
defaultOf course there will always be the need for some
default flexibility – events can always derail the best of plans. 
defaultBut any reformed SR system needs to discourage playing political football with the whole SR process and content or it will simply become a meaningless ‘spin’ operation.
default&#xa0;
defaultBefore turning to the issue
default of SRs in the context of the FTP Act, it is useful to look at the impact of the Act on the Finance and Suppl
defaulty process – in short the Budget.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBUDGETS AND THE FTP ACT
default&#xa0;
defaultAt first sight it might seem that the advent of Fixed-term Parliaments would have 
defaultlittle impact on the annual Budget process, except perhaps in Election year (assuming GEs continue to occur in May).
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, I would argue that the FTP Act has, inadvertently
default perhaps, introduced a possibly 
defaultprofound constitutional change into the Budget p
defaultrocess.
default&#xa0;
defaultStanding Order 48 of the House of Commons states that:
default&#xa0;
default“48. This House will receive no petition for any sum relating to public service or proceed upon any motion for a grant or charge upon public revenue, wh
defaulte
defaultther payable out of the Consolidated F
defaultund or the National Loans fund or out of money to be provided by Parliament, or for releasing or compounding any sum of money owing to the Crown, unless recommended by the Crown.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is basis of a pervasive myth that any vote against the government on a
default finance or supply motion is tantamount to a ‘vote of confidence’. This myth is so powerful that it regularly appears in accounts of UK budget processes in academic texts 
default– e.g. 
default“The last government defeat over estimates was in 1921 ….. nowadays any amendm
defaultent would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence.”
default 
default(Whener
default p8). P
defaulterhaps much more importantly – 
defaultthe ‘confidence’ myth
default 
defaulthas been
default 
defaulttaken as accepted wisdom amongst many Parliamentarians over the years.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn fact, what SO
default48 says is simply that only the Government – the Crown – can propose motions to Parliament to spend money. Technically it does not cover motions to raise taxes, although it has generally been assumed it does. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a consequence it is generally accepted tha
defaultt the only motions that can be moved from the floor of the House on Finance or Supply are amendments to either reduce or remove proposals for taxes or spending.
default But it is also often thought (an idea encouraged by government’s of all stripes) that any such 
defaultamendment would be an issue of confidence. And indeed, prior to the FTP Act, what constituted an issue of confidence was essentially flexible and open to the government of the day to decide.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite the prevalent myth there have been some attempts to amen
defaultd spending or tax proposals 
default– there have been about 20 Government defeats on such amendments over the past hundred years or so, none leading to the fall of a government or even been seen as a ‘confidence’ issue. An unknown number of other amendments have b
defaulteen put forward but accepted by the government, or withdrawn before a vote.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhatever the veracity or prevalence of the myth of amendments to Finance or Supply being a ‘confidence’ issue before the FTP Act, it should now be firmly dead and buried. The FTP 
defaultAct lays out in precise terms what a vote of (no) confidence in the government of the day should look like, even s
defaulttipulating the words to be used and the exact consequences.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the moment therefore, any vote to amend Finance or Supply to reduce or remove 
defaulta tax or spending proposal would definitely 
defaultnot
default be a confidence issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis opens up the definite possibility that the Opposition, or any party in a Coalition that wishes to embarrass its allies, 
defaultor indeed any individual MP, 
defaultcan move amendments to Finance
default or Supply without any fear of causing the fall of the government or triggering a General Election.
default Whilst such moves would still be constrained by SO48 in relation to spending, it is also entirely possible motions to amend Finance (tax) proposals could be
default moved to increase or raise new taxes.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt has always been unclear how or why the executive’s essential monopoly over tax and spending decisions emerged – there is no real constitutional justification for not allowing Parliament to revise or advise on thes
defaulte issues, as it does on legislation. It appears to be simply another example of how lop-sided our constitutional conventions have become, in favour of the executive.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis raises the spectre of Budget debates becoming much more contentious and even the pro
defaultspect 
defaultthat
default a sitting government could see its plans amended or overturned by majorities in the Commons.
default More positively, it could create a much more
default systematic role for Parliament, as will be discussed below.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSPENDING REVIEWS AND THE FTP ACT – THE 
defaultFUTURE
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principle behind Spending Reviews – that medium term planning of public expenditure programs brings many benefits – is a good one. It has potential also for providing for a more structured political debate and decision making processes that wou
defaultld present electors, parliamentarians and governments with more transparent and 
defaultclear choices. Spending Reviews cannot, and should not, take politics out of public spending decisions, but they can, in conjunction with changes implicit in fixed term parliam
defaultents, make for a better political process.
default&#xa0;
defaultAligning Spending cycles with Parliamentary cyclesdefault.default&#xa0;
defaultThe first and most obvious reform would be to align the public spending process with the electoral cycle.
default&#xa0;
defaultAssuming elections continue to be held in May, an in
defaultcoming government could first introduce a Budget in June/July to am
defaultend plans for the existing year. It could
default then
default 
defaultpublish a proposed Spending Review in 
defaultOctober to cover the following 3
default fiscal years.
default During the third year of this Review period, it could pub
defaultlish a new Spending review covering the next two-years, as illustrated
default in 
defaultFigure 
default2
default below.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is of course what has more or less happened in the current Parliament. The 3 or 2-year period is also what has happened in practice in the 7 Spending Reviews since 1998. So in a sense, this would be nothing new - it would simply codi
defaultfy 
defaultand regularise 
defaultwhat has evolved in practice
default and seems to work
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSpending Reviews could be published in draft form and subjected to Parliamentary scrutiny via the Select Codefaultmmittee system.default&#xa0;defaultOne of the issues not discussed so far is the degree to which SRs have, in practice
default, concentrated even more power in the hands of HM Treasury. Few observers would dissent from the view that they have given HMT and the Chancellor much greater control over departmental budgets. Even devices like the much vaunted ‘end-year-flexibility’ have
default been operated within tight Treasury reins. Moreover the whole spending process has been just as – if not more –secretive than before, and with less justification. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn past Budget day announcements could move markets, because 
defaultthe overall fiscal stance of 
defaultthe Government was announced alongside detailed spending and tax plans. This was at least some justification for Budget ‘purdah’. However, since SRs were introduced the Government sets out its broad fiscal position in the Autumn Statement preceding the SR 
default– announcing the size of the public spending cake to be fought over in the SR. The SR announcement simply says how the cake is to be divided up after an almost completely hidden decision process. It has no effect on markets.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs I have been arguing since t
defaulthe early 2000s, 
defaultthe 
defaultinnovation
default of Spending Reviews should have provided the opportunity
default to open this whole process up and
default for improved Parliamentary scrutiny of spending plans.
default The process should be fairly 
defaultstraightforward
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government publishes a draf
defaultt Spending Review
default,
default within the parameters 
defaultfor a public spending envelope set out in the
default preceding Autumn Statement. Each departmental Select Committee looks in detail at proposals for spending in its area. They invite evidence and opinion from interested pa
defaultrties.
default Each
default can then
default 
defaultreport
default, 
defaultbased on the evidence presented, 
defaultmaking recommendations to amend, or not, proposed spending plans.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis would go
default a long way
default towards alleviating what King and Crewe
default recently called the “deficit of deliberation” i
defaultn public 
defaultpolicy decision-making – of which public spending decisions are arguably one of the most important.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll main Pdefaultarties Spending defaultand Finance defaultproposals could be subject to scrutiny by the OBR before General Electionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultLabour has recently proposed that the OBR
default be involved in auditing the spending plans of all the main Parties in the run up to the next GE. This idea was welcomed by the Chair of the OBR and Public Accounts Committee 
defaultwhen they spoke recently in 
defaultManchester.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain, there se
defaultems to be a fairly obvious time-
defaulttable for this. At the time of the Pre-Budget report (usually November) before the year of a GE, the main opposition Party or Parties should be invited to outline their approach to the first SR of the next parliament
default, includ
defaulting spending and fiscal policies. In the event of there being a Coalition government 
defaultin office
default, this would also be the time when the Coalition partners could – if they wised – set out their independent tax and spend policies.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe OBR should then be tasked
default with assessing the policy statement and producing a report on each at the time of the March Budget, shortly before the formal GE process begins.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAligning defaultGovernmentdefault financial statements.default&#xa0;
defaultAn important technical change would be helpful alongside these pr
defaultocedural changes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite HM Treasury’s so-called ‘alignment project’ it is still difficul
defaultt for Parliamentarians and members
default of the public to “follow the money” 
defaultthrough the various stages of public spending decisions: Spending Reviews; Budgets; Finance a
defaultnd Supply; and finally departmental (and whole of government) accounts. If we are to have a more integrated and predictable public spending decision-making process it is essential more progress is made on this front.
default&#xa0;
defaultCONCLUSION
default&#xa0;
defaultThe benefits of a Fixed-Te
defaultrm Parliament should not be limited to the political realm – it should also help to improve government. Fundamental to this would be to have a more ordered, predictable and open decision making process for public spending and fiscal policy. The fact that s
defaultuccessive Governments, of different complexions and in very different circumstances have found the idea of some form of medium
default-term framework helpful suggests it is useful. Fixed term Parliaments opens an opportunity to make it even more so.
