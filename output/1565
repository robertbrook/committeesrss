default 
defaultFaced with all of these issues it would be easy

defaultThe inquiry ra

defaulta vision
default of wh
defaultat might be achieved by 2050, they are very light on 
defaultthe 
defaultmeasures 
defaultby which these ambitions can an
defaultd will be delivered. Cru
defaultcially when considered alongside the practical challenges to decarbonise the heating market that we outlined earlier in this response, 
defaultthey do not provide the level of certainty that t
defaulthe heating industry needs to
default bring the products
default to market
default with appropriate cost and performance characteristics and at sufficient scale to deliver the changes envisaged.
default2.2
default 
defaultIndustry want to see m
defaultore robust shor
defaultt and medium term plans 
defaultput in place 
defaultto 
defaultsupplement the long term vision
default2.3
default 
defaultTo address th
defaultis issue HHIC has embarked on an ambitious project to try to plot out a pathway
default for
default decarbonising the domestic heating market. Phase 1 of this project, to establish some s
defaulthort to medium term scenarios has been completed. The findings are detailed in our report 
default‘
defaultPathways for Domestic Heat
default’
default which can be accessed on the following link: 
defaultwww.centralheating.co.uk/pathway
defaults
default2.4
default 
defaultThe objective of this work has been to address the 
defaultchallenges presented by the government's heat strategy and in particular to provide alternatives to the largely all electric scenario
default.
default In particular HHIC's view is that in the medium term i.e.at least until 2030, the UK will need a greater mix of fuel and 
defaulttechnology choices than those proposed by the heat strategy.
default2.5
default 
defaultThe report is the result of an evidence based study into a range of differe
defaultnt pathway options using d
defaultetailed 
defaultmarket and economic analysis 
defaulttogether with input on technology, performance and applic
defaultations from 
defaultHHIC members from across the supply
default chain
default. 
default 
default2.6
default 
defaultThe outcome of this study is a more realistic scenario for the deployment of domestic heating products in 2027 which:
default2.7
default 
defaultOur sc
defaultenario does however 
defaultenvisage
default a major c
defaulthange in product mix and that by 2027 condensing boilers will fall from the dominant position today with annual sales reducing to just over one third of the market. Of these nearly half would have solar thermal or flue gas heat recovery. Electric heat pump
defaults would grow to just over one quarter of the market and about half of these would be hybrid heat 
defaultpump/hybrid products. Low carbon gas technologies (gas heat pumps, microCHP and fuel cells) would rise to one fifth of the market and district heating would su
defaultpply about one tenth of the market
default2.8
default 
default The report points out that this 
defaultambitious
default view of how the market could be transformed can only be realised if the government also demonstrates its commitment. This would require the introduction of policies that stimulat
defaulte demand for low carbon heating and which provide industry with the confidence to develop and bring these
default products to market. P
defaultossible policy options 
defaultare included in the report and 
defaultthe next stage of the p
defaultroject 
defaultwill start to develop these into more detaile
defaultd proposals.
default2.9
default 
defaultThe outcome is a scenario which industry believes that with appropriate policy support it would be able
default to deliver. The acceptance by 
defaulti
defaultndustr
defaulty and Government to delivering such a change and the establishment of a credible policy framework will
default then provide industry with the confidence needed to scale up the technical and market development of these products.

default,

default We recognise the economic and political constraints but believe that we need 
defaultan 
defaultimaginative

default3.2
default 
defaultWe think that new market segmentation might allow us to better focus available resources and we are interested in the idea of establishing some low carbon heating communities. There are also opportunities
default for some limited regulatory levers that could be used.
default 
defaultIndustry, with its

defaultand understanding

defaultRole of the Domestic RHIdefault&#xa0;default4.1
default 
defaultThe recent announcements about the RHI are welcome and will provide 
defaulta much needed 
defaultstimulus 
defaultto encourage the uptake 
defaultof renewable
default heating. 
defaultWhilst the tariffs within the scheme have been 
defaultcautiously 
defaultset 
defaultto 
defaultprovide 
defaultsome 
defaultrate of return on investment
default, there are still uncertainties about actual costs of installation
default of products at this early stage 
defaultand the tariffs may not fully take account of barrier costs. The industry is very aware that the factors involved in replacing a heating system are different and more complex tha
defaultn a decision to install solar PV
default on a roof. A
defaults a result we believe that the domestic RHI will still be a hard sell especially in the owner occupier sector.  
default4.2
default 
defaultTaking into account the comments above and also the limited scale of the RHI 
defaultthen 
defaultthis scheme alone is
default unlikely to 
defaultdrive the scale of uptake th
defaultat would be needed to deliver HHIC’s 2027 scenario
default. It is 
defaulthowever
default a good start but will quickly need to be supplemented by other 
defaultpolicies which will help drive demand for low carbon and renewable heating
default.

defaultHeat storagedefault&#xa0;default5.1
default 
defaultThe 
defaultheat generator is often the s
defaultingle
default 
defaultf
defaultocus of any debate about heating; o
defaultther components of the heating system are also important and are likely to play an increasingly significant role in the drive to decarbonisation. 
default5.2
default 
defaultHeat storage will become an increasingly important factor in the de
defaultcarbonisation of UK homes. Combi boilers were introduced to the market in the 1990’s and since t
defaulthen 
defaulthave grown in popularity mainly because, by
default eliminating the hot water tank
default,
default 
defaultthey free up space in the home 
defaultand
default are generall
defaulty easier and cheaper to install.
default 
defaultHHIC boiler sales figures show that 
defaultin the past year 76
default% of gas boiler sales are combi
default and the English House Condition Survey indicates that over 50% of homes now have a combi boiler. 
default In the vast majority of cases the hot water tank will have been removed
default and the space used for other purposes.
default5.3
default 
defaultThe characteristics 
defaultof many
default alternati
defaultve low carbon sources of heat
default 
defaultleads to a mismatch between heat demand and supply availability. 
defaultRenewables are intermittent in availabili
defaultty and the inability to store electricity, 
defaulttogether
default with limitations in the supply infrastructure means that it can be more 
defaulteconomical
default to provide heating at times where there is low demand. Another consideration is the cost and performance characteristics of 
defaultalternative heating products. The higher
default costs mean that it can be more 
defaultattractive
default to install a lower capacity product to provide continuo
defaultu
defaults heating rather than one sized to deliver on demand fast heat up times. Some products such as heat pumps are also more energy efficient when delivering a st
defaulteady heat load 
defaultrather than peaks
default  
default5.4
default 
defaultConsideration needs to be given to reversing th
defaultis
default trend 
defaultaway from hot water storage 
defaultand 
defaulta 
defaultsector based approach would be most appropriate 
defaultf
defaultor this.   New homes provide a clear but limited opportunity to re-introduce hot

default 
defaultThe design of heating c

default C.  The heating circuits and particularly the radiators have been sized for this high te
defaultmperature operation. By contrast the performance heat 
defaultpumps can fall off rapidly when they are required to generate such high temperatures
default, typically above 50 deg. C. 
defaultThe design and sizing of the system therefore becomes much more critical when a heat pump is being installed. This characteristic does not necessarily mean that every new heat pump installation requires an expensive new heat distribution system. There

defaultbe used equally well 
defaultwith low temperature heating circuits and
default a small improvement (typically 1-2%) in efficiency would result. However the main benefit of such a move would be to future proof some homes for heat pumps as the conditions for the use of these products improves.
