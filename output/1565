[normal]Written evidence submitted by Hhic And Hwa (HOT12) [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Heating and Hotwater Industry Council (HHIC) and the Hot
[normal] W
[normal]ater Association (HWA) welcome the opportunity to respond to the Energy
[normal] and Cli
[normal]mate Change Select Committee’s Inquiry into H
[normal]eat.  HHIC and HWA 
[normal]are trade associations 
[normal]work
[normal]ing
[normal] together under the umbrella of t
[normal]he Energy &amp; Utilities Alliance to provide 
[normal]widespread
[normal] representation of the domestic heating 
[normal]and hot water 
[normal]industry
[normal] which 
[normal]is worth 
[normal]£3-4 billion
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]HHIC members include manufacturers, merchants and installers of all types of heating products including traditional fossil fuel boilers, microCHP
[normal], heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar water heaters. HWA represents manufacturers of hot water storage products. 
[normal]93-95% of heating and hot water solutions in the UK are covered by HHIC’s and HWA’s membership.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would be happy to discuss any of the issu
[normal]es rais
[normal]ed in this response and in the I
[normal]nquiry with the Select Committee.

[normal]Opportunities and b[bold]arriers[bold] facing the uptak[bold]e of low carbon heating in [bold]UK homes[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal] 
[normal]HHIC and HWA 
[normal]support
[normal] 
[normal]the need to 
[normal]reduce carbon emissions in order to 
[normal]help 
[normal]combat climate change and to establish longer term energy 
[normal]security
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]At the same time we recognise the 
[normal]ongoing 
[normal]need 
[normal]to provide affordable an
[normal]d effec
[normal]tive heating for UK households along
[normal] with the implications and needs to alleviate fuel poverty
[normal].
[normal]1.2
[normal] 
[normal]Reducing the amoun
[normal]t of carbon used for heating 
[normal]UK homes is a significant 
[normal]challenge and 
[normal]progress has been relatively slow. There are a number
[normal] of
[normal] factors which 
[normal]are 
[normal]li
[normal]mit
[normal]i
[normal]ng
[normal] the pace of decarbonisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal] 
[normal]Faced with all of these issues it would be easy 
[normal]to focus the decarbonisation agenda 
[normal]on other market sectors. Heating and hot
[normal] water 
[normal]are together
[normal] responsible for 
[normal]over 80 % of the domestic sectors energy consumption
[normal] and
[normal] 27%
[normal] of
[normal] the UK’s
[normal] carbon emissions and so cannot be ignored 
[normal]if 
[normal]the 2030 and 2050 
[normal]ambitions
[normal] are to be achieved.
[normal]1.4
[normal] 
[normal]The inquiry ra
[normal]ises a number of 
[normal]critic
[normal]al questions about the opportunities and challenges to reduce carbon emissions from domestic heating. HHIC has prod
[normal]uced a report entitled Pathways 
[normal]to Domestic Heating which provides some new and alternative options to reduce the carb
[normal]on intensity of domestic heating and in doing so addresses a number of questions raised in the Inquiry.

[normal]Pathways to low carbon heating[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]The DECC Heat Strategy which was published in
[normal] March 2012 and the subsequent 
[normal]2013 
[normal]document 
[normal]‘The Future of Heating:
[normal] Meeting the Challenge
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]have 
[normal]given
[normal] a 
[normal]valuable insight into the
[normal] Government’s ambitions. This has also provided a
[normal] basis for a more informed debate about the prospects for reducing the carbon
[normal] intensity of heating. W
[normal]hilst these documents provide 
[normal]a vision
[normal] of wh
[normal]at might be achieved by 2050, they are very light on 
[normal]the 
[normal]measures 
[normal]by which these ambitions can an
[normal]d will be delivered. Cru
[normal]cially when considered alongside the practical challenges to decarbonise the heating market that we outlined earlier in this response, 
[normal]they do not provide the level of certainty that t
[normal]he heating industry needs to
[normal] bring the products
[normal] to market
[normal] with appropriate cost and performance characteristics and at sufficient scale to deliver the changes envisaged.
[normal]2.2
[normal] 
[normal]Industry want to see m
[normal]ore robust shor
[normal]t and medium term plans 
[normal]put in place 
[normal]to 
[normal]supplement the long term vision
[normal]2.3
[normal] 
[normal]To address th
[normal]is issue HHIC has embarked on an ambitious project to try to plot out a pathway
[normal] for
[normal] decarbonising the domestic heating market. Phase 1 of this project, to establish some s
[normal]hort to medium term scenarios has been completed. The findings are detailed in our report 
[normal]‘
[normal]Pathways for Domestic Heat
[normal]’
[normal] which can be accessed on the following link: 
[normal]www.centralheating.co.uk/pathway
[normal]s
[normal]2.4
[normal] 
[normal]The objective of this work has been to address the 
[normal]challenges presented by the government's heat strategy and in particular to provide alternatives to the largely all electric scenario
[normal].
[normal] In particular HHIC's view is that in the medium term i.e.at least until 2030, the UK will need a greater mix of fuel and 
[normal]technology choices than those proposed by the heat strategy.
[normal]2.5
[normal] 
[normal]The report is the result of an evidence based study into a range of differe
[normal]nt pathway options using d
[normal]etailed 
[normal]market and economic analysis 
[normal]together with input on technology, performance and applic
[normal]ations from 
[normal]HHIC members from across the supply
[normal] chain
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]2.6
[normal] 
[normal]The outcome of this study is a more realistic scenario for the deployment of domestic heating products in 2027 which:
[normal]2.7
[normal] 
[normal]Our sc
[normal]enario does however 
[normal]envisage
[normal] a major c
[normal]hange in product mix and that by 2027 condensing boilers will fall from the dominant position today with annual sales reducing to just over one third of the market. Of these nearly half would have solar thermal or flue gas heat recovery. Electric heat pump
[normal]s would grow to just over one quarter of the market and about half of these would be hybrid heat 
[normal]pump/hybrid products. Low carbon gas technologies (gas heat pumps, microCHP and fuel cells) would rise to one fifth of the market and district heating would su
[normal]pply about one tenth of the market
[normal]2.8
[normal] 
[normal] The report points out that this 
[normal]ambitious
[normal] view of how the market could be transformed can only be realised if the government also demonstrates its commitment. This would require the introduction of policies that stimulat
[normal]e demand for low carbon heating and which provide industry with the confidence to develop and bring these
[normal] products to market. P
[normal]ossible policy options 
[normal]are included in the report and 
[normal]the next stage of the p
[normal]roject 
[normal]will start to develop these into more detaile
[normal]d proposals.
[normal]2.9
[normal] 
[normal]The outcome is a scenario which industry believes that with appropriate policy support it would be able
[normal] to deliver. The acceptance by 
[normal]i
[normal]ndustr
[normal]y and Government to delivering such a change and the establishment of a credible policy framework will
[normal] then provide industry with the confidence needed to scale up the technical and market development of these products.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]need for an ambitious policy framework[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst our pathways report provides 
[normal]some 
[normal]confidence
[normal] that decarbonisation of th
[normal]e
[normal] market is a practical reality
[normal],
[normal] Phase 2 will 
[normal]identify
[normal] policy options that could stimulate 
[normal]the demand needed 
[normal]to 
[normal]deliver the necessary scale of market transformation.
[normal] We recognise the economic and political constraints but believe that we need 
[normal]an 
[normal]imaginative
[normal] approach if we are to have any chance of success. 
[normal]3.2
[normal] 
[normal]We think that new market segmentation might allow us to better focus available resources and we are interested in the idea of establishing some low carbon heating communities. There are also opportunities
[normal] for some limited regulatory levers that could be used.
[normal] 
[normal]Industry, with its 
[normal]close
[normal] knowledge 
[normal]and understanding 
[normal]of the market and customers is able to bring ideas to the table.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]If we 
[normal]are to stand any chance of meeting the ambitions
[normal] and potential that exists in this area, 
[normal]we 
[normal]believe 
[normal]a cross government action group 
[normal]should be established to 
[normal]work closely with industry and other stakeholders
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Role of the Domestic RHI[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal] 
[normal]The recent announcements about the RHI are welcome and will provide 
[normal]a much needed 
[normal]stimulus 
[normal]to encourage the uptake 
[normal]of renewable
[normal] heating. 
[normal]Whilst the tariffs within the scheme have been 
[normal]cautiously 
[normal]set 
[normal]to 
[normal]provide 
[normal]some 
[normal]rate of return on investment
[normal], there are still uncertainties about actual costs of installation
[normal] of products at this early stage 
[normal]and the tariffs may not fully take account of barrier costs. The industry is very aware that the factors involved in replacing a heating system are different and more complex tha
[normal]n a decision to install solar PV
[normal] on a roof. A
[normal]s a result we believe that the domestic RHI will still be a hard sell especially in the owner occupier sector.  
[normal]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]Taking into account the comments above and also the limited scale of the RHI 
[normal]then 
[normal]this scheme alone is
[normal] unlikely to 
[normal]drive the scale of uptake th
[normal]at would be needed to deliver HHIC’s 2027 scenario
[normal]. It is 
[normal]however
[normal] a good start but will quickly need to be supplemented by other 
[normal]policies which will help drive demand for low carbon and renewable heating
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Heat storage[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]heat generator is often the s
[normal]ingle
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]ocus of any debate about heating; o
[normal]ther components of the heating system are also important and are likely to play an increasingly significant role in the drive to decarbonisation. 
[normal]5.2
[normal] 
[normal]Heat storage will become an increasingly important factor in the de
[normal]carbonisation of UK homes. Combi boilers were introduced to the market in the 1990’s and since t
[normal]hen 
[normal]have grown in popularity mainly because, by
[normal] eliminating the hot water tank
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]they free up space in the home 
[normal]and
[normal] are generall
[normal]y easier and cheaper to install.
[normal] 
[normal]HHIC boiler sales figures show that 
[normal]in the past year 76
[normal]% of gas boiler sales are combi
[normal] and the English House Condition Survey indicates that over 50% of homes now have a combi boiler. 
[normal] In the vast majority of cases the hot water tank will have been removed
[normal] and the space used for other purposes.
[normal]5.3
[normal] 
[normal]The characteristics 
[normal]of many
[normal] alternati
[normal]ve low carbon sources of heat
[normal] 
[normal]leads to a mismatch between heat demand and supply availability. 
[normal]Renewables are intermittent in availabili
[normal]ty and the inability to store electricity, 
[normal]together
[normal] with limitations in the supply infrastructure means that it can be more 
[normal]economical
[normal] to provide heating at times where there is low demand. Another consideration is the cost and performance characteristics of 
[normal]alternative heating products. The higher
[normal] costs mean that it can be more 
[normal]attractive
[normal] to install a lower capacity product to provide continuo
[normal]u
[normal]s heating rather than one sized to deliver on demand fast heat up times. Some products such as heat pumps are also more energy efficient when delivering a st
[normal]eady heat load 
[normal]rather than peaks
[normal]  
[normal]5.4
[normal] 
[normal]Consideration needs to be given to reversing th
[normal]is
[normal] trend 
[normal]away from hot water storage 
[normal]and 
[normal]a 
[normal]sector based approach would be most appropriate 
[normal]f
[normal]or this.   New homes provide a clear but limited opportunity to re-introduce hot 
[normal]water storage. There would also be value in identifying and tar
[normal]geting those types of property 
[normal]where space is less of an issue, 
[normal]and 
[normal]to engineer
[normal] innovative 
[normal]heat storage 
[normal]options which can make use of unused spaces.

[normal]Heat distribution[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal] 
[normal]The design of heating c
[normal]ircuits can also have an impact on heating performance and efficiency 
[normal]in the UK, heat
[normal] in the form 
[normal]of hot water generated in a boil
[normal]er has traditionally been distributed around homes at relatively high temperatures of typically 80 deg
[normal].
[normal] C.  The heating circuits and particularly the radiators have been sized for this high te
[normal]mperature operation. By contrast the performance heat 
[normal]pumps can fall off rapidly when they are required to generate such high temperatures
[normal], typically above 50 deg. C. 
[normal]The design and sizing of the system therefore becomes much more critical when a heat pump is being installed. This characteristic does not necessarily mean that every new heat pump installation requires an expensive new heat distribution system. There 
[normal]may 
[normal]however 
[normal]be 
[normal]benefits 
[normal]in identifying opportunities to encourage the installation of low temperature heating circuits in new homes or when major refurbishment work is being undertaken. Boilers can 
[normal]be used equally well 
[normal]with low temperature heating circuits and
[normal] a small improvement (typically 1-2%) in efficiency would result. However the main benefit of such a move would be to future proof some homes for heat pumps as the conditions for the use of these products improves.
