defaultChair:default Welcome, everyone, to the fifth evidence session of our inquiry into local
default 
defaultgovernment
default 
defaultprocurement.
default 
defaultBefore we begin proceedings, I would ask all Members of the Committee to put on record again their declarations of interest. They are on the register, but could we still put them on the minutes of our meeting as well?
default 
defaultI am a Vice President of the Local Government Association.
default 
defaultLet us go around the Committee.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default My wife is a councillor in 
defaultRochdale
default.
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default 
defaultMy husband is
default a councillor in North
default 
defaultTyneside.
defaultHeather Wheeler:default I am a Vice President of the LGA, and my husband is a councillor.
defaultChair:default That is it for this inquiry; we have those on the record.
default 
defaultAlso for the record, if witnesses could say who you are and the organisation you represent, it would be helpful.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default Good afternoon.
default 
defaultI am Matthew
default

default 
defaultI am the Associate
default

defaultResearcher.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: I am Oliver Henman.
default 
defaultI am the Head of Partnerships at the National
default 
defaultCouncil for Voluntary
default 
defaultOrganisations.
defaultQ335 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you very much for coming to give evidence this afternoon.
default 
defaultOne of the things we will be looking at is how procurement might be used for a number of objectives.
default 
defaultWe will begin by looking at how it might be used by local councils to tackle social disadvantage and poverty.
default 
defaultDo you think councils are actually doing this effectively?
default 
defaultAre they getting it right, or is there more they could be doing?
default 
defaultWho would like to start?
defaultMatthew Jackson:default In short, the answer is yes, in some localities.
default 
defaultIt is very much dependent upon the culture of procurement officers within particular local authorities.
default 
defaultWhere there is an effective strategic relationship between procurement and economic development, in particular within local authorities, that is where procurement leads to wider benefits.
defaultThere is effective engagement between procurement officers and economic
default-
defaultdevelopment practitioners where there is economic intelligence around the challenges of the issue—around things like 
defaultworklessness
default, low skills, poor business sustainability and those sorts of concerns, i.e. where there is a culture of achieving wider benefits through the process of procurement.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: At NCVO, we understand that local authorities are facing a challenging economic environment.
default 
defaultFunding for services is decreasing while demand is increasing.
default 
defaultThis does change the balance of what can be funded and what cannot be funded.
default 
defaultHowever, in these tough conditions, more effective procurement would enable the resources that are available to be better targeted.
default 
defaultIt is important to involve community organisations early in the process, even pre
default-
defaultprocurement, in order to identify the needs of a local area and make sure resources are best used for that area.
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: From my limited experience of the number of local authorities I meet, many are still quite unaware of it at a practical level.
default 
defaultProcurement officers often have not heard about the Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act at all; it is quite new.
default 
defaultOn the other hand, quite a lot of them have been doing social value for quite a long time.
default 
defaultThey have had powers under the Localism
default 
defaultAct.
default 
defaultThe LGA, for example, put out guidance on targeted recruitment and training as a social value three or four years ago.
default 
defaultThere has been a lot of activity.
default 
defaultThe first local
default-
defaultauthority contract I did with social value in it was in 1981.
default 
defaultIt has been around and on the blocks for quite a long time.
default 
defaultThe issue is pushing it forward in the very crowded agenda that people are trying to deal with at the moment.
defaultQ336 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How far is it down to whether individual procurement officers might know what is going on and understand how to do it?
default 
defaultHow far is it an issue of political leadership from councils that requires officers to recognise these objectives and pursue them?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: Political leadership is key, because it tells officers this is a high priority on the long agenda of things they have to deal with: re
default-
defaultcontracting, cuts and changes of all sorts.
default 
defaultFor places like 
defaultBirmingham
default or Nottingham or 
defaultLiverpool
default, which are the cities I have been working in, political leadership is key to saying, “This is something we have to take forward and are going to take forward”.
default 
defaultThe officers then get their ducks in line and start to work out how to do it and where to do it and so forth.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default Some of the most effective practice is where local authorities have aligned their procurement strategies, priorities and practices with wider corporate strategy and community strategy as well.
default 
defaultTo give an example, we have done a range of pieces of work with Manchester City Council.
default 
defaultOne of the simplest things they have undertaken is to put, at the outset of each of their tender documents, what their core corporate prior
defaultities are as a local authority, 
defaultwhich are around reducing 
defaultworklessness
default, raising aspiration and private
default-
defaultsector growth.
default 
defaultThat flow of priorities and objectives flows through the entirety of the procurement process.
defaultThat is important in terms of the supply chain as well.
default 
defaultIf you are influencing the behaviour of the supply chain to think about what your core priorities are as a local authority, it can have knock
default-
defaulton consequences in terms of how they behave and what added value they deliver through procurement beyond the delivery of services.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: Furthermore, part of it is simply through a lack of awareness.
default 
defaultIn many cases, procurement officials do not necessarily know what is allowable even under the current rules.
default 
defaultCertainly, with the new rules proposed now by 
defaultBrussels
default, the new EU Procurement Directive, that lack of understanding may well be further exacerbated.
default 
defaultThere is a lot of work to be done around awareness
default-
defaultraising, highlighting to officials what is actually possible, and highlighting good examples of where more innovative procurement has been used.
defaultQ337 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default To what extent are local councils exploiting the Public Services (Social Value) Act 
default2012 in
default terms of encouraging social benefits to their communities?
defaultMatthew Jackson:default The Public Services (Social Value) Act is a continuation of many of the things local authorities were doing anyway, particularly on the capital side of procurement—more construction
default-
defaulttype services.
default 
defaultFor years, a significant emphasis has been placed upon apprenticeships, job creation, and skills and training.
default 
defaultThe Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act has enabled authorities to formalise activities around wider social and economic benefits on the revenue side of things, i.e. more revenue
default-
defaultfocused services as well.
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: Perhaps the major changes in the area focus on social enterprise as a delivery route for it.
default 
defaultOn the whole, many local authorities with substantial teams of officers and so forth have already been doing it and are doing it already.
default 
defaultThe big gain from the Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act would be if other Ministries and other parts of Government started to do what local authorities actually have a long track record of doing, but it has never transferred outside of that to non
default-
defaultlocal authority contracts, except perhaps to 
defaultCrossrail
default, a few transport projects in London and one or two hospital projects around the country.
defaultThere is some impact, but there is also a downside.
default 
defaultBy leaving out works contracts, where most of the activity has been out of the Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act, you are actually sending a message.
default 
defaultPeople are saying, “Hang on a minute.
default 
defaultWe have been doing works projects, but we are 
defaultnot expected to do that now.”
default 
defaultBy leaving works projects out of the mix and focusing on services, there is the potential for some negative messages to go out about the works side, which has been very important.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: Not enough has been done with it so far over a year.
default 
defaultThe Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act is a very useful tool, and it could be better used by local authorities.
default 
defaultAs I said before around procurement officials, the feeling we get from members is that there is still a tendency to focus on the lowest price in procurement exercises and not look at the wider social and environment wellbeing indicators.
defaultOne example is a 
defaultLondon
default charity 
defaultthat 
defaultlost its contract delivering home care and end
default-
defaultof
default-
defaultl
defaultife care for a local authority 
defaultbecause the contractor price/quality weightings shifted from being 50/50 to being 70/30 in favour of lowest price.
default 
defaultThey could not compete with other private care providers.
default 
defaultThere is a risk that procurement officials are still looking for the lowest
default-
defaultcost option.
default 
defaultAs I said at the beginning, it reflects the wider economic environment.
default 
defaultThere is something to be said for showing that this does have a long
default-
defaultterm economic benefit and that it will save money and lead to more efficient services over the long term.
defaultQ338 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Oliver, your organisation suggests that the Public Services (Social Value) Act be amended to apply to any level of contract; is that right?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: That was a particular point we were seeking clarification on.
default 
defaultOur understanding is the Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act only applies above the EU procurement thresholds, which are €200,000 and are going up to €750,000 in the new procurement rules, which would take most of the contracts that reach the voluntary sector out of the scope of the Public Services (Social Value) Act.
default 
defaultWe felt that there was perhaps a contradiction there, because the spirit of the Public
default 
defaultServices (Social
default 
defaultValue) Act should apply, ideally, across the piece, even for those smaller community
default-
defaultbased projects that many of our organisations are delivering.
defaultQ339 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default You think it should apply to every service contract.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: It would make sense for the spirit of it 
defaultto apply across the board, yes.
defaultQ340 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Do you not think that is a lot of bureaucracy?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: The ideal way for it being applied—it is a conversation we have had previously—is around ensuring that the spirit of wider impact is taken on board.
default 
defaultIt does not necessarily require a huge amount of additional work in those contracts; it does not necessarily require a huge amount of additional questions in the contract.
default 
defaultIt is about embedding that into the core part of the contract so that this becomes the normal way of evaluating any contract: you look at price, but you also look at the social impact, and that does generate a saving.
defaultAn example might be an employment
default-
defaultrelated service, which could actually lead to savings on youth
default-
defaultcrime budgets or healthcare budgets.
default 
defaultIt does actually generate a saving, but it may come beyond the scope of that particular project.
default 
defaultIt is identifying ways that you can quantify those savings.
defaultQ341 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Some might argue that you are arguing against lowest
default-
defaultprice contract, but why not have a laissez
default-
defaultfaire approach and let local authorities get the service delivered as cheaply as possible?
default 
defaultSome would argue there is a premium attached to trying to root out social value within the contract and the local authority has to pay more to get more out of the contract.
default 
defaultWhy not let them 
defaultgo for the cheapest price and then use the savings they make to buy additional services?
default 
defaultWhat is wrong with that argument, Richard?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: If you specify your social benefit as part of the contract requirements—i.e. it goes into the specification—the cheapest price always has to be for the delivery of that whole specification, so you do not separate out the cost of the social value.
default 
defaultTo deliver the contract without the social value would not be meeting the contract objectives, if you follow the idea that you are including social value as part of the contract requirements.
default 
defaultHowever, the evidence from the big body of works contracts has been that these are being delivered without additional cost.
defaultFor example, the Glasgow
default 
defaultHousing
default 
defaultAssociation have delivered £2.3
default 
defaultbillion of works contracts in quite intricate housing regeneration with occupied homes—it is quite difficult stuff—and Savills have been doing annual evaluations of their cost outturns.
default 
defaultThey have delivered 60,000 person
default-
defaultweeks of work for apprentices and trainees at or below the market cost for doing the sort of work they have been doing; that has been independently assessed.
defaultThe key thing there is that it depends a bit on what the social
default-
defaultvalue requirement is.
default 
defaultFor training and employment, there is obviously other employment funding out there that contractors or clients can access.
default 
defaultThey can offset any additional costs by pulling in money from the Work
default 
defaultProgramme or Construction
default 
defaultSkills grants and so forth.
default 
defaultThere may be other types of social value: for example, requiring contractors to seek out local suppliers.
default 
defaultThey do not have to give them contracts, but going through the route of, say, going to Find
default-
defaultI
defaultt
default-
defaultI
defaultn
default-
defaultBirmingham, which is a database of Birmingham firms, and saying, “You must go and find this in Birmingham”, can actually reduce the contractor’s cost, because they find local suppliers instead of bringing them down the road from Leeds or somewhere.
defaultIt depends a lot on what it is you are specifying, what other resources are out there and what the cost impact of that is.
default 
defaultThere is evidence from works contracts on that, but not really from services.
defaultQ342 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Matthew, you were saying there were some good examples in Manchester City Council.
default 
defaultIf it is such good practice, why are the other nine councils in Greater Manchester not doing the same thing?
defaultMatthew Jackson:default It relates to the previous question.
default 
defaultA lot of it is about measurement of impact of things like social value.
default 
defaultWe do not have a standardised approach across local authorities for measuring wider economic, social and environmental impacts.
default 
defaultAt the moment, the case will be that a service will go out to contract; an organisation will start delivering that activity, but there is no real mechanism or means of highlighting the impact of, say, an apprenticeship scheme and what impact it has on addressing issues like unemployment within a particular locality.
default 
defaultThere is no formal contract monitoring process or continuous engagement with the supply chain, beyond the delivery of that particular service.
defaultIt is something that my organisation has been working on in terms of trying to develop things like outcomes frameworks or common sets of indicators, against which the performance of the supply chain can be monitored beyond the delivery of that service.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: I would add to what has been said.
default 
defaultIt is about generating efficiencies across the piece.
default 
defaultWe are not arguing that there should be more costly contracts; there are savings to be had across different budget lines.
defaultFor example, there is an organisation called Blue
default 
defaultSky
default 
defaultDevelopment and they work to employ ex
default-
defaultoffenders in maintenance and recycling contracts.
default 
defaultYou can actually quantify the saving for each of those people not reoffending, because we have calculated the cost of those prison places to be £41,000 per year.
default 
defaultIf those people are in meaningful employment, they are generating income and contributing to their society.
default 
defaultThere is a direct saving to the public purse; it is just across a number of budget lines.
defaultQ343 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Could I follow through on that example?
default 
defaultIt is possible, in a procurement exercise, to specify various things; it is impossible to specify others.
default 
defaultYou cannot specific local, but you can specify fresh, sustainable or something like that.
default 
defaultIn the case of prisoners, there is obviously added social value in dealing with ex
default-
defaultoffenders in that particular way.
default 
defaultIt is not a condition that you could write in to a contract, though, is it?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: The understanding we have is about how to develop good practice amongst contractors so that they are looking for those kinds of wider impacts.
default 
defaultIt comes back to the point about measurement and ensuring that when you go out to contract you can look at a wide range of different impacts, above and beyond the specific impact of the cost of that service.
defaultQ344 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Would it be possible to devise a contract where legitimately, under EU procurement rules, you would favour a contract that, say, did employ ex
default-
defaultoffenders, even though it might be slightly more expensive than one that did not?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: My understanding is that you would be able to favour social impact.
default 
defaultYou would not specify that it had to be ex
default-
defaultoffenders; you would not specify that it had to be a particular number of people; however, you could specify a social impact.
defaultIt is up to the provider to come up with a model that does actually make those savings.
default 
defaultProviders would look at across the piece.
default 
defaultIt may be ex
default-
defaultoffenders in this case; in another case it could be young people or other target groups.
defaultQ345 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Obviously, you looked at a whole range of procurement up and down the country.
default 
defaultHave you come across many instances of things going badly awry, where the contract is awarded and it is a blatant breach of EU procurement rules?
default 
defaultCan you think of examples?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: Local authority legal officers and procurement officers are very careful.
defaultJohn Pugh:default That is what I was getting at.
default 
defaultIf people were working at the margins or not risk averse, you would get that.
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: People are out there being very cautious about this and they have to be convinced that there is a legal way of doing it.
default 
defaultYou have mentioned that you cannot mention local.
default 
defaultYou have to unpick that decision, going back to 1988.
default 
defaultThe EU procurement rules are in favour of social value in contracts.
default 
defaultWhat you have to do is specify it in a way that means a contractor from anywhere across 
defaultEurope
default has an equal chance of bidding.
default 
defaultThe way they typically do that around training and employment—this could relate to the ex
default-
defaultoffenders issue—is to say, “You must recruit eight ex
default-
defaultoffenders from this agency”.
default 
defaultThat is something that a contractor from 
defaultPoland
default, 
defaultDurham
default or 
defaultLondon
default can do.
defaultIf there is a tendency to disadvantage non
default-
defaultlocal contractors in that, you have to provide a source for those people.
default 
defaultYou might say, “You can recruit eight ex
default-
defaultoffenders from this agency in Brixton.”
default 
defaultThat levels the playing field.
default 
defaultBidders from anywhere in 
defaultEurope
default can go to that agency; the service is open to all of them; they know what they have to do; they can price that if they want to.
default 
defaultThat 
defaultdoes not contravene, in my knowledge and experience, the EC procurement directives, because you have kept a level playing field.
defaultQ346 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Taking a broad
default-
defaultbrush view, do you think the general effect of EU procurement regulations has been to act as a kind of deadener or does it incentivise councils to do things more variably?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: There is a fear factor around it, particularly around the risk of challenge afterwards.
default 
defaultYou have to achieve quite a strong threshold of commitment and understanding before councils and their legal advisers are going to do this.
defaultQ347 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Let us quickly touch on the legal advisers.
default 
defaultLegal advisors, particularly on councils, in my experience, are generally cautious and trained a good while ago.
default 
defaultDo you think they are up to speed with revisions to EU regulations, or do you think they are trapped in the past?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: That is a very good point.
default 
defaultIt is about one of the things I mentioned before around awareness
default-
defaultraising and training for procurement officials and legal advisers.
default 
defaultThey often will think that the full scope of EU procurement rules applies in any contract, whereas, as you allude to, there are exceptions and thresholds under which you can be more flexible.
default 
defaultThat flexibility is not always used when it could be.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default It goes back to the culture of local
default 
defaultgovernment procurement officers.
default 
defaultWe effectively have two types of local
default 
defaultgovernment procurement people: those that are focused on transparency, compliance and risk management, and those that are focused on those three things, but, also, on the wider benefit that procurement can bring for a place, in terms of economic and social issues.
defaultJohn Pugh:default The ideal person has both features.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default Yes.
default 
defaultOn the question around training and skills development, procurement officers are taught a very particular trade around value for money, in its broadest sense, and price when it comes to procurement.
default 
defaultIf we are going to achieve wider social value through the procurement process, what we need is a more balanced set of skills within procurement teams, which reflects both that compliance with EU regulations but also the wider benefits that that process can bring.
defaultQ348 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default I am interested in whether you can give us some examples of where councils’ procurement systems and the culture of councils support local economies.
default 
defaultThe first question is this: do you think they do?
default 
defaultIf they do, could you give any examples where they are particularly loading social value into contracts?
default 
defaultIt would be very useful for the Committee to hear some specific examples that you have.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default It is dependent on the localities, to be honest.
default 
defaultWe have undertaken research with particular local authorities to try to understand where their spend is going and what impact it is having upon local economies, both at an individual level and also across 177 local authorities across the country.
default 
defaultThrough that research, what we have found is that, on average, local authorities will spend around 31% of their procurement spend with local businesses.
defaultWe have undertaken more specific and more individual bits of work, particularly with Manchester
default 
defaultCity
default 
defaultCouncil.
default 
defaultWe looked at their spend in 2008-09 to try to understand where £357
default 
defaultmillion of procurement money went.
default 
defaultWe found that 51.5% of that spend was within the 
defaultManchester
default local
default-
defaultauthority boundary, and the supply chain re
default-
defaultspent 25p in every pound they 
defaultreceived back in the 
defaultManchester
default economy.
default 
defaultWhat they have tried to do in 
defaultManchester
default is up the levels of local expenditure and influence the behaviour of the supply chain when it comes to wider benefits.
defaultOver the last three or four years, we have done a range of pieces of work with them.
default 
defaultWe have set up things like cross
default-
defaultdepartmental working groups where the priorities of different Departments across the authority are fed into the procurement process.
default 
defaultWe have set up suppliers’ networks, where we are trying organically to influence the behaviour of the supply chain, to think about the priorities of the authority.
default 
defaultWe have undertaken a range of work in areas of deprivation within the city, again with a focus on influencing the behaviour of the supply chain.
defaultA good example of that is in 
defaultArdwick
default, which is one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the city, where there is £43
default 
defaultmillion of public investment from the local authority going directly into that community.
default 
defaultWhat we have tried to do is get suppliers based in that locality to think differently about how they procure and recruit, and about wider environmental concerns as well.
default 
defaultThe upshot of that work is that we have seen local expenditure increase from 51.5% in 2008
default–
default09 to around about 63% in 2012
default–
default13.
defaultThere is an impact there not only in networks and engagement activity with the supply chain, but also in terms of some of the wider engagement work the City
default 
defaultCouncil have done in terms of simplifying some of the bureaucracy associated with pre
default-
defaultqualification questionnaires and in terms of developing particular portals.
defaultFor me, the starting point for any procurement exercise is understanding impact and understanding where your spend goes at the moment, as a local authority, with a view to implementing a range of strategic activities to enhance local spend.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: I have a concrete example for you.
default 
defaultWithin the voluntary sector, as you know, many organisations do operate at the local level and do engage very much in local spending and creating local employment.
default 
defaultThey will work to attract new resources into an area from foundations and individual volunteers, and build social capital.
default 
defaultIn fact, 75% of our members indicate that they consider their area of benefit to be local, whatever exactly that “local area” might mean.
default 
defaultThe expenditure of all of those local organisations is about £25
default 
defaultbillion in total, if you were to join them together.
defaultThe concrete example, to come to that, is one in York City Council called Café West.
default 
defaultPrior to the tender, the local council engaged voluntary organisations to look at what would be the best way to work with local people.
default 
defaultThey then went out to a tender that works directly with people with disabilities and therefore creates employment pathways for those people.
default 
defaultIt uses local produce, so it supports the local economy; it invests in local suppliers and builds a wider local partnership through the actual space.
default 
defaultThe council then offered a six
default-
defaultmonth rent
default-
defaultfree contract at the start, and it was a won by United
default 
defaultResponse, which is a voluntary
default-
defaultsector provider.
default 
defaultIt was a good example of that whole chain being locally driven.
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: Could I give you an example from Birmingham City Council, 
defaultfrom 
defaultabout two and a half years ago?
default 
defaultThey adopted a procurement policy for jobs and skills, which was a mandatory policy across the whole of the council, for everything it procured.
default 
defaultThere were thresholds for the different sorts of services where that had to be applied.
default 
defaultThey changed the ethos from the employability team trying to persuade individual procurement teams they should include employment and training to those teams having an obligation and coming, therefore, to the training team and saying, “We have an obligation to do it; how do we do it?
default 
defaultWhat do we do?”
default 
defaultOn the back of that, they now have procurement and legal officers who are skilled and experienced at putting clauses into contracts.
defaultIt is going beyond new things.
default 
defaultYou will have heard that the Library of Birmingham had 360 trainee and apprenticeship jobs for people from 
defaultBirmingham
default.
default 
defaultIt has spread to Network
default 
defaultRail’s New
default 
defaultStreet
default 
defaultStation contracts.
default 
defaultThey are now doing it across all their contracts.
default 
defaultIt has gone into the 25
default-
defaultyear roads maintenance contract.
default 
defaultIt is in the Constructing West Midlands Framework contract.
default 
defaultThey are talking about it with social services with the Green New Deal contracts.
defaultIt is spreading out into services and way beyond construction.
default 
defaultIt is a market leader in taking across the council’s approach and saying, “Do this.
default 
defaultIf you do not want to do it, you have to make the argument why not.”
default 
defaultThat comes back to leadership and policy; it came from the leader of the council saying, “We are going to do this.”
default 
defaultThe first thing they did was set up a clear procurement policy, then get all of the procurement teams around the council in for training to understand that.
default 
defaultThat continues to work today.
default 
defaultThere are other examples, but that is a prime one.
defaultQ349 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Richard, you started to touch on the next issue, which is skills and expertise, which, quite clearly, are significant matters for councils, council officers and, indeed, councillors.
default 
defaultCan I start with Matthew?
default 
defaultDo you think councils up and down the country actually have the staff with the abilities to deal with the complex world of modern
default-
defaultday procurement?
defaultMatthew Jackson:default It goes back to the point I started to touch on before.
default 
defaultIn terms of considerations around value for money and cost in its broadest senses, yes, the skills are there, but when it comes to wider benefit through procurement—i.e. the social
default-
defaultvalue issues we are talking about here today—the skills are not necessarily there.
default 
defaultTwo things need to happen to enable better skills within procurement teams.
default 
defaultOne is to recognise that procurement is a cycle.
default 
defaultIt goes from the commission stage and the design of services through to procurement strategy, pre
default-
defaultprocurement and delivery of the service.
default 
defaultThe social
default-
defaultvalue considerations need to come in a lot earlier.
default 
defaultIt is predominantly the role of the commissioners and the service designers to build in those social
default-
defaultvalue considerations.
defaultThe second thing is that procurement needs to become a much more cross
default-
defaultdepartmental activity.
default 
defaultWe need economic intelligence from economic
default 
defaultdevelopment and regeneration people feeding into the mindset and culture of procurement officers as well.
defaultThere is a need to re-stratify and realign the role of the procurement officer away from simply making a decision on the basis of cost and value for money, but also to be considerate of the wider economic and social challenges that a locality may face.
defaultQ350 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default On balance, you would say it is working in parts, but not in other parts.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default Yes.
defaultQ351 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Richard, you mentioned one council that clearly does seem to be addressing the issue, but I am looking across the board.
default 
defaultWhat would be your impression?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: My experience now, compared to 30 years ago, is that procurement officers are open to this, but they do not know how to do it.
default 
defaultThe first thing—a bit like we went through with John—is you have to present the argument to them in a logical way that overcomes their fears and concerns about European rules and so forth.
default 
defaultYou have to explain how to fit it in, and I have found them positive.
defaultThe second thing is that they need to network with new people.
default 
defaultFor example, around the routine procurement of care services, contract services or cleaning services, they work with officers that know about cleaning, construction or whatever it is.
default 
defaultWhatever social value you are looking at—it might be training; it might be small firms; it could be some other social value—they need to work with colleagues they have not worked with before.
defaultQ352 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Are you suggesting collaborating with other authorities?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: That could be one way of doing it.
default 
defaultThe danger of jointly purchasing is that contracts get bigger and bigger, and that becomes more difficult in another way for SMEs and small firms that traditionally provided services to bid.
default 
defaultLeaving that aside, yes, learning from others is quite important, as is the movement of procurement officers between authorities, carrying knowledge and experience with them.
defaultWhat I particularly had in mind was that a procurement officer needs to work with somebody who understands what the social-value requirement is.
default 
defaultIf that were, say, support for social enterprises, they would need to work with social
default-
defaultenterprise officers within the council or an external agency to understand what could go in the specification, what support there is out there to help contractors deliver it and how you would measure that.
default 
defaultIt is those practical, technical things around how you specify what you are trying to achieve in order to put it in the contract.
defaultAs Simon was saying, just let the thing roll.
default 
defaultAny contractor winning the contract has to deliver those outcomes.
defaultQ353 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default On that same subject, I would be interested in your response.
default 
defaultHowever, going a little bit further, is there actual room for councils to second people from either the voluntary sector, or indeed the private sector, to come in and help build up that skill base?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: That is a good suggestion; it is certainly something we have been promoting as an idea.
default 
defaultThere could be external recruitment or secondment, as you rightly say, in terms of bringing in that external expertise, and, beyond that, just having regular dialogue with the voluntary sector, social enterprises and other local stakeholders, so that the dialogue is a more natural one before a procurement exercise even takes place, to ensure that procurement officials understand the way those service
default-
defaultdeliverers are thinking and the kinds of challenges they might be facing.
default 
defaultThey can then structure the procurement in a way that actually suits and reflects the local need much better.
defaultWe very much agree with the idea of external recruitment and training for those existing commissioners.
default 
defaultThe Cabinet
default 
defaultOffice already runs the Commissioning
default 
defaultAcademy and we would like to see that expanded.
default 
defaultPerhaps it is something that could be done on a network basis in terms of a peer
default-
defaultlearning exchange between officials, but we would certainly be interested to see what could be possible.
defaultQ354 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are you referring to a point of reference to which procurement officers who are not quite certain whether they are doing things in the right way, or who want to innovate and are not quite clear on the boundaries, could go for particular advice and that sort of thing?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: Absolutely, yes.
default 
defaultAs we know, people’s way of interacting has changed.
default 
defaultPeople look online; they look on Twitter; they look on 
defaultFacebook
default.
default 
defaultIf there were ways that people could exchange good practice in a more informal way, it would certainly help, yes.
default 
defaultIf there were a way that could be through trusted networks of others who have been through the same sorts of issues, yes, that would help.
defaultQ355 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default I wonder if I might ask you about the transparency of the social
default-
defaultvalue objectives in the role of procurement.
default 
defaultNormally, in procurement, if you are a supplier and you provide the right goods or service at the right time at the right price, you are successful in picking up a particular contract, but you are introducing new ideas that many suppliers may be less familiar with.
default 
defaultHow can we make certain there is transparency at the outset in the letting of the contracts, so that a supplier who does provide the best price and who is not successful in a contract understands why that is?
default 
defaultI speak as somebody who ran a small business; if I came to an authority and gave the best deal but was not successful, I would struggle to understand why.
default 
defaultHow can we make it all transparent?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: We very much believe that transparency is important and actually improves performance over time.
default 
defaultCertainly, the opportunity to understand what kinds of contracts are being let will help in the future for others to understand what they might bid for, what they might be scored against and so on.
default 
defaultIt is important to have that transparency, both in terms of the initial procurement and the ongoing information about how many contracts are going to the voluntary sector.
defaultQ356 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Where a social
default-
defaultvalue objective is sought within a contract, are authorities letting those contracts in a sufficiently upfront and open way?
default 
defaultPotential suppliers must have enough information to understand, “You may come in at the best price, but you may not necessary get it.”
default 
defaultDo suppliers understand that?
defaultMatthew Jackson:default What we need here is a process of early engagement and market testing of particular opportunities.
default 
defaultThere are lots of services that could have social value attached to them, such as mental health or adult social
default-
defaultcare services.
default 
defaultThe key is to have early engagement at the commissioning stage, during the design of that service, with voluntary and community
default-
defaultsector organisations and the small
default-
defaultbusiness sector to highlight exactly what the local authority is seeking from that particular service and to engage a voluntary
default-
defaultsector organisation in the design of that service.
default 
defaultIt is really important to have that early engagement before we actually get to a formal tender process, to enable that transparency.
defaultQ357 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default How about the transparency with the successful contractors?
default 
defaultOnce the contract is let, does that process check up sufficiently that these social
default-
defaultvalue objectives are being achieved?
default 
defaultIt could easily be the case that somebody comes in with a higher price and nobody monitors the social
default-
defaultvalue bit.
default 
defaultOther potential contractors might feel pretty left out.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default This is the point I was making earlier.
default 
defaultYou often get to the award of a contract and the supplier will go away and deliver that service for three years.
default 
defaultThey may well be delivering a good service, but you have no means of monitoring the wider benefit that service is bringing in economic, social and environmental terms, which is why there is a need for a standardised set of indicators or means of monitoring the impact of provision, beyond the actual delivery of the service.
defaultOliver Henmandefault: There are a number of tools that exist to do precisely that: to measure the performance against social indicators.
default 
defaultSocial Return on Investment is one that is quite widely used, but there are other measurements that different bodies have come up with.
default 
defaultIt would certainly make sense and it is absolutely right that there should be regular evaluation and that it should also be published, so that people can see that the wider social impact is being achieved.
defaultOne of the things we also promote—you may know about it—is the use of the compact, which is an agreement that exists between the voluntary
default 
defaultsector and the Government that highlights some 
defaultof those ways of measuring and ensuring that you get the ongoing dialogue and monitoring through the life of the contract.
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: The simple answer is that you simply follow good procurement practice.
default 
defaultAt the beginning, Matthew referred to starting the contract with, “These are our objectives”.
default 
defaultIf you put the social
default-
defaultvalue bit at the beginning of the tender, it is not actually clear what you want the contractor to do.
default 
defaultIt is much better to say, “These are our objectives.
default 
defaultThis is what you have to deliver: this, this, this and this.”
default 
defaultYou then have some 
defaultmeasurables
default.
defaultQ358 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Is it your view that potential suppliers understand those objectives?
default 
defaultDo they buy in to those objectives?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: Initially, what you are doing is changing the market.
default 
defaultYou are tweaking the market not just to provide a service, but now provide a service and provide some social value, and this is the social value.
default 
defaultInitially, contractors will not know that.
default 
defaultSome will; some will not.
default 
defaultSome are very good.
default 
defaultIf you take the construction sector, where this has been happening widely—for example in Birmingham, the West of Scotland or South
default 
defaultWales—most contractors will have met many tenders with employment and training requirements or supply
default-
defaultchain requirements in them.
default 
defaultThey are used to dealing with that and they know how to respond.
default 
defaultThey virtually expect to see it and they have mechanisms set up for doing it.
default 
defaultThat is not to say that all contractors do that.
default 
defaultThe importance of having an agency they should work with to help deliver the outcomes will help those who are not used to doing it to do it.
defaultQ359 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default How capable do you think small businesses are of achieving those objectives?
defaultRicharddefault defaultMacfarlanedefault: They are more capable than they think they are.
default 
defaultComing back to construction, where most of this has happened, most traineeships and apprenticeships happen in small firms.
default 
defaultFrom the construction
default-
defaultskills point of view, that is where most of the opportunities are.
default 
defaultThey have a capability; they know the systems and so forth.
default 
defaultIt is actually the big boys who do not do any of that, because they are just managing the whole contract.
default 
defaultThey are more capable, but they are very loud in saying, “We should not be expected to do this”.
defaultCouncillors—and yourselves, I would imagine—get quite a lot of flak about, “This is not right; we should not be expected to do this.
default 
defaultWe should be able to employ who we want.”
default 
defaultTruthfully, if you set it out in the tender, “This is what we are now buying”, and it goes in the OJEU notice and the contract notice, you give a score for how much weighting that issue is going to have in the award of the contract as part of the quality, and then you monitor it.
defaultOne of the things on monitoring is that, if you have Social Return on Investment or Local Multiplier and other things, it requires an awful lot of data and an awful lot of time to analyse.
default 
defaultIt is not realistic to do those across all contracts.
default 
defaultWhat you can do is put in measures.
default 
defaultIf you take on five apprentices, you need to be able to monitor that simple requirement.
default 
defaultWho are they?
default 
defaultWhere are they?
default 
defaultCan I meet them?
default 
defaultCan I see them?
default 
defaultHow many weeks do they have?
default 
defaultYou can devise mechanisms.
default 
defaultThat is where people working in the sector can help you devise the appropriate mechanisms.
default 
defaultHowever, you have to stick to the normal processes.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default It is important to have an ongoing understanding and relationship with your supply chain to enable these social
default-
defaultvalue considerations to come to the fore.
default 
defaultOne of the key things that we have done around procurement is to try to understand local business bases and exactly the types of goods and services that small businesses and voluntary and community
default-
defaultsector organisations can provide for a local authority.
default 
defaultThere is a two
default-
defaultway relationship here, in 
defaultthat local authorities need to understand more effectively who is based in their local economy and what types of service they can provide.
defaultAlso, however, organisations from the voluntary and community sector need to understand more effectively what local government actually procures and what types of services they can actually deliver, which is a key balance to be met as well.
defaultQ360 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I was going to ask the question of the NCVO as well.
default 
defaultReply to the point you want to make, as well.
default 
defaultYou mentioned in your evidence that, for some very low
default-
defaultvalue contracts, it might be better to go back to the old way of doing things and give an organisation a grant and let them get on with it, monitoring that over the course of a year.
default 
defaultDo we have some examples now where, perhaps, initiative has been squeezed out of smaller organisations?
default 
defaultIt was Supporting
default 
defaultPeople where organisations came forward and did not really say, “We can deliver this service”, but said, “This is a new service that we think would be appropriate; this is how we can deliver it; can you give us a grant towards it?”
default 
defaultAre we in danger of squeezing that sort of initiative out by putting everything out to competitive tender?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: I have two points.
default 
defaultOn that specific question, the area we were looking at is the potential higher cost of managing, overseeing and monitoring the contract.
default 
defaultAs you say, if it is a relatively low
default-
defaultvalue contract, in some cases the economics of it do not stack up.
default 
defaultYou end up spending more time and it taking more investment from the council to actually do the monitoring of the contract than it would have cost if it were simply a grant.
default 
defaultThat was why we said, in some cases, some of the smaller projects would benefit from a grant instead.
defaultThere are cases where that can happen.
default 
defaultHowever, we do still think the point of monitoring effectiveness is absolutely crucial, and we would never advocate for not demonstrating that impact.
default 
defaultMany of our organisations do that sort of impact assessment in their day
default-
defaultto
default-
defaultday work anyway, whether or not they are procured or receiving funding from a local authority.
default 
defaultWe would certainly continue to advocate for strong impact measurement.
default 
defaultI agree with the point Matthew made earlier about impact measurement and the different models for impact measurement.
defaultI was going to add something to the previous question, which ties this together.
default 
defaultIf you need to train up the procurement officials on one side, there may also be a need for training for some of those suppliers to understand the new types of commissioning priorities that are being looked for.
default 
defaultOne of the things that would be interesting is to see whether you could, as part of that ongoing dialogue both before and during a contract, actually run sessions where the local stakeholders and procurement officials are able to discuss informally some of the key areas they may have, and some of the needs they may be looking to address within that area.
defaultQ361 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default I have one specific question about the community right to challenge, which is relevant to what you were just saying.
default 
defaultTo what extent are the existing procurement and commissioning processes that we have providing a disincentive to local voluntary—sector organisations for actually taking up the right to challenge?
default 
defaultIs that your experience?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: That is an interesting question.
default 
defaultIt certainly has not been as widely used as many people expected, yes.
default 
defaultWe have some evidence to show that only 22 rights to challenge were formally launched.
defaultJames Morris:default Is that 22 across the country?
defaultOliver Henmandefault: Yes.
default 
defaultAcross the country, only 22 have been through the process formally.
default 
defaultOf those, nine were rejected and two were accepted.
default 
defaultIt does seem to indicate, as you say, that there 
defaultis some limit to the ability to use that challenge, and that some councils are not feeling there is any obligation on them to respond to that challenge, because it does not necessarily fit within the standard procurement process.
defaultHowever, there is some evidence—it is harder to quantify—from members to say that the ability to refer to the right to challenge allows them to begin a conversation with the council that they would not otherwise have been able to begin.
default 
defaultAlthough we have only seen 22 actual formal processes, it may be the case that in other cases people are raising particular needs and the councils are responding less formally, rather than going through a full right to challenge.
default 
defaultThe evidence we have is that the right to challenge is sometimes seen as creating unnecessary confrontation.
default 
defaultActually, if things can be resolved less formally, sometimes they can be.
default 
defaultSometimes the particular need a community organisation has identified can be picked up in other ways.
default 
defaultIt is harder to quantify that, but we would certainly like to see more use of that opportunity for organisations to take on local services.
defaultMatthew Jackson:default From a local government perspective, local authorities are actively seeking to avoid going to challenge through trying to understand their market more effectively when it comes to the voluntary and community sector.
default 
defaultThey are implementing better engagement activities with the voluntary and community sector within their locality to avoid going through that exact challenge process.
defaultOne of the other challenges with the challenge is that it opens up the market a little bit.
default 
defaultIf you are highlighting that you want to deliver a library service, for example, you are opening yourself up to a full tender exercise that often involves large private
default-
defaultsector organisations engaging in that process.
default 
defaultYou will not necessarily have any winners, if you like, in the voluntary and community sector by challenging the provision of those services.
default 
defaultIt is more effective to have a relationship between the local
default-
defaultauthority commissioning people and the voluntary and community sector in place to enable better outcomes.
defaultChair:default Thank you
default all
default very much for coming and giving evidence this afternoon.
default 
defaultIt is appreciated.
default 
defaultThank you.
defaultPanel Two: Questions 3default62default–3default85defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault, Chairman, Local Government Policy Unit, Federation of Small Businesses, 
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault, Director, Market Dojo, and 
defaultDr Pedro defaultTellesdefault, 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultBangor
default, gave evidence.
defaultQ362 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you all for coming to give evidence to us as our second panel.
default 
defaultJust for our records, could you indicate your name and the organisation that you represent?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: I am Martin
default 
defaultMcTague
default, from the Federation of Small Businesses.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: I am 
defaultAlun
default 
defaultRafique
default; I am a Director from Market
default 
defaultDojo.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I am Dr
default 
defaultPedro 
defaultTelles
default; I am a lecturer at Bangor
default 
defaultUniversity.
defaultQ363 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you for coming.
default 
defaultCould I just begin with a subject where we have perhaps had slightly different points of view expressed by yourselves and your organisations?
default 
defaultIt is about councils 
defaulttrying to achieve greater opportunities for SMEs and 
defaultmicrobusinesses
default to obtain contracts, and the extent to which there is a potential conflict between that and the council getting the best value for money from its contracts.
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: We did an extensive research exercise amongst our members and what that demonstrated was that there was a 58% improvement in what you could call the 
defaultstickability
default—in other words, the amount of the value of a contract that stayed within community where the contract was let.
default 
defaultThere was real evidence that it produced value in that community, inasmuch as there was better social cohesion, small businesses took on a wider range of employees and there was clearly a growth in the local economy, because of the added value that was retained.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: Market
default 
defaultDojo is an SME, but we also supply e-sourcing systems.
default 
defaultWe received a grant from the Technology
default 
defaultStrategy
default 
defaultBoard to help develop our tool to assist local
default 
defaultgovernment in the adoption of e
default-
defaultsourcing from a buyer and a supplier side and encourage innovation.
default 
defaultIn fact, we see both sides of the coin, as it were.
defaultIn terms of applying for contracts, as an SME we see that there are some councils with which we are involved, such as Bedford
default 
defaultCouncil or Shropshire
default 
defaultCouncil, who have used an appropriate level of competition for the tender we have been applying for.
default 
defaultOther councils—for example, Mole
default 
defaultValley
default 
defaultCouncil or Worcester
default 
defaultCounty
default 
defaultCouncil—have used a very onerous procedure for low
default-
defaultvalue tenders.
default 
defaultAs an SME, it can really put you off applying for these tenders and take up a lot of time and money.
defaultTo give you an example, at Worcester
default 
defaultCounty
default 
defaultCouncil, their tender was broken up into a questionnaire that was very onerous and the scoring seemed to be more aimed at, for example, support organisations.
default 
defaultOne of the questions was, “How big is your support organisation?” rather than, “Is it appropriate for the size of the tender that you are bidding for?”
default 
defaultThe price
default-
defaultscoring mechanisms were incorrectly named and non
default-
defaultlinear, which can create issues for a buyer, when they are setting up the tender, to understand how a scoring mechanism is going to react and, from the supplier side, to understand what is going to happen when you apply for a tender.
default 
defaultThey were also not able to take account of innovation during the tender procedure, which is where you can create real value for local councils.
defaultUnfortunately, we have seen a lot of councils going through a very onerous procedure for tendering and some councils use a very appropriate procedure.
default 
defaultWith regards to the question, sometimes SMEs can be put off and sometimes they are engaged with.
default 
defaultIt seems to be very much a lottery to see what is actually going to happen in the long run.
default 
defaultUltimately, these kinds of onerous procedures can put SMEs off tendering; they can take up a lot of time and money; and they can actually put some SMEs out of business.
default 
defaultYou also get issues with aggregation of requirements and framework agreements, which can also remove SMEs from tendering for these kinds of opportunities.
default 
defaultI know we are going to discuss some of that later.
defaultFrom our side, we have very much seen a mixture in terms of whether they encourage SMEs.
default 
defaultCertainly, a lot of the time they do not really know how to take account of innovation in the process.
default 
defaultSMEs are the reason why a lot of large companies fail and yet local government procurement does not take account of this very well in the process.
defaultWe developed an innovation portal as part of our tool to help local councils bring innovation into the council.
default 
defaultWe had a lot of discussion with Bristol
default 
defaultCouncil around this, because we are part of 
defaultBristol
default, and there was a big push to involve local suppliers there.
default 
defaultUnfortunately, however, it has just ended up being discussions and has not gone anywhere.
default 
defaultWe have had a really mixed view.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default For my background, I would say that, more than creating opportunities specifically for SMEs or micro-companies, the important bit is to find new procedures and new ways to award contracts, which solve the problems you have highlighted very well and are more attuned to the needs of low
default-
defaultvalue contracts.
default 
defaultTaking on board your comments, what you faced was something that is very common, whereby the contracting authority took a procedure that had been designed for very expensive contracts above the EU thresholds and decided to apply it to a low
default-
defaultvalue contract.
default 
defaultWhen that happens, obviously SMEs are going to be more disadvantaged, because the opportunity and transaction costs are felt more highly by SMEs.
defaultBefore we start discussing whether we should do it like the Americans do, which is to reserve certain contracts for minorities or for SMEs, or whether we should have a specific regime that favours SMEs in public procurement, there is still a lot that could and should be done at the procedural level and the requirements that are set for low
default-
defaultvalue contracts.
defaultQ364 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have gone on to argue that some authorities are really doing no more than engaging protectionist policies under the guise of helping local economies and that, if all authorities do this, there is no overall benefit but probably an extra cost, in that you are not getting the best
default-
defaultvalue contractors bidding for work.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I was surprised when I came to the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultI used to be a lawyer in 
defaultPortugal
default and 
defaultSpain
default and I worked a lot in public procurement.
default 
defaultEspecially in 
defaultSpain
default, I was used to the regionalism.
default 
defaultI used to be a lawyer in 
defaultBarcelona
default and the Catalans would say, “We want to keep Catalan money in 
defaultCatalonia
default.
default 
defaultWe do not want to have companies from 
defaultMadrid
default winning our business.” I was expecting that, but, when I came here to the 
defaultUK
default, I found out that this was happening not only at the regional level, but it was also happening at the county and local level.
defaultIn the long run, when you look at what is happening now with the budget cuts in local authorities, if we start imposing barriers, whereby every single local contracting authority starts to favour, in one way or another, their local supplier base, what will happen is that no
default-
defaultone is going to grow, because even if they get 100% of that local pie, two years or five years down the line the local pie is going to shrink and they will not be able to win business elsewhere.
default 
defaultGood companies will not be able to grow.
default 
defaultIn my view, that is a recipe for disaster.
default 
defaultThat is what I wanted to highlight in my submission.
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: I would fundamentally disagree with that.
default 
defaultWhat we are seeing is that councils, at the same time, will be spending money on procurement.
default 
defaultThey could take a low
default-
defaultcost view; they could take the view that they are going to drive down costs by maybe increasing lot sizes and aggregating, but it is counterproductive.
default 
defaultAt the same time, they are trying to spend on economic development in the same areas.
default 
defaultThe effect of driving down the price and disadvantaging small businesses in their own area is only depressing growth within their own area, as well, which they then have to counteract by spending more money.
default 
defaultIt is perfectly rational not to advantage small businesses, but to take away unnecessary barriers.
defaultThere were four fairly simple recommendations that came out of our own research.
default 
defaultYou simplify the PQQ process and make it much more straightforward and standardised.
default 
defaultYou break down major contracts into lots.
default 
defaultYou have to go out there and try to engage with the small
default-
defaultbusiness community.
default 
defaultWe found that something like 70% of small businesses were not interested in engaging with local councils.
default 
defaultIn fact, it was easier to get them to export than to get them to trade with their local councils.
default 
defaultYou have to go out and actively engage with them.
default 
defaultThe final thing, which is a big incentive, is you say, “If you are going to get paid quickly, pass that on.”
default 
defaultMany councils do pay very quickly to their tier
default-
defaultone, prime contractors.
default 
defaultWith 
defaultWakefield
default, we saw that it was very 
defaulteasy to include a contract term that meant they had to pass on those quite swift payment terms to their tier
default-
defaulttwo and tier
default-
defaultthree suppliers.
default 
defaultThat has a dramatic effect on take
default-
defaultup within the community.
defaultQ365 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default How does collaboration by councils across geographical areas impact on the ability of small organisations to do business with those councils?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: From our experience, it has not been excellent.
default 
defaultFor example, we are involved with an ESPO tender where they aggregated the requirements for several local councils.
default 
defaultThey were actually looking for e
default-
defaultprocurement systems.
default 
defaultThey aggregated the requirements and they broke them down into the systems they were looking for: e
default-
defaultauctions, e
default-
defaulttendering, etc.
default 
defaultThere were five different requirements.
default 
defaultAs a provider of these systems, we thought we could really help local
default 
defaultgovernment procurement.
default 
defaultWe had some great success with Bedford
default 
defaultCounty
default 
defaultCouncil, where they had existing sourcing systems that were difficult to adopt and we added value.
default 
defaultThey used our system for a month and saved a great deal of revenue.
defaultWe thought we were perfect for this framework agreement.
default 
defaultThey had broken it down into various areas.
default 
defaultHowever, in the same tender documentation they then said, “If you are going to apply for this, we actually want to reduce the number of suppliers who can apply for it, and we want to make sure that any supplier who applies for this aggregates these things together.”
default 
defaultThe knock
default-
defaulton effect of that is that the only suppliers who can then apply for that tender are the largest suppliers.
default 
defaultSince it was also a framework agreement to supply procurement systems to local councils, it would just exacerbate the problem and proliferate the issue with local councils using the same procurement systems, which are slightly cumbersome to use and may make it more onerous for SMEs to take part.
default 
defaultThat was an example of where they had aggregated and it had put SMEs off tendering, because they simply could not.
defaultWe have also seen other examples such as a 
defaultWest Sussex
default open day, where they were asking suppliers for advice on their procurement systems, and also the London Procurement Partnership.
default 
defaultHowever, the result of that was they came up with a tender documentation saying, “You need to provide all of this”, instead of breaking it down into constituent parts, again eliminating the ability for an SME to take part.
defaultOn these collaborations, it is also worth mentioning that you have things like G
default-
defaultCloud and the Dynamic
default 
defaulteMarketplace
default, which are essentially framework agreements.
default 
defaultThey are very good ideas, and you can be part of these.
default 
defaultWe have been part of it, and it takes time and effort to be part of it.
default 
defaultHowever, we have not had opportunities come from it.
default 
defaultYou can further add that each local council has a different portal for its own procurement.
default 
defaultYou try to be a part of each of these, because it is important.
default 
defaultIn the end, the question to you would be, “How many framework agreements and portals does a company need to be a part of for the same requirement to be able to get business?”
default 
defaultIt takes a lot of time and money to manage these kinds of things.
defaultAll in all, we have not seen the framework and collaboration side of things as being that beneficial, unfortunately.
default 
defaultG
default-
defaultCloud and the Dynamic
default 
defaulteMarketplace
default are a step in the right direction, but you need a bit more common sense applied to that.
default 
defaultThe SMEs can offer a lot of innovation, which is really important.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default Building upon that, if you look at collaboration by itself it means, as you are probably implying, you are going to have less contracts available and the contracts are going to be bigger.
default 
defaultThe bigger a contract is, the more difficult it is for an SME or a micro-company to win that business.
default 
defaultThat is clear.
default 
defaultThat is one way of looking at things.
defaultThe other way to look at it is if you have collaboration of councils and a little bit more centralisation, you are going to have procurers who are going to be more expert.
default 
defaultYou are going to have people who are going to be more trained and more able to deliver good procurement.
default 
defaultIf you use that work, especially with the use of e-procurement, and you start to advertise lower
default-
defaultvalue contracts, which currently are not being advertised across the 
defaultUK
default, you open a huge number of opportunities for SMEs to bid directly for those contracts.
defaultFor example, look at the data published by the European
default 
defaultCommission regarding 2010
default&#x2011;
default11.
default 
defaultIn the 
defaultUK
default, only 25% of contracts are above the EU thresholds.
default 
defaultThe other 75% have a value that is below the thresholds.
default 
defaultBelow the threshold, pretty much every contracting authority can do what they want, obviously with the caveat that now Government Departments and Ministries are forced or supposed to advertise contracts above £10,000.
default 
defaultOther than that, any other contracting local authority may do what they want.
default 
defaultIf they pool those resources together and start to advertise those contracts, in the end you may have more contracts altogether being advertised that are more attuned to the needs of SMEs.
defaultQ366 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default The skills, expertise and the experience of councils and their council officers clearly matters.
default 
defaultHow do you rate the ability of councils to deal with small suppliers and small businesses and their capacity?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: What we found was that it was generally pretty good—surprisingly good.
default 
defaultThere were more examples of good practice than bad.
default 
defaultHowever, there was nobody doing everything they could do.
default 
defaultFor example, with splitting into lots, only 39% of councils had actively participated in splitting down major contracts into lots, which is quite poor.
default 
defaultSpreading that good practice would be relatively easy.
defaultHowever, the biggest factor we saw—I know other witnesses to the Committee have said the same thing—is this risk aversion, which seems to stifle a lot of what goes on in this area.
default 
defaultIt is not like these guys do not know what to do.
default 
defaultIt is that, in this very tense environment of local
default 
defaultgovernment at the moment, they are more frightened of losing their job.
default 
defaultSometimes, the responsibility for that situation may fall on members.
default 
defaultMembers have to say, “We are going to back the officers to be more innovative, to take a few more risks and take the opportunity to engage with small business”, because that will carry a bit more risk, but it carries a lot more benefits.
defaultQ367 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Does your own organisation have a role to play in this?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: Yes, we do.
defaultQ368 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default If you could do more, what should you be doing?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: We should be spreading the word and spreading the gospel of good practice around local
default 
defaultgovernment.
default 
defaultThat is our role in this: to be a bit of an evangelist.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: I generally agree.
default 
defaultIt seems as though there are a lot of good people out there.
default 
defaultThere just seems to be some confusion about what processes they should use for the size of the tenders.
default 
defaultA lot of the challenges have been because, as you mentioned beforehand, they have taken an OJEU procedure and applied it small
default-
defaultvalue tenders, which is very expensive for an SME in terms of time and effort to bid for these.
default 
defaultSuppliers also fear the repercussions of making the wrong decisions.
default 
defaultThey try to use belt and braces, and make the process far too complex, which is not good for them, because it takes a long time to take part in this.
defaultIn a lot of local government procurement, it does seem as though people are scared to pick up the phone and speak to the suppliers before the process to understand what innovation can be taken with part of the tender to structure it better.
default 
defaultIn terms of the aggregation, ESPO aggregated the requirements and streamlined the SLAs, which is a great idea, but, in terms of going back out to tender, they should have still made it available to the SMEs and larger companies, because there are a lot of benefits to be had from that.
defaultAll in all, the skills are there, but we need a bit more guidance on what is appropriate for the size of the tender so that people feel confident about running a tender that way, without the risk of something going wrong.
defaultQ369 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Would secondment from the private or voluntary sector into councils help that, or is it an internal matter for councils?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: It would definitely help to an extent, as long as the people who are seconded in have the guidance on what they are allowed to do within the public sector.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default When it comes to skills and expertise, there is a huge range of people and skills.
default 
defaultOne of the biggest problems with procurement is that procurement is something people fall into, especially in local
default 
defaultgovernment.
default 
defaultIt is a function; it is not a profession that you take from the start of your career and you do it for your entire career, as it is in the private sector.
default 
defaultIn the public sector, the people I talk to, both at the corporate level in local
default 
defaultgovernment and also below it, are people who, one way or another, got into that function for whatever reason in their careers.
defaultRegarding the skills themselves, there are at least two reports from John
default 
defaultMcClelland—one on Scotland from 2006 or 2007 and another on Wales from last year—that clearly highlight the lack of skills in local authorities when it comes down to procurement.
default 
defaultIn my view, the biggest problem is that we have too many people doing procurement.
default 
defaultYou should have less people responsible for bigger chunks of the budget in local authorities instead of having very much devolved organisations inside the councils, which allow people at the bottom ranks to make purchasing decisions.
default 
defaultThat is my take on it.
defaultRegarding risk aversion, I am going to use an American joke: no
default-
defaultone was ever fired for buying from IBM.
default 
defaultI can understand why someone in the same position in a council would go with the bigger company instead of a smaller company.
default 
defaultI am not saying that I agree, but I can understand.
default 
defaultAt the end of the day, if you are only promoted on the grounds that you do not make any mistakes and you do not bring the council into disrepute by having bad news about your procurement in the papers, you are obviously going to be risk-averse; that is what is going to happen.
defaultThat is for the procurers.
default 
defaultIn addition to the procurers, you have to bear in mind there are more people involved in the procurement process who are not procurement officers.
default 
defaultFor example, you have risk managers and risk managers are paid to manage risk.
default 
defaultManaging risk means minimising it as much as it can be minimised.
default 
defaultObviously, for a risk manager, what happens to the local supplier base and local SMEs is irrelevant, because they are not promoted on the basis of that metric.
default 
defaultThey are promoted on the basis of the metric of not creating problems for the council and reducing the risk.
defaultIn addition to the risk managers—we have seen this with the work that we have done with local councils in Wales—especially when it comes to insurance, it is actually not the risk manager’s responsibility or final decision in the insurance policies that are demanded, especially in low
default-
defaultvalue contracts.
default 
defaultIt is actually something that is set by the insurance policies that cover the 
defaultcouncil.
default 
defaultIt is very hard to change that practice, and I do not know exactly where you should start—whether you should start with the procurers or with the other stakeholders who are involved in any way, shape or form with the process.
defaultQ370 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Is there any merit, then, in trying to second from the private sector or the voluntary sector into councils to try to change that culture?
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I have two comments on that.
default 
defaultFirstl
defaulty, I was a lawyer, and I still—
defaultJohn Stevenson:default You are risk-averse, then.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I am risk-averse in certain circumstances.
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Spoken like a lawyer there.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default Once a lawyer, always a lawyer.
default 
defaultIt is true.
default 
defaultAlun
default mentioned a good example: councils should talk more with suppliers.
default 
defaultTo a certain extent, yes, if you are the one picking up the phone, you say, “Yes, I want to be contacted, so I can influence the way that the tenders are designed.”
default 
defaultHowever, imagine that the council does not call you, but it calls one of your competitors, and the tender is designed in a way that suits your competitor and not you.
default 
defaultYou would be crying foul, because the tender had been skewed in the favour of the person who talked to the council.
defaultPersonally, I am very much of the position that we should keep separate what should remain separate, which is the business
default-
defaultdevelopment side of things and the procurement functions within the council.
defaultMy final answer is that, no, I do not think the secondment of private or voluntary
default-
defaultsector staff in councils would be very positive in the long run.
defaultQ371 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default I was talking to a company in my constituency the other day who were complaining about the local authority procurement process.
default 
defaultThey had received four identical documents in the course of this tendering process and they calculated that it had reached the point where they had spent so much money on conforming to the requirements that had come out of this particular local authority that it now meant it was not profitable for them to continue with it.
default 
defaultHow common is it in local government that, because of this risk aversion you were talking about, we end up in a situation where totally valid small and medium
default-
defaultsized businesses make the judgement it is not worth them pursuing a tender because of the onerous compliance requirements that are placed upon them?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: It is very common.
default 
defaultIt is one of the biggest factors that came out of our research.
default 
defaultIt is driven by risk aversion.
default 
defaultIt is driven by the idea that if you stack an enormous PQQ at the beginning of the process you will somehow insulate yourself from risk.
default 
defaultThere is the opposite reaction of, “You should get rid of PQQs”.
default 
defaultHowever, the tender would then become infinitely more complex and difficult.
default 
defaultIn the end, it comes back to John’s point earlier: it is about leadership.
default 
defaultIt is about saying, “We see a bigger picture here—not just shaving a few pennies off the price of your paperclips.
default 
defaultWe want to show leadership and show some commitment to smaller businesses.”
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: It is also that you should just apply an appropriate level of competition.
default 
defaultWe find that a lot of tenders these days are very onerous and they do not have to be.
default 
defaultIt is surprisingly common.
default 
defaultYou can reduce the tender depending on the size of the opportunity.
default 
defaultThat is where the public sector needs some guidance in terms of what is acceptable for that.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default One of the things we have done in 
defaultBangor
default is take on exactly that problem and tackle it head on.
default 
defaultAt Bangor
default 
defaultUniversity, we are of the opinion that low
default-
defaultvalue contracts should be advertised.
default 
defaultThey should not only be awarded via request for quotes, whereby only two, three or five companies are invited.
default 
defaultEveryone should have an opportunity to bid for that contract.
default 
defaultWhat we do not agree is that for a £10,000 or £20,000 contract the level of detail and information required should be identical to that which is required for a £100,000, £200,000 or £2 million contract.
default 
defaultIt does not make sense.
defaultWhat we have done is gone back to the drawing board and designed from scratch what we call a simplified open procedure, whereby we are able to award contracts in less than 40 days from start to finish.
default 
defaultWe eliminated everything that was unnecessary; the selection stage, the PQQ, was gone.
default 
defaultObviously, we require self-declaration, as it is going to be mandatory from 2016, when the new directives come in.
default 
defaultWe require a self-declaration saying, “Yes, we have the insurance levels.
default 
defaultYes, we have the policies you require.”
defaultAt the end of the day, what we want to identify is the best bid, not the best bidder.
default 
defaultWhat tends to happen with PQQs, which is why they are so long and drawn-out, is PQQs are used to identify the best bidder, which—unfortunately, because we are all biased—means people are going to look at the bid influenced by the decisions that have been taken at the selection stage and say, “This company was the best bidder; why do they not have the best bid?
default 
defaultPerhaps we can skew the results a little bit and change the numbers.”
defaultI do not think this has happened in practice, but I know that in 
defaultPortugal
default and 
defaultSpain
default people who are involved in selecting bidders at the start cannot be involved in selecting the bids at the end and making a final decision.
default 
defaultThe reason for that is precisely to avoid the bias.
default 
defaultI see that every day when I am marking my students’ exams.
default 
defaultFor example, I am not authorised or entitled to know which student’s script I have in front of me.
default 
defaultI need to evaluate the exam on the merits of what is written and not on the merits of the candidate, who I may know.
default 
defaultIt is the same thing with procurement.
default 
defaultYou are supposed to identify and award the contract to the best bid, not the best bidder.
defaultBasically, what we have done at Bangor was to reduce the timescales, remove what was not necessary, simplify the procedure, use e
default-
defaultprocurement, obviously, do everything online and, for example, impose word limits, which is a very sensible thing to do.
default 
defaultAt least this is what we do with the essays of our students.
defaultSo far, the pilots we have done in two councils, Carmarthenshire
default 
defaultCounty
default 
defaultCouncil and Gwynedd
default 
defaultCouncil, have been very successful.
default 
defaultIt can be done.
default 
defaultThere is nothing in the law to say that it cannot be done.
defaultQ372 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default To follow up, Pedro, during your evidence you said that the individual council officers who select people to bid should not be those making the final decision on who is accepted.
default 
defaultDo you also accept the principle that, if you employ a consultant or a set of consultants, they should not be allowed to bid on the contract after they have given advice on setting up a bid process?
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default That comes back to the discussion of the problem of who is going to pick up the phone if the local authority makes a phone call to learn how they should draft the tender.
default 
defaultThere have been some cases, at least over the threshold cases in the European
default 
defaultCourt
default 
defaultof
default 
defaultJustice, which seem to imply that unless the technical specifications are skewed in favour of the consultant that drafted them, the consultant should be entitled to take part.
default 
defaultThe problem is that it is going to be pretty much impossible to prove that.
default 
defaultIt is one of those tests that the European
default 
defaultCourt
default 
defaultof Justice 
defaulthas created that, for me, does not make a lot of sense.
default 
defaultAt the moment, however, it is where things stand.
defaultWhat would I say if I was advising a council?
default 
defaultI would say, “Have them as consultants; do not allow them to bid.
default 
defaultOtherwise you may have problems in the future.”
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: On the subject of picking up the phone, the flipside of the coin is that no one picks up the phone, you do the same tender you have done for the last 15 times and you end up with the same result and the same suppliers taking the bid.
defaultThere is an appropriate level of due diligence you do before a tender.
default 
defaultIf you are going out and looking at a solution, and you want to see whether you have the right structure, you do not pick up the phone to one supplier; you pick up the phone to 10 suppliers.
default 
defaultYou go and look at what innovation is out there before structuring your tender, so that when your tender comes in you know you have taken account of innovation, especially if we are talking about the SME market.
default 
defaultThe SME market is all about innovation.
default 
defaultYou want to take part in that.
default 
defaultIf you do not pick up the phone, you are left with a real challenge.
defaultWith respect to whether you let them also bid for the tender, it is a very difficult question, and you need to apply some common sense.
default 
defaultIt would be very difficult to apply hard
default-
defaultand
default-
defaultfast rules about that, because it depends upon the people who have helped to create the tender opportunity.
defaultQ373 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default The problem is someone thinking, “This is already wired to this particular company, because, after all, they have written the specification for the authority and so, naturally, they will write the specification around what products or services they can provide.”
default 
defaultMaybe other people can provide the same service, but not necessarily.
default 
defaultThey may skew it to make certain things mandatory that other companies cannot do.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: There could be several ways around that: do not just involve one consultant from one area, but consultants from different areas or an independent consultant.
default 
defaultThe person who is managing the process might simply be careful about the way these things are structured.
default 
defaultCertainly, that type of process could easily be abused, but, if there is some common sense around the process, it could be mitigated as well, and it is all about risk mitigation.
default 
defaultTo say, “You are not allowed to bid”, to anyone who helps the tender or picks up the phone—
defaultBob Blackman:default Sorry, I am not talking about the people who pick up the phone.
default 
defaultIf they are employed to provide this, should they then be excluded from a tender process?
default 
defaultThat is the specific; do you agree or not?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: I would say that it would depend.
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: My view is pretty clear: if they are SMEs, the chances are that they are not going to be in a position to corrupt the process, but I see a lot of very powerful consultancy firms manipulating the playing field for their advantage.
default 
defaultI would not have any hesitation in excluding them.
defaultQ374 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Can I ask about small businesses who are involved in multiple
default-
defaultcontract bids having to complete multiple pre
default-
defaulttender qualifications?
default 
defaultShould it not be the case that, if you are accepted by a major authority, it ought to be good enough for lots of subsequent authorities?
default 
defaultIs there any evidence of any moves towards that sort of standardisation?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: Yes, there is.
default 
defaultThere were some worrying moves in the past, where there was commercial businesses that were set up and, for a fee, they would put you through this process and act as gatekeepers.
default 
defaultThat was really counterproductive and did not work.
default 
defaultGovernment has a role here: Government could provide a central clearing house for pre
default-
defaultqualifications.
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Do you mean by means of a charter or something of that nature, whereby a business could say, “We have done this and it was good enough in this instance.
default 
defaultWhy should it not be good enough again?”
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: Yes, there is a lot that could be done that would centralise and simplify that process.
default 
defaultYou could register for the system on the basis of a relatively small fee.
defaultQ375 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Both sets of witnesses have set out what a minefield the whole procurement process actually is.
default 
defaultYou will probably be familiar with the report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research earlier this year, which suggested that the procurement process in the 
defaultUK
default is more expensive and takes longer than anywhere else in the European
default 
defaultUnion.
default 
defaultOn that basis, I wondered whether or not you think it would be better if central
default 
defaultGovernment provided a mandate for greater centralisation of the procurement process?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: Certainly, as far as PQQs are concerned, that is an area where central
default 
defaultGovernment could get involved.
default 
defaultLocalism has the capacity to deliver a lot of advantages in individual councils.
default 
defaultWe do not want to centralise everything, because that plays into the hands of the big organisations.
default 
defaultI would favour an approach in which, where there are barriers, central
default 
defaultGovernment plays a role in trying to reduce those barriers.
defaultPayment terms is an area that they could get involved in, as well as PQQs.
default 
defaultHowever, all of the solutions could be developed locally.
default 
defaultThere is lots of evidence that innovation, good practice and different approaches work all over the country in different ways.
defaultQ376 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Do you not think there is a role for centralisation at all?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: There is defini
defaulttely a role in respect of PQQs.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: It is a really interesting question.
default 
defaultIf you look at the private sector, for example, in procurement departments, we wrote an article recently on creating e
default-
defaultCademies
default within larger organisations, who support the local satellite procurement areas.
default 
defaultIf you created regional hubs, for example, which would help lots of local councils together, you could have a lot of advantages from that, through standardising without necessarily centralising the procedures.
defaultFor example, you could have help with the PQQ responses, offer advice, offer best practice, analyse suppliers who are used across several local councils to understand risk and mitigate that risk.
default 
defaultYou can aggregate opportunities through these e
default-
defaultCademies
default or regional hubs.
default 
defaultThis is not centralising in one area, but, in particular regions, you could centralise that effort.
defaultHowever, there is a massive caveat to that.
default 
defaultIt is exactly the issue you mentioned: it has to have the right mandate, controls and accountability to that kind of organisation.
default 
defaultOtherwise, it is just going to proliferate the issues that we see today.
default 
defaultFor example, you could have regional hubs that look at local councils.
default 
defaultYou could look at how they do things.
default 
defaultYou could offer best practice and advice to them to use at appropriate levels of the competition for the size of the tender.
default 
defaultYou could also aggregate opportunities together, create standard service
default-
defaultlevel agreements, which would streamline the process, so that each council is not doing the same thing.
default 
defaultThat best 
defaultpractice, like category management, could be shared across all of the regional centres of excellence.
defaultHowever, when it goes out to tender, they need the right 
defaultmeasurables
default so that, when they do go out to tender, they do not simply aggregate the requirements and send them out to a large business, which is exactly the risk you are referring to—like how ESPO handled their tender.
default 
defaultInstead, aggregate the tender but then split it out to SMEs, so that they can still apply as well as large businesses.
default 
defaultThere are a lot of advantages.
default 
defaultIf you were not going to do that, you have to ask yourself what you would do otherwise.
default 
defaultYou then have to go back out to every single local council and embark on a massive training programme.
default 
defaultThat perhaps might be impractical and very costly.
defaultQ377 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Who should do that massive training programme?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: What I am saying is that it would probably be impractical to go out to every single council and roll it out; that would take too long.
default 
defaultHaving regional centres of excellence, where you have mentors, procurement professionals, people who may be related to CIPS, or the private sector or others from the public sector, who could offer that advice to the local council.
default 
defaultYou then have less people to train to make that happen.
defaultWe had a meeting with IEWM—Improvement and
default 
defaultEfficiency
default 
defaultWest
default 
defaultMidlands.
default 
defaultThey seem to do exactly that: they go out to local councils, understand what procurement they were taking part of, look for aggregation opportunities, look for support and, obviously, save time and money by not doing things 10 times, but doing things once.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I have two comments.
default 
defaultIn regard to the first question, if you have multiple bids and you have multiple PQQs that have to be filled in, solving that problem is treating the symptom, not treating the cause.
defaultAnother thing I have noticed here in the 
defaultUK
default is that the 
defaultUK
default is the only member state in the EU that uses the restricted procedure more than the open procedure.
default 
defaultIn the restricted procedure, yes, detailed PQQs are the norm, because they allow you to select a number of candidates that are going to be invited to present bids.
default 
defaultIn general, that is what happens here in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultAs I said, the 
defaultUK
default is the only member state that uses the restricted procedure more than the open procedure.
defaultIn the open procedure, what the contract authority is interested in at the selection stage is only a de 
defaultminimis
default capability: does the company have the necessary insurance?
default 
defaultIt is either yes or no.
default 
defaultIt does not need to know which one is the best with the best insurance; it just wants to known whether or not they passed the grade.
defaultIt is more important to solve the addiction the 
defaultUK
default has to the restricted procedure first of all, and then solve the issues related to PQQs.
default 
defaultWhen it comes down to specific PQQs, when they are supposed to be used on actual restricted procedures—i.e. procedures that should be restricted to only a limited number of companies—I would highlight that in Wales, for example, the Government has created an online tool.
default 
defaultI do not know if it is online or it is still a paper exercise; it is called a SQID, which is a Supplier Qualification Information Database, which keeps the information logged with the central
default 
defaultGovernment and allows contracting authorities to ask specific questions and get the data directly from that database.
defaultIn regards to centralisation, bearing in mind the issues with procurement at the devolved level inside the councils, I personally am of the opinion that, yes, we should have more centralised procurement.
default 
defaultThe consequence may be that we have more aggregated demand and that may or may not play into the advantage of SMEs, but, at the end of the day, councils should have a more 
defaultprofessionalised procurement workforce, be that the people who are working on a day
default-
defaultto
default-
defaultday basis on a council or the people who are working on a day
default-
defaultto
default-
defaultday basis in a regional organisation or centralised organisation.
defaultAgain, that is treating the symptoms and not the root cause.
default 
defaultThe root cause is lack of training in the people doing that work on a day
default-
defaultto
default-
defaultday basis.
defaultQ378 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Would more training enable the procurement process to be more cost-effective, more timely and still provide social value for local communities?
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default Yes.
defaultQ379 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default What would your one piece of advice to local authorities be, if you were to say, “You need to do this one thing, which will help you down the road towards achieving that goal of more timely and cost effective procurement that delivers social value”?
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default If the procurement budget is the one you cut, you will pay, down the line, in the actual procurement that gets done.
default 
defaultYou will pay more when the procurement actually gets done.
defaultChris Williamson:default Essentially, we should invest in procurement.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default Yes.
defaultChris Williamson: defaultWhat would you say to them, 
defaultAlun
default?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: I would say it is simply about guidance on using the appropriate practices for the value of the tender.
default 
defaultThere are a lot of good procurement people out there and they are sometimes scared about repercussions, for example.
default 
defaultThey copy previous tenders.
default 
defaultThey all have a lot of knowledge and experience.
default 
defaultThey do not necessarily need training; they need guidance so that they feel confident the processes they use are the correct ones.
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: It is leadership.
defaultChris Williamson:default Do you mean from elected members?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: Yes, from elected members.
default 
defaultIt has to come from elected members.
default 
defaultThey would have to show they put as much value on those components of the purchasing package that will deliver value to their communities—values other than the bottom line of how much they have spent on paperclips.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: When I was a buyer at Rolls
default-
defaultRoyce, I fell into procurement, as a lot of people do.
default 
defaultI fell into procurement: I was an engineer and I found myself in procurement; I am not quite sure how I ended up there, but I enjoyed it.
default 
defaultThat was 15 years ago.
default 
defaultThe industry is changing.
default 
defaultBack then, they were realising that a 1% saving puts 10% back on profits.
default 
defaultThere was a lot of understanding.
default 
defaultPeople need to raise the attractiveness of the field as well.
default 
defaultThe way that Rolls
default-
defaultRoyce ended up helping drive better practice within the buyers—they have a lot of buyers—was to create best
default-
defaultpractice academies within Rolls
default-
defaultRoyce, who could help the buyers and start giving them guidance on the appropriate methodologies.
default 
defaultThey had good people there; they just needed a bit of leadership there to show them what was appropriate for the given time, and that is exactly the methodology we are looking at here.
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default They invested money in human
default 
defaultresources.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: Yes.
defaultQ380 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default You have answered my question about how councils are not doing enough to minimise procurement costs for you.
default 
defaultI would ask this next question, wouldn’t I?
default 
defaultHow much of the bureaucracy in local
default 
defaultgovernment procurement is due to local authorities and how much is due to EU regulation?
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I will take that one.
default 
defaultEU regulations are a very convenient scapegoat in these matters.
default 
defaultAs I have highlighted, only 25% of contracts are actually covered by EU rules.
default 
defaultBelow that, you can do pretty much what you want.
default 
defaultI do not know why it is not different for the other 75% of contracts, but it is not a problem with EU law.
default 
defaultIt is a problem at either the local, regional or central levels of government.
defaultWhat is happening with procurement is a certain feeling that you have to go for the gold
default-
defaultplated option.
default 
defaultIf you go for the restricted procedure and you go for the PQQ, if you select the IBMs and 
defaultAccentures
default of the world you are basically protecting yourself down the line.
default 
defaultThe interesting bit is that, when you go and see what happens after the contracts get awarded, the number of legal challenges here in the 
defaultUK
default is shockingly small.
defaultAs far as I know—this is data supplied to me by a colleague of mine, Dr
default 
defaultRichard
default 
defaultCraven, from the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultNorthumbria
default—we had less than 25 judgments on public procurement in 2012 and around 20 or 
default25 in
default 2011.
default 
defaultThe numbers are even lower for previous years.
default 
defaultWhat that tells me is that, on the one hand, people who do procurement exercises are being very careful, but they are being very careful without actually needing to do so.
default 
defaultThere are usually no legal consequences of trying to push the practice a little bit more.
default 
defaultIf you have 10,000 procurement exercises above the EU thresholds and you only have 25 challenges, the risk that the procurement procedure you are running is going to be challenged is very low.
defaultThere is a lot that can be done at the process level, which should be done.
default 
defaultAs I say, for the contracts below the EU thresholds, they should be done from the ground up.
default 
defaultIf you do them from the ground up, instead of taking the current open procedure and trying to remove things from it, which is what the Government has decided to do over the last couple of years, you should start with a whiteboard and a blank sheet of paper.
default 
defaultThat way, you will be able to have a much leaner and much more streamlined process and procedure, which is suitable and suited for small companies.
default 
defaultAt the end of the day, that is what you want.
default 
defaultYou want to save time; you want to save money; you want to reduce the costs for the procurer and the suppliers.
default 
defaultThat is what you should be doing.
default 
defaultOnce you find that way of simplifying the open procedure—in 
defaultBangor
default, we have done some work in that area—it should be mandatory for everyone to follow.
defaultIt is not the fault of EU law that there is no centralisation below the threshold and every authority does what they want to do.
defaultQ381 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default I know you are desperate to get in but we are really quite late for time.
default 
defaultI will move on, if you do not mind.
default 
defaultI have another difficult question: how can councils ensure that small suppliers are not disadvantaged by large contractors failing to pay them promptly?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: That is the point I made earlier, and it is a really important point.
default 
defaultIt is relatively easy for them to solve: they can introduce that clause in their contracts to their prime suppliers.
defaultQ382 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default How do they monitor it?
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: There are all sorts of ways they can monitor it.
default 
defaultI can give you examples.
default 
defaultI will write to you afterwards about how we have seen certain councils apply this very successfully.
default 
defaultThere are a whole variety of ways in which they can do it.
default 
defaultHowever, they set the benchmark very early on.
default 
defaultThey make it clear to their prime suppliers that they are watching them.
default 
defaultThe prime suppliers do not want to lose their relationship.
default 
defaultYou may need a bit of an audit trail afterwards to check this, but it needs that leadership from the council to say that they want them to pass those payment terms on.
defaultQ383 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default This is my last question; it is really for Dr
default 
defaultTelles
default.
default 
defaultIn respect of the pilots for simplifying low
default-
defaultvalue tender processes, how scalable are the lessons we can learn from that?
default 
defaultIs it possible to really copy that across the whole country?
defaultDr defaultTellesdefault:default I would say yes.
default 
defaultWe ran eight or nine pilots with Carmarthenshire
default 
defaultCounty
default 
defaultCouncil and Gwynedd
default 
defaultCouncil.
default 
defaultEveryone was happy with them—both procurers and the private sector.
default 
defaultWe had no complaints from either the private sector or the public sector.
default 
defaultPeople were really happy with it because, especially for the lead officers that were being involved in the process, it demystified procurement a lot; it does not need to be as complex as it is made to be.
defaultThat is an important lesson for us as well.
default 
defaultIf that happens in small councils, it is going to be valid in big councils.
default 
defaultIf you start applying a methodology like the one developed there and roll it out across the country, yes, there will be some teething pains.
default 
defaultWe have already identified quite a few issues that can be solved, but, at the end of the day, everyone will benefit from it.
default 
defaultNeither the procurers nor the suppliers are going to get everything they would want from that process; that is not the objective.
default 
defaultThe objective is to find something that is a middle ground that works well for everyone.
default 
defaultIt is pretty much scalable for low
default-
defaultvalue contracts below the EU threshold anywhere in the 
defaultUK
default.
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: To the other point about whether it is the local authorities or the EU regulations, to give you an example, with Mole
default 
defaultValley
default 
defaultCouncil we developed a procurement system to help them procure more effectively and adopt from a buyer and a supplier side, but we were told by them we would have more chance of changing our system than they would of changing their procedures for local
default 
defaultgovernment procurement.
defaultYou asked about which one it is.
default 
defaultThey had actually interpreted the full OJEU procedures for small
default-
defaultvalue tenders, so, in fact, in some ways it is not only the local authorities or the EU regulations; it is both together.
default 
defaultObviously, if we did that and incorporated it all within our systems, it would just exacerbate the issue.
default 
defaultAll of the local councils would then use our system and create just as many problems.
default 
defaultI just wanted to add that point there.
defaultQ384 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Mr
default 
defaultRafique
default, you touched on this in your final answer.
default 
defaultWhen people talk about whether or not it is EU procurement regulations that are the problem, I am left asking why it is that EU procurement issues are not a problem for our colleagues on the continent.
default 
defaultIs it out interpretation?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: Yes, absolutely.
default 
defaultIt is our interpretation.
defaultQ385 default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Does that come back to training?
default 
defaultWhat do we do about that?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: To give you an example, there are lots of different scoring mechanisms for weighted tenders.
default 
defaultThey are not really set out in OJEU, but we interpret them in a lot of different ways.
default 
defaultOnce someone has interpreted them, they are copied.
default 
defaultWhen you have this interpretation that is very long-winded and may be incorrect and inappropriate, it is then copied throughout the 
defaultcouncils and this proliferates the issue.
default 
defaultYou need someone to step in and answer the question and say, “That is not correct”.
defaultChris Williamson:default Who is that someone?
default 
defaultThat is like saying, “They should do something about this”.
default 
defaultWho is it?
defaultAlundefault defaultRafiquedefault: You could have some regional centres of excellence or someone they could speak to.
default 
defaultIt could either be that or you would have to go around and train everyone again.
default 
defaultYou are quite right: for low
default-
defaultvalue procurement, the problem is the interpretation of the rule.
default 
defaultSome people take the full OJEU process and interpret it for the low
default-
defaultvalue tenders, and put too much rigour towards it.
defaultMartin defaultMcTaguedefault: In part, the EU is an easy scapegoat, is it not?
default 
defaultIf you really do not want to do something, blame the EU and pretty much anybody will accept it.
defaultChair:default We do not want any divisions in the Committee.
defaultThank you all very much for coming to give evidence this afternoon.
default 
defaultWe appreciate it.
default 
defaultThank you.
