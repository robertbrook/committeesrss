The data includes the number of school places available at the end of the academic year 2011-12 and forecasts of the number of children who will need school places in September 2015, and so it is not surprising that there is \na difference in these figures, as local authorities create\n new places each year. \n The Targeted Basic Need programme invited LAs to apply for funding to expand existing schools or establish new schools â€“ academies make up 22% of the expansion projects. \n The Academies Capital Maintenance Fund has supported 60 popular and successful academies to expand, and 25% of bids to this fund are to support expansion. \n"
