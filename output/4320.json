In 2010, DAS 80e had only 6 cases where th\ne allegations could not be refuted and those cases were therefore discontinued. Given DAS’s case load in 2010, this represents \na rate of less than \n0.018%.  ARAG encounters fraud in 0.02% of cases, a similar percentage. Most of these relate to either staged\n accidents or exaggerated claims. Their typical costs liability as a consequence is in excess of £10,000. Templeton report that they have only had to repudiate around a dozen claims in the last 12 months on the basis of misrepresentation of the facts.\n The \nExperian Fraud Index (July 2011) also confirmed the real figures: only \n12 in every 10,000 applications and claims\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Part 3: Small claims threshold&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Part 4: data sharing&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
