Written evidence [bold]from the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists[bold] (LTC 44)[bold]Executive [bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Society of
[normal] Chiropodists and Podiatrists, 
[normal]the professional body and trade union 
[normal]which represents over
[normal] 10,000
[normal] Chiropodists and P
[normal]odiatrists, 
[normal]wishes to respond to your invitation to submit evidence to its inquiry into the man
[normal]agement of long 
[normal]term conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists is well placed to comment on the treatmen
[normal]t of long term care as it is
[normal], or should be, 
[normal]an integral part of the care pathway relating to the treatment of 
[normal]a number of long term 
[normal]conditions
[normal]. These range 
[normal]from Diabetes to Peripheral Arterial Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Moreover its members, whether employed by the NHS or in private practice
[normal], work in a range of settings
[normal] 
[normal]- 
[normal]community and acute.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Society found that 
[normal]the current 
[normal]mix of service responsibilities
[normal] does not always serve the patient best
[normal] nor are services sufficiently well organised so that community and acute services are 
[normal]well
[normal] 
[normal]integrated
[normal]. For example those with d
[normal]iabetes often l
[normal]ack the availability of a multi
[normal]disciplinary 
[normal]footcare
[normal] team 
[normal](MDFT) as o
[normal]nly 45.5% of hospital sites currently have one
[normal]. In terms o
[normal]f
[normal] 
[normal]evidenced 
[normal]best practice each MDFT
[normal] should be linked to a Foot Protection Team working in 
[normal]both 
[normal]the community
[normal] and the acute sector
[normal]. This 
[normal]lack of provision 
[normal]is 
[normal]despite 
[normal]clear
[normal] and accepted
[normal] 
[normal]research showing 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration of these sectors
[normal] generate
[normal]s
[normal] better patient outcomes and save
[normal]s
[normal] money
[normal] (up to £
[normal]3
[normal]4m a year)
[normal]. 
[normal]The submission includes examples of effective integrated provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similarly, people
[normal] with Peripheral Arterial Disease 
[normal]are often not diagnosed in the early stage of disease progression- an early diagnosis could be made by a Podiatrist.
[normal] Th
[normal]e 10 year mortality for those with Peripheral Arterial Disease, at approximately 50%, is worse than those for other serious conditions such as breast cancer. 
[normal]However
[normal] 
[normal]better assessment, diagnosis and management 
[normal]through 
[normal]the provision of 
[normal]c
[normal]ommunity 
[normal]Podiatry
[normal] and other
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] would lead to 
[normal]a 
[normal]reduced mortality rate and lead to
[normal] more appropriate referrals to vascular clinics. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similarly, despite NICE noting that all people with Rheumatoid Arthritis
[normal] should have access to
[normal] foot health services, only half of all rheumatology departments report basic foot 
[normal]health
[normal] services for their patients and less than 1 in 10 have formal care pathways or mechanisms for referral to foot 
[normal]health 
[normal]services. Better integrated NHS primary and acute care, including the provision of foot 
[normal]orthoses
[normal] (insoles) which have the potential to prevent major functional and structural foot problems, would result in earlier diagnosis and better treatment resulting in estimated productivity gains to the economy of £31 million from reduced sick leave and lost employment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The revised NHS Constitution’s first guiding principle declares that the NHS has a duty to promote equality through the 
[normal]services it provides. 
[normal]The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]urges that full foot health
[normal] services
[normal] provision be extended throughout England rather than the current rolling back and cutting of services. Foot 
[normal]h
[normal]ealth 
[normal]s
[normal]ervices have a 
[normal]large 
[normal]part to play in improving the quality of life and longevity of an ageing population with long term conditions through their ability to diagnose and treat foot conditions, make tim
[normal]ely onward referrals and via
[normal] the d
[normal]elivery of health promotion advice
[normal] to prevent symptoms.
[normal] Despite providing guidance to commissioners
[normal], for example on best practice on 
[normal]‘Putting Feet First in Diabetes C
[normal]are
[normal]’
[normal] for the attention of CCGs and Health &amp; Wellbeing Boards
[normal],
[normal] the Society fears that the new NHS may lead to fragmentation and not better practice
[normal] in treating those with long term conditions
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Currently 
[normal]2.9 million people 
[normal](4%) in the UK 
[normal]have been diagnosed with d
[normal]iabetes
[normal]. It is estimated that a further 850,000 are either undiagnosed or have no confirmed diagnosis
[normal].
[normal] E
[normal]pidemiologists estimate that this figure will have increased to 5 million by 2025 and 
[normal]to 
[normal]10% of
[normal] the whole population by 2032
[normal].
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The prevention and management of foot disease in people with diabetes is an essential component of every commissioned diabetes pathway. T
[normal]he ch
[normal]allenge for the NHS is to ensure these services are in place and therefore reduce
[normal] th
[normal]e incidence of amputation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]5-7%, (130,000-180,000) of people with diabetes will
[normal] experience
[normal] a foot ulcer at some stage in their lives
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]At any single time there will be over 60,000 people
[normal] in England
[normal] with a foot ulcer.
[normal] Evidence shows foot complications account for more hospital admissions than any other complication of diabetes
[normal]; 500,000 hospital bed nights are taken up by foot complications
[normal] per year
[normal]. Moreover the mortality rate for 
[normal]people with 
[normal]diabetic foot ulcers is third only to pan
[normal]creatic and lung cancers at 5
[normal] years
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (2012) found that 9.3% of patients had a foot complication on admission, of which 53.3% 
[normal]had input from a multi
[normal]disciplinary foot team within 24 hours.
[normal] 
[normal]The audit found that 
[normal]1.6% of patients developed a foot lesion during their admission
[normal] which was reduced from 2.2% in 2010
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The current number
[normal] of amputations is
[normal] rising from 5,700 in 2009/10 to over 6
[normal],
[normal]000 in 2010/11. It is reported that 
[normal]given the increasing incidence of diabetes 
[normal]there will be over 7
[normal],
[normal]000 amputations 
[normal]performed 
[normal]o
[normal]n people with d
[normal]iabetes in England by 2014/15, unless
[normal] urgent action is taken
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is currently 
[normal]a
[normal] high variability in incidence of lower limb amputation, both minor and major, evident across 
[normal]commissioning organisations
[normal]. For minor amputat
[normal]ions the variation is tenfold- 
[normal]from 0.3
[normal] 
[normal]per thousand adults to 3.5, with an average of 1.4
[normal] per thousand
[normal]. For major amputations the range is from 0 to 1.8
[normal] per thousand
[normal], with an average of 0.7 per thousand adults.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Jeffcoate
[normal] et al (2012) concluded that the 10-fold variation in amputation rates between 
[normal]commissioning organisations
[normal] in England related largely to the structure of available specialist services
[normal].
[normal] It 
[normal]has also been widely reported, 
[normal]and accepted by D
[normal]epartment of Health Ministers, 
[normal]that 80% 
[normal]of amputations are preventable.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NICE clinical guideline 10 (2004) set out a 
[normal]footcare
[normal] management plan in order to reduce 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk of problems occurring in those with diabetes.
[normal] 
[normal]Similarly 
[normal]Diabetes UK
[normal] put forward f
[normal]our
[normal] simple steps to reducing amputations
[normal]:

[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It h

[normal] calculated that the total expenditure withi

[normal] on diabetic foot care in 2011
[normal] was
[normal] between £
[normal]573 and £686

[normal]This does not include the economic impact from disability payments, reduced tax revenues and re-housing.

[normal]C
[normal]l
[normal]ear clinical evidence 
[normal]was provided 
[normal]that
[normal] showed
[normal] the importance of diagnostic tests, early referral to sp
[normal]ecialist care, the use of multi
[normal]disciplinary teams and cardiovascular screening
[normal], a
[normal]ll of which can reduce amputation and mortality
[normal] rates
[normal]. 
[normal]NICE guidance
[normal] Clini
[normal]cal Guideline
[normal] 119
[normal] 
[normal]backs this up by 
[normal]stating
[normal] 
[normal]in its list of key priorities 
[normal]that ‘ongoing care of an individual with an ulcerated foot should be undertaken without delay by a multidisciplinary foot care team.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]E
[normal]vidence 
[normal]was cited 
[normal]for
[normal] a multidisciplinary foot c
[normal]are team
[normal] (MDFT)
[normal] approach for 
[normal]in
[normal]patients
[normal] with diabetes in Southampton which led to a reduction in the length of inpatient stays from 50 days to 18 days. Not only were patient outcomes improved but annual savings to the NHS of £888,979 were 
[normal]generated. In another example, 
[normal]at 
[normal]The 
[normal]James
[normal] Cook Hospital in Middlesb
[normal]ro
[normal]ugh
[normal], 
[normal]a 
[normal]MDFT
[normal] generated annual savings of £249,459. 
[normal]Likewise a
[normal]n 11 year study at Ipswich Hospital found that the incidence of major amputation per
[normal] 10,000 people with 
[normal]diabetes fell by 82% following the introduction of an inpatient 
[normal]MDFT
[normal]. The incidence of minor amputation per 10,000 people with diabetes fell by 21%.

[normal]the NHS could make net savings and reduce the number of amputations. 
[normal]Marion Kerr estimated, for example, 
[normal]th
[normal]at 
[normal]i
[normal]f there were
[normal] a 50% reduction in amputations by 2018, the savings generated are calculated as £42million over the five year period from 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]Meanwhil
[normal]e the National Audit Office has
[normal] estimated that a reduction of late referrals to specialist foot teams by 50% could save at least £34 million each year through the reduction of amputations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.

[normal]T
[normal]he Society 
[normal]of Chiropodists and Podiatrists 
[normal]has long had an on-going concern about whe
[normal]ther the issue of amputations, and consequent mortality, 
[normal]receives the level of public attention it warrants given that the mortality rates for 
[normal]people
[normal] with diabetic 
[normal]foot 
[normal]ulcers and those having amputations are greater than those with breast or prostate cancer.
[normal] 
[normal]By
[normal] prioritising best practice in long term conditions, as well as meeting t
[normal]he Nicholson Challenge
[normal], 
[normal]there
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]an ideal opportunity to right this wrong. To do so would also be in line with two of the five outcomes for the NH
[normal]S identified within the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Mandate for NHS 
[normal]England
[normal]: preventing people from dying prematurely and enhancing quality of life for pe
[normal]ople with long term condit
[normal]ions
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] Foot health services are 
[normal]strug
[normal]gling to manage current demand and 
[normal]the predicted increase in 
[normal]the 
[normal]prevalence of dia
[normal]betes will lead to overload- consequently 
[normal]a workforce review is urgently required.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Peripheral Arterial Disease [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is common in the UK population 
[normal]in
[normal] those aged 55 or over
[normal], but is 
[normal]often not
[normal] 
[normal]diagnosed
[normal] until it is moderate or severe
[normal]. Outcomes have been poor, with substantial cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser degree, chronic lower limb wounds and amputation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PAD 
[normal]has recently been included in 
[normal]NICE
[normal] guidance
[normal] (2012)
[normal] and Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Fox (2013)
[normal] postulated that with
[normal] better assessment, diagnosis and management of PAD in community services
[normal], there
[normal] 
[normal]could be 
[normal]fewer, but more appropriate
[normal] referrals to vascular clinics.
[normal] 
[normal]This
[normal] could in turn
[normal] free up surgical appointment slots to allow rapid access for people with critical limb 
[normal]ischaemia
[normal], thus unlocking improvement at no significant additional cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PAD’s 10 year mortality, at approximately 50%, is worse than those for other serious conditions such as breast cancer and malignant melanoma of the foot. This may be due to a lack of early diagnosis
[normal] 
[normal]and effective clinical management
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As up to 50% of those with PAD are asymptomatic 
[normal]it 
[normal]is important that those with risk factors are screened early to enable l
[normal]ifestyle changes to take place, t
[normal]hus enabling
[normal] a reduction in
[normal] h
[normal]ospital admissions, amputations and premature death
[normal];
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]improvement
[normal]s
[normal] in
[normal] quality of life and life expectancy.
[normal] 
[normal]Podiatrists are able to diagn
[normal]ose PAD and

[normal]Rheumatoid A
[normal]rthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint diso
[normal]rder that affects approximately
[normal] 580,000 people in England, wh
[normal]ich suggests that over 690,000 people
[normal] in the UK live with the condition.
[normal] [bold]Females are 
[normal]up to 
[normal]four
[normal] times more likely to develop the condition than men. 
[normal]Up to 90% of people with Rheumatoid A
[normal]rthritis have some form of disease related foot involvement. Long standing inflammation leads to structural deformity and soft tissue lesions, which in turn generates areas of pressure that
[normal] may result in foot ulceration.

[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NICE (2009)
[normal] and Scottish Intercollegiate 
[normal]Guidelines 
[normal]Network (2011)
[normal] concurred that a
[normal]ll people with 
[normal]Rheumatoid A
[normal]rthritis
[normal] should have access to
[normal] 
[normal]foot health services
[normal]. Yet only half of all rheumatology departments report basic foot care services for their patients and less than 1 in 10 have formal care pathways or mechanisms for
[normal] referral to foot care services.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.

[normal]The National Audit Offic
[normal]e’s report, Integration Across G
[normal]overnment,
[normal] 
[normal]stated that b
[normal]etter integrated NHS primary and acute care would result in earlier diagnosis and treatment of patients with the 
[normal]Rheumatoid Arthritis
[normal], ultimately resulting in productivity gains to the economy of £31 million from reduced sick leave and lost employment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Podiatry Rheumatic Care Association
[normal] recommended that early intervention through the provision of foot 
[normal]orthoses
[normal] (insoles) 
[normal]has the potential to prevent major functional and structural foot 
[normal]problems
[normal] providing joint mobility is still good
[normal]. They cit
[normal]ed studies which demonstrated 
[normal]that 
[normal]th
[normal]rough the
[normal] intervention of foot 
[normal]orthoses
[normal],
[normal] a sustained effect is had on the foot structure and stability of the joints of the foot, thus reducing pain and improving mobility. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is potential to prevent major functional and structural foot problems by providing foot 
[normal]orthoses
[normal] early on in the disease process. However, 
[normal]because f
[normal]oot changes have the potential to occur within 2 years of disease onset it is essential that patients are referred for assessment of foot function as early as possible following diagnosis.
[normal] 
[normal]Similarly NICE guidance
[normal] [bold]recommended that
[normal] [bold]f
[normal]unctional insoles and therapeutic footwear should be available for all people with 
[normal]rheumatoid arthritis
[normal] if indicated.
