defaultWritten evidence 
defaultfrom
default Sharon and Peter Matthews (TWR0009)
defaultFour family members were booked on EZY8349 from Gatwick north terminal to Nice due to depart at 07.15 on 24 December. 
default 
defaultWe
default were travelling from Farnham and our son and his partner from central London. 
defaultAs requested, we checked the 
defaulteasyJet
default website before leaving home at 04.00 and no problems were indicated. We arrived at departures north terminal at 05.
default15
default and were immediately t
defaultold that our flight would be delayed and asked to go down one floor and wait for further instructions.
default 
default At this stage none of the information boards were working. 
default 
defaultAt 06.29 
defaultwe
default received a t
defaulte
defaultxt from 
defaulteasyJet
default to say flight delayed and offering refreshment vouc
defaulthers but not telling us where to get these.
default 
default 
defaultA further t
defaulte
defaultxt was received 
defaultat 06.43 
defaultgiving an apology
default. 
default 
defaultWe kept trying to visit the hopelessly 
defaultovercrowded departures
default area to try and find someone who could tell us what was going on or at least could reassure 
defaultus that the growing crowd downstairs would not be forgotten if there was some news. The information boards were still not functioning although evidenced by the 
defaultfrequent Microsoft
default messages
default,
default someone was obviously trying to reboot the whole system numerous ti
defaultmes. 
default 
defaultAt 09.39 a further t
defaulte
defaultxt was received asking us to wait for announcements to go to South terminal to check in.
defaultDuring this long wait, we managed to buy food and drink
default,
default but 
defaultdue to lack of power
default only one
default of 
defaultthe toilet blocks
default in the terminal 
defaultwas
default working
default,
default and 
defaultimpossibly 
defaultlong queues built up
default for 
defaultit
default.
default  
default 
defaultOur
default only option 
defaultwas to take the train to
default the
default toilet
defaults
default in South terminal
default,
default 
defaultalthough
default there was 
defaultno one
default 
defaultsuggesting to
default 
defaultothers
default that this 
defaultwas
default what they 
defaultcould
default do. 
default 
defaultAmazingly t
defaulthe lack of power only seemed to affect 
defaultthe 
defaultt
defaultoilets –
default the Christmas tree lights were working as were the escalators and lifts and all the shops
default,
default including the gaming arcade.
defaultEventually,
default around midday, 
defaultwe were 
defaultcalled
default to go to South terminal to be checked in for our flight and this we did. 
defaultWe joined th
defaulte crowds there where there
default was a person calling forward travellers for particular 
defaultflights and
default 
defaultdirecting 
defaultthem 
defaultto a check in desk.  
defaultOur baggage was 
defaultchecked
default in and we were asked to go through security 
defaultthen
default head to 
defaulta specific gate
default.  There, instead of boarding 
defaulta flight,
default we were faced with a huge queue for a bus – apparently there was only one available. 
default 
defaultAfter a very uncomfortable 60 minutes of waiting in a very 
defaultover
defaultcrowded area, we got the bus 
default- 
defaultnot to the plane
default,
default but back 
defaultagain 
defaultto 
defaultan entrance to 
defaultNorth t
defaulterminal.
default There was nobody from 
defaulte
defaultasyJet
default 
defaulthere and the atmosphere was pretty tense as there were hundreds of people from different flights and different airlines trying to find out what to do next. 
default Why on earth were we not simply asked to go back to the North termin
defaultal via the shuttle train?  We eventually found our way back to the departure hall (now airside) to await boarding information.  
defaultBy this time, the information boards were showing the flights but no indication of any cancellations or expected departure times
default. We managed to find seats in restaurants 
defaultand 
defaultremained there
default.  The
default restaurant staff were
default very accommodating
default,
default 
defaultthey
default did not mind us staying there 
defaultas by now most of their food had run out.
defaultWe only discovered that our flight was cancelled when our son called u
defaults from France to say that he had seen it on 
defaultthe 
defaulteasyJet
default website, around 6pm.  
defaultI
default went to the information desk which was by then only being manned by the police and was surrounded by a huge crowd. 
defaultI
default managed to get confirmation that our flight 
defaulthad been cancel
defaultled but no clues as to when
default or whether
default it might be rescheduled.
default 
default 
defaultAmongst the confusion, we were 
defaultfinally
default 
defaulttold
default to go through a 
defaultside
default door
default, queue again for immigration
default 
defaultthen go to
default baggage reclaim. The route was quite dangerous as a large section of the wide cor
defaultridor near to baggage reclaim was in almost complete darkness with only a couple of totally inadequate emergency lights. 
defaultThere were only two carousels 
defaultworking and
default n
defaulto attempt was made to manage the baggage reclaim by flight
default.
default  
defaultWe were there for 
defaultnearly three 
defaulthours
default.
default 
defaultA
default number of people had obviously just given up an
defaultd
default abandoned their luggage
default which was clogging up the belts
default. 
defaultThe huge
default crowd includ
defaulted
default people who were disabled, elderly, had very young children etc. There was nobody in evidence from either 
defaulteasyJet
default or t
defaulthe airport
default 
defaultalthough
default 
defaultsome 
defaultpolice were there being helpful
default.
default 
default 
defaultWith the help of passengers they started to remove baggage from the belts and pile it on the floor.  This caused further problems as both abandoned baggage and new baggage were now piling up togeth
defaulter and passenger floor space was quickly reducing. 
default 
defaultWe
default were 
defaultfinally
default 
defaulttold
default that no further bags would come out via the baggage carousels as they were all now being delivered to the pavement area outside the terminal building. There was additional confusion d
defaultue to a rumour that baggage checked in at South terminal needed to be reclaimed there – but there was nobody around to check this with. We emerged on to the pavement area to be greeted by more chaotic scenes and a huge police presence. These policemen were
default again friendly and helpful but luckily our son had stayed in bagg
defaultag
defaulte reclaim
default 
defaultwhere
default 
defaulthe 
defaulteventually discovered
default our cases.
defaultWe had still not been given any information about the possibility of our flight going the next day nor any information of how to handle 
defaulta hotel booking etc. 
default 
defaultOur decision was to leave the airport and go home. 
default 
defaultWe left the airport at 22.00 after seventeen wasted and very frustrating hours and still nowhere nearer our Christmas with family in France.
default 
defaultOnce we 
defaultgot home, at 23.54 we
default 
defaultfinally 
defaultrec
defaulteived an email 
defaultfrom 
defaulteasyJet
default 
defaultinforming us of the cancellation of our flight. 
default 
defaultOn Thursday 26 December, 
defaultwe
default received a further email with an apology – 
defaultcancellation ‘
defaultdue to unplanned runway closure
default’
default – and asking for feedback, although there was no link to give this.
defaultWe would like answers to the following points:
default1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy were there no senior airport staff in evidence in North terminal even though there must have been many senior people in the airport?
default&#xa0;
default2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWh
defaulty were the toilets in North terminal not working when all the revenue earning shops, restaurants, and arcades were fine?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy were we routed through South terminal and then a lengthy, confusing and convoluted route back to the North terminal we had left a
default couple of hours earlier?
default&#xa0;
default4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy were we not told formally of the cancellation until we got home?
default&#xa0;
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy did it take 3 hours to get our baggage back.
default&#xa0;
default6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnplanned runway closure as the reason for cancellation does not seem to stack up as Gatwick only has one run
defaultway and there were numerous flights landing and taking off from South terminal.
