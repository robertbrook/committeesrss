[normal]Written evidence 
[normal]from
[normal] Sharon and Peter Matthews (TWR0009)
[normal]Four family members were booked on EZY8349 from Gatwick north terminal to Nice due to depart at 07.15 on 24 December. 
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] were travelling from Farnham and our son and his partner from central London. 
[normal]As requested, we checked the 
[normal]easyJet
[normal] website before leaving home at 04.00 and no problems were indicated. We arrived at departures north terminal at 05.
[normal]15
[normal] and were immediately t
[normal]old that our flight would be delayed and asked to go down one floor and wait for further instructions.
[normal] 
[normal] At this stage none of the information boards were working. 
[normal] 
[normal]At 06.29 
[normal]we
[normal] received a t
[normal]e
[normal]xt from 
[normal]easyJet
[normal] to say flight delayed and offering refreshment vouc
[normal]hers but not telling us where to get these.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]A further t
[normal]e
[normal]xt was received 
[normal]at 06.43 
[normal]giving an apology
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]We kept trying to visit the hopelessly 
[normal]overcrowded departures
[normal] area to try and find someone who could tell us what was going on or at least could reassure 
[normal]us that the growing crowd downstairs would not be forgotten if there was some news. The information boards were still not functioning although evidenced by the 
[normal]frequent Microsoft
[normal] messages
[normal],
[normal] someone was obviously trying to reboot the whole system numerous ti
[normal]mes. 
[normal] 
[normal]At 09.39 a further t
[normal]e
[normal]xt was received asking us to wait for announcements to go to South terminal to check in.
[normal]During this long wait, we managed to buy food and drink
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]due to lack of power
[normal] only one
[normal] of 
[normal]the toilet blocks
[normal] in the terminal 
[normal]was
[normal] working
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]impossibly 
[normal]long queues built up
[normal] for 
[normal]it
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]Our
[normal] only option 
[normal]was to take the train to
[normal] the
[normal] toilet
[normal]s
[normal] in South terminal
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]although
[normal] there was 
[normal]no one
[normal] 
[normal]suggesting to
[normal] 
[normal]others
[normal] that this 
[normal]was
[normal] what they 
[normal]could
[normal] do. 
[normal] 
[normal]Amazingly t
[normal]he lack of power only seemed to affect 
[normal]the 
[normal]t
[normal]oilets –
[normal] the Christmas tree lights were working as were the escalators and lifts and all the shops
[normal],
[normal] including the gaming arcade.
[normal]Eventually,
[normal] around midday, 
[normal]we were 
[normal]called
[normal] to go to South terminal to be checked in for our flight and this we did. 
[normal]We joined th
[normal]e crowds there where there
[normal] was a person calling forward travellers for particular 
[normal]flights and
[normal] 
[normal]directing 
[normal]them 
[normal]to a check in desk.  
[normal]Our baggage was 
[normal]checked
[normal] in and we were asked to go through security 
[normal]then
[normal] head to 
[normal]a specific gate
[normal].  There, instead of boarding 
[normal]a flight,
[normal] we were faced with a huge queue for a bus – apparently there was only one available. 
[normal] 
[normal]After a very uncomfortable 60 minutes of waiting in a very 
[normal]over
[normal]crowded area, we got the bus 
[normal]- 
[normal]not to the plane
[normal],
[normal] but back 
[normal]again 
[normal]to 
[normal]an entrance to 
[normal]North t
[normal]erminal.
[normal] There was nobody from 
[normal]e
[normal]asyJet
[normal] 
[normal]here and the atmosphere was pretty tense as there were hundreds of people from different flights and different airlines trying to find out what to do next. 
[normal] Why on earth were we not simply asked to go back to the North termin
[normal]al via the shuttle train?  We eventually found our way back to the departure hall (now airside) to await boarding information.  
[normal]By this time, the information boards were showing the flights but no indication of any cancellations or expected departure times
[normal]. We managed to find seats in restaurants 
[normal]and 
[normal]remained there
[normal].  The
[normal] restaurant staff were
[normal] very accommodating
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]they
[normal] did not mind us staying there 
[normal]as by now most of their food had run out.
[normal]We only discovered that our flight was cancelled when our son called u
[normal]s from France to say that he had seen it on 
[normal]the 
[normal]easyJet
[normal] website, around 6pm.  
[normal]I
[normal] went to the information desk which was by then only being manned by the police and was surrounded by a huge crowd. 
[normal]I
[normal] managed to get confirmation that our flight 
[normal]had been cancel
[normal]led but no clues as to when
[normal] or whether
[normal] it might be rescheduled.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Amongst the confusion, we were 
[normal]finally
[normal] 
[normal]told
[normal] to go through a 
[normal]side
[normal] door
[normal], queue again for immigration
[normal] 
[normal]then go to
[normal] baggage reclaim. The route was quite dangerous as a large section of the wide cor
[normal]ridor near to baggage reclaim was in almost complete darkness with only a couple of totally inadequate emergency lights. 
[normal]There were only two carousels 
[normal]working and
[normal] n
[normal]o attempt was made to manage the baggage reclaim by flight
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]We were there for 
[normal]nearly three 
[normal]hours
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] number of people had obviously just given up an
[normal]d
[normal] abandoned their luggage
[normal] which was clogging up the belts
[normal]. 
[normal]The huge
[normal] crowd includ
[normal]ed
[normal] people who were disabled, elderly, had very young children etc. There was nobody in evidence from either 
[normal]easyJet
[normal] or t
[normal]he airport
[normal] 
[normal]although
[normal] 
[normal]some 
[normal]police were there being helpful
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]With the help of passengers they started to remove baggage from the belts and pile it on the floor.  This caused further problems as both abandoned baggage and new baggage were now piling up togeth
[normal]er and passenger floor space was quickly reducing. 
[normal] 
[normal]We
[normal] were 
[normal]finally
[normal] 
[normal]told
[normal] that no further bags would come out via the baggage carousels as they were all now being delivered to the pavement area outside the terminal building. There was additional confusion d
[normal]ue to a rumour that baggage checked in at South terminal needed to be reclaimed there – but there was nobody around to check this with. We emerged on to the pavement area to be greeted by more chaotic scenes and a huge police presence. These policemen were
[normal] again friendly and helpful but luckily our son had stayed in bagg
[normal]ag
[normal]e reclaim
[normal] 
[normal]where
[normal] 
[normal]he 
[normal]eventually discovered
[normal] our cases.
[normal]We had still not been given any information about the possibility of our flight going the next day nor any information of how to handle 
[normal]a hotel booking etc. 
[normal] 
[normal]Our decision was to leave the airport and go home. 
[normal] 
[normal]We left the airport at 22.00 after seventeen wasted and very frustrating hours and still nowhere nearer our Christmas with family in France.
[normal] 
[normal]Once we 
[normal]got home, at 23.54 we
[normal] 
[normal]finally 
[normal]rec
[normal]eived an email 
[normal]from 
[normal]easyJet
[normal] 
[normal]informing us of the cancellation of our flight. 
[normal] 
[normal]On Thursday 26 December, 
[normal]we
[normal] received a further email with an apology – 
[normal]cancellation ‘
[normal]due to unplanned runway closure
[normal]’
[normal] – and asking for feedback, although there was no link to give this.
[normal]We would like answers to the following points:
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why were there no senior airport staff in evidence in North terminal even though there must have been many senior people in the airport?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Wh
[normal]y were the toilets in North terminal not working when all the revenue earning shops, restaurants, and arcades were fine?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why were we routed through South terminal and then a lengthy, confusing and convoluted route back to the North terminal we had left a
[normal] couple of hours earlier?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why were we not told formally of the cancellation until we got home?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why did it take 3 hours to get our baggage back.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Unplanned runway closure as the reason for cancellation does not seem to stack up as Gatwick only has one run
[normal]way and there were numerous flights landing and taking off from South terminal.
