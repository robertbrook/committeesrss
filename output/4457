defaultinquiry questions are outlined below.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1. defaultWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better defaultmodels?default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultThe West Midlands b
defaultelieves the approach offered the following disadvantages:
defaultQ2. defaultDo local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnershipdefaults, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?default5.
default              
defaultYes. Local areas do have t
defaulthe ca
defaultpacity to assess, prioriti
defaults
defaulte
default and deliver local transport schemes. 
defaultGovernments original rationale of devolution was to empower local areas and allow flexible, dynamic transport government and delivery structures reflective of local 
defaulteconomic 
defaultgeographies
default.
default6.
default              
defaultHowever, Government 
defaultdoes appear to have 
defaultcontradicted this approach by imposing new structures and bodies rather than allowing local determination
default towards transport
default. 
defaultWhilst, the 
defaultprioritisation of Major Schemes by the 
defaultthree LTBs covering the West Midlands me
defaulttropolitan area 
defaultis considered to have been 
defaultlargely have been successful
default in terms of type of schemes and strategic policy alignment
default, their role 
defaulthas now been absorbed into the LEP through SLGF A
defaults strategic transport planning and scheme 
defaultpriorities will be det
defaultermined by LEPs, they need to be resources to undertake this work. 
default7.
default              
defaultAny part of the Metropolitan Area effectively has 5 different organisation
defaults
default undertaking similar 
defaulttransport 
defaultfunctions
default.
default 
defaultIn practice, the differing remits, funding and covering geographies 
defaultis likely to lead to inefficiencies between strategic planning, development and delivery of 
defaulttransport 
defaultschemes and initiatives.
default8.
default              
defaultWith LEPs covering differing geographical areas, there is a need for strategic transport governance structures
default 
defaultto ensure 
defaultcoordination activity
default. To that end, t
defaulthe West Midlands 
defaultMetropolitan Area 
defaulthas 
defaultself 
defaultdetermined that transport governance
default 
defaultshould be undertaken by the seven leaders of the District Authorities as the 
defaultITA
default. 
defaultThis will ensure a closer alignment between the economic
default development responsibilities of LEPs and the integrated transport responsibilities of the West Midlands ITA. 
defaultThe arrangements presently operate in shadow form and are presently being considered by the 
defaultDfT
default.
default9.
default              
defaultIn relation to funding, the West Midlands welc
defaultomed devolution of major scheme funding. However, the pro-rata nature of the allocations reflects population not need of area. This means funding of large strategic schemes, such as rail/ 
defaultlight rail and/ or bus rapid transit 
defaultschemes is less feasible
default and th
defaultis is discussed further in question 7
default. 
defaultQdefault3default. defaultWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?default10.
default              
defaultIn the Metropolitan Area, strategic cross boundary transport planning is vital and reflects the 
defaultrealities
default of transport patterns and requirements of an urban area both for internal cross boundary movements and wider within the economic catchment of the metr
defaultopolitan area.
default11.
default              
defaultIn the West Midlands, 
defaultthe ITA 
defaultpresently is tasked by the Local Transport Act (200
default8
default) to 
defaultundertake strategic cross boundary
default transport
default 
defaultplanning 
defaultwhilst 
defaultdecision
default making
default on Major Schemes
default is 
defaultnow 
defaultundertaken by 3 separate LEP
defaults
default who have a specific focus on promoting economic development
default.
default 
defaultAs the District Leaders sit on both the LEP and ITA 
defaultthey will be coordinating transport across the West Midlands
default.
default 
defaultQ4. defaultHow effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government dedefaultpartments and national transport agencies?default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultThe West Midlands believes that local bodies 
defaultlargely do work well together, reflecting historical working processes and relationships. However, there 
defaultmust 
defaultbe 
defaulta
default stronger responsibility for national transport agencies, such as the Highways 
defaultAgency and Network Rail, to work closely with local bodies such as ITAs and LEPs to ensure alignment between local needs and 
defaultnational investment programmes. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultNational trans
defaultport investment programmes should be fully aligned to supporting local areas. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultwe believe 
defaultthere is a
default 
defaultdisconnect
defaultion
default between local needs and 
defaulthow 
defaultnational 
defaultinvestment programmes
default are developed
default. 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultFor example, in Control Period 5 the West Midlands wi
defaultll benefit from only one named scheme (Walsall – Rugeley Electrification) 
defaultin Network Rails investment programme 
defaultwhilst local rail priorities such as Water Orton rail corridor and the 
defaultCamp Hill Chords 
defaultremain unfunded impacting on the ability to support econ
defaultomic development, address congestion and connect people to jobs.
default 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultIn relation to the Highways Agency, local priorities such as 
defaultSmart
default Motorways on the M5 (between the M6 Interchange and J4a) through the core of the Black Country 
default(as identified by the W
defaultest Midlands Metropolitan Freight Strategy) 
defaultalso remains unfunded, leading to impacts to journey reliability, connectivity to markets, congestion and the environment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault5default. defaultDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of defaultlocal authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultAs previously stated, the West Midlands has seen a significant reduction in capital funding blocks. 
defaultBetween
default 2009/10 
defaultand
default 2011/12 capital allowances was 
defaultcut by 
default47%
default.
default. 
defaultThe West Midlands welcomes devolution and removal of funding allocation ring fencing, however the ability to support economic growth, tackle congestion, connect people to jobs and support environmental objectives will be directly linked the size of funding
default available. Each of these latter objectives supports the government objective of supporting economic growth. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultHowever there is considerable inequity between London and the rest of the UK
default. F
defaultor 2014/15 all transport authorities across England outside of
default London will be allocated £2.084Bn (£1.664bn Capital; £420M revenue) compared to the £2.4bn London is to be allocated by the DfT. This significant inequity in transport funding distribution means that for 2011/12 the West Midlands had £198 per head for tra
defaultnsport compared to £644 per head in London. Efforts to rebalance the UK 
defaulteconomy 
defaultwill be undermined not supported if the spend on transport 
defaultper head 
defaultoutside of London is not 
defaultbrought closer to the levels enjoyed by London.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultInvestment in any transport sc
defaultheme is a highly efficient approach to supporting the economy as materials are purchased, jobs are created in building the scheme and it improves productivity of the wider economy. Whilst the Government has recognised this and has increased funding for nat
defaultional agencies to historical high levels for the period 2015-19, local transport funding (covering Major Schemes, Integrated Transport and Maintenance Blocks) for 2015-19 is £2.244bn per annum compared to £1.968Bn in 2009/10 an increase of 14% or the equiv
defaultalent of 1.9% per annum.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultFinally, the West Midlands has developed the Local Connectivity Package 
default(LCP) 
defaultwhich outlines an integrated approach to maximising the economic benefits of High Speed Two. The £2bn programme of schemes and interventions would 
defaultdouble the econom
defaultic benefits of HS2. The West Midlands wants the national transport investment programmes and priorities to be reflective of the 
defaultLCP
default. If Network Rail was to therefore fund the rail schemes required in the LCP then half of the 
defaultLCP
default would be f
defaultunded by Network Rail. 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultThe other half could be provided by Government as it is committed to maximising the economic benefits of HS2. Government could allocate additional resource to the West Midlands. For example, if the West Midlands received an ext
defaultra £50 per person on transport spending this would total an extra £135m per year. This additional money; allocated per year - over a ten year period; would help fund the other half of the 
defaultLCP
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault6default. defaultWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to defaultLocal Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultThe SLGF 
defaultin principal should be a strong start to 
defaultaddress
default the underinvestment in local transport as discussed in previous answers. 
defaultThe £2bn per annum pot is a welcomed 
defaultstart, however given the competitive nature of the fund, the government still retains control over funding allocations – against the premise of 
defaultlocal 
defaultdevolution. 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultWe note that Lord Heseltine’s “No Stone Unturned” report identified the potential to 
defaultdevolve £49bn to local areas, a transformational level of resources which could regenerate and transform local areas and allow for locally driven long term planning and development.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default              
defaultHowever, the SLGF must be the start of a wider process of transport f
defaultunding devolution not the end of the process. 
defaultCrucially, only the DfT is contributing significant Government spend, other department should provide equivalent resources to maximise the benefits and opportunities of the SLGF.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default              
defaultA more equitable solution 
defaultwould be for the complete devolution of th
defaulte SLGF
default with 
defaultparticular focus of resource on metropolitan areas 
defaulturban areas which are often the focal point of journeys
default, hubs of economic activity, population growth
default and therefore 
defaultthe location where investment in 
defaulttr
defaultansport issues
default will generate the largest benefits
default. 
default&#xa0;
default25.
default              
defaultThe West Midlands notes with caution that if SEP/ SLGF awarded monies are not allocated over a fixed medium term process (5-10 years) then the ability to plan or bring schemes forward to meet develop
defaultment opportunities will be severely restricted, especially if allocations are 
defaultconfirmed 
defaulton an annual basis.
default&#xa0;defaultQ7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport defaultinfrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?default&#xa0;
default26.
default              
defaultWhilst the Government’s 
defaultfunding for transport 
defaultwill 
defaultsupport 
defaultinvestment in sma
defaultller scale schemes 
default(&lt;£2
default0
defaultM
default approx
default local transport schemes
default) and larger schemes (&gt;£500
defaultM
default approx
default national transport scheme)
default, the
defaultre is a gap in
default 
defaultthe 
defaultability to fund ‘mid-range’ schemes i.e. £

default0
defaultM
default - £500
defaultM
default locally
default, vital for transformational changes to local area economies. 
defaultSuch m
defaultid-range schemes 
defaultmostly 
defaultcover rapid transit (light rail and bus), rail schem
defaultes or stations.
default In the West Midlands, the following schemes would fall into this category:
default&#xa0;default              defaultCamp Hill Chordsdefault: A £200
defaultM
default (approx)
default scheme which would facilitate the introduction of rail services to residential areas of Birmingham which are home to 250,000 people providing 
defaultthem with 
defaultaccess to jobs, education and other key services whilst reducing road congestion.
default The scheme would gene
defaultrate £150M approx GVA 
defaultfor the regional economy 
defaultand support 
defaultthe creation of
default 3220 jobs in the West Midlands.
default&#xa0;default              defaultWednesbury to Brierley Hill Metrodefault: 
defaulta £
default270
defaultM 
default(approx) 
defaultMidland Metro light rail extension from existing Metro Line One through the heart of the Black 
defaultCountry acting as a catalyst for regeneration, land use changes and economic development. T
defaulthe area has poor transport accessibility and connectivity to the wider conurbation and particularly Birmingham city centre.
default The scheme would generate £165M GVA for t
defaulthe regional economy and support the creation of 3,600 jobs
default&#xa0;
default27.
default              
defaultFunding of these specific schemes and general ‘mid-range’ transport schemes 
defaultcannot
default be done within the funding allocations of Major Schemes, whilst the multi- infrastructure nature of the SLGF means that funding 
defaultfrom that competitive pot 
defaultis unlikely. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default              
defaultThis means funding opportunities for these types of schemes will focus on 
defaultsovereign/ private investment funds, council tax levy increases (noting the Governments statutory requirements for a local referendum), borrowing
default, 
defaultTax
default Incremental Financing or 
defaultpr
defaultivate sector contributions through mechanisms such as the Community Infrastruc
defaultture Levy. 
default&#xa0;
default29.
default              
defaultThe West Midlands notes that generally 
defaults
defaultmall schemes 
default(&lt;£20M) 
defaultand 
defaultlarger 
defaultschemes
default (£500M&gt;)
default 
defaultare 
defaultnot exposed to such risks, 
defaultas 
defaultGovernment 
defaultprovides the capital for delivery through local transport funding or national transport agency which remo
defaultves risk or funding uncertainly. However, this is 
defaultnot
default the case for such mid-range £20M-£500M schemes
default which require the promoting local authority 
defaultor private sector 
defaultto take on 
defaultcost or price 
defaultrisk
default. 
defaultR
defaultisk is therefore priced into schemes, inflating costs or 
defaultdefl
defaultating 
defaultreturns
default/benefits
default.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default              
defaultTherefore, Government should look to 
defaultaddress how to deliver such mid-range schemes.
default 
defaultIdeally there should be a consistent approach to funding whereby greater levels of capital is available to fund such schemes, providing equalit
defaulty with the low-risk funding certainty of the national transport agencies/ organisations
default. 
default&#xa0;
default31.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultSLGF
default offers the opportunity to pool resources but the levels of funding 
defaultpresently allocated 
defaultare not receptive to the delivery of these types of schemes 
defaultalone and would need to be completed by further capital funding, including locally generated funding. 
default&#xa0;
default32.
default              
defaultThe West Midlands notes the successful use of Council Tax funding for transport schemes 
defaultin metropolitan areas such as 
defaultGreater 
defaultManchester, however presently such an approach would be included in calculations to increase council tax by more than 2% and the subsequent requirement by Government for a local referendum. The specific requirement sho
defaultuld be amended by Government if local areas self determine this funding approach as an aspiration
default.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default              
defaultWithout the levels of capital resources required to deliver such transformational schemes available in the SLGF nor can they be practically raised local
defaultly, metropolitan areas are missing out on the economic, congestion, environmental and health benefits of these schemes, meaning our capability to cater for a growing population and economy is impacted upon.
default&#xa0;
default34.
default              
defaultHowever, w
defaultith such 
defaulta funding model 
defaultin place,
default the 
defaultlower 
defaultcost of risk built into financial models and decision making by local areas and the private sector would be reduced by creating an environment of greater funding certainty to unlock investment to create jobs and growth.
default 
default&#xa0;
default35.
default              
defaultThe W
defaultest Midlands 
defaulta
defaultgain highlights that 
defaultan extra £50 per p
defaulterson on transport spending
default would total an extra £135m per year
default and would 
defaultfund the other half of the 
defaultLCP required to double the economic benefits of HS2 across the West Midlands.
default 
defaultThis would be more akin to the powers 
defaultand approaches used by Transport for London to the benefit of the London economy and population.
default&#xa0;
default36.
default              
defaultHowever, such an approach should not discount the opportunity of private sector investment.
default 
defaultHowever, how
default such
default investment is secured needs to
default be
default altered. A
default single large capital pot for funding of mid-range transport 
defaultschemes
default means the 
defaultpublic 
defaultsector could
default 
defaultfund and deliver 
defaulta 
defaultmid-range transport 
defaultscheme 
defaultwhich could 
defaultthen 
defaultbe sold to the private sector 
defaultor public sector pension funds 
defaultas 
defaulta long term concession after a
default pre-determined number of years. 
default&#xa0;
default37.
default              
defaultOnce the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be modelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the concession could then be recycled 
defaultback 
defaultto 
defaultthe strategic transport 
defaultfund 
defaultfor 
defaultother mid-range transport schemes. 
default&#xa0;
default38.
default              
defaultAfter the concession period was over, a reselling of the asset could occur. However, this approach requires a dedicated capital pot to pump prime the process and Government should
default empower and resource local areas above the present levels of the SLGF to achieve this and generate economic benefits both 
defaultlocally
default and nationally.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8. How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?default&#xa0;
default39.
default              
defaultPresently, the West Midlands feels there a strong lines of accountability
default, however in the spirit of devolution, local areas should be allowed to develop appropriate structures to undertaken government requirements rather than
default Government
default imposing structures
default.
