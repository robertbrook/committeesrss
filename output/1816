[normal]“Good practice benefits al
[normal]l, staff and students, men and women. However, bad practice adversely affects women’s careers more than men’s.”
[normal]“The age profile of the department, and the diversity of its staff, makes a difference. Young men and women with families have different expectations 
[normal]and needs from their older colleagues. Those younger staff members’ careers (and their science) cannot thrive unless the working culture of the department reflects the reality of dual career partnerships.”
[normal]Principle 1:
[normal]A robust organisational framework to deliver equality of opportunity and reward.
[normal]Principle 2: 
[normal]              
[normal]Appointment, promotion and selection processes and procedures that encourage men and women to apply for academic posts at all levels.
[normal]Principle 3
[normal]:
[normal]Departmental structures and systems that enable men and women to progress and continue in their careers.
[normal]Principle 4: 
[normal]              
[normal]Departmental organisation, structure, management arrangements and culture that are open, inclusive and transparent and encourage the 
[normal]participation of all staff.
[normal]Principle 5: 
[normal]              
[normal]Flexible approaches and provisions that encompass the working day, the working year and a working life and enable individuals, at all career and life stages, to maximise their contribution to mathematics, their d
[normal]epartment and institution.

[normal]Extracts from [bold]The current and future UK science workforce[bold]Report prepared for the Science Council by TBR, 2011 [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This research uses a new analysis
[normal] considering the science workforce across the entire economy, rather than looking at total employees within science based industries. This innovative approach enables an understanding of the true size and scope of the science workforce across the economy, 
[normal]rather than limiting the research to considering scientists working in a narrow band of science sectors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The definitions of the science workforce used for this report are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sectors are also classi
[normal]fied as:
