[[[Q30 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] A big welcome to you. Thank you very much, and a particular thank you for the paper produced by the Head of International Affairs, Birmingham City Council, and the Assistant Director for Employment. Mr Conway, I am sorry we did not have written evidence from you, but I am sure you will be able to come in and we will ask you what your views are of the situation, too. Before we start, I must remind Members that they have to declare their interests. Are there any interests here declared? Yes, Lady Valentine.

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] Possibly that I am chief executive of London First, for the purposes of Alex Conway being here.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. The session is broadcast live and, therefore, sotto voce remarks should be avoided. The session will last approximately 60 minutes. The relevant interests of Members of the Committee, as I say, have been declared. It is on record. It is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct, and this will be put on the public record in printed form and, again, on the parliamentary website. Before we start, I want to ask if you could begin by stating your names and official titles for the record.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: I am Alex Conway. I am the European Programmes Director at the Greater London Authority.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: My name is Lloyd Broad. I am Head of European and International Affairs at Birmingham City Council.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: My name is Shilpi Akbar. I am the Assistant Director for Employment, Birmingham City Council.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much indeed. I would like to invite all three of you, or one or two of you, to give an opening statement if you want to. If not, we can go straight into the questions.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Shall I start, and then if Lloyd or Shilpi want to?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: First, thank you for inviting me, my Lord Chairman, and for the opportunity to make these opening remarks. I thought it might be helpful if I briefly set out the arrangements in London in using this money, which are a little different from elsewhere. Our European regional development fund and European social fund programmes are worth over £1 billion over seven years, and that is half EU funding, half match funding. Outside London, local enterprise partnerships have been charged with developing a pipeline of projects but civil servants remain responsible for programme management, whereas my team at the GLA manage both ERDF and ESF in London as an intermediate body on behalf of Government.Our local enterprise partnership arrangements also differ a little. We have a London Enterprise Panel appointed and chaired by the Mayor, and it is the body through which the mayoralty works with London’s boroughs, business and Transport for London to take a strategic view of London’s regeneration, employment and skills agenda. Like other LEPs, it has a very high level of business representation.Our LEP produced its jobs and growth plan for London earlier this year and the Government has since asked all LEPs to produce an EU funds strategy, which includes how the youth employment initiative is to be used. Our LEP’s EU fund strategy sets out how that EU money can help implement our earlier jobs and growth plan.Skills and employment are very much our priority for using 2014 to 2020 EU funds. The current 2007 to 2013 programmes are upskilling 50,000 people, getting another 50,000 Londoners into work, including over 14,000 14 to 19 year-olds. We expect these new programmes to achieve something similar in respect of the 128,000 or so 16 to 24 year-olds not in education, employment or training.The final and most important point that I want to emphasise is that we work in partnership with London boroughs and business to ensure that employment funds for London—from Government, EU or anywhere else—are put to the best possible use. Our LEP has a skills and employment group, which is chaired by two London businesspeople, Grant Hearn of Travelodge, and Jack Morris of the Business Design Centre. It builds on the work of the previous London Skills &amp; Employment Board, and the partners represented on that group will be the means by which we check that YEI funds are utilised effectively. I also want to highlight the Young People’s Education and Skills Board for London. That is the lead strategic body for 14 to 19 year-old education and training provision in relation to the needs of learners and employers. It is run by London councils who run these pan-London services on behalf of the 33 boroughs. That board is chaired by the leader of Southwark Council, who also serves on the LEP. Its deputy chair is Jack Morris, who I mentioned earlier.I hope that shows that we have some reasonably joined-up mechanisms for ensuring youth employment funding is used and monitored as effectively as we can, albeit there is always more to learn and do.

[[[Q31 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. Can I ask you, just for clarification, you said you had divided them into 14 to 19 year-olds but that is really for education; it is not for employment?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: It could be employment as well.

[[[The Chairman:]]] The problem we have is that we know there are people who are hanging out there, who have left school at the age of 16 and they do not appear in this because they are not paid until 18. So what happens? You are assuming they are all in education, is that it?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: No.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Oh, no, sorry, you do not because you go for 16 to 24 year-olds.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Yes. There is perhaps a difference in classification there between how we are looking at things in London and how the EU is looking at things from the top down.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes. Why do you have that difference in classification? It makes it difficult for people like us.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Possibly. The YEI has come down from on high saying, “This is for 16 to 24 year-olds”.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you want to make a statement now?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Yes, please. First, thank you, my Lord Chairman, for the opportunity. I think I need to make a statement at the beginning to say that the evidence put forward to you is from Birmingham City Council, but much of the reason for us being here is about ambition around how we tackle youth unemployment. Through the development of the EU strategies it is a LEP-based strategy and, therefore, it covers a broader territory than just Birmingham. While the evidence is from Birmingham City Council, much of what we want to cover is for a broader territory than just the city of Birmingham.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is not just the city, it is the whole conurbation?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: The EU strategy that we had to develop is for the Greater Birmingham and Solihull local enterprise partnership area.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Surely you talk to each other?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Of course we do. We are one partnership, but I have to make that point clear because it is a strategy for nine local authorities rather than one for Birmingham City Council.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I see. Thank you very much.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Sorry, I did want to just say a few words as a statement in terms of why we are here.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Once again I thank you. I will not talk about the machinery, about how we are set up in Birmingham. I think that will come out during the questioning. I want to make a statement around the political ambition and the political leadership we are taking in Birmingham around youth unemployment and, effectively, how we want to see a greater alignment of the EU resources to the local investments that we are keen to develop. Our strapline is "From fragmented to integrated", and that is effectively where we want to take this. Through the political leadership, we have developed a youth unemployment commission that is aimed at bringing together all local stakeholders and partners towards developing a much more integrated approach to tackling the deep-rooted problems that we have around youth unemployment in the area. We fundamentally believe that EU resources could and should be better deployed in our local area.Our ambition is to try to develop local co-investment strategies around how EU resources should be more appropriately and effectively aligned to local provision, not just aligned to national commissioning strategies through skills funding agencies and the Department for Work and Pensions, but utilising national, local resources within one integrated framework akin to the strategy to make an integrated programme, rather than what we believe is currently a fragmented one that is not meeting local need. Our will to come and provide evidence to this Committee is about outlining how we believe we need to make better, more effective use of the EU structural funds moving forward than we have done in recent years.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I see. Thank you. Do you want to make a statement?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Lord Chairman, not unless you would like me specifically to do so.

[[[The Chairman:]]] No, I think it would be better if we got on with it. Sorry about that.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: No, that is okay.

[[[Q32 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] At one stage, when Mr Broad was talking, I said to myself, “Well, what is all this evidence then? Is it anything to do with the inquiry, with the way you are looking at it?” Now, I think we are probably starting from the same basis.I am going to ask you the first question. What distinction do you draw, if any, between the so-called NEETs, young people looking for work, and other types of young people who may fit into a category? I have briefly referred to that. We intend the question to help us compare the definitions and understandings used at EU, Government and local authority levels. There seems to be a lot of confusion on this. Who would like to lead on that?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Shall I start?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, please.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: There is a fundamental issue in terms of wanting to categorise young people because I think therein lie some of the challenges. What we have, certainly within our city, within our local enterprise partnership area, are young people from 15 right up to 24 who, for those who can see a route or way through from formal school age through GCSEs into perhaps A levels and then into a degree, see a very clear pathway and that is a very structured pathway. Others, though, may not see a future based on an academic route that keeps them in formal education. Many people who we see falling out of the system often can be identified very early on, perhaps while they are at school in formal education. Those individuals could be identified as being at risk of being NEET.The problem that we have is that agencies want to classify and categorise young people. It is based on some of that categorisation and, therefore, eligibility that we start to programme resources, depending on how old they are, how long they have been out of work perhaps and whether they have been out of work for six months or 12 months. But what we need to do is see young people exactly as they are: young people who are trying to find a way in life, trying to better themselves and achieve something. Essentially, as a local authority, we want to be able to support those pathways to a life of independence, prosperity with very little dependency on public sector services. What this European funding is designed to do is to give young people the hope that there are safety nets and guarantees for them, which is going to help them along that journey.Yes, we categorise them at different stages: when they leave school between 16 right up until 18 and they are classified as NEET by the Education Funding Agency, and then they are classified as not being in employment by DWP, by the Skills Funding Agency. What we tend to do is put them in little compartments and pigeonholes and we treat them in different ways at different times in their life.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Who do you mean by “we”?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: I would say public sector agencies.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I see, thank you.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: However, from a local authority perspective, we have a leadership role, which is not about the resources that we hold. It is about how those resources impact and how those services impact on our citizens in particular neighbourhoods and in particular communities and on particular families.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: I will answer this question in a slightly different way. NEET is an all-encompassing term, which I think is pretty consistent everywhere and includes everybody. For our purposes, that means an unemployed Oxbridge graduate and, as an example, a homeless drug-addict parent with mental health issues who dropped out of school at 15. Both those categories are NEET. I do not think we need to use EU YEI money to worry about the former who will sort themselves out, but we need to focus on moving the latter towards the employment ladder.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I just ask for clarification there? Somebody who drops out of school and is looking after somebody else, they cannot be NEETs because they are not going to get any benefits until the age of 18. How do you categorise those? They are not NEETs. At least in my definition, NEETs are people who are at least 18.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: No, my understanding would be that, from the Commission or Government’s perspective, those people may not be claiming benefits but they are still NEET.

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] But they are not entitled to benefits.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, that is right. They are not entitled to benefits. They are NEET but they are not—

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Yes, but it is what it says on the tin. They may or may not be entitled to benefits but they are not in employment, education or training.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is right, but I do not think it makes any difference, does it? It does not matter how you categorise those people up to the age of 18 because they are not going to get anything anyway.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Yes. The NEET categorisation is consistent. I think where you do get inconsistencies sneaking in is when you talk about who is unemployed, for example, or who is economically inactive. Those are terms of art where you may find the EU has one definition and a Government has another.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You think the EU, the Government and local authorities all have different descriptions of NEETs?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: No, NEETs is the same.

[[[The Chairman:]]] NEETs are okay but it is the rest?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: It is the rest of them, yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I see. Mr Broad?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I have nothing further to add.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, okay, fine. Thank you.

[[[Q33 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Good afternoon. Thank you for the paper, which is lengthy but stimulating and gave rise to a number of questions from many of us that we will want to pursue later. There is a general consensus that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis across most of Europe. However, some would argue that there is a mismatch and that the unemployment arises because of the mismatch between the skills or absence of skills that individuals have compared with the jobs that require particular skills. On the other hand, others will argue that, at the end of the day, the real problem is that there are not enough jobs there to employ people regardless of whether or not they have the skills. What would you say about that in the light of your experience? Could you please summarise for us your view of exactly what the nature is of the current problems in your area? I know we have had your paper already, but we would be grateful if you could boil this down into a fairly concise response for Birmingham. We would be very interested indeed to hear what the position is in London. Who is affected by this and in what ways are they affected?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: I will start by giving you some examples from Birmingham. In terms of the causes of the spike and the serious issue about youth unemployment, which we looked at through the Birmingham Commission on Youth Unemployment this time last year, what we found was there were several reasons why there seemed to be a rise in the number of young people out of work. That was borne out by evidence taken from a cross-sector partnership.What witnesses to that commission were telling us was that clearly there was the impact of the recession. There was no doubt that young people bore the brunt of the lack of jobs, or the number of people that were being made redundant, losing their jobs and finding themselves participating in a very competitive marketplace, where they were pitching themselves for opportunities against people who had been made redundant, who probably had far better skills and were able to transfer those skills into the job opportunities that were available. That was one thing.There was clearly a lack of jobs, and even businesses were very nervous about bringing jobs forward to the marketplace because they were uncertain about their own productivity, the number of orders, and their order books. Even if there were opportunities, the nature of that employment offer perhaps was not full-time. It may have been part-time, so the opportunities were much less.I also think there is something in the skills mismatch. In Birmingham we were seeing a very much improved set of results coming out of our schools. We were better than our local authority neighbours. Far more young people are achieving their GCSEs and achieving what we feel is the average for young people, so we were exceeding those. Yet employers were still not recruiting young people who were presenting themselves for work.That mismatch between academic achievement versus employability skills and the softer skills that employers were looking for was expressed time and time again by businesses in the commission. Not only that, but we saw that where Government or national incentives were in place—being made available by the National Apprenticeship Service, by DWP—there was a lot going on. Certainly at a national level, agencies were desperately trying to put support in place to help young people.What that generated was a very confused marketplace for businesses to navigate through the plethora of support and the financial packages. If you wanted to take an apprentice, the eligibility rules were about you as a company, but if you wanted to recruit specifically somebody that was long-term unemployed, then it was about the individual and their eligibility. Businesses were saying, “We do not want to bother. We will go off and we will recruit somebody else”. There was an acknowledgement that we were all trying to do our bit locally, but it was not cohesive, it was fragmented and disparate. Therefore, with the packages that were put in place for young people, there was demonstrable market failure on behalf of what everybody was trying to do in terms of supporting young people.The other thing to say is that recently the Local Government Association produced a report that talked about lots and lots of training and qualifications being delivered by the further education sector, by training providers, but there was a mismatch between what was being delivered within the training family, the community of training providers, and what employers were asking for. The title of that report was something like, “Are we training too many hairdressers when we need engineers and people with automotive skills and the ability to make things, and we need more people with digital and IT technology?” There is something very much in that about what we are churning out, in terms of qualifications of young people and what businesses want. I will stop there.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Could I ask for the title of that report again and when it was published?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: It was published last year. Lord Chairman, I can find the title of the report for you.

[[[The Chairman:]]] If you could do that. Thank you very much.

[[[Q34 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] I want to ask Alex Conway: in passing you made a comment about the difference between an Oxbridge graduate temporarily out of work and I do not know whether it was a drug-addicted single mother or whatever. I wonder where you thought the relevant intervention was between charitable activity in getting people into work to address their social needs or an economic opportunity of trying to bring people that are just unemployable up to scratch so that they become employable. Where are you in that spectrum?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: That is a very interesting question. When people are devising EU funding-based contracts that all offer rewards for getting people into work, you have to start taking pretty close account of those kinds of issues.As a broad-brush statement I would say that an opportunity that you have with EU funds, which you do not necessarily have with domestic funding, is to try different things, including perhaps rather expensive things. If you need to treat drug addiction it is a very expensive business which is not typically sitting in a Jobcentre budget. Perhaps using YEI money you can say, “Here is something we really want to try with a limited cohort of people, to get somebody who is not going to enter the job market overnight but with a lot of time might get a little bit nearer”. The problem we always tend to have—and charities will say this time and again—is you are moving somebody up the job ladder but not necessarily into work, but the reward mechanisms are always about getting people into work and that means people will just cherry pick the “easier to do” people. How do you draw a line? Again, there is no easy answer to that. I think the answer is you have some fairly complex packages about trying to incentivise people to deal with the hardest to reach and not making it too easy for people just to deal with the dead weight of people who will find work anyway.

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] Do you hope that once they are in work those people will add value? Do you have any measure that says having put these people in work they should repay their salary in terms of added value? Where does that come into the thinking?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: I think the fundamental thinking from this Government, and pretty much every Government, is getting anyone into any kind of paid work is absolutely crucial for avoiding the ultimate cost to society of a life on benefits. Essentially, there is almost no question that almost any kind of work is better than someone who is not doing anything.

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] My point is that coming out of recession you obviously want your businesses to be as competitive as possible, and if there is a philosophy around where you are mentoring or training people, it can be a cost in the early years.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Yes.

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] As you are trying to come out of recession, is that the right time to be putting that drag on to business, as you could describe it in one sense? I am not trying to argue against it; I just wonder if you have a view on whether, when they first go in, they should be delivering at or exceeding the amount they are paid.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Yes. One of the many things that the Government has been trying out is payments particularly to small businesses to encourage people to take on apprenticeships. I think the jury is still out on whether these kinds of payments work, but it seems to me that it is certainly something that is worth trying. This leads on to a question we might come to later about how willing employers are to engage with these kinds of things. Some will be; some will not be. If a cash incentive helps, then it is probably a price worth paying in my view.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. Lord Brooke, is there anything further on that question that you want to ask?

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] No. I was interested in your final comment there on incentivisation, that this is an area that perhaps is worth further exploration.

[[[Q35 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] I want to ask about the attitude of employers. Of course, I recognise we are talking about a very wide spectrum of people, but there are certain common denominators. Do you find that among employers there is a concern about youth unemployment or very little concern? We can go on enjoying the same sort of routine as before? What do you find? Do they offer any avenue of help? Are they concerned about the issue or more concerned about how they operate themselves?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: When we have looked at this particular issue we have done it alongside employers and employers expressing to us what it is that they felt were the issues. What we are finding in Birmingham—and I think this is true in other cities—is that there is a growing concern about our young people, the fact that essentially young people are the future workforce. Therefore, if they are not displaying or providing the right skills that businesses require for those businesses to grow, to be productive and to remain competitive, not only locally, regionally or nationally but also globally, then they have to think about how they are going to continue to be successful businesses. That means looking at their current workforce, and some of those businesses are recognising that their profile is now an ageing one. We have businesses in Birmingham and more widely across the enterprise partnership area that are concerned that they are not bringing enough toolmakers into their businesses. If they want to produce a skilled toolmaker to replace the person that has been in their workforce for 30 or 40 years, they should have started training that person a very long time ago.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Surely that is exactly the place where apprentices should be?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Absolutely, and apprenticeships are not necessarily a one-year apprenticeship or a two-year apprenticeship.

[[[The Chairman:]]] No, of course not; five and 10 years, yes.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: They should be five years, 10 years. A doctor or somebody going through medical school is an apprentice for seven years. We need to think more about young people not necessarily coming in with the right skills from day one but coming in as trainees.

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Is the view you express that of many employers, or not enough of them?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Employers are beginning to recognise that they are going to have to co-invest. That means they are going to have to give up their time and support those young people just as much as public sector agencies, and it is a right and responsibility of young people themselves. There are lots of parts to play here and different parts to bring together.

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] How is that manifested?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Some businesses quite welcome other agencies and training professionals going into their businesses and helping to train young people. Very small companies have very little time to train young people but are willing to send them off to college for one or two days a week to help in that. Some of them welcome the Government incentives that exist to offset some of the costs for training and view it as an investment into their company. Without a doubt, there are businesses who feel that what is important to them is running their business and what they want is an oven-ready person to come in. There is a duty also to create those people, perhaps using larger employers who can provide the environment to train some young people with a view not to keep them but perhaps to pass them on to their supply chain companies. That is something that we are seeing more and more of, about how we share the burden of training.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is very interesting. Lord Kakkar, you want to come in.

[[[Q36 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] I will just pick up on a very interesting point about apprenticeships and long-term investment in training people. Do the funds that are available from the European Union allow for that to happen? Are there programmes of funding that will allow a seven-year fellowship or apprenticeship—whatever it is called—to be established to take an individual from the outset and train them to a very highly skilled place?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Historically, no. Although they work in seven-year cycles, European funding programmes have invariably supported short-term projects that last two or three years. Therefore, it is always short-termism. I think the approach that is now being taken for the next seven-year cycle, 2014 to 2020, is encouraging local enterprise partnerships and their local authorities to develop longer-term solutions and—as I tried to outline in my opening discussion—to develop much more integrated longer-term strategic plans. This will allow us to develop much more coherent and longer-term working relationships with business and local organisations that can help us work with the supply and the demand.The answer to your question in terms of what we would want to do with EU funds and how we can use them in the programme moving forward with greater local accountability, is that we want to use the different EU funds and the local investments to support business in a much more integrated business gateway that links skills, skill support and working with the supply of labour, with the demand for labour and to tailor-make the oven-ready provision to them.

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] Going forward, does what is proposed facilitate that, or are there roadblocks?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Yes, it can do. In the local enterprise partnership areas we are responsible for developing our seven-year strategies, and we have just done the first draft. They are finalised in January. We have outlined our seven-year strategic plans, which aim to do just that. The holistic business gateway proposal that brings different funds together to support business, not just with skills but other types of business support provision in a more holistic way, is our ambition. That is the point that I made at the beginning about integration rather than fragmentation, and what Shilpi said about compartmentalising various people in various ways and different types of activity happening in different places and never in one all-encompassing single way. That is the approach we want to take with the EU funds.

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Can you influence the MEPs in your area in the direction you prefer?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I do not think it is the MEPs that are the problem for us. I think it is our own Government.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Business people.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: No, I think it is our own Government in terms of what they would prefer to be an efficient European programme. Ultimately, they are accountable to the European Commission and need to think about simplified, less bureaucratic processes that do not present too much risk to Government in terms of paying money back to Brussels. Therefore, they prefer to take a more centralist approach to the overall management of EU programmes, notwithstanding in this next period they are putting the strategic focus in the hands of local areas. What we are looking for is greater local accountability over how we deploy those funds locally alongside other local investments in one seven-year strategic plan.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Just to enforce Lloyd’s point, your point that there are other member states that do manage programmes over seven-year periods and have seven-year budgets, the reason we do not have it in the UK is basically to do with spending review timetables, which stem nationally and then feed down locally as well. If Government is doling out money in three-year chunks and Birmingham only knows how much money it has for three years, projects are unlikely to last more than three years.

[[[Q37 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] You made one interesting comment. They want to avoid paying money back to Brussels. What is that risk? What are you thinking of?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: The risk is cities like Birmingham and, indeed, London are always claiming they want greater delegation of funding and local accountability for decision-making. It is those sorts of powers that we all cry out for. However, there is so much EU regulation around EU resources, if it is not managed and accounted for and reported in the very auditable way in which the European Commission expects, there is a risk that if it is not managed properly it gets paid back. English programmes and UK programmes have fallen foul of subtleties within those regulations and, therefore, funding gets suspended or programmes get suspended as a result. It is quite a risky landscape, and I think the centralist approach is more towards guarding against the potential to hand money back rather than entrusting local areas to handle it.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Can I just pin this one down? You can be given money to carry out a scheme. You can carry out a scheme. You have been doing it for two years and somebody says, “You have not done it quite right. We want the money back”?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Yes.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Yes, and it happens a lot.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] It happens a lot?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That came to the fore last week, when there was a report of the Court of Auditors saying there was something like £4 billion that has to be weighed back in from people who have been paid it but they have not delivered, so to speak.

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] I am sure the employers in Birmingham are much the same as everywhere else. They complain about people with lack of skills and people with a lack of the right attitude. I notice in your paper that you try to get these firms to look after their own interests by, you say here, “Placing contract conditions on organisations tendering for work that follow the Birmingham business charter for social responsibility”, for instance. I also imagine that it is the same in Birmingham as everywhere else that some employers say, “We are not going to train people. What we will do is we will poach the people that other people have trained”. Do you try to find a way through this by your Birmingham business charter for social responsibility and insisting that contractors conform to that? Do you try to do anything about firms poaching, and do you generally try to encourage firms to train their own people rather than get people from abroad?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Yes. It is all of those things and a few other things. As a local authority there are a number of levers that we have where we can influence the labour market or the jobs market, or even capture jobs for particular groups that we feel are a priority; in this case, young people. The budget is diminishing—it feels like by the week at the moment—and we used to have a budget of £3 billion. We were the largest local authority in Europe. Our spending power is huge. If we are buying and procuring services, whether they are goods, services, construction, whatever, what we can write into those contracts is, “We would like you to do something for us if you are going to deliver a building for us”, for instance. Within that, we can stipulate that, “We want to work with you because surely, as a result of winning this contract, you might have a few more people you need to recruit. We would like some of those to be apprentices and we would like some of those to be apprentices from Birmingham, perhaps even from a particular neighbourhood where there are lots of young people who are unemployed”. That is where we can talk to them. It is not about policing what they do but supporting them to find the right people.What we do with our local partners is to prepare them for those particular jobs. We can read the labour market and we have some knowledge of where the sectors are growing. As we know, there are a lot of jobs in the health and social care sector. We have an ageing population. We need to take care of our elderly, and we need to bring in more well trained and very well qualified young people to provide a good high-quality of care. We are purchasing those services as a local authority, so we have a duty to make sure we have a response to that demand. The local enterprise partnerships are very much placing themselves in that position. We know where our growth sectors are, but what we need to be doing is taking that information and putting it into schools, giving it to careers advisers so that they can advise young people about the right qualifications they should be taking and  the right routes that they should be following, such as “Do you need maths and English and science for this or do you need something else?” We need to be informing our young people right through school so that they can be helped and supported to make the right choices, so that we have enough people to make our cars, support our elderly residents in care and so on.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I think that is great. I would sum all of that up as joined-up thinking, in effect.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I think that is very good but we have to rush on.

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] Could I ask how effective it is?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: We are getting better. But I have to say that working in that way, where businesses are leading the training agenda and the preparation of young people, is something that is fairly new. We need more of that. It has to be led by business.

[[[Q38 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] Perhaps I could come back to the point about the European Union being able to claw back funds once they have been spent. We have two large authorities here, Birmingham and London. How frequently has it happened that you have spent EU funds for the Government only to be told that they must pay the money back?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: I would draw a distinction. The Commission has what is called the N+2 rule, a great bit of jargon. What it means is if you do not spend money quickly enough they claw it back anyway. I am happy to say that has never happened in London, so we have never failed to spend the money quickly enough. Of course, whether you are spending it wisely is another question.The second point about so-called irregularities is that, for one reason or another, there is virtually no EU project that will not have some level of money, and it may be a very trivial sum, clawed back, because when audited you have four different sets of auditors. You have my team, Government auditors, Brussels auditors and the European Court of Auditors, who audit the auditors, who all come and check your work. They will always find something. I should hasten to add that it is not fraud, It is not so, it is the nature of it.

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] What proportion? Clearly, it makes central Government nervous about giving you the local control that you want and that you could most effectively apply. In terms of the proportion of money that is causing this anxiety, what is it?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: I would say it is low overall, typically under 2%.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Yes, I think there have been instances across England, albeit not in Birmingham or London I think. I am unable to comment on levels, but there have been issues where programmes have been suspended because of what are often in the grander scheme of things minor irregularities, but that is what auditors are there to do, find these things and then report them.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is right, but it is a different sort of situation in London, is it not? The evidence we have is it is claimed that the number of unemployed young people in London equals the number of vacancies.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: There is a different situation and I can go back to that if you like.

[[[The Chairman:]]] No, perhaps you could write to us about this. If this is true, what prevents them being matched with each other?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: A very short answer: one thing that is different about London is that there is a lot of competition at the level of unskilled entry jobs. That largely comes from economic migrants who come to London who may be working legally or illegally or, indeed, commuters from outside London. There are lots of vacancies in London but there is also a lot of competition.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Is there a mismatch in the West Midlands between the jobs available and the people competing for jobs?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Yes. What we are finding is that we often have between 10 and 15 people chasing a retail job in a supermarket and perhaps two people chasing a job at a higher skill level. There is that mismatch. We need to have a look at that and look more at how we are fostering high-level skills, not only through an academic route but through an apprenticeship route. That needs to be on the job, in companies, and look at high-level apprenticeship schemes and not just people going through school, college and university.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Of course you could miss out. The last three chief executives of Tesco started off doing Saturday work and then loaded shelves and then became CEO’s.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Absolutely.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You cannot say that it is only a supermarket job.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: No, I think it is the demand.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Part of the thing is to get people into work to know what work is about and get the regulation and discipline.

[[[Q39 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] Three times now you have mentioned schools, and you mentioned leaflets going into schools in the last report. What happens about the feedback? Who gets the feedback? Who is responsible for getting the feedback to you? Or are you happy with no feedback at all? Do you wait for the individuals to reply?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: I am sorry, Lord Fearn, when you said leaflets into schools, I did not—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Leaflet?

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] You said that the schools have a lot to do with this and you also said that some people in schools would be employable—I think you used that word—and others would not. I wonder how you sort them out. Who sorts them out? Who goes back and asks?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Right. There are two things here. One of them is what happens to individuals when they leave school. Many schools now encourage their pupils to stay on until sixth form and there is a growing marketplace to retain children in school. Some schoolchildren leave school because it was not suitable for them, but there is an onus now and there is a public duty on schools to publish the destinations of every single individual school leaver. The feedback we are getting from schools is that they keep the good ones and the other ones go off somewhere else. Hopefully, they are going off into colleges, undertaking some vocational education and training. Some of them will go to other voluntary sector training providers, for instance, or even private sector training providers.What we have found—and I think this is the answer that you are looking for—is that most employers are saying whenever they come out they are still not ready for work. The feedback we are getting is that when individuals, and particularly young people, present themselves for interview they do not have the required skills.One of the things that we are doing in Birmingham local authority is introducing the Birmingham baccalaureate, which is almost a certification or a qualification based on employability skills that have been pulled together by the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, with seven indicators of what makes a good employee. Those good soft skills include problem solving, communication skills, team working and building those skills into the curriculum. When they are doing their geography or their maths, what does that mean in terms of problem-solving capabilities? How are you going to demonstrate those to an outside organisation? That needs to happen all the way through school, not just in your two-week work experience, which often they get.

[[[Q40 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Thank you for your written evidence from Birmingham City Council. Reading it, I got the impression of complexity in organisational structure and duplication. After all, we have had a recession now for six years and we are still talking about introducing new initiatives. If you would not mind being candid with the Committee, within the West Midlands conurbation I counted at least six different organisations—including the employers involved, the voluntary sector obviously, Birmingham City Council, but also the LEPs and Greater Birmingham—if you were in charge, and if you had the authority, how would you simplify the structure to make sure that we are helping young people with the minimum of bureaucracy and the minimum of complexity?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: The major thing for me is to keep it simple and uncomplicated, so that young people when they leave school or find themselves wanting a job or wanting training know where to go to get it. So that there is clear signposting, there is a single gateway and they know what they are going to get when they knock on that door and express themselves as needing some support. The great majority of young people will not need that support, but there are a great number, too, that will need some support at some point during their young life. It is a matter of understanding that they can pick up some information or look for that information remotely and that the answer will be simple. Behind that, there might be a plethora of answers, resources, funding, specialisms, experts, all ready to deploy that, but the front of it, and the window to this, must be simple and uncomplicated.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] We do not have it?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: No, and the reason for that is because young people, and some adults, have to find the funding, and the funding sits in different places in different departments and you access it in different ways. What needs to happen is the funding should follow the person according to the needs that they need to overcome or there might be a skills barrier they need to overcome. That complexity is far too great at the moment. There is a plethora of disparate, fragmented, piecemeal provision and the landscape is unclear.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Perhaps I could add something to that, my Lord Chairman. I think this is the opportunity that now faces us with a new seven-year programme of EU investment funds being placed in the hands of local enterprise partnerships to develop their strategies. It is that local alignment that we are talking about in developing what we want to be one strategic economic plan for our territory, which is focused on people, place and business, that does demystify a very, very complex landscape but provides one single gateway to all, where what we see right now is what we describe as like a hub and spoke with a multitude of gateways for various types of support. What we want is one single gateway, an integrated gateway, which is based on co-investments, co-commissioning, co-decision-making, and co-design.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] One final question from me: could you explain to the Committee your thoughts about how we create this single gateway?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Exactly, yes. It should be the objective number one in the new funding.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I think Lord Heseltine, in his report No Stone Unturned: in pursuit of growth, pretty much said to Government, through what was meant to be a large announcement on the local growth deals available to local enterprise partnerships, that there should be one single pot of funding for growth. Within the Lord Heseltine work there was the Greater Birmingham project that went into greater detail, which we are happy to share with the Committee. That gave examples of how that integrated single pot approach and single gateway would work for our territory.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Is that published anywhere?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: It is.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Could you provide that?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Absolutely.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. That is very kind of you.

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] These funds have all come to local authorities so far, though, is that correct? These funds sit with local authorities or with local government?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: They notionally have been allocated to local enterprise partnerships, but local enterprise partnerships have a very different status and being wherever you go across the country. They are normally administrated by the largest local authority in their patch, so Birmingham City Council administers the local enterprise partnership for our area. Funding has been notionally allocated to that area for a seven-year period, but then there are a number of conditions attached to that, which are based on—as Alex noted earlier—things like N+2 and spending and output targets. You commission your projects, and if you spend your money and deliver outcomes the money will keep coming. If you do not, it stops.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: The Lord Heseltine report was important. It did set out a vision whereby EU funding might be matched to a streamlined source of domestic funding and let us be empowered to do things. Not untypically what the Government has done is it has devolved EU funding, but it has devolved pretty trivial amounts of match funding and there are still lots of separate reporting lines. I think it does fall to us to try to co-ordinate things at the local level.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Get your act together.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: We are not getting a whole lot of help from Government in that, to be honest.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: We are challenging them daily on devolving some of those powers to us to do just that.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, but you have all the information at your fingertips. If it is such a cohesive package and they would find this is so marvellous let them run with it.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: It is localism versus risk, my Lord Chairman, and I think Governments have a greater fear of the risk of paying back.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, but nothing is without risk.

[[[Q41 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] We were led to believe by DWP in their evidence that they are engaged in some very constructive exchanges with the local organisations and there will be many new initiatives coming out—probably announced before Christmas—on a way forward, if I understand the position correctly.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Let us wait and see.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Do they have the say-so on the expenditure at the end of the day, including the European one?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: As I said, it is intended that the strategic plan of who and what we want to spend our money on is within our control. However, the current model that Governments are proposing is that you then filter that money through the national agencies that will do what you want them to do for you. Fundamentally, our problem over the past seven years was that the model of national agencies—like the Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Work and Pensions through Jobcentre Plus—operate regional contracting where they hand the money to prime contractors. Prime contractors can be from anywhere, so people from Liverpool parachute into Birmingham, try to deliver local training and employment, skills services and provision for our local people, but the problem we have is it never penetrates down deep enough to tackle the deep-rooted problems that we have.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Surely you have contacts at a level where you would be able to convince them that that is what they should be doing. It is analysis and analysis, but action is what is needed.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: There is a simple example. There are two conditions that we would have loved for the SFA and the DWP to place on their contractors. Condition 1: please make sure that they put geographically targeted conditions in that contract so that we can ensure that the money gets spent in the right places so they do not cherry pick. They were not able to put that condition in there. Condition 2—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Why were they not able to do it? The EU said no, or who said no?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: It was nothing to do with the EU.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Who is it then?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: We wanted them to do so. They were not obliged to do so. Condition 2: please consult with your local authorities on who to target your resource to.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Those big agencies will typically say, “We are just working to national procurement rules and we cannot do anything any different”. In fairness, I have to say that for 2014 to 2020—and we were talking about this outside—these same agencies are saying, “We see that this top-down approach has not been that successful and we are going to change. Just tell us what you want and we will do it”. My key challenge in the next two months is to find out whether that is true.

[[[The Chairman:]]] And yours?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Yes, absolutely. It is shared, yes.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: We are saying, “No, we will do it ourselves, thank you”.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I know we have to crack on. Yes, Lady Valentine, your question, and then we have a few more.

[[[Q42 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] Very quickly, I just want to come in in support of this because I have known the people on the London Skills and Employment Board and now the London Enterprise Panel and the London Development Agency since 2000. The business people serving in any of those bodies—who are roughly all the same people for the last decade—feel they have no purchase on the delivery of any of these programmes at all. They cannot make the system deliver what they ask for and they have been planning perfectly sensibly for a decade.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Hence our desire to take greater local accountability.

[[[The Chairman:]]] We have to crack this, do we not?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: We are trying.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Somebody has to.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: This is what the Heseltine report laid out.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Perhaps we ought to revisit it and have a look.

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] What happened, as I understand it, is that the Heseltine report suggested £70 billion.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: In the local growth deal it ended up as £2 billion.

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] It was watered down to about, what, five?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: £2 billion, but that has strings attached and it is competitive across the whole country.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It would be comic if it were not so sad. We have all these young people without a future. It is fine for us who are sitting here saying, “Oh, well, it is pathetic”, but the reality is something has to be done about it.

[[[Q43 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] Some witnesses have argued that there are too many different schemes and programmes—we have heard a few this morning—both domestic and European. Do you share that view and, if so, what would be a better approach?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I think it is to bring it all together in an integrated way which aligns, complements and provides additionality—the co-design, co-investment, co-strategic option. Otherwise, you end up with complexity, multi-layers, multi-gateways and, potentially, duplication.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: All I would add to that is: do not forget there are billions of pounds at stake here so it would be odd if we tried to do it all through one big scheme. Of course, things like the Work Programme suggest that is not such a great idea. What I do think is important in London in particular—and perhaps we have a slightly different approach from Birmingham—is we want to understand what the Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Work and Pensions and the Big Lottery Fund, with all their hundreds of millions of pounds of match funding, are offering. Hopefully, they are going to deliver on their promises to do what we want. Once we have that, then we can work on filling in the gaps with smaller voluntary sector organisations, with our own resources and the resources of London boroughs. I think we need to get that big picture with these big organisations that do have hundreds of millions of pounds sorted first.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: We respect that national programmes are not necessarily going away, but what we want is to have greater ability to align what those national programmes do with local investments within this joint strategic process that makes it all work better together. We are not saying we want to do it instead of. We want to do it with, but in a much more co-designed way.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Do you have any experience of European countries and the way that they handle it in a devolved fashion? Are there any you know from your experience that are particularly successful, and could you direct us towards making enquiries there?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Absolutely. In one word, the Netherlands.

[[[Q44 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Okay, that is great. Now I have been nobbled on both sides. It is not easy being a chairman of this Committee, believe you me. What specifically do you plan to do with the extra EU new employment initiative funds? That is really central to what we are worrying about.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: Firstly, I will not repeat everything I have said about developing new local governance arrangements that allow us to align those funds. I think it is worth about £19 million in youth employment initiative funding in our local enterprise partnership area alone. What we want to do is co-invest that with other local provision. We want to build on successful programmes. There are successful programmes in our patch that are successfully targeting young people and doing good things with them. What we want to do is align the EU funding to that and build on the work of our youth commission, which has developed the Birmingham Jobs Fund. We developed the apprenticeship offer, which was the target of developing 1,000 apprenticeships in 100 days. We exceeded that. The YEI money has to be spent within the first two years, so we want to build it on what we know works in our area with the people that we know that can deliver in our area and effectively get what we call “shovel ready” programmes on the ground in January 2014. We know what works in our area and we think we are able to do so.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Are the funds likely to be sufficient to do the things that you are planning to do?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I think it is a sufficient amount of money for the first two years. My only problem with this is that it detracts away from all the other people that need the support in our areas as well.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is a tough world out there, is it not?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: We have to match those youth employment initiative funds with our existing ESF resource, so it deflects for the first two years that resource away from other people as well.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: My point is that it all helps. In London we have some £500 million that we will be spending on ESF and about £37 million of that is YEI money. We are not planning to do something completely separate and different with it. We need to look at it as part of an integrated whole.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: It is targeted.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Coalesce it.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: There is a particular difficulty that I would just like to highlight, which is that this money—due to quirks of EU statistics—only applies to inner London. The reality is that in outer London unemployment levels are pretty similar, but as things stand we cannot use this money in places like Barking and Dagenham, and Waltham Forest, which could really use it. The Government has retained some 10% flexibility on how it uses the YEI and it has not announced yet what it intends to do. We would love to hear that we would have the flexibility to be able to do that so that we do not have to exclude people who live on the wrong side of the street from accessing this money.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Why do you not ask them?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: We have, but I think they might want to give it to Wales.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I just say there are two remaining questions and they are very important? We want to get through them. The first one is the point that Lord Cotter was going to ask that has not been mentioned.

[[[Q45 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] I have seen your report peripherally. Clearly we are talking about young people, so we would like to know how you are engaging with young people themselves to learn what they are saying to you. We need to inspire, enthuse and help them. What are you doing or going to do in that regard? Perhaps you can help us. We wish to do that as a Committee and it is very difficult for us to pick out and ask groups of young people to come along and tell us what it is all about.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: I asked around a little bit ahead because it was an interesting question. When it comes to skills-based or training-based schemes that you have ready-made, you have young people in school and you can ask them. Many contracts issued by the likes of the Skills Funding Agency will require that there is consultation as part of the package that is developed. The harder question to answer is what about these hard-to-reach youth that I was talking about earlier.

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] Yes.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: If you knew where they were, it would be easy.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It would not be hard to reach.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Even there, of course, in London we have a scheme that involves working with young offenders in Feltham Prison. Unfortunately, youth are in prison and you do know where to find them and you can do real targeted one-to-one work, which I think has been quite successful. Otherwise, I think it is a tricky one. Again, it comes back to having a multiplicity of approaches because we have found that when it comes to dealing with the hardest-to-reach groups, then charities that perhaps specialise in drug addiction or an ultra-local approach from a particular estate is how you might find your hardest-to-reach people. There is no easy answer. The London boroughs reminded me that you often have young mayors or youth councils. Indeed, I think there is a youth Parliament. That is another way, but it occurs to me that the kids doing that kind of thing are probably quite civic minded already, but that may not be what you are trying to get at here.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you.

[[[Q46 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] A question of best practice. A lot of people have talked about the need to exchange best practice throughout Europe. Birmingham has done quite a lot on this, I am told. What is your impression about how good the exchange of best practice is? How much is it used? The final bit of all that: are there gaps in the exchange of best practice information that ought to be filled in in some way?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I will answer that. Birmingham City Council was given intermediate body status to manage for the Department for Work and Pensions the transnational part of the ESF programme for the current programming period. We managed that as a national programme for the English regions in the last seven years. What we have found is that, in answer to your question, yes, there is good practice to be gleaned. What we need to do is develop a much more coherent and effective infrastructure that allows that sharing of knowledge, expertise and practice on an even footing.Where we have had problems in the last seven years is that, again, it is a very fragmented landscape. Every single member state tackles ESF in a subtly different way. Therefore, their governance and their organisational arrangements and, indeed, their priorities will often differ. What we have been trying to do for this new programming period—and I have been doing this on behalf of DWP with other member states across Europe—is develop what we are calling a thematic common framework, a theme for example being youth unemployment, and allow member states to bring forward their approaches to tackling each of these different thematic areas, whether it is active ageing, youth unemployment and so on, and bring together ESF programmes from different member states so you are working on a very similar landscape and a very similar playing field. What we have found in the last seven years is there are an awful lot of things that you can learn from other places, whether it is Scandinavia and how they deal with active ageing, or whether it is Germany and how they deal with their apprenticeship programmes, or whether it is Italy and how they deal with some of their social policies. There is a lot of learning you can take from different places. What we need to do is develop a framework that allows that mutuality to thrive and where people can more effectively learn from each other. We are supporting this EU-level framework to allow LEPs within regions or former regions, territories, as well as member states to share their approaches of how they are using EU programmes to do just that. We are quite excited about how the new framework can facilitate and enable that mutual learning.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Where could this Committee find a list of best practice:  "Youth unemployment best practice—the Netherlands is terrific", and so on all the way down? Where can we find it?

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: The DG-Employment EUROPA website does keep a whole list of publications, but if you are really that interested in looking at some of the EU best practice, a number of studies have been done. Even Birmingham, with EU funding, has run a transnational project called Cities for Active Inclusion, which has involved eight or nine different cities around Europe. The report that is now in the process of being developed, because the project is coming to an end, has done just that. It has captured good practice around active inclusion policies from different cities. I know that we got you directly involved in that, Shilpi, did we not?

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Yes.

[[[Alex Conway]]]: To add another example to that, the London Borough of Enfield is involved in Jobtown. That is a European network of local partnerships for the advancement of youth employment. I would say what Lloyd was saying. It is a relative strength of EU-funded schemes that a lot of work is put both into transnational schemes and, indeed, their evaluation. Part of the problem with this—and we can let you have this—is that these schemes run for two or three years and then stop, and then they are out there in the ether, but that is it.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is right, yes. It seems a terrible shame when somebody has gone to a huge amount of trouble, or a lot of people have gone to a huge amount of trouble, to do it. If we could have a list of these, that would be very useful. We will just cast an eye over them.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: We funded 32 projects across England and we can give you access to an evaluation report of that programme and examples of those projects that were funded within that project.

[[[The Chairman:]]] We do not want a pantechnicon full of paper, I can assure you.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: It is very simple. It is plain English, I think.

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] Can I make a very quick statement?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, Lord Cotter.

[[[Q47 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] I was very concerned about your answer about the young people, coming from a local authority. I was a councillor elsewhere and we set up a sub-committee on the leisure committee. I would hope that you might think about this issue, regardless of it being youth unemployment, leisure or whatever it is. You should know who they all are: organisations, youth clubs and so on. If you do not know, who would know? I was a bit concerned.

[[[Lloyd Broad]]]: I do not think we have answered your question very well.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Sorry, my Lord Chairman—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Two minutes.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: Thank you very much. You are absolutely right. One fundamental point I want to make is that some brilliant best practice is home-grown, and it is home-grown by voluntary sector organisations and young people themselves, and we need to take account of that. What we ought to be doing is asking how we can expand that and extend it with European money.

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Exactly.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: In terms of young people, I think you are absolutely right. We had representation from a young person who was representing a wider group on our commission. Talent Match—the Big Lottery—had a huge group of young people saying what they wanted from future programmes. When I say "a single uncomplicated gateway where there is lots of wraparound support", that is exactly what they want.On the other hand, we should never forget that the ultimate destination for young people once they have created a pathway is hopefully to move them into a life of working. We must remember that part of this equation is to work with businesses and we need to make sure that we are responding to some of the needs that they are expressing about a simple system, a place where they can go for information that is easy to access. You are quite right. The local authority has lots of children in care. We have lots of children in care who present a huge complexity of issues. We have a statutory duty for young NEET people and unknowns, and often we have the duty but not the resource to act on our own and we have to work in partnerships. We have to work with schools and increasingly schools are self-governing. They respond locally. They do not have and are not required to have the contact that they used to with local authorities. When things go wrong, we often find ourselves holding the baby.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Picking up the pieces, yes.

[[[Shilpi Akbar]]]: We have to be very strong about making those connections and keeping those connections and having good tracking systems, only as far as to progress people.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. I think that has given us all a bit of hope, yes. It is something we have discussed many times. I say on behalf of the whole Committee, thank you very much indeed. If you have any notes that you can leave it would help the shorthand writers, because we have been going at it hammer and tongs and I think they must have a terrible job. I have tried to keep it simple but it does not always work out that way. You have given us a lot of food for thought, and although London did not produce a report, thank you very much indeed, Mr Conway. The document certainly ruined my Sunday evening, but it was very illuminating. Thank you very much indeed for that. We shall let you know when the report is published, obviously, but if there is anything fundamental that you think we have not touched on—I am sure there are many points—do you think that you could let us know?

[[[Alex Conway]]]: Absolutely.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much.&#xa0;
