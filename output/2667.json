"PPC 19&#xa0;Supplementary evidence from Sue Mountstevens, Police and Crime Commissioner for Avon &amp; Somerset, following the evidence session on 11 September 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion: How are drug and alcohol services funded in your area in this financial year, following the devolution of responsibility to local authorities and to yourselves, and how do you respond to DrugScope’s concerns that there is a risk of disinvestment from such\n services now that the budget is no longer ring-fenced?\n&#xa0;\nAnswer: \n&#xa0;\nIn 2012/13 I provided funding to Drug and Alcohol Action Teams (DAATs) for the purpose of providing a drug arrest referral service in custody. The level and proportion of funding I provided \nto the DAATs was based on historic arrangements (i.e. the level of funding provided to them by the Home Office in 2011/12, minus the cut in the community safety grant that the Commissioner received for 2012/13 – approximately 12%). On investigation the Hom\ne Office confirmed historic funding allocations to DAATs were based on the number of custody suites in their local authority area.\n&#xa0;\nMajor changes are due to come in effect to custody provision in 2014/15 in Avon and Somerset, with a reduction to four main \nsites (of which three are completely new suites, built via PFI). Therefore DAATs will see a very different number of custody suites/cells in their local authority area – with Bristol moving from having a majority of custody places, to none. Given this I de\ncided (in June 2013) to undertake an innovative single commission for this service to commence from April 2014. Key principles in undertaking the single commission were as follows:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo ensure a high quality and consistent service across Avon and Somerset (h\nistorically each DAAT operated their service slightly different and some areas had a higher quality service than others)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeliver value for money (and in reality a reduced cost service, with less custody suites and only one provider)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo provide a substance \nmisuse arrest referral service (i.e. to include the whole range of categories of drugs and alcohol)\n&#xa0;\nGiven the expert knowledge of drug and alcohol commissioning within the DAATs I decided to second in a drug and alcohol commissioning manager from one of t\nhe DAATs (South Gloucestershire) to lead the commissioning, working 2.5 days per week on this project. The cost of this was split between all the DAATs and the Office of the PCC. Similarly the Constabulary Drug Strategy manager was also seconded to work on\n this project for the same amount of time. Bristol DAAT also provided a one day per week resource to support this work and all the DAATs have engaged in the commission as it has developed. As such it is a true partnership commission, led by the OPCC, to de\nliver the first single commission drug and alcohol arrest referral service \n&#xa0;\nacross a whole force area, where there is more than one DAAT, in the country.\n&#xa0;\nThe removal of the ring fence on funding has not therefore had a negative effect on drug and alcohol \ncommissioning in Avon and Somerset. \n&#xa0;\nI did also want to take this opportunity to reiterate one point which I made at the Committee about the importance of protecting successful existing partnerships in developing the Transforming Rehabilitation proposals.\n For example, there is a very effective Integrated Offender Management scheme in Avon and Somerset. The scheme in Bristol has been very effective in reducing serious acquisitive crime - in the period 2007/08 to 2012/13 Serious Acquisitive Crime rates have \nreduced in \nBristol by 58% which is the biggest reduction over this period in any of the 8 core cities. The other core cities who have made significant investments in IoM (Nottingham and Greater Manchester) have also seen significant reductions in recorded \nSerious Acquisitive Crime. As part of implementing the Transforming Rehabilitation proposals I would want to see IoM arrangements replicated through the service delivery arrangements as far as possible e.g. private sector staff being seconded in to IoM sch\nemes as probation staff are currently. One of the reasons the Bristol IOM scheme has been successful is that it has focused in a very targeted way on those offenders with the highest risk of reoffending. It would probably be helpful overall if a prescripti\nve approach was taken in the specifications of the Transforming Rehabilitation service requirements as this would be a means of ensuring a consistent approach to IOM across the country based on the most successful schemes. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
