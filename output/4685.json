"&#xa0;\nAFS0088&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Ofsted&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThis submission is Ofsted’s response to the Committee’s call for written evidence on academies and free schools.  It \ndraws upon published findings from the \nAnnual Report 2012/13 as well as analysis of inspection outcomes and examination results for 2013.\n \nOfsted inspects all academies under section 5 inspection arrangements\n.\n \n \nWe have long experience of inspecting sponsor-led academies, which tend to be scho\nols which have replaced predecessors with challenging histories\n;\n more recently there is growing ins\npection evidence about ‘converte\nr’ academies, which tend to be successful schools. \n&#xa0;\nAs outlined in the Annual Report 2012-13, \nOfsted will assess the impact \nof conversion to academy status on school performance in the coming year. This will include detailed reporting on how well new academies make use of their autonomy and freedom to innovate and raise standards. We will also report in more detail on the perfo\nrmance of free schools once more schools have been inspected in 2013/14.\n&#xa0;\nRecent reports from Ofsted, such as \nUnseen Children: access and achievement in education – 20 Years On\n, and changes to inspection frameworks, have\n collectively\n put an increased focus\n on ensuring that the quality of education improves\n,\n especially in those schools that are in the most disadvantaged areas and where the gaps between the performance of disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers differs most. In this submission,\n the term ‘disadvantaged’ refers to those students from low income backgrounds that have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the previous 6 years (FSM6).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(a) The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and (b) what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes:&#xa0;Part (a)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Part (b)&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;What role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply;  and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nUnvalidated\n examination results \n \nExcept for 16-19 academies which are inspected under the Common Inspection Framework for Further Education Learning and Skills\n Figures are for primary and secondary academies where deprivation has been classified. \nDeprivation is b\nased on the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) 2010. The deprivation of a provider is based on the mean of the deprivation indices associated with the home post codes of the pupils attending the school rather than the location of the schoo\nl itself. The schools are divided into five equal groups (quintiles) that are labelled from ‘most deprived’ to ‘least deprived’\n \n \nThis includes f\nree \ns\nchools, University Technical Colleges and \ns\ntudio \ns\nchools\nAll academ\nies, including free schools, have a l\negal status as\n independent schools and must meet the requirements of the Independent Schools Register. Those academies which acquire academy status under the Academies Act 2010 are deemed to have met those requirements upon opening and, therefore, do not u\nndergo pre-registration inspections\n"
