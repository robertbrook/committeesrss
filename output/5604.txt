[[[Written evidence submitted by the End Violence Against Women Coalition]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]“We will work across the whole of government on preventative measures to stop violence from happening in the first place.” Home Secretary, Theresa May MP in Call to end violence against women and girls&#xa0;Almost one in three 16-18 year-old girls has experienced ‘groping’ or other unwanted sexual touching at school in the UK (YouGov poll for EVAW).&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary]]]Women and girls in the UK experience high levels of harassment and abuse in their homes, communities, schools and workplaces so the ongoing commitment by the Coalition Government in Westminster to a strategy on violence against women and girls (VAWG) is extremely welcome. The Government has pledged to work across government to prevent abuse from happening in the first place, however prevention remains the weakest part of the VAWG strategy.&#xa0;We believe that the Government should develop a Prevention Plan to set out action to change harmful attitudes and behaviours in order to save lives and reduce the emotional, physical and financial cost of violence in the long term, similar to action on road safety through the THINK! campaign.&#xa0;Questions for the Prime Minister:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]The Home Office-led cross-government strategy Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls, has prevention as one its key objectives. In addition, the UK has international obligations to prevent VAWG including under the new Istanbul Convention (Council of Europe) when it is ratified.&#xa0;We warmly welcome the ongoing commitment to the strategy by the Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Director of Public Prosecutions and other parts of government. However, despite excellent initiatives such as the ThisisABUSE teen abuse campaign, prevention remains the weakest part of the strategy. Violence against women and girls is one of the biggest human rights abuses globally and here in the UK, and yet there is no national programme of work to prevent it. Indeed, a recent expert assessment of the Government’s action to deliver on its own objective on prevention, Deeds or Words?, found that education policy in particular was undermining action in this area and the overall score was just 24/100.&#xa0;

[[[Girls]]] campaign calling for girls and young women’s safety to be a national priority was launched just as the Jimmy Savile revelations were breaking in 2012 and in the midst of ongoing cases of serious and large-scale child sexual exploitation across our towns and cities.  Over the last few years there have been a number of significant reports adding to our understanding of this problem: &#xa0;&#xa0;Violence against women and girls flourishes in a society where prejudicial attitudes towards women are deeply entrenched. The Crime Survey England and Wales shows that around one in twelve people thought that the victim is ‘completely’ or ‘mostly’ responsible for someone sexually assaulting or raping them when they were under the influence of drugs (8%), by someone they have been flirting heavily with beforehand (7%) or while drunk (6%).&#xa0;

[[[girls]]]The Home Office leads the VAWG strategy and holds regular Inter-Ministerial Group meetings and stakeholder meetings. This engagement is not only welcome, it is critical. A ten year study found that women’s rights organisations are the most important factor in combating violence against women globally. Unfortunately there are gaps in cross-government working on this agenda. It is critical that all key departments work together to prevent VAWG, including the Department for Education. &#xa0;Moreover, the Government will only be effective in delivering on prevention if it sets out a comprehensive plan to prevent VAWG. This would provide a step by step pathway to achieving the desired goal. Professor Carol Hagemann-White’s Model of Perpetration for the EU draws together available research to show clearly what factors contribute to VAWG perpetration and therefore what interventions are required to intervene in pathways to abuse. We have adapted this in our report A Different World is Possible and would suggest that this is the basis for developing a Prevention Plan.&#xa0;

[[[Education]]]As a universal service, schools and other educational environments are critical for helping young people to develop consensual and respectful attitudes and behaviours, and shaping a society where abuse is not condoned or tolerated. They are places where all children should feel safe, and where support is offered to young people experiencing or at risk of perpetrating abuse. Unfortunately, this is simply not the case at present and our expert report, Deeds or Words?, found that education policy is one of the weakest parts of the government’s commitment to preventing abuse. &#xa0;This has been confirmed by other independent reports. In 2013, Ofsted found that Personal Social Health and Economic (PSHE) education is not good enough in a significant proportion of schools and that this is leaving young people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. A joint Inspection report in 2013 found that teachers and other professionals all too often dismiss or minimise inappropriate sexual behaviour in boys, which then escalates to more serious sexual offending. &#xa0;Whilst there is overwhelming support from experts, parents, teachers, young people and the general public for schools to be required to teach Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) in order to tackle issues such as pornography and abuse, this remains outside the National Curriculum. The result is, according to a recent survey by the Sex Education Forum, that one in three young people are not taught about sexual consent. Research for the Office of the Children’s Commissioner found that young people’s understanding of sexual consent is deeply gendered in that young men are rewarded for having sex and women condemned for doing so. Importantly, younger people have narrow concepts of rape, seeing it as involving explicit force between strangers. The emphasis and responsibility remains on young women to give consent with little expectation that young men seek and get consent. SRE has a critical role in changing these attitudes. In the absence of consistent and well-taught SRE, children, and boys in particular, are learning about sex from increasingly violent and misogynistic pornography.&#xa0;School policies on Behaviour, Bullying, Child Protection and Safeguarding are extremely patchy and often inadequate in how they address VAWG according to local surveys we have carried out. For example, Bullying policies should make specific reference to sexual harassment and Child Protection policies should include specific reference to Female Genital Mutilation and sexual exploitation.

[[[&#xa0;]]]There needs to be ongoing training for teachers and other staff to identify the signs of all forms of violence against women and girls, including responding to disclosures and harmful behaviours, as well as delivering lessons on prevention.&#xa0;Critically, this issue needs to be a priority for the Department for Education. There is widespread bafflement and disappointment that the Department with key responsibility for children’s safety and welfare does not support the excellent ThisisABUSE teen abuse campaign developed by the Home Office. This widely praised campaign has recently been relaunched on MTV and targeted youth media using celebrities. However, it has not been disseminated by government to schools meaning that many may not be aware that young people will be seeking help or disclosing abuse after watching the ads. At best, this is an inefficient use of government resources. At worst, this is damaging to children’s welfare and safety.&#xa0;We believe that there should be a legal obligation on all schools to address all forms of VAWG in an age-appropriate way as a basic life skill.&#xa0;

[[[support]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[services]]]Women’s support services are crucial for supporting women and girls who experience sexual and other violence, particularly as most do not report to the police. They should be linked in to schools to be funded to deliver innovative prevention programmes and to support both survivors and perpetrators. We support the briefing provided by Imkaan, Women's Aid, Respect and Rape Crisis.&#xa0;

[[[Public]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[campaigns]]]There needs to be long term investment in public campaigns to change harmful attitudes and behaviours, similar to the investment in road safety campaigns. The Home Office’s teen rape campaign (http://thisisabuse.direct.gov.uk/) should be built upon and further campaigns developed targeting the adult population and tackling hidden issues such as child sexual abuse.&#xa0;

[[[media]]]There is growing evidence of the way that the media provides a conducive context for VAWG to flourish. By reinforcing the stereotype of women and girls as sexual objects and sexually available for men and boys and the stereotype of male sexual ‘need’ and ‘entitlement’, sexualisation creates a culture in which VAWG is justified. &#xa0;We therefore welcome work, supported by the Prime Minister, to tackle pornography and sexualisation. However, for this agenda to be effective it needs to be rooted in the principles of gender equality and linked more closely to the Home Office-led VAWG strategy.  At present, work to tackle sexualisation is inconsistent, for example it does not extend to the print media.&#xa0;Print mediaEVAW’s 2012 report, ‘Just the Women’, with Eaves, Equality Now and Object found endemic sexism in the British press including articles and images that condone, tolerate and normalise violence against women and girls. We believe this is a critical issue for the new press watchdog to address. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]PornographyThe Children’s Commissioner’s report on pornography recently found that there is a clear correlation between boys’ use of pornography and negative attitudes and behaviours towards women and girls and called for schools to be required to teach Relationships and Sex Education.&#xa0;Social media Recent cases of online abuse of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and female politicians including Stella Creasy MP and Claire Perry MP have highlighted the ways in which social media is used to abuse women and girls. EVAW’s recent report New Technology, Same Old Problems of a joint roundtable with The Guardian reviewed problems from threats and harassment targeted at individual women, the abuse and naming on Twitter of a rape victim following the conviction of footballer Ched Evans for rape through to non-consensual sharing of explicit images through ‘sexting’ or ‘revenge porn’.  We believe that this spells the need for schools to teach young people about consensual and respectful relationships, whether offline or online. &#xa0;Music videosWe support action to introduce age-ratings on hard copy music DVDs and believe the same principle applies online. Over 16,000 people have signed a change.org petition calling for age-ratings of music videos online and offline. http://www.change.org/rewindreframe
