[[[ ]]]  The Academy of Social Sciences welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into Government Horizon Scanning and wishes to highlight the importance of social sciences in horizon scanning activities.

[[[2]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[  ]]]The Academy commends the championing of horizon scanning by the Cabinet Secretary and supports the aspiration towards greater joining up of horizon scanning activities across government. The Day review observed that a senior champion was necessary in order for horizon scanning to be applied effectively and strategically across Departments.

[[[3]]]

[[[.]]]  The work strands identified for the 2013 Horizon Scanning Programme are all in areas addressed by research in social sciences:  emerging technologies; emerging economies; changing supply and demand of resources; changing social attitudes of young people; the future of demographic change in the UK.  All of these topics require an understanding of human behaviour and behaviour change in order to meet future challenges. 

[[[4]]]

[[[.]]]  Social scientists (including Academicians) are already involved in the horizon scanning activities of the Foresight programmes, working alongside natural scientists and other experts to bring evidence to policy making in key areas.  For example, the Foresight programme on Identities is likely to form a useful backdrop to the strand on changing social attitudes of young people, as it examined the changing nature of identity in the digital age, and in terms of social plurality with the attendant risks of extremism, amongst other relevant aspects.   In considering changing social attitudes of young people and the future of demographic change, issues around intergenerational resource distribution and wider social values are likely to emerge, and to benefit from insights from social science research.

[[[ ]]]The Cabinet Secretary is to be supported in horizon scanning work by the Cabinet Secretary Advisory Group (CSAG) which includes Departmental leads from across government, the Head of the Civil Service and the Government’s Chief Science Adviser.  As noted above, social scientists are embedded in many Foresight groups, and active in research areas of central relevance to the horizon scanning work strands.  This activity may be even more effective across government, were a social scientist with oversight across the Departmental and work strands relevant to horizon scanning, also at the table.

[[[.]]]

[[[  ]]]The Academy of Social Sciences and the Campaign for Social Sciences have advocated for some time for the reinstatement of the post of Government Chief Social Scientist to draw together social science evidence, research and best practice at the highest levels.  The championing of cross-government horizon scanning provides yet more impetus for the collation of social science research to meet strategic aims and indicates a demand for co-ordinated input of social research at the heart of Government.

[[[ ]]]The Academy of Social Sciences can draw upon a membership of more than 950 peer-elected Academicians and 46 Learned Societies in the social sciences in order to provide expertise to policymakers, professionals and the public.  We would be happy to contribute further to the Committee’s work on Government Horizon scanning and response to future risks and challenges.  October 2013&#xa0;
