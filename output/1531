[normal]Q1[bold] 
[normal]What types of CCS 
[normal]technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another?

[normal]Q2 [bold]What contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?
[normal]Q3[bold] 
[normal]Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?     
[normal]Q4[bold] 
[normal]What are the mai
[normal]n barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?
[normal]Q5[bold] Are there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6[bold] 
[normal]How have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have
[normal] they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts?
[normal]Q7 [bold]Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?
[normal]Q8[bold] 
[normal]Could the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?  
[normal]Q9 [bold]What are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation 
[normal]if CCS fails?
