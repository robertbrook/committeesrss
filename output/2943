[normal]* there should be two inspections of care homes per year;
[normal]* a focus on a few selected standards only is negligent;
[normal]* specialists with expertise in care homes should be recruited to inspect care homes;
[normal]* CQC appears to be taking steps to being a learning organisation, but they have a long way to go;
[normal]* CQC could reduce the burdens on care homes for older people by becoming a reliable and trusted organisation;
[normal]* CQC should carry out an evaluation of its priorities and inspection methodology;
[normal]* CQCs regulatory regime should be specifically tailored to meet the needs of each sector;
[normal]* the DH should improve its capability and expertise on the regulation of safety and quality; and
