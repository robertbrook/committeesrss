default* CQC does not have sufficient expertise in the care home sector;
default* CQC’s strategy should build in the capability to inspect care homes at least twice a year;
default* performance measures for care homes should focus on improvement in the health, safety and well-being of residents;
default* there should be two inspections of care homes per year;
default* a focus on a few selected standards only is negligent;
default* specialists with expertise in care homes should be recruited to inspect care homes;
default* CQC appears to be taking steps to being a learning organisation, but they have a long way to go;
default* CQC could reduce the burdens on care homes for older people by becoming a reliable and trusted organisation;
default* CQC should carry out an evaluation of its priorities and inspection methodology;
default* CQCs regulatory regime should be specifically tailored to meet the needs of each sector;
default* the DH should improve its capability and expertise on the regulation of safety and quality; and
default* the CQC website should not allow care homes to expunge their (often poor) records by changing the name under which the provider is registered.
