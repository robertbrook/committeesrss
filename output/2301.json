"EIS 24Written evidence submitted by Carbon Tracker Resilience to c\nlimate change risk is central to good corporate gove\nrnance of the extractive industries sector\nAbout Carbon TrackerCarbon Tracker is a non-profit organisation working to align the capital markets with the climate change policy agenda. We are applying our thinking on carbon budgets and stranded assets across geographies and asset classes to inform investor thinking and \nthe regulation of capital markets. We are funded by a number of US and UK charitable foundations. \nIntroductionCarbon Tracker welcomes the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills’ decision\n to open a discussion about current issues surrounding the \next\nractive industries sector\n. Broadly, we see the current \nexposure\n of extractives companies listed on the London Stock Exchange \n(LSE) \nto be undermining London’s position as a global financial centre of excellence. Furthermore, our research \nreveals a system\nic risk sitting on the world’s capital markets due to \nthe mismatch between climate change policy and the business models of these extractives companies. This could lead to significant value de\nstruction for investors if the \n‘carbon bubble’ \nwere to burst\n.\nWe\n see this period of reflection for the London Stock Exchange\n after a number of controversies\n to be an opportunity to marry improvements in both the corporate governance and awareness of climate change ri\nsk within \ninvestors in \nthe extractive\n industr\nies sect\nor\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?C\nompanies come to the LSE to benefit from the UK’s respected corporate governance regime. \nT\nhe combination of growth and good governance should, in theory, represent a compelling proposition for investors.\n However, t\nhe UK \nhas \nfailed to \nevolve its\n governance \nstandards \nto reflect this new type of risk – that the changing energy sector will see significant shifts in value.  Instead London has seen increasing exposure to companies\n in the extractives industry during the recent commodities boom. \n \nThese companies do\n not represent best practice in terms of corporate governance or addressing climate risk. Two very recent examples demonstrate this fact.\nThe\n \nEurasian Natural Resources Corporation (\nENRC\n)\n was one of several companies that the UK listings authority allowed \nto list on the LSE even though it\ns\n free float of shares was below the usual 25% threshold. \nThis decision \nhas \nsince \ncome into\n question amid \nallegations of corruption, bribery and a criminal investigation\n as its value plummeted from £13bn to £3bn resulting in huge shareholder loss\n– in essence, those behind the group failed to meet the standards of a public company.\nThe second reputational hit on the LSE involved Bumi PLC\n,\n described as ‘the biggest corpora\nte scandal to hit London for two decades’ by the Wall Street Journal.\n \nIt has been \nrevealed that Bumi was sitting on unaccounted payments of $201m – investors’ expectations about corporate governance at Bumi, assumed from being listed on the LSE, were not \nmet. Bumi\n’s shares \nhave\n fallen \nby a quarter in value.\nThese cases have dealt a huge blow to the reputation of London as a centre for excellence in business. However, in spite of these warning signs, London continues to encourage extractives companies to it\ns exchange. Glencore/X\ns\ntrata recently\n listed on the LSE and Sibanthracite have documented they will be listing here soon\n, with Mongolian coal companies set to follow\n. \nCorporate governance as a practice is designed to have the long-term security of a corpo\nration at its core. Therefore, misdemeanours in c\norporate governance often run through into the \nfundamental \nbusiness models of these companies, meaning \nLondon may not just be \nvulnerable to reputational hits\n, but investors’ value and market integrity could \nbe at risk also\n.\n \nF\nor example,\n Bumi’s business mode\nl \nrelies on exporting poor quality coal to China\n, but is that\n viable on an ongoing basis given \nrecent \nChinese announcements \non tackling\n air quality and carbon intensity? \nHas the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in the sector?London\n’s boom in listed extractive companies \ncould position\n it at a significant comp\netitive disadvantage in the\n future\n. \nCarb\non Tracker’s research \nreveals the potential for significant value-destruction of \nthe fossil fuel\n assets \non which the business models of the\n corporations rely\n \nat the hands of environmental regulation\n and market forces\n. The LSE is \nnot currently \nfactoring \nthis risk\n into its corporate governance requirements of listings regulations.\nOur analysis \ndemonstrates\n that there are more proven fossil fuel reserves listed on the world’s stock exchanges than can be burnt unmitigated if we \nare to stay\n below 2\n°\nC \nof global warming,\n \n(the objective agreed in the Cancun Accord)\n,\n. \nOur analysis has been confirmed \nby the International\n Energy Agency who calculated \nthat ‘without a significant deployment of CCS, more than two thirds of current proven fossil-fuel reserve\ns cannot be commercialised in a 2°C world before 2050’\n, (based on\n a 50% chance \nof limiting global warming to 2°C,). \nLord Stern described it as a ‘profound contradiction between climate change policy and the valuations of listed companies’.\n \nIn this conte\nxt, the risks of an over-relianc\ne on fossil fuels is apparent, yet \none fifth of the FTSE100 is mining and oil and gas firms, accounting for approximately 30% of the total market capitalisation. Carbon Tracker research found that the LSE has reserves listed\n on it equivalent to around 10 times the UK CO\n2\n budget between now and 2050 to keep within 2°C of global warming.\n Additionally, most of these reserves are located overseas exposing investors to decision-making and political processes around high carbon as\nsets in which they have no say. For example, a third of coal listed in London is located in Australia, a market \nwhich exports 90% of its coal, and \nwhere a number of factors are combining to raise costs and make their assets increasingly uncompetitive globa\nlly.\nLondon is also the primary listing for a number of oil and gas majors. These corporations are increasingly reliant on oil\n which is \nhard to get at because almost all the most easily extractable reserves have been exploited. Essentially this means they\n are producing less and less oil for \nevery dollar\n of shareholders’ funds invested\n.\n Alongside the corporate controversies which \ncome with\n the sector - BP’s oil spills \nat\n Macondo and Shell’s costly and contested drilling in the Arctic, for example – the LSE\n is housing companies exposing investors to an increasing level of risk that only provides returns at a high oil price. \nIn this context, the LSE’s encouragement and \nincentivisation to attract more extractives companies further inflates the carbon bubble a\nnd the potential downfall if it bursts.\n Companies are not currently required to provide analysis of sensitivity of their business to low demand, low price scenarios, which would see a number of companies with impaired assets\n that were no longer economic.\nWould increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?We feel increased regulation and requirements of \ncompanies \ncoming to London \nto raise capital \nis necessary to re-establish the UK and London as a reputable global financial centre. \nOur research reveals climate change is a ri\nsk to a corporation’s \nprosperity\n, yet there are no requirements from the UK listin\ngs authority or the LSE to disclose or even consider climate change in its business strategy. \nFor example, in Glencore’s 1,637-page prospectus for its initial public offering to list on the LSE, just a single paragraph noted climate risk – ‘regulation of g\nreenhouse gas emissions could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for Glencore’s products’.\n This \nboilerplate statement gives investors no idea of how significant company management consider the risk to be.\nMarkets need not be \nresistant \nto ch\nange\n;\n in fact their success relies on moving\n with the times and respond\ning\n to new risks, like climate change. Mining companies coming to the AIM market, a sub-market of the LSE, are encouraged to seek a Competent Persons report to verify the existence of \nf\nossil fuel \nreserves. This needs to be extended to consider \nthe impacts of \nclimate risk \nfor reserves levels and \nbusiness models as increasing emissions constraints come in and scaled up to the full LSE. UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, supports being a f\nirst-mover by stating recently that ‘London can teach other centres how it [corpor\nate governance] should be done’, but needs to reflect this in actions.\nLondon has historically set the standards for other markets to follow, which has given it a competitiv\ne advantage due to the extra reputational benefits of listing in London. Unless London maintains this position, it will find itself having to compete more with other exchanges that have not built up the same historic reputation.\nWhat is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?The LSE’s recent action to join the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) takes important steps to \nenhancing the exchange by \nencouraging the disclosure\n of revenues from coal, oil and gas development.\n \nThis reflects the requirements of the US Dodd Frank Act and EU Accountability requirements. It is also fitting, given the UK’s lead in establishing the EITI.\n \nHowever revenue transparency only occupies a small part of what is required. \nThe UK should take a\n similar leadership position on requiring climate risk disclosure, specifically with regards to the CO\n2\n potential of their fossil fuel reserves. This information would allow investors to track exposure to high-carbon assets themselves, and observe if this \nwas increasing or decreasing over time. \nOur research reveals the extent to which the LSE is exposed to over-valued and potentially worthless fossil fuel assets. Regula\ntion and listings rules \nneed to\n \nbe aligned with this threat\n \nto\n maintain the UK’s position\n as a global standard-setter\n.\n \nThe UK has le\nd with the Climate Change Act and setting carbon budgets; this needs to be transferred across to its oversight of London as a major global financial centre.\n \nWithout having market wide information on the exposure \nto this issue it will not be possible for \nregulators or investors to understand the level of exposure in London. At present there is a risk that investors who track the market seeking diversification are in fact ending up with a concentration in fossil fue\nl based businesses.\nWhat is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them? The landscape for the extractives industries going forward sees them having to adapt\n to a low-carbon energy future or be comprehensively uncompetitive as their market shrinks. This transition may take time but the signals are apparent\n. Analysts at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Citi see the first step is for coal to \nbe a poor investment\n,\n primarily due to environmental regulations, China peaking its demand and market forces favouring cheaper gas.\nUnlike countries like Norway, the UK does not have vast sovereign wealth funds to finance sustainable energy infrastructure for future generatio\nns. Ins\ntead it will be the UK’s financial mark\nets that will need to adapt – enhanced regulation and requirements can guide this transition\n. For the UK to remain competitive going forward is needs to be getting \nahead in the growth industries of a low carbon\n future. Otherwise this opportunity will be capitalised on elsewhere. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7b8716a6-0ef7-11e3-ae66-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2dFyOymGZ\n \nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324880504578296122247181726.html\n \n \nhttp://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_16/application/pdf/cop16_l\nca.pdf\n  \n \nhttp://www.carbontracker.org/linkfileshare/Unburnable-Carbon-Full-rev2.pdf\n \nhttp\n://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/publications/weo-2012/\n \nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/52f2709c-20f0-11e1-8a43-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2NsqYpw7h\n \nwww.carbontracker.org/london\n \n \nhttp://www.carbontracker.org/australia\n \n \nhttp://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21582522-day-huge-integrated-international-oil-company-drawing\n \n \nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/629f9a52-2283-11e2-b606-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2AodKf6eB\n \n \nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ec3eec8-ead6-11e2-9fcc-00144feabdc0.html\n \n"
