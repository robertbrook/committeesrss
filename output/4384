[normal]Introduction
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into the Future of the BBC. We note that the Committee has outlined a number of 
[normal]areas it wishes to examine. These terms of reference are necessarily wide-ranging in scope given the contex
[normal]t of Charter Review by
[normal] 2016. 
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many of these areas are not for Ofcom to address. However, given the Committee’s focus on governance and regulation of 
[normal]the BBC beyond 2016, 
[normal]this memorandum is intended
[normal] to provide the Committee with a high level 
[normal]over
[normal]view of Ofcom’s
[normal] broadcasting 
[normal]duties
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] the role for Ofcom and the BBC Trust in relation to the BBC
[normal]. 
[normal]

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom’s role regarding the BBC
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The governance and re
[normal]gulation of the BBC
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] the
[normal] roles for Ofcom and the BBC Trust 
[normal]within this, 
[normal]are set by Parliame
[normal]nt in the Communications Act
[normal] and
[normal] in the
[normal] BBC Charter and the BBC Agreement. C
[normal]hanges 
[normal]to governance and the regulatory framework are in the first instance a matter 
[normal]for the Secretary of State
[normal], and 
[normal]for
[normal] Parliament
[normal] to approve. 
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In those areas where Ofcom and the BBC Trust have co-jurisdiction, the two bodies have a good working relationship. 
[normal] 
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The following table sets out at a high level the different functions and 
[normal]responsibilities of the BBC Trust and Ofcom in e
[normal]ach of 
[normal]the areas discussed in Section 3
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Role of the BBC TRUST[bold]Role of OFCOM[bold]Programme and output quotas[bold]Original television production quotas[bold]Responsible for BBC compliance.  Must agree quota levels with

[normal] public purposes.
[normal]Assesses the overall delivery of the public service broadcasting purposes and characteristics by the public service broadcasters taken as a whole, including the BBC.[bold]Duties regarding the quality of content[bold]Duty to ensure high-quality BBC
[normal] content.  Service reviews assess the extent to which each BBC service is delivering high-quality content.
[normal]Responsible for maintaining and strengthening public service broadcasting by the public service broadcasters taken as a whole, including the BBC.[bold]Li[bold]censing[bold]Oversight of BBC television, radio and online services[bold]Issues service licenc

[normal]Issues [bold]broadcast licences for the BBC’s commercial television services (including joint ventures). Does not licence the BBC public services.[bold]Compliance with the obligations in these licences is a legal requirement.[bold]Editorial Guidelines[bold]The 
[normal]BBC Trust approves Edi
[normal]torial Guidelines against which the BBC must operate and the Trust judges performance against them.  BBC Editorial Guidelines provide ways in which BBC should meet Ofcom codes.  Also, they explain to producers how they should conduct themselves in creating
[normal] content for programmes.  Guidelines include so
[normal]me things which are forbidden. The 
[normal]BBC Trust has sole responsibility for impartiality and accuracy in BBC programmes
[normal] on the BBC’s public services
[normal].
[normal]Ofcom sets the Broadcasting Code for the whole industry.[bold] [bold]These rules apply to the BBC’s public services, except for matters of impartiality and accuracy.  These rules apply in full to the BBC’s Commercial Services. [bold]The Ofcom rules on commercial communications in radio programming and commercial references in te[bold]levision programming also do not apply to the BBC’s UK public services except in the case of rules reflecting European and UK law on product placement in television programmes (which is prohibited on the BBC’s UK public services).[bold]Programme complaints[bold]BBC
[normal] Trust can sanction (but not fine): can ask for on-air apology and for disciplinary proceedings against 
[normal]staff member if felt necessary.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom’s
[normal] 
[normal]broadcasting duties
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the Communications Act 2003 , Ofcom
[normal]’s
[normal] principal dut
[normal]ies are
[normal]: 
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]to further the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters; and
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]to further the interests of consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate by promotin
[normal]g competition.
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In carrying out its functions, Ofcom is required to secure, in relation to broadcasting, the following: 
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the availability throughout the UK of a wide range of high-quality television and radio services which (taken as a whole) are both of a 
[normal]high quality and calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the maintenance of a sufficient plurality of providers of different television and radio services;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the application of standards that provide adequate protection to members of the public from offensive and harmful material; 
[normal]and
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the application of standards that provide adequate protection to members of the public and all other persons from both unfair tr
[normal]eatment and unwarranted infringements of privacy
[normal].
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]We also have a duty to ensure 
[normal]the optimal use for wireless telegraphy of the electro-magnetic spectrum.
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, Ofcom is the competition authority for the broadcasting sector and also has further secto
[normal]r regulatory duties with respect to competition including:
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]nvestigating alleged anti-competitive conduct or agreements under competition law;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]imposing and enforcing conditions in Broadcasting 
[normal]Act licences to ensure fair and 
[normal]effective competition in the pr
[normal]ovision of broadcast services; and
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]acting in an advisory role to the BBC Trust to assist with Public Value Tests by conducting market impact assessments and providing input to the BBC Trust on determining whether changes to BBC public services are signific
[normal]ant. 
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]We set out below how we fulfil our
[normal] duties in each of these areas. 
[normal]Positive content regulation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]As set out above, Ofcom has duties to ensure:
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]Ofcom fulfils these duties primarily 
[normal]through a system of programme and output quotas, broad oversight of the public service broadcasting system and more specific oversight via 
[normal]the 
[normal]licensing
[normal] regime
[normal].
[normal]Programme and output quotas
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]TV broadcasters must comply with a range of programme and output quotas that set minimum levels of types of programmes that they must show. These obligations originate in the Communications Act 2003 
[normal]and/
[normal]or in European legislation, and Ofcom has a duty to m
[normal]onitor and enforce compliance with these quotas.
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The level of regulatory intervention that Ofcom is required to apply depends on the category of broadcaster – public service broadcasters operate under much tighter regulations than multichannel operators – 
[normal]therefore some quotas apply across the board while othe
[normal]rs are specific to the p
[normal]ublic service broadcasters. The latter are set out in more detail below.
[normal]3.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All television services that Ofcom regulates must be provided under a licence issued by Ofcom.  Under se
[normal]ction the Broadcasting Act 1990 it is an offence for any person to provide any “relevant regulated television service” without a licence.
[normal]3.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In terms of licensing and regulation, Ofcom has a direct relationship with
[normal] 
[normal]the Channel 3 licensees (including ITV, STV
[normal] and UTV)
[normal], Channel 4
[normal], S4C
[normal] and Channel 5, whose licences carry specific quota compliance obligations
[normal]. Ofcom does not licence the BBC as the BBC is established by Royal 
[normal]Charter and the BBC Agreement. 
[normal]The BBC is jointly regulated by the BBC Trust and Ofcom. T
[normal]he BBC’s Charter and Agreement and the Communications Act make express provision for Ofcom to regulate the content of BBC television and radio services 
[normal]in certain areas and also gives 
[normal]Ofcom the power to fine the BBC in relation to those areas. Services pro
[normal]vided 
[normal]commercially 
[normal]by BBC
[normal] Worldwide – as opposed to the BBC public service
[normal] – are licensed by Ofcom and are subject to the full range of standards set out in Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code
[normal].
[normal]Oversight of public service broadcasting
[normal]3.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A range of broadcasters current
[normal]ly provide public service programming. Each year, the 
[normal]p
[normal]ublic service broadcasters are required to submit Statements of Programme Policy
[normal] to Ofcom which explain how they have delivered their public service broadcasting remit in the previous year and how the
[normal]y intend to deliver it in the coming year.
[normal]3.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to the industry-wide quota system set out above, the Act also sets out a range of obligations applying only to public service channels. When setting these quotas, Ofcom takes into account the individu
[normal]al remit of each channel and other relevant criteria. These are reviewed as necessary, and the levels may be revised up or down to allow for changes in circumstances and the broadcasting environment. 
[normal]3.14
[normal]              
[normal]A summary of the quotas applying to public service
[normal] broadcasting channels is given below. These are applicable to the BBC channels, 
[normal]STV, UTV, 
[normal]ITV, ITV Breakfast, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C in Wales. They do not apply to the commercial 
[normal]broadcasters’ digital services (such as ITV2, CITV, E4, More 4, 5*, 5U
[normal]SA) or to other 
[normal]channels
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.15
[normal]              
[normal]O
[normal]fcom is also required to periodically review the extent to which the public service broadcasting system, taken as 
[normal]a whole, has delivered the purposes and objectives of public service broadcasting
[normal]. 
[normal]Ofcom is required to carry out these reviews with a view to maintaining and strengthening public service broadcasting. 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]Communications Act sets the purposes of public service broadcasting:
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the provision of relevant television services which secure that 
[normal]programmes dealing with a wide range of subject-matters are made available for viewing;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the provision of relevant television services in a manner which (having regard to the days on which they are shown and the times of day at which they are shown) is 
[normal]likely to meet the needs and satisfy the interests of as many different audiences as practicable;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the provision of relevant television services which (taken together and having regard to the same matters) are properly balanced, so far as their nature and s
[normal]ubject-matters are concerned, for meeting the needs and satisfying the interests of the available audiences; and
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the provision of relevant television services which (taken together) maintain high general standards with respect to the programmes included in
[normal] them, and
[normal], in particular with respect to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.16
[normal]              
[normal]The public service broadcasting objectives are
[normal] intended to ensure that programming is provided that, among other things: disseminates information; is educational and entertaining; reflects cultural diversity; covers news and current affairs; provides coverage of sporting events; includes topics such a
[normal]s science and religion; and includes high quality and original programmes for children and young people.
[normal]3.17
[normal]              
[normal]Ofco
[normal]m’s Public Service Broadcasting
[normal] Annual Report provides an evidence base for this assessment of the delivery of the public service broadcasting
[normal] purposes and 
[normal]objectives.
[normal] Among other things, our annual report assesses whether the public service broadcasters have met their annual pro
[normal]duction and programming quotas.
[normal]Licensing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.18
[normal]              
[normal]Ofcom regulates Channel 3, Channel 4 and Channel 5 through licence con
[normal]ditions intended to promote the fulfilment of the purposes of public service television. Licence commitments are currently focused on meeting public service purposes in a small number of core programming genres regarded by audiences as the most important (
[normal]in particular news and current affairs). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.19
[normal]              
[normal]In return, all of the public service broadcasters, including the BBC, receive benefits. These include the right to appropriate prominence on electronic programme guides, as well as access to spectrum that 
[normal]enables them to make their services available to 98.5% of the UK population on the digital terrestrial platform.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Standards regulation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]20
[normal]              
[normal]Ofcom has a duty to set standards for the content of programmes on television and on radio in order to secure the 
[normal]following standar
[normal]ds objectives set by Parliament. These apply to the BBC
[normal] and are enforced by Ofcom
[normal] unless otherwise stated:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These standards have to be published in a code, and in setting or revising these standards, Ofcom must take into account considerations such as the degree of harm or offence likely to be caused, the likely size and composition of the potential audience, th
[normal]e likely expectation of the audience and the likelihood of persons who were unaware of the nature of the programmes content being unintentionally exposed to that content. 
[normal]3.22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We publish these standards in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code
[normal], which sets out the
[normal] rules 
[normal]by which broadcasters must abide
[normal]. Ofcom
[normal] also
[normal] has a specific duty under section 107 of the 1996 Act to draw up a fairness code, which gives guidance to broadcasters on the principles and practices to be followed to prevent unjust or unfair treatment in pro
[normal]grammes and unwarranted infringement of privacy in programmes (or in connection with the obtaining of material included in them). We apply these provisions in Sections 7 (Fairness) and 8 (Privacy) of the Broadcasti
[normal]ng Code.
[normal]3.23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All 
[normal]UK licensed broadcasters
[normal] are 
[normal]required by the terms of their licences to comply with the Broadcasting Code
[normal] rules
[normal]. Breach of the Broadcasting Code is
[normal] a
[normal] breach of a licence condition and we may take enforceme
[normal]nt action against the licensee.
[normal]3.24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As noted above, t
[normal]here are some exceptions to the
[normal]se rules for the BBC. Although it does not hold a licence, the BBC is required by the terms of the BBC Agreement to comply with the provi
[normal]sions of the Broadcasting Code, 
[normal]except
[normal] on matters
[normal] in relation to
[normal] 
[normal]due impartiality and due accurac
[normal]y
[normal] and elections and re
[normal]ferendums which
[normal] are governed by the BBC Trust.
[normal] 
[normal]3.25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the event of a breach of 
[normal]these rules
[normal], Ofcom has the power to impose statutor
[normal]y sanctions on the broadcaster
[normal]. Ofcom also has the power to 
[normal]impose 
[normal]statutory sanctions on the BBC
[normal] 
[normal](again, under the terms of the 
[normal]BBC Agreement)
[normal].
[normal]3.26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The imposition of a sanction against a broadcaster is a serious matter. Ofcom
[normal] 
[normal]may, following due process, impose a sanction if we cons
[normal]ider that a broadcaster has seri
[normal]ously, deliberately, repeatedly, or recklessly breached a licence conditio
[normal]n.
[normal]3.27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In most cases, the maximum fine for commercial television or radio licensees is £250,000 or 5% of the broadcaster’s "Qualifying Revenue", whichever is the greater. For licensed public service broadcasters, the maximum financial penalty payable is 5% of 
[normal]"Qualifying Revenue". For the BBC or S4C, the maximum financial penalty is £250,000.
[normal]3.28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The sanctions available to Ofcom against
[normal] the BBC include a decision to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our procedures for how we handle complaints are published publicly
[normal] and set out how we will assess complaints and the timescales in which we will do so.
[normal]3.30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During the last financial year 
[normal], we assessed a total of 16,151
[normal] broadcasting complaints, 
[normal]of 
[normal]which
[normal] 2,832 (17.5%) referred to the BBC. The
[normal]se
[normal] resulted in
[normal] 266 investigations
[normal], of which 12 (4.5%) were about content broadcast on BBC television and radio services.
[normal] In total, we found 275 breaches of our rules and imposed fines totalling £129,000 for broadcasting complaints and £160,000 worth of fines for video-on-demand services. 
[normal]Of the investigations about the BBC’s services, 
[normal]Ofcom found 
[normal]3 
[normal]cases resulted in 
[normal]a 
[normal]breach of the Broadcasting Code.
[normal] We also assessed 183 complaints about fairness and privacy, of which 46 (25.1%) referred to the BBC. None of the fairness and privacy complai
[normal]nts in relation to the BBC were upheld
[normal].
[normal]Spectrum
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.31
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom’s statutory duties include securing the optimal use of the radio spectrum. In practice Ofcom manages and 
[normal]authorises use of
[normal] almost all of the civil radio spectrum (i.e. not those 
[normal]frequencies
[normal] used by t
[normal]he military or Crown). 
[normal]3.32
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC Agreement also places a duty on the BBC Trust to secure the efficient use of the spectrum available to the BBC. All BBC TV and radio services using spectrum in bands 
[normal]managed
[normal] by Ofcom must hold Wireless Telegraphy Act lic
[normal]ence
[normal]s that are issued by Ofcom.
[normal]3.33
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In digital terrestrial TV (DTT) broadcasting, Ofcom works closely with the BBC, the commercial broadcasters and transmission providers to develop detailed TV frequency plans with the aim of securing specific public policy object
[normal]ives such as delivering near-universal coverage of public service broadcasting via DTT, as well as providing appropriate spectrum resources for non-public service broadcasting services. DTT frequency planning work is carried out collaboratively by a group 
[normal]comprising all DTT multiplex operators including the BBC. The group is chaired by Ofcom which also retains ultimate responsibility for
[normal] how the spectrum is allocated.
[normal]3.34
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In radio broadcasting, the more diverse range of broadcasters and transmission operators m
[normal]eans that the BBC generally develops and manages the allocation of its services within agreed sub-bands or frequency blocks (though in some limited cases commercial and community services make use of frequencies within BBC sub-bands and vice versa), while 
[normal]Ofcom develops and manages frequency plans for commercial radio broadcasting services. Ofcom does however retain overall responsibility for managing and licensing the use of all of the spectrum used for radio services, 
[normal]including that used by the BBC.
[normal]3.35
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom
[normal]’s spectrum responsibilities also include securing international frequency co-ordination for terrestrial TV and radio services. International co-ordination rights
[normal] and obligations
[normal], which 
[normal]cover
[normal] the overall spectrum available for the BBC’s services, influence
[normal] the availability and number of terrestrial broadcasting services in the UK. 
[normal]3.36
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In contrast to the commercial broadcasters, the BBC’s services are not 
[normal]separately 
[normal]licensed by Ofcom under the Broadcasting Acts (though there are some limited exceptions to this). Broadcasting Act licences are of fixed duration, with statutory criteria setting out the circumstances under which the licences may be renewed. The Broadcasti
[normal]ng Act licences issued by Ofcom to the commercial public service broadcasters, multiplex operators and radio services also require adherence 
[normal]to certain technical standards.
[normal]3.37
[normal]              
[normal]While Ofcom has overall responsibility for resolving interference issues betwe
[normal]en different wireless services, the BBC has a specific responsibility for investigating suspected cases of interference to domestic TV and radio reception. If the BBC determines that a case of reported interference is being caused by a source such as an un
[normal]authorised radio signal, they may refer the case to Ofcom for further investigation.
[normal]Competition
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.38
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom has a number of roles and duties relating to competition, which broadly 
[normal]consist of 
[normal]enfo
[normal]rcement of competition law,
[normal] sector regulatory duties concerning Broadcasting Act licences
[normal], and
[normal] specific duties in relation to advising the BBC Trust.
[normal]Competition Law
[normal]3.39
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom undertakes competition law investigations 
[normal]in the communications sector 
[normal]under two parallel provisions, the Compe
[normal]tition Act 1998, and the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which concerns 
[normal]issues affecting 
[normal]trade between EU member states. Both provisions describe two broadly similar forms of behaviour that can be subject to investigation under com
[normal]petition law.
[normal]3.40
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The first form of behaviour (prohibited under Chapter I of the Competition Act and Article 101 of the TFEU) is when parties enter into anti-competitive agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition. One example of such behaviour wo
[normal]uld be the operation of a cartel. 
[normal]3.41
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The second form of behaviour (prohibited under Chapter II of the Competition Act and Article 102 of the TFEU) is conduct that amounts to an abuse of a dominant position. Having a dominant position is not against the law i
[normal]n itself, and it is only when this dominant position is abused that we would find a party in breach of 
[normal]competition law. Examples of an abuse of a dominant position include, but are not limited to, excessive pricing, price discrimination, refusal to supply,
[normal] predatory pricing and margin squeeze. 
[normal]3.42
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC is subject to both forms of prohibition under competition law.
[normal]3.43
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom also has the power to make market investigation references under the Enterprise Act 2002. Ofcom exercises all these powers concurrently wit
[normal]h the Office of Fair Trading (soon to
[normal] 
[normal]be the Competition and Markets Authority). 
[normal]Information on Ofcom’s approach to competition law inve
[normal]stigations can be found in our enforcement g
[normal]uidelines
[normal].
[normal]Broadcasting Act licences
[normal]3.44
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many broadcast services require licenc
[normal]es from Ofcom under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996. Under the Communications Act, Ofcom has powers to impose conditions in those licences to: 
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ensure fair and effective competition in the provision of broadcast services; and
[normal];
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ensure compliance with a 
[normal]Code for practices to be followed in the provision of electronic programme guides. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.45
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We may also open an investigation into whether or not the relevant licence condition has been breached. Before 
[normal]exercising powers under 
[normal]licence condition
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in relation to a 
[normal]competition issue
[normal] we consider whether it would be more appropriate to proceed under the Competition Act.
[normal]3.46
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These provisions are relevant to the BBC given Broadcasting Act licences held by companies which are either wholly-owned (e.g. BBC Free-to-view Ltd, th
[normal]e licensee for DTT multiplex PSB3) or partially-owned (e.g. Freesat, licensed as a
[normal]n
[normal] EPG provider) by the BBC.
[normal]Advice to the BBC Trust
[normal]3.47
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BBC Royal Charter and Agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 2007, provided for the establishment of a new Pub
[normal]lic Value Test regime. The Public Value Test must be applied before a decision can be taken to make any significant change to the BBC’s UK public services, which can include the introduction of a new service or the discontinuation of an existing one. 
[normal]3.48
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Unde
[normal]r the new regime, the decision on whether to authorise such a change will be made by the BBC Trust (the Trust), following the application of a Public Value Test. In reaching a decision on a Public Value Test, the Trust must take into account the findings o
[normal]f two separate reviews: 
[normal]3.49
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, the Trust must undertake assessments of certain of the BBC Executive’s proposals in order to determine when the Public Value Test must be 
[normal]applied. The Trust will normally conduct these significance tests on proposals formally submitted by the BBC Executive, but it may also decide at its discretion to apply a significance test to any proposed BBC activity whether formally submitted by the BBC
[normal] Executive or not. Ofcom will provide its view on the potential impact on others to inform the Trust’s decision in respect of its significance tests. In doing so, Ofcom will act as an independent body, and will have regard to its statutory duties. Advice r
[normal]eceived from Ofcom as to the potential impact on others of the BBC’s proposals will be taken into account by the Trust as part of its overall test for significance, and will be published. However, the final decision on whether a proposal is significant res
[normal]ts only with the BBC Trust.
[normal]Plurality
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.50
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As set out above, 
[normal]we are
[normal] required to carry out our functions so as to secure 
[normal]the maintenance of a sufficient plurality of providers of different television and radio services
[normal]. We fulfil this generally through the exe
[normal]rcise of our broadcasting functions but also have 
[normal]some 
[normal]specific powers that are relevant.
[normal]Merger control
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.51
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Secretary of State has powers to intervene in certain mergers in the public interest. One such ground is “the need, in relation to every different
[normal] audience in the United Kingdom
[normal], for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience”. The definition of “media enterprise” excludes the BBC but may include a BBC company.
[normal]3.52
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If the Secretary of State 
[normal]intervenes in this way, Ofcom must report on whether it is or may be the case that the merger may be expected to operate against the public interest”. The Secretary of State decides whether or not to refer the merger to the Competition Commission (soon, th
[normal]e C
[normal]ompetition and 
[normal]M
[normal]arkets 
[normal]A
[normal]uthority
[normal]) for further review on these grounds.
[normal]Cross-m
[normal]edia ownership rules
[normal]3.53
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rules relating to cross-media ownership may also be relevant to plurality. In particular, the “20/20” rule prevents a 
[normal]newspaper group with more than 20% 
[normal]of national newspaper share from holding a Channel 3 licence or a stake in a Channel 3 licensee that is greater than 20%
[normal]. Such a person is also prevented from being the “appointed news provider” to a Channel 3 licensee. These rules are enforced by Ofcom in
[normal] effect through the broadcast licensing regime.

[normal]The Communications Act requires public service broadcasters to have in place Codes of Practice for commissioning from inde
[normal]pendent producers which have been approved by Ofcom. Ofcom is required to issue guidance to assist public service broadcasters in drawing up their codes.
[normal]Appointments and remuneration
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.56
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom is responsible for appointing the Chair and non-Executive Board m
[normal]embers of Channel 4. 
[normal]Ofcom
[normal] does not play a role 
[normal]in appointments at 
[normal]ITV or Channel 5, which are commercial organisations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Nor does Ofcom have any role in the appointments at the BBC Executive or the BBC Trust
[normal].
[normal]Equal opportunities
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.57
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ofcom has a duty to requir
[normal]e all broadcasters (except the smallest) to make arrangements to promote equality of opportunity in relation to employment and training.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For Channel 4, this duty is wider. Channel 4 Corporation must submit a Statement of Media Content Policy, which covers the delivery of its remit across all of its television and other media services.
[normal] The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has annou
[normal]nced its intention to remove this duty.
[normal] Ofcom is required under the Communications Act to assess delivery of PSB by carrying out a review every five years. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has announced its intention to amend this duty so that a review would only be conducted at the 
[normal]discretion of the Secretary of State and has put draft legislation to make this amendment before Parliament.
