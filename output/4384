defaultOfcom welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into the Future of the BBC. We note that the Committee has outlined a number of 
defaultareas it wishes to examine. These terms of reference are necessarily wide-ranging in scope given the contex
defaultt of Charter Review by

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany of these areas are not for Ofcom to address. However, given the Committee’s focus on governance and regulation of 
defaultthe BBC beyond 2016, 
defaultthis memorandum is intended
default to provide the Committee with a high level 
defaultover

default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the Communications Act 2003 , Ofcom

defaultto further the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters; and
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultto further the interests of consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate by promotin
defaultg competition.
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn carrying out its functions, Ofcom is required to secure, in relation to broadcasting, the following: 
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe availability throughout the UK of a wide range of high-quality television and radio services which (taken as a whole) are both of a 
defaulthigh quality and calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe maintenance of a sufficient plurality of providers of different television and radio services;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe application of standards that provide adequate protection to members of the public from offensive and harmful material; 
defaultand
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe application of standards that provide adequate protection to members of the public and all other persons from both unfair tr
defaulteatment and unwarranted infringements of privacy
default.
default3.3
default              
defaultWe also have a duty to ensure 
defaultthe optimal use for wireless telegraphy of the electro-magnetic spectrum.
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, Ofcom is the competition authority for the broadcasting sector and also has further secto
defaultr regulatory duties with respect to competition including:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultnvestigating alleged anti-competitive conduct or agreements under competition law;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultimposing and enforcing conditions in Broadcasting

defaultovision of broadcast services; and
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultacting in an advisory role to the BBC Trust to assist with Public Value Tests by conducting market impact assessments and providing input to the BBC Trust on determining whether changes to BBC public services are signific
defaultant. 
default3.5
default              
defaultWe set out below how we fulfil our
default duties in each of these areas. 
defaultPositive content regulation
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultAs set out above, Ofcom has duties to ensure:
default3.7
default              
defaultOfcom fulfils these duties primarily 
defaultthrough a system of programme and output quotas, broad oversight of the public service broadcasting system and more specific oversight via 
defaultthe 
defaultlicensing
default regime
default.
defaultProgramme and output quotas
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTV broadcasters must comply with a range of programme and output quotas that set minimum levels of types of programmes that they must show. These obligations originate in the Communications Act 2003 
defaultand/
defaultor in European legislation, and Ofcom has a duty to m
defaultonitor and enforce compliance with these quotas.
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe level of regulatory intervention that Ofcom is required to apply depends on the category of broadcaster – public service broadcasters operate under much tighter regulations than multichannel operators – 
defaulttherefore some quotas apply across the board while othe
defaultrs are specific to the p
defaultublic service broadcasters. The latter are set out in more detail below.
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll television services that Ofcom regulates must be provided under a licence issued by Ofcom.  Under se
defaultction the Broadcasting Act 1990 it is an offence for any person to provide any “relevant regulated television service” without a licence.
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of licensing and regulation, Ofcom has a direct relationship with
default 
defaultthe Channel 3 licensees (including ITV, STV
default and UTV)
default, Channel 4
default, S4C
default and Channel 5, whose licences carry specific quota compliance obligations
default. Ofcom does not licence the BBC as the BBC is established by Royal 
defaultCharter and the BBC Agreement. 
defaultThe BBC is jointly regulated by the BBC Trust and Ofcom. T
defaulthe BBC’s Charter and Agreement and the Communications Act make express provision for Ofcom to regulate the content of BBC television and radio services 
defaultin certain areas and also gives 
defaultOfcom the power to fine the BBC in relation to those areas. Services pro
defaultvided 
defaultcommercially 
defaultby BBC
default Worldwide – as opposed to the BBC public service
default – are licensed by Ofcom and are subject to the full range of standards set out in Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code
default.
defaultOversight of public service broadcasting
default3.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA range of broadcasters current
defaultly provide public service programming. Each year, the 
defaultp
defaultublic service broadcasters are required to submit Statements of Programme Policy
default to Ofcom which explain how they have delivered their public service broadcasting remit in the previous year and how the
defaulty intend to deliver it in the coming year.
default3.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to the industry-wide quota system set out above, the Act also sets out a range of obligations applying only to public service channels. When setting these quotas, Ofcom takes into account the individu
defaultal remit of each channel and other relevant criteria. These are reviewed as necessary, and the levels may be revised up or down to allow for changes in circumstances and the broadcasting environment. 
default3.14
default              
defaultA summary of the quotas applying to public service
default broadcasting channels is given below. These are applicable to the BBC channels, 
defaultSTV, UTV, 
defaultITV, ITV Breakfast, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C in Wales. They do not apply to the commercial 
defaultbroadcasters’ digital services (such as ITV2, CITV, E4, More 4, 5*, 5U
defaultSA) or to other 
defaultchannels
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default              
defaultO
defaultfcom is also required to periodically review the extent to which the public service broadcasting system, taken as 
defaulta whole, has delivered the purposes and objectives of public service broadcasting
default. 
defaultOfcom is required to carry out these reviews with a view to maintaining and strengthening public service broadcasting. 
defaultThe
default 
defaultCommunications Act sets the purposes of public service broadcasting:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe provision of relevant television services which secure that 
defaultprogrammes dealing with a wide range of subject-matters are made available for viewing;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe provision of relevant television services in a manner which (having regard to the days on which they are shown and the times of day at which they are shown) is 
defaultlikely to meet the needs and satisfy the interests of as many different audiences as practicable;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe provision of relevant television services which (taken together and having regard to the same matters) are properly balanced, so far as their nature and s
defaultubject-matters are concerned, for meeting the needs and satisfying the interests of the available audiences; and
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe provision of relevant television services which (taken together) maintain high general standards with respect to the programmes included in
default them, and
default, in particular with respect to:
default&#xa0;
default3.16
default              
defaultThe public service broadcasting objectives are
default intended to ensure that programming is provided that, among other things: disseminates information; is educational and entertaining; reflects cultural diversity; covers news and current affairs; provides coverage of sporting events; includes topics such a
defaults science and religion; and includes high quality and original programmes for children and young people.
default3.17
default              
defaultOfco
defaultm’s Public Service Broadcasting
default Annual Report provides an evidence base for this assessment of the delivery of the public service broadcasting
default purposes and 
defaultobjectives.
default Among other things, our annual report assesses whether the public service broadcasters have met their annual pro
defaultduction and programming quotas.
defaultLicensing
default&#xa0;
default3.18
default              
defaultOfcom regulates Channel 3, Channel 4 and Channel 5 through licence con
defaultditions intended to promote the fulfilment of the purposes of public service television. Licence commitments are currently focused on meeting public service purposes in a small number of core programming genres regarded by audiences as the most important (
defaultin particular news and current affairs). 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.19
default              
defaultIn return, all of the public service broadcasters, including the BBC, receive benefits. These include the right to appropriate prominence on electronic programme guides, as well as access to spectrum that 
defaultenables them to make their services available to 98.5% of the UK population on the digital terrestrial platform.
default&#xa0;
defaultStandards regulation
default&#xa0;
default3.
default20
default              
defaultOfcom has a duty to set standards for the content of programmes on television and on radio in order to secure the 
defaultfollowing standar
defaultds objectives set by Parliament. These apply to the BBC
default and are enforced by Ofcom
default unless otherwise stated:
default&#xa0;
default3.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese standards have to be published in a code, and in setting or revising these standards, Ofcom must take into account considerations such as the degree of harm or offence likely to be caused, the likely size and composition of the potential audience, th
defaulte likely expectation of the audience and the likelihood of persons who were unaware of the nature of the programmes content being unintentionally exposed to that content. 
default3.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe publish these standards in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code
default, which sets out the
default rules 
defaultby which broadcasters must abide
default. Ofcom
default also
default has a specific duty under section 107 of the 1996 Act to draw up a fairness code, which gives guidance to broadcasters on the principles and practices to be followed to prevent unjust or unfair treatment in pro
defaultgrammes and unwarranted infringement of privacy in programmes (or in connection with the obtaining of material included in them). We apply these provisions in Sections 7 (Fairness) and 8 (Privacy) of the Broadcasti
defaultng Code.
default3.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll 
defaultUK licensed broadcasters
default are 
defaultrequired by the terms of their licences to comply with the Broadcasting Code
default rules
default. Breach of the Broadcasting Code is
default a
default breach of a licence condition and we may take enforceme
defaultnt action against the licensee.
default3.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs noted above, t
defaulthere are some exceptions to the
defaultse rules for the BBC. Although it does not hold a licence, the BBC is required by the terms of the BBC Agreement to comply with the provi
defaultsions of the Broadcasting Code, 
defaultexcept
default on matters
default in relation to
default 
defaultdue impartiality and due accurac
defaulty
default and elections and re
defaultferendums which
default are governed by the BBC Trust.
default 
default3.25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the event of a breach of 
defaultthese rules
default, Ofcom has the power to impose statutor
defaulty sanctions on the broadcaster
default. Ofcom also has the power to 
defaultimpose 
defaultstatutory sanctions on the BBC
default 
default(again, under the terms of the 
defaultBBC Agreement)
default.
default3.26
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe imposition of a sanction against a broadcaster is a serious matter. Ofcom
default 
defaultmay, following due process, impose a sanction if we cons
defaultider that a broadcaster has seri
defaultously, deliberately, repeatedly, or recklessly breached a licence conditio
defaultn.
default3.27
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn most cases, the maximum fine for commercial television or radio licensees is £250,000 or 5% of the broadcaster’s "Qualifying Revenue", whichever is the greater. For licensed public service broadcasters, the maximum financial penalty payable is 5% of 
default"Qualifying Revenue". For the BBC or S4C, the maximum financial penalty is £250,000.
default3.28
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe sanctions available to Ofcom against
default the BBC include a decision to:
default&#xa0;
default3.29
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur procedures for how we handle complaints are published publicly
default and set out how we will assess complaints and the timescales in which we will do so.
default3.30
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the last financial year 
default, we assessed a total of 16,151
default broadcasting complaints, 
defaultof 
defaultwhich
default 2,832 (17.5%) referred to the BBC. The
defaultse
default resulted in
default 266 investigations
default, of which 12 (4.5%) were about content broadcast on BBC television and radio services.
default In total, we found 275 breaches of our rules and imposed fines totalling £129,000 for broadcasting complaints and £160,000 worth of fines for video-on-demand services. 
defaultOf the investigations about the BBC’s services, 
defaultOfcom found 
default3 
defaultcases resulted in 
defaulta 
defaultbreach of the Broadcasting Code.
default We also assessed 183 complaints about fairness and privacy, of which 46 (25.1%) referred to the BBC. None of the fairness and privacy complai
defaultnts in relation to the BBC were upheld
default.
defaultSpectrum
default&#xa0;default3.31
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom’s statutory duties include securing the optimal use of the radio spectrum. In practice Ofcom manages and 
defaultauthorises use of
default almost all of the civil radio spectrum (i.e. not those 
defaultfrequencies
default used by t
defaulthe military or Crown). 
default3.32
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC Agreement also places a duty on the BBC Trust to secure the efficient use of the spectrum available to the BBC. All BBC TV and radio services using spectrum in bands 
defaultmanaged
default by Ofcom must hold Wireless Telegraphy Act lic
defaultence
defaults that are issued by Ofcom.
default3.33
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn digital terrestrial TV (DTT) broadcasting, Ofcom works closely with the BBC, the commercial broadcasters and transmission providers to develop detailed TV frequency plans with the aim of securing specific public policy object
defaultives such as delivering near-universal coverage of public service broadcasting via DTT, as well as providing appropriate spectrum resources for non-public service broadcasting services. DTT frequency planning work is carried out collaboratively by a group 
defaultcomprising all DTT multiplex operators including the BBC. The group is chaired by Ofcom which also retains ultimate responsibility for
default how the spectrum is allocated.
default3.34
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn radio broadcasting, the more diverse range of broadcasters and transmission operators m
defaulteans that the BBC generally develops and manages the allocation of its services within agreed sub-bands or frequency blocks (though in some limited cases commercial and community services make use of frequencies within BBC sub-bands and vice versa), while 
defaultOfcom develops and manages frequency plans for commercial radio broadcasting services. Ofcom does however retain overall responsibility for managing and licensing the use of all of the spectrum used for radio services, 
defaultincluding that used by the BBC.
default3.35
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom
default’s spectrum responsibilities also include securing international frequency co-ordination for terrestrial TV and radio services. International co-ordination rights
default and obligations
default, which 
defaultcover
default the overall spectrum available for the BBC’s services, influence
default the availability and number of terrestrial broadcasting services in the UK. 
default3.36
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn contrast to the commercial broadcasters, the BBC’s services are not 
defaultseparately 
defaultlicensed by Ofcom under the Broadcasting Acts (though there are some limited exceptions to this). Broadcasting Act licences are of fixed duration, with statutory criteria setting out the circumstances under which the licences may be renewed. The Broadcasti
defaultng Act licences issued by Ofcom to the commercial public service broadcasters, multiplex operators and radio services also require adherence 
defaultto certain technical standards.
default3.37
default              
defaultWhile Ofcom has overall responsibility for resolving interference issues betwe
defaulten different wireless services, the BBC has a specific responsibility for investigating suspected cases of interference to domestic TV and radio reception. If the BBC determines that a case of reported interference is being caused by a source such as an un
defaultauthorised radio signal, they may refer the case to Ofcom for further investigation.
defaultCompetition
default&#xa0;
default3.38
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom has a number of roles and duties relating to competition, which broadly 
defaultconsist of 
defaultenfo
defaultrcement of competition law,
default sector regulatory duties concerning Broadcasting Act licences
default, and
default specific duties in relation to advising the BBC Trust.
defaultCompetition Law
default3.39
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom undertakes competition law investigations 
defaultin the communications sector 
defaultunder two parallel provisions, the Compe
defaulttition Act 1998, and the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which concerns 
defaultissues affecting 
defaulttrade between EU member states. Both provisions describe two broadly similar forms of behaviour that can be subject to investigation under com
defaultpetition law.
default3.40
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe first form of behaviour (prohibited under Chapter I of the Competition Act and Article 101 of the TFEU) is when parties enter into anti-competitive agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition. One example of such behaviour wo
defaultuld be the operation of a cartel. 
default3.41
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe second form of behaviour (prohibited under Chapter II of the Competition Act and Article 102 of the TFEU) is conduct that amounts to an abuse of a dominant position. Having a dominant position is not against the law i
defaultn itself, and it is only when this dominant position is abused that we would find a party in breach of 
defaultcompetition law. Examples of an abuse of a dominant position include, but are not limited to, excessive pricing, price discrimination, refusal to supply,
default predatory pricing and margin squeeze. 
default3.42
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC is subject to both forms of prohibition under competition law.
default3.43
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom also has the power to make market investigation references under the Enterprise Act 2002. Ofcom exercises all these powers concurrently wit
defaulth the Office of Fair Trading (soon to
default 
defaultbe the Competition and Markets Authority). 
defaultInformation on Ofcom’s approach to competition law inve
defaultstigations can be found in our enforcement g
defaultuidelines
default.
defaultBroadcasting Act licences
default3.44
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany broadcast services require licenc
defaultes from Ofcom under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996. Under the Communications Act, Ofcom has powers to impose conditions in those licences to: 
defaulta)

defaultAdvice to the BBC Trust
default3.47
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC Royal Charter and Agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 2007, provided for the establishment of a new Pub
defaultlic Value Test regime. The Public Value Test must be applied before a decision can be taken to make any significant change to the BBC’s UK public services, which can include the introduction of a new service or the discontinuation of an existing one.

defaultUnde
defaultr the new regime, the decision on whether to authorise such a change will be made by the BBC Trust (the Trust), following the application of a Public Value Test. In reaching a decision on a Public Value Test, the Trust must take into account the findings o
defaultf two separate reviews: 
default3.49
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, the Trust must undertake assessments of certain of the BBC Executive’s proposals in order to determine when the Public Value Test must be 
defaultapplied. The Trust will normally conduct these significance tests on proposals formally submitted by the BBC Executive, but it may also decide at its discretion to apply a significance test to any proposed BBC activity whether formally submitted by the BBC
default Executive or not. Ofcom will provide its view on the potential impact on others to inform the Trust’s decision in respect of its significance tests. In doing so, Ofcom will act as an independent body, and will have regard to its statutory duties. Advice r
defaulteceived from Ofcom as to the potential impact on others of the BBC’s proposals will be taken into account by the Trust as part of its overall test for significance, and will be published. However, the final decision on whether a proposal is significant res
defaultts only with the BBC Trust.

defaultAs set out above, 
defaultwe are

defaultthe maintenance of a sufficient plurality of providers of different television and radio services

defaultsome 
defaultspecific powers that are relevant.
defaultMerger control
default&#xa0;
default3.51
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Secretary of State has powers to intervene in certain mergers in the public interest. One such ground is “the need, in relation to every different
default audience in the United Kingdom
default, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience”. The definition of “media enterprise” excludes the BBC but may include a BBC company.
default3.52
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf the Secretary of State 
defaultintervenes in this way, Ofcom must report on whether it is or may be the case that the merger may be expected to operate against the public interest”. The Secretary of State decides whether or not to refer the merger to the Competition Commission (soon, th

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRules relating to cross-media ownership may also be relevant to plurality. In particular, the “20/20” rule prevents a 
defaultnewspaper group with more than 20% 
defaultof national newspaper share from holding a Channel 3 licence or a stake in a Channel 3 licensee that is greater than 20%
default. Such a person is also prevented from being the “appointed news provider” to a Channel 3 licensee. These rules are enforced by Ofcom in
default effect through the broadcast licensing regime.
