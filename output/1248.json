"&#xa0;\nHi there,\n&#xa0;\nI live in Ravenglass in Cumbria and wish to bring to the notice of the \n&#xa0;\ncommittee the lack of train services \n&#xa0;\nto this community\nin the early evening and none at all on a Sunday.\n&#xa0;\nIt takes about 2 hours to travel from Ravenglass\n to Lancaster to then transfer to a major City train. \n&#xa0;\n The last train in the evening to\nRavenglass leaves Lancaster before 4.30pm.\n&#xa0;\nIn the last 20 years I have only been able to book one return journey when taking holidays. \n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nAlmost all of the time I am \nforced to\nto use my car instead of the train because of the limitations of the service provided.\n&#xa0;\nI have never use a bus in the county of Cumbria.\n&#xa0;\nRegards \n&#xa0;\n Brian Kennish\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
