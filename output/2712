default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis Memorandum has been prepared for the Joint Committee which is scrutinising the Deregulation Bill in draft form (‘the Bill’) and for the consideration of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. 
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe memorandum identifies the provisions of the Bill which confer powers to make delegated legislation. It explains in each case why the power has been taken and the nature of, and reason for, the procedure selected. 
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the Bill deals with diverse subject areas, and covers changes from a number of departments, each measure is addressed individually. Most powers are specific to individual clauses but the Bill also includes some general powers. The material for the Memorandum was prepared by the relevant departments and drawn together by the Cabinet Office.
defaultBackground default&#xa0;default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Deregulation Bill is a cross-Government Cabinet Office-led Bill. It forms part of the government’s commitment to reduce the overall burden of regulation and to cut ‘red tape’ during this Parliament. The implementation of that programme includes measures given effect by administrative changes and secondary legislation. The Bill is one of a number 
defaultof
default government bills that is taking forward reforms where their implementation requires primary legislation. Its purpose is to change various pieces of legislation in 
defaultorder
default to reduce or remove unnecessary legislative burdens on businesses, civil society, the taxpayer and individuals; and, additionally, to repeal some redundant legislation. 
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Bill includes measures relating to general and specific areas of business, companies and insolvency, the use of land, housing, transport, communications, the environment, education and training, entertainment, public authorities and the administration of justice. It also provides for a duty on those exercising specified regulatory functions to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth. It repeals some legislation that is no longer of any practical use, and provides ministers with a power to make similar repeals in the future via secondary legislation.

defaultThe 
defaultprovisions
default in the Bill which confer these powers are identified below. The purpose of the delegated powers taken, and an explanation as to why the matter is to be left to delegated legislation and why the relevant department has chosen a particular procedure, are then set out in relation to each relevant clause.  
default&#xa0;
defaultTerritorial coverage default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAny amendment of existing legislation has the same extent as the original legislation except where specified by clause 63(2) and (3). Clause 63(2) and (3) specify certain paragraphs in 
defaultSchedule 16, which repeal
default legislation which is no longer of practical use. 
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy virtue of clause 63(5), the new powers granted to a Minister of the Crown by clauses 49 (power to amend legislation to describe actual commencement dates), 51

defaultand 58-61
default (provisions concerning the promotion of economic growth) form part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The provisions concerning consequential changes, commencement and short title set out in clauses 62, 64 and 65 also so apply, by virtue of the same clause.

defaultIntroduction
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause provides the Secretary of State with a new regulation-making power under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
default.
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 3(2) of the 1974 Act imposes a general duty on all self-employed persons to conduct their undertaking in such a way to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that they themselves and persons other than their employees who may be affected by it are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. 
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClause 1 limits the scope of section 3(2) so that only those self-employed who conduct a “relevant undertaking” will continue to hold a duty under this provision.
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis 
defaultnew regulation-making 
defaultpower is exercisable in relation to England and Wales and Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClause 1(3) defines “relevant undertaking” as an undertaking of a prescribed description, or any other undertaking that could expose other persons to risks to their health and safety. 
default15.
default&#xa0; 
default“Prescribed” has a specific meaning within the 1974 Act, defined in section 53(1) as prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. Clause 1(3) therefore enables the Secretary of State to make regulations for the purpose of bringing the
default self-employed within the scope of the section 3(2) duty. 
defaultUnless a relevant undertaking has been prescribed, a self-employed person will only owe a duty to themselves if their undertaking poses a risk of harm to others.
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe regulation-making power in clause 1(3) affords the Secretary of State a degree of flexibility because a number of different 
defaultdescriptions  of
default an  undertaking could be given in the regulations. For example, a “prescribed description” could be by reference to the activities that the undertaking engages in (e.g. construction
default) ,
default the hazardous substances it uses, or a combination of these things. 
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Secretary of State can exercise this power at his or her own discretion, or 
defaulton  a
default recommendation from the Health and Safety Executive who, by virtue of section 11(3) of the 1974 Act, may submit to the Secretary of State such proposals as it considers appropriate for the making of regulations. 
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultKey stakeholders will be consulted and their responses taken into account prior to a relevant undertaking being prescribed.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification 
defaultof 
default the
default delegation
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe department considers it necessary for the Secretary of State to be given a separate regulation-making power to prescribe a relevant undertaking because 
defaultit  will
default give the assurance that those self-employed persons working in high hazard industries or engaging in  high hazard activities (who would be expected to pose the highest risks of harm to others, as well as themselves) will not be exempt from the general duty under section 3(2) of the 1974 Act. This approach will make it clear and unambiguous to those working in high risk industries that they will not be exempt from section 3(2), and that they will still have a duty to conduct their undertaking in such a way as to ensure that they and others are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is appropriate for relevant undertakings to be prescribed through secondary legislation because it is anticipated that the kind of undertaking that needs to be prescribed may be subject to change and require regular updating to reflect fluctuating or emerging risks associated with a variety of different workplace activities or sectors. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of Parliamentary scrutiny
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRegulations made under the power conferred by clause 1(3) will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.  Section 82(3)
default of the 1974 Act 
defaultprovides that any power to make regulations conferred by Part 1 of the Act 
default( which
default includes section 3) shall be exercisable by statutory instrument and subject to annulment (subject to an exce
defaultption set out in section 82(4), 
defaultwhich is not relevant here). 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultStatutory instruments made under this clause will not make amendments to primary legislation, therefore the additional procedural hurdles and increased occupation of Parliamentary time associated with the affirmative procedure is not considered appropriate. However
default,
default these regulations will effectively bring individuals within the scope of the primary legislation. Accordingly, the department considers the negative resolution procedure provides the appropriate level of scrutiny for detailed and technical provisions regarding health and safety at work.

defaultIntroduction
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 
defaultA1(
default2) sets out the meaning of an approved English apprenticeship for the purposes of the new Chapter A1 of the 
defaultApprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). 
defaultIt is an arrangement which either takes place under an approved English apprenticeship agreement or is an alternative English apprenticeship and, in either case, satisfies any conditions specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.  Section 
defaultA1(
default4) confers a power on the Secretary of State to describe the kind of arrangements which are alternative English apprenticeships for the purposes of the new Chapter. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe background is that Schedule
default 1 inserts a new Chapter A1 in Part 1 of 
defaultthe 2009 Act. 
defaultChapter 1 currently provides a regime for both English apprenticeships and Welsh apprenticeships. The new Chapter 
defaultA
default1 relates only to English apprenticeships. The existing Chapter 1 will continue to apply to Welsh apprenticeships.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe new provisions follow a review of apprenticeships by Doug Richard in 2012. He recommended that the government improve the quality of apprenticeships and introduce more employer focus. Chapter A1 simplifies the existing system. It introduces new concepts of approved English apprenticeships and approved apprenticeship standards.
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Secretary of State has power to make regulations requiring the apprenticeship and the apprenticeship agreement to satisfy specified conditions. The Secretary of State also has the power to issue certificates to those who complete an approved English apprenticeship. The provisions as a whole reduce bureaucratic burdens, for example by abolishing apprenticeship frameworks and the issuing authorities who issue them.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese 
defaultnew delegated 
defaultpowers are exercisable in
default relation to
default England only.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of new section 
defaultA1(
default2) 
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection A1(2) provides a power for the Secretary of State to specify conditions which must be satisfied in 
defaultorder
default for an arrangement to be an approved English apprenticeship for the purposes of the new Chapter A1. The Department envisages that this power will be used to specify common requirements that all apprenticeships must meet.  These common requirements may change from time to time and therefore it would be inappropriate to specify them in primary legislation.  For example, the Secretary of State may wish to specify a minimum duration to allow all apprentices sufficient time to practise and embed the skills they have learned. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of new section 
defaultA1(
default4) &amp; (5)
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 
defaultA1(
default4) and (5) provide a power for the Secretary of State to describe the kinds of arrangements which constitute alternative
default English apprenticeships.  The d
defaultepartment envisages that the Secretary of State will use this power to describe arrangements which are suitable for apprenticeships, but where the arrangements cannot satisfy the employment requirements of an approved English apprenticeship agreement.  
defaultRegulations made under a similar existing power at section 1(5) of the 2009 Act exist for certain occupations where the apprentice is part of a crew or collective in the fishing, creative or performance industries. Regulations also exist for elite athletes undertaking the Sporting Excellence Apprenticeship with the hope of competing in 
defaultthe
default Commonwealth or Olympic Games.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation: new section 
defaultA1(
default2)
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe main elements of approved English apprenticeships – apprenticeship agreements, approved apprenticeship standards, and certificates are set out in the new sections. Following consultation with employers and other stakeholders, it is very likely that further detailed conditions will be identified as being ones that all apprenticeships should meet
default,
default 
defaultf
defaultor example a minimum duration, a minimum amount of off-the-job learning, or minimum levels of English and maths 
defaultachievement t
defaulthat need to be acquired to complete an apprenticeship.  These requirements may change from time to time, for example in response to changes in policy priorities, or as new English and maths qualifications become available or their titles change.  As such it would be inappropriate to specify them i
defaultn primary legislation, and the d
defaultepartment considers that the use of delegated powers to specify conditions that must apply to an approved English apprenticeship is appropriate.  
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation: new section 
defaultA1(
default4) and (5)
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe power to describe the kind of arrangements which constitute alternative English apprenticeships is similar to the power currently contained in section 1(5) of the 2009 Act to specify alternative English completion conditions. It is envisaged that
default the power will be used by the d
defaultepartment for the same purpose. 
defaultThe department
default is encouraging the use of more innovation within apprenticeships and a new apprenticeship standard can be developed at any time.  Delegation allows for the creation of an 
defaultapprenticeship  in
default exceptional circumstances, for example in certain circumstances where a person is self employed, or where a sector and individual could benefit from an approved apprenticeship.  Delegation will require detailed consideration of the merits of any application for an alternative English apprenticeship.  A
default 
defaultneed to use primary legislation would inevitably lead to delay and difficulty in keeping up with developments, and might constrain flexibility within the system.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of p
defaultarlia
defaultmentary s
defaultcrutiny
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe department considers that the use of the negative procedure to specify conditions that must apply to an approved English 
defaulta
defaultpprenticeship is appropriate. Section 262(5) makes the current (and similar) regulation making power subject to the negative procedure.
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe d
defaultepartment also considers the use of the negative procedure to describe the kinds of arrangements which constitute alternative English apprenticeships to be appropriate.  
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRegulations on alternative apprenticeships under the current law first came into effect in 2012 and were amended in 2013 using the affirmative procedure.  On both occasions only cases of genuine merit were proposed and on both occasions the 
defaultR
defaultegulations were approved unanimously and without controversy.  In 2013 three formal requests for alternative English completion conditions were received.  Of those only one was recommended for inclusion in the regulations and even this one was subject to considerable challenge before it went forward.  The department believes it has proved effective at weeding out cases that are not appropriate for apprenticeships. The sifting of requests has become largely an administrative act, and has not proved to be controversial or of wide interest.
default35.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs a result, the department does not consider that the additional cost, procedural hurdles and occupation of Parliamentary time associated with the affirmative procedure (which applies under the current law) are appropriat
defaulte to these powers; a change to 
defaultthe 
defaultnegative  procedure
default will enable the Secretary of State to act more swiftly where necessary to encourage innovation within apprenticeships and to respond to the nation’s needs at lower overall cost to the public purse.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThis section provides the Secretary of State with the power to make provision about applications for apprenticeship certificates, the supply of copies of apprenticeship certificates and the charging of fees for the issue of a certificate or supply of a copy.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThis power is exercisable in relation to England only. 
defaultThe effect of the section

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe d
defaultepartment envisages that the Secretary of State will use these powers to replace certificates (for example if these have been lost by the individual), or 
defaultto charge a fee for issuing and - or 
default- 
default replacing
default certificates.  This will be beneficial to the individual as it will give them evidence of their apprenticeship and the achievement of their apprenticeship, which they will find helpful when, for example, seeking a new job.  
defaultJustification of the Delegation
default              
default49.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese powers replace the powers in sections 3 and 4 of the 2009 Act (so far as relating to English apprenticeships). The new sections as a whole will simplify the current system by removing the role of English certifying authorities. In future there may be situations where an apprenticeship certificate may not be required to be issued, for example where a trade specific certificate is the main recognisable standard for a particular occupation.  The use of the delegated power will regulate the supply of certificates and enable the Secretary of State to charge a fee for issuing or supplying a certificate.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe supply of copy certificates and the charging of fees for this or for the issue of an apprenticeship certificate is largely an administrative task and the department considers that the use of the negative procedure is appropriate.

defaultIntroduction
default51.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments made by 
defaultSchedule
default 2 provide for a single system of registration for driving instructors which applies to both instructors who are disabled and those who are not. 
default&#xa0;
default52.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the new system the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors will have power to require a person, whether disabled or not, to undergo an assessment as to their ability to control a  vehicle in an emergency (“an emergency control assessment”) and to issue a certificate where satisfied of the person’s ability to do so (“an emergency control certificate”).
default&#xa0;
default53.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe new system requires changes to the regulation-making powers in Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. 
default&#xa0;
default54.
default&#xa0; 
defaultPart 1 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2 amends Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 in the form it will be in once the amendments made to it by the Road Safety Act 2006 come into force.  Part 2 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2 amends Part 5 as it has effect before those amendments come into force.  
default55.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese powers are exercisable in 
defaultrelation to 
defaultEngland and Wales and Scotland
default.
defaultThe effect of Part 1 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2
defaultParagraph 2(a) – amending section 124(3)
default&#xa0;
default56.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 123 a person is prohibited from giving paid driving instruction of any prescribed
default description unless registered in respect of that description. Regulations under section 124 may prescribe circumstances in which the section 123 prohibition does not apply. In particular, regulations may be made so that in prescribed 
defaultcircumstances persons who are training to be driving instructors are not required to be registered. Section 124(3) sets out particular circumstances which may be so prescribed. Paragraph 2(a) of 
defaultSchedule
default 2 amends section 124 so as to make it clear that those circumstances could include the circumstance that a person holds a current emergency control certificate. This would allow regulations to be made to exempt trainee driving instructors from the requirement to register in circumstances where the trainee holds an emergency control certificate.
defaultParagraph 3(3) – amending section 125
default57.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 125A of the 1988 Act is repealed by paragraph 5 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2. However, the definitions of “disability” and “relevant disability” given by section 
default125A(
default8) are still required for the purposes of Part 5 of the 1988 Act, as amended. Accordingly, paragraph 3(3) amends section 125 to reproduce the definitions. This has the effect of preserving the current power to prescribe by regulations a disability which is to be treated as a relevant disability for the purposes of the Part.   
defaultParagraph 4(2
default)(
defaultb) – amending section 125ZA(2)
default58.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 125ZA(1) the Registrar must register a person in respect of a description of driving instruction if the person makes an application for registration and the Registrar is satisfied that the prescribed conditions are met. Section 125ZA
default 
default(2) sets out what conditions may, in particular, be prescribed. Paragraph 4(2) amends section 125ZA so as to add conditions requiring a person who has been required to submit to an emergency control assessment to hold a current emergency control certificate. 
defaultParagraph 4(3
default)(
defaulta) and (d) – amending section 125ZA(4)
default59.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 125ZA(3) a person may be registered in respect of a description of driving instruction subject to fulfilling prescribed conditions so long as the person continues to be registered. Section 
default125ZA(
default4) sets out what conditions may, in particular, be prescribed. Paragraph 4(3)(a) amends section 125ZA so as to add-
default&#xad;
default(a) 
defaultconditions
default requiring a person to submit to an emergency control assessment (if required to do so by the Registrar in the circumstances mentioned in section 125(3D));
default(b) 
defaultconditions
default requiring a person to hold an emergency control certificate following such an assessment;
default(c), conditions requiring that, if instruction is to be given in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of an emergency arising which necessitates the instructor taking control of the vehicle, a person will only give such instruction if they would be able to take control of the vehicle if such an emergency arose.  
defaultParagraph 11(4) and (5) – amending section 
default133A(
default2) and (6) 
default60.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 133A
default 
default(2) sets out in full the meaning of “emergency control assessment”. It refers to an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a vehicle of a class 
defaultcovered by the disabled person’s limited driving licence. This is no longer appropriate as, under the new system, people who are not disabled may also be required to undertake emergency control assessments. Paragraph 11(4) therefore amends section 
default133A(
default2) to refer instead to an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a motor vehicle of a prescribed class. Paragraph 11(5) makes a consequential amendment to section 
default133A(
default6) which deal with the issue of emergency control certificates.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of Part 2 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2
defaultParagraph 17(2)
default&#xa0;
default61.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis paragraph inserts a new section 125(2C) and (2D) which sets out the circumstances in which the Registrar may require an applicant for registration to submit to an emergency control assessment. The circumstances are that the Registrar has reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant would be unable to take control of a motor car of a prescribed class if an emergency arose while he was giving driving instruction. 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultParagraph 17(4) – amending section 125(5)
default62.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 125(5) continued 
defaultregistration
default as an approved driving instructor is subject to the condition that the instructor will, upon request by the Registrar, submit to a test of continued ability and fitness to instruct. Paragraph 17(4) amends section 125(5) to add a further condition that the person will, if required to do so by the Registrar, submit to an emergency control assessment on a day within such period as may be prescribed.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThis paragraph inserts section 125(8A) and (8B) which prevent a person making  a further application for registration if the person  has undergone an emergency control assessment, been refused an emergency control certificate and, in consequence,  either not been registered or had their name removed from the register. The person is  prevented from making a further application before the end of the period of 6 months , beginning with the date of the assessment, or before the end of such other period as may be prescribed, unless the Registrar is satisfied that there is good reason for allowing an earlier application.  
default&#xa0;
defaultParagraph 17(9) – amending section 125(10)
default64.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 125A of the 1988 Act is repealed by paragraph 18 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2. However, the definitions of “disability” and “relevant disability” given by section 
default125A(
default8) are still 
defaultrequired for the purposes of Part 5 of the 1988 Act, as amended. Accordingly, paragraph 17(9) amends section 125 to reproduce the definitions. This has the effect of preserving the current power to prescribe by regulations a disability which is to be treated as a relevant disability for the purposes of the Part.
default&#xa0;
defaultParagraph 23(3) – amending section 129
default65.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis paragraph inserts a new section 129(1B) and (1C) which set out the circumstances in which the Registrar may require a person who applies for a licence for the purpose of gaining experience in giving driving instruction to submit to an emergency control assessment. The circumstances are that the Registrar has reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant would be unable to take control of a motor car of a prescribed class if an emergency arose while he was giving driving instruction.
default   
defaultParagraph 23(4) – amending section 129(2)
default66.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn consequence of the new system, paragraph 23(4) substitutes a new section 129(2) to set out the circumstances in which the Registrar must grant a licence to persons seeking to gain experience in giving driving instruction. The amendment preserves the existing power to prescribe a fee for the granting of such a licence. 
default&#xa0;
defaultParagraph 23(6) – amending section 129
default67.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 129(5) a licence granted for the purpose of enabling a person to gain experience in giving driving instruction may be granted subject to prescribed conditions. Paragraph 23(6) amends section 129 to provide that those conditions may include-
default(a) 
defaulta
default condition requiring the person granted the licence, if required to do so by the Registrar at a time when the circumstances in section 129(1C) apply, to submit to an emergency control assessment within a prescribed period;  
default(b) 
defaulta
default condition requiring that, if driving instruction is to be given in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of an emergency arising which necessitates the instructor taking control of the car, a person will only give such instruction if they  would be able to take control of the car if such an emergency arose. 
default&#xa0;
defaultParagraph 25(4) 
defaultand (5) – amending section 
default133A
default(
default2) and (6)
default68.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 
default133A(
default2) sets out in full the meaning of “emergency control assessment”. It refers to an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a motor car of a class covered by the disabled person’s limited driving licence. This is no longer appropriate as, under the new system, people who are not disabled may also be required to undertake emergency control assessments. Paragraph 25(4) therefore amends section 
default133A(
default2) to refer instead 
defaultto an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a motor car of a prescribed class. Paragraph 25(5) makes a consequential amendment to section 
default133A(
default6) which deals with the issue of emergency control certificates
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default69.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments to Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 set out above expand the existing powers to make regulations in relation to driving instruction under that Part. The department continues to consider that the power to make such provision should be delegated to the Secretary of State as a regulation-making power. The detail of such provisions is more appropriate to secondary legislation. There is also likely to be a need to amend such provisions and make further provision from time to time which would be less conveniently achieved if contained in primary legislation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny
default70.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe negative resolution procedure applies, by virtue of section 195(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, to the existing powers to make regulations under Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the department continues to believe that this is appropriate. There should be Parliamentary scrutiny as the new powers extend to matters which are important to becoming and remaining a driving instructor but these are not so significant as to merit the affirmative procedure.

default&#xa0; 
defaultClause
default 7 provides for the amendment of
default Part 3, sections 20 and 21, of the Clean Air Act 1993 
defaultwhich deals with 
defaultSmoke Control Areas
default.
default 
defaultUnder Part 3, it is an offence to emit smoke from the chimney of any building, or to emit smoke from a chimney (not being a chimney of a building) which serves the furnace of any fixed boiler or industrial plant, within a smoke control area unless using an authorised fuel or exempted appliance.  It is also an offence under section 23 to acquire or sell an unauthorised fuel within a smoke control area unless it is to be used under the specified requirements of an exempted appliance.
default&#xa0;
default72.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently the Secretary of State has the power under sections 20 and 21 of the Clean Air Act 1993 to authorise fuels by regulations and to exempt 
defaultclasses of fireplaces by 
defaultorder
default.  The regulations and 
defaultorder
default are made by statutory instrument. They are made every six months (April and September) in England to coincide with the common commencement dates.  
default&#xa0;
default73.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAuthorised fuels and exempted fireplaces are not identified individually within the Clean Air Act 1993 but have been the subject of the power of delegated legislation as this allows new fuels and fireplaces to be authorised and exempted as they are developed. This Bill includes a modification to the
default 
defaultprocedure by which thi
defaults delegated power is exercised.
default74.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis change to the procedure applies in relation to
default England only.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the change in delegation
default75.
default&#xa0; 
defaultManufacturers submit their products for testing to determine whether they are capable of being used without producing any smoke or a substantial quantity of smoke. The results are then checked by authorised contractors who subsequently make recommendations to the Secretary of State for inclusion in the six monthly 
defaultSIs
default.
default 
default76.
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the Red Tape Challenge
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment made a commitment to simplify the process of exemption and authorisation, with a view to reducing burdens and improving efficiency.  Interested parties advised that the main burden associated with the current process was the delay between receiving a recommendation from authorised contractors and subsequent inclusion in the SIs.
default&#xa0;
default77.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTo reduce the burden associated with the delay the Bill will amend sections 20 and 21 of the Clean Air Act to provide the Secretary of State with powers to authorise fuels and exempt appliances administratively by the publication of lists
default, thus avoiding 
defaultthe need for the production of the six monthly 
defaultSIs
default.  The government intends that this power would be exercised by publishing lists on the gov.uk website. Initial lists of authorised fuels and exempt appliances would be published upon the commencement of this provision; these lists would include the products approved under the existing SIs to ensure that these do not lose their approved status. Thereafter updated versions of the lists would be published on a monthly basis as new products are approved.  This will allow manufacturers to bring their products to market more rapidly and allow consumers access to latest 
defaultthe 
defaulttechnology.  The new procedure would enable lists to be updated and published as deemed necessary and if changes are required these will be made on a specific date each month.  The published lists will include details of the product type, conditions of use and date of grant, withdrawal
default or variation of any approval.
default Consumers without internet facilities may obtain access to the information via the 
defaultDefra
default Helpline
default or by writing to or emailing the d
defaultepartment direct.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification 
defaultof the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny
default78.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultorder to qualify for
default inclusion in the published lists, products must continue to meet the current requirements to demonstrate they are capable of being used without producing any smoke or a substantial quantity of smoke, therefore the safety and eligibility of these products for use in smoke control areas will remain unchanged. List publication and amendment will be subject to a robust system of quality controls and approval by senior staff.  The dates that products are added to the lists will be specified as will the dates of 
defaultany  variations
default or withdrawals of approvals. This will ensure that there is legal certainty with respect to which products may or may not be used, or, in the case of fuels, sold and acquired for use in a smoke control area at any given point in time.  
default&#xa0;
default79.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe offences under sections 20 and 23 regarding the emission of smoke and the sale and acquisition of fuels for use within a smoke control area are not changed by the 
defaultB
defaultill.  
default&#xa0;
default80.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe authorisation or exemption of a product would only be withdrawn if evidence which demonstrates that the product does not meet the eligibility criteria for use in a smoke control area came to light. 
defaultThe department
default is not aware of any appliance exemption being withdrawn to date.  Some authorised fuels have been removed in the past as manufacture had ceased and the fuel had not been available for many years.  Variations of authorisations and exemptions have previously consisted of changes to brand name or manufacturer’s name and the SIs have indicated any previously known names for clarity.  It is not intended to change this process.
default&#xa0;
default81.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the event of evidence indicating that a product authorisation should be withdrawn 
defaultthe department
default would liaise with interested parties first to investigate the validity of the evidence and then to ensure the withdrawal is publicised appropriately and where possible consumers are notified of the withdrawal.  The new centralised lists will highlight the date at which any withdrawals or amendments were made which is an improvement on the current system where it would be necessary to compare lengthy product lists in the SIs in 
defaultorder
default for consumers and 
defaultlocal authorities 
defaultto identify any changes in the status of a product.  Finally there are some inherent additional legal safeguards to protect consumers and manufacturers.  The first of these is the requirement in the Clean Air Act 1993 to publish the lists.  The other is that a decision to withdraw an authorisation/exemption would be subject to judicial review if it is not taken correctly.

default82.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClause 9 will amend Part 13 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to allow individuals to be authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to certain categories of appointment only.   Currently, individuals who are authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner are authorised in relation to all categories of appointment.  
default&#xa0;
default83.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments to Part 13 will provide for a person to be either fully authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner and practise in all categories of appointment or to be partially authorised to act only in relation to companies or only in relation to individuals.   
default&#xa0;
default84.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe clause will also prevent partially authorised insolvency practitioners from acting in relation to a company or individual that is, or was, a member of a partnership that has outstanding liabilities, without permission from the court. Such appointments require an individual to be fully authorised because this type of insolvency requires knowledge of both company and individual insolvency law.

defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default86.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe clause will amend section 391 of the Insolvency Act 1986 relating to recognised professional bodies.  Section 391(1) and (2) will confer powers on the Secretary of State by 
defaultorder
default:
defaultIn each case, an 
defaultorder
default may be made only if it appears to the Secretary of State that the body regulates the practice of a profession and maintains and enforces rules for ensuring that its insolvency specialist members are fit and proper persons to act as insolvency practitioners and meet acceptable requirements as to education practical training and experience.   An 
defaultorder
default which recognises a body for the purposes of granting partial authorisations has to state whether the partial authorisation relates to companies or to individuals.
default&#xa0;
default87.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSection 391(5) will require the Secretary of State by 
defaultorder
default to revoke a professional body’s recognition where it appears that the body no longer meets the relevant requirements. The Secretary of State must also revoke recognition of a professional body in relation to full authorisations and replace it with recognition in relation to partial authorisations if
default 
defaultit appears to the Secretary of State that the body is capable of providing its insolvency specialist members with partial authorisation only.  The Secretary of State may in the relevant 
defaultorder
default make transitional provisions to treat the body’s insolvency 
defaultspecialist members as fully or partially authorised, as the case may be, for a specified period after recognition is revoked, or revoked and replaced.
default&#xa0;
default88.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn 
defaultorder
default under section 391 must be made using the negative procedure by virtue of section 419 of the 1986 Act.  
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default89.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe powers to recognise professional bodies which may authorise their members to act as an insolvency practitioner and to revoke a body’s recognition in section 391 have been delegated since the Insolvency Act 1986 came into effect.  The clause will replace these powers with powers enabling the 
defaultdepartment
default to recognise professional bodies in relation to full authorisation or in relation to partial authorisation.  Professional bodies which are currently recognised will be treated as bodies capable of providing full authorisations.
default&#xa0;
default90.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe d
defaultepartment considers that such powers should continue to be delegated to the Secretary of State.  Delegation will allow the 
defaultdepartment 
defaultthe flexibility to determine in any specific case whether or not a professional body meets or continues to meet the requirements for recognition and whether or not it is or continues to be capable of granting full authorisations or is capable of providing partial authorisations only.  It will enable the 
defaultdepartment
default to take swift action pursuant to its determination.  A need to use primary legislation to address such issues would inevitably lead to delay and difficulty. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny
default91.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe d
defaultepartment considers it appropriate that 
defaultorder
defaults relating to the recognition of professional bodies which regulate insolvency practitioners should continue to be made using the negative resolution procedure.  Decisions relating to the recognition of bodies which regulate insolvency practitioners can be taken by the executive to a large extent and do not
default merit the additional level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny afforded by the affirmative procedure.

defaultIntroduction
default92.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause inserts new section 519A into the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”). Subsection (1) defines 
defaultlisted
default company and, also, non-
defaultlisted
default company, for the purposes of Part 16 (removal, resignation, etc of auditors). 
default&#xa0;
default93.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA 
defaultlisted
default company is defined as a company whose “transferable securities” (these include shares and bonds) are included in the “official list” – in other words they have a main (London Stock Exchange) market listing – or whose shares are listed on a comparable market elsewhere in the EEA. A non-
defaultlisted
default company is defined as a company that is not a 
defaultlisted
default company.
default&#xa0;
default94.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the context of auditors ceasing to hold office and the amendments to the Act being made by clause 10, there is a distinction between a 
defaultlisted
default company and a non-
defaultlisted 
defaultcompany and an enhanced framework of regulatory requirements applies in the case of the former. For instance, if an auditor of a 
defaultlisted
default company is ceasing to hold office that auditor must in all cases send the company a statement of reasons as to why he or she is stepping down. If an auditor of a non-
defaultlisted
default company is ceasing to hold office, however, that requirement does not apply in all cases – it applies where an auditor leaves before the end of his or her term and either one or more of the auditor’s reasons for leaving is of regulatory interest or there are matters which the auditor thinks the company’s shareholders or creditors should know about.  
default&#xa0;
default95.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe sending of such a statement leads in turn to other obligations on the part of the auditor or the recipient – for instance, the company must (generally speaking) send a copy of such to a statement to its shareholders and creditors and to the Registrar of Companies.

defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default97.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSubsection (5) of new section 519A provides that the Secretary of State may by 
defaultorder
default amend the definition of 
defaultlisted
default company. Since a non-
defaultlisted
default company is simply defined as a company that is not a 
defaultlisted
default company, amending the definition of 
defaultlisted
default 
defaultcompany
default 
default will
default simultaneously have the effect of altering what is a non-
defaultlisted
default company. 
default&#xa0;
default98.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAmending the definition of 
defaultlisted
default company may be a relatively trivial matter – markets may change over time and the power could, for instance, be used to update terms and references used in the then current definitions (the power may already have been used of course) that have become obsolete. The power could, however, be used to provide that certain types of company, in respect of which the enhanced framework does not apply, will thereupon be subject to that framework. An example would be amending the definition to include companies that are listed on secondary markets or which are currently unlisted but, because of their size or the sector in which they operate, are of 
defaultconsiderable economic or public importance.  Conversely, the power could be used to amend the definition to exclude a type of company from the list of 
defaultcompanies  in
default respect of which the enhanced framework applies.   
default&#xa0;
default99.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSubsection (6) of new section 519A provides that an

default100.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAmending the definition of 
defaultlisted
default compa
defaultny is justified because of the department
default’s wish for flexibility as regards keeping the current (and any future) definitions up-to-date and as regards determining precisely what type of company will or will not be covered by the enhanced framework of auditor leaving statement requirements.     
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny
default101.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn balance, and notwithstanding that this is a Henry VIII power, the department considers that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate. This is because, and as explained above, such a power might only be used in a very minor way – bringing references and terms used in the then current definitions up-to-date. Even if the power is used in a more material way, there will be cases in which there are no practical consequences. For instance, where the power is used to add new types of company (and thereby apply the enhanced framework to the same), the auditor of such a company may be sending the company a leaving statement in a case in which, prior to the exercise of the power, he would also have had to have sent such a statement – i.e. because he or she was leaving prior to the end of his or her term and, for example, there were matters which he or she thought the company’s shareholders needed to know about.  Moreover, these are technical, regulatory matters such that in any event the use of the power is not expected to attract widespread interest or be controversial. In th
defaulte circumstances, the d
defaultepartment does not consider that the a
defaultdditional procedures and p
defaultarliamentary engagement associated with an affirmative resolution procedure statutory instrument can be justified. 
default&#xa0;
default102.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a number of existing Henry VIII powers on the face of the Act in respect of which the negative resolution procedure applies and which might therefore be considered a precedent. Section 857(1) is a power to make regulations further providing for the contents of a company’s annual return and subsection (2) provides that these regulations may amend the existing provisions at sections 855 and 856. Section 1099(4) relates to the Registrar of Companies obligations to keep an index of the names of companies and other bodies and allows the Secretary of State by 
defaultorder
default to amend the list of other bodies at section 1099(3). Section 1160(1) is a power to make regulations amending the definitions of “subsidiary”, “holding company” or “wholly-owned subsidiary” – see section 1159 of and 
defaultSchedule
default 6 to the Act. Note that, like the proposed power to amend the definition of “public interest 
defaultcompany
default”, each of these powers may be used in material way - making bodies or other persons subject to new obligations or, conversely, 
defaultremoving obligations to which bodies or other persons are subject.  
default&#xa0;
default103.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlease note that the department
default is considering whether it would be preferable to replace the terms ‘listed company’ and ‘non-listed company’
default with alternative labels before the Bill is introduced in Parliament.

defaultGeneral introduction to the ‘rights of way’
default provisions
default104.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy way of general background to these measures, Part 3 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”) requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. The local authorities concerned are referred to in that Act as “surveying authorities” and the maps and statements are referred to as “definitive maps and statements”. Part 3 also sets out the procedures which apply where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made.
default&#xa0;
default105.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA definitive map and statement is conclusive evidence of certain matters. For example, if a map shows a footpath, this is generally conclusive evidence that the public had a right of way on foot over the land on a particular date.
default&#xa0;
default106.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome rights of way are not recorded on a definitive map and statement. Section 53 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”). 
defaultprovides
default for unrecorded rights of way created before 1949 to be extinguished immediately after 1 January 2026 (known as the “cut-off date”), subject to certain exceptions. 
default&#xa0;
default107.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2000 Act also confers power on the Secretary of State to, by regulations, make transitional provisions and savings, in particular for cases where (a) orders modifying definitive maps and statements have been made but not confirmed before the cut-off date; (b) applications for definitive map orders have been submitted before the cut-off date; or (c) orders have been quashed because of a legal error (section 56(2
default)(
defaultb)).
default&#xa0;
default108.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Highways Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) also deals with public rights of way. For example, it allows applications to be made, in certain circumstances, to extinguish or divert a public right of way.

defaultIntroduction
default110.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause provides the Secretary of State with a method to protect certain public rights of way from extinguishment in 2026. 
default&#xa0;
default111.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe general background to this, as explained in the general introduction to 
defaultthe rights of way provisions
default, is that Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. 
default&#xa0;
default112.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome rights of way are not recorded on a definitive map and statement. Section 53 of the 2000 Act provides for the extinguishment, immediately after cut-off date, of unrecorded rights of way created before 1949, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
default&#xa0;
default113.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat Act also confers power on the Secretary of State to, by regulations, make transitional provisions and savings (see the general introduction to 
defaultthe rights of way provisions for further details of this.) 
default&#xa0;
default114.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is thought that, in the period immediately before the cut-off date, there will be a large volume of applications to surveying authorities for modifications to be made to the definitive map and statement to show rights of way that are currently unrecorded. This is because individuals and groups in the voluntary sector are likely to carry out research so that they can make applications to have unrecorded rights of way shown on a definitive map and statement (with the result that they will not be automatically extinguished after that date). There is concern that surveying authorities will also carry out research into unrecorded rights of way during this period in order to comply with the requirement that they keep under review definitive maps and statements. This could lead to surveying authorities unnecessarily duplicating the work of individuals and the voluntary sector.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default115.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe clause therefore inserts a new section 56A in the 2000 Act. This extends the regulation-making power in section 56(2) of that 
defaultAct  to
default enable the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling a surveying authority to designate, during a period of one year after the cut-off date, public rights of way extinguished immediately after that date under section 53 of that Act. The exercise of the power is subject to the negative resolution procedure (see section 56(6) of that Act).  The new section 56A also sets out what else may be included in the regulations. It is envisaged that the power to make regulations will be used to provide for designated rights to cease to be regarded as extinguished as from the time of designation. Where a right is designated, surveying authorities will be required to decide whether to modify the definitive map and statement to show the right of way. If a right of way is then sho
defaultwn on the map, it will remain non-
defaultextinguished. If the authority decides not to show the right of way, it will normally be extinguished again.

defaultClause 13 is in the nature of a transitional or savings provisi

defaultthe  transition
default 
defaultto a position where certain unrecorded public rights of way will no longer be able to be added to definitive maps and statements. It also provides a method to save unrecorded rights that would otherwise be extinguished on the cut-off date. It enables surveying authorities to wait until after the cut-off date to assess what research has been carried out by individuals and voluntary organisations. There will be a one-year period after that date within which they can act under the regulations to prevent rights of way being permanently extinguished. They will therefore be able to avoid duplicating any work done by individuals and voluntary organisations and focus, during the one-year period following the cut-off date, on areas where research has not been carried out by individuals and voluntary organisations.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs explained above in the description of the effect of clause 13, the clause is in the nature of a transitional or savings provision. As explained in the general introduction to 
defaultthe rights of way provisions
default, the 2000 Act already confers power on the Secretary of State to, by 
defaultregulations,
default make transitional provisions and savings in relation to the cut-off date. 
defaultThe department
default therefore considers it appropriate that further provision for 
defaulttransition and savings is also 
defaultdealt with by delegated legislation. 
default&#xa0;
default119.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department
default also considers it appropriate that the procedure for the determination in relation to a designated public right of way be dealt with by delegated legislation. Clause 13 provides that the provision that may be made by virtue of subsection (1
default)(
defaultd) includes provision applying 
defaultSchedule
default 15 to the 1981 Act, subject to such modifications as may be specified in the regulations. 
defaultThe department’s
default intention is to introduce a procedure that closely follows the procedure set out in 
defaultSchedule
default 15. However, due to the 
defaultfact that the procedure will apply for only a transitory period, and deal with designated public rights of way (and not rights of way generally), it is anticipated that various modifications of 
defaultSchedule
default 15 will be required. 
defaultThe department
default has not finalised the details of the modified procedure, and needs the flexibility afforded by the regulation-making power.

defaultAs described above in the description of the effect of the clause, the exercise of the power is subject to the negative resolution procedure. Clause 13 sets out in some detail the matters which may be provided for in the transitory period during which public rights of way may be designated. 
defaultThe department 
defaultconsiders in view of this that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate and proportionate.
default&#xa0;
default121.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 56(2) of the 2000 Act also provides a precedent for transitional and savings provision relating to the cut-off date being subject to negative resolution procedure. 
defaultThe department 
defaultdoes not see any good reason to depart from that in this case. One consequence of applying a different level of scrutiny in this case would be that provision for transition and savings would be fragmented, which

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe background to this clause, as explained in the general introduction to

default the 1980 Act also deals with public rights of way. For example, it allows applications to be made, in certain circumstances, to extinguish or divert a public right of way.
default&#xa0;
default124.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 118ZA of the 1980 Act, owners, lessees and occupiers of land used for agriculture, forestry or the breeding of keeping of horses may apply to a local authority for an order (“a public path extinguishment order”) which extinguishes a public 
defaultright of way over a footpath or bridleway crossing the land.  Section 119ZA of that Act confers a comparable right to apply for an order to divert such a right of way (“a public path diversion order”).  
default&#xa0;
default125.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

defaultAs explained above in the introduction to this clause, applicants for public path extinguishment orders or public path diversion orders have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in certain circumstances. The Secretary of State has only limited powers to recover the costs of these kinds of appeals and thus is forced to bear some of the costs.

default1980 Act locally. 
default&#xa0;
default131.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe background to this clause is that sections 118ZA and 119ZA of the 
defaultHighways Act 1980
default allow owners, lessees or occupiers of certain land to apply to local authorities for public path extinguishment orders or public path diversion orders. The amendments made by this clause deal with the recovery of costs in respect of such applications.
default&#xa0;
default132.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultCurrently, the sections contain powers which allow the Secretary of State, in relation to England, or the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to prescribe charges payable on the making of such applications (and further charges where an order is made on the application). Under such regulations, the authority dealing with the application would be able to recover its costs but only up to the prescribed amount which would be set centrally and may not be at a level which would allow the authority to recover all of its costs.
default&#xa0;
default133.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe Secretary of State has a general power in section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (“1989 Act”) to allow authorities to allow local authorities to charge for certain things locally. The power is exercised by delegated legislation. However, this power is only available where there is no other power or duty to impose a charge.
defaultThe e
defaultffect of the 
defaultprovision
default134.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe clause therefore amends sections 118ZA and 119ZA of the
default Highways Act
default 1980 so as to limit the application of the charging provisions within those sections to Wales. The effect of this is to allow the Secretary of State (in relation to England) to use the power under section 150 of the 1989 Act to authorise charges to be imposed in respect of applications under sections 118ZA and 119ZA.

defaultThe power in section 150 of the 1989 Act is exercisable by delegated legislation.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe clause has the effect of allowing the delegated power in section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to be exercised in circumstances where it couldn
default’t currently be exercised. The department
default therefore considers that clause 17 should be justified.
default&#xa0;
default136.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 150 provides a precedent for the delegation of legislative powers to the Secretary of State to allow local authorities to

default138.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis provision provides the Secretary of State with power to introduce a modified procedure for the correction of administrative errors in maps and statements of public rights of way.
default&#xa0;
default139.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe background to this, as explained in the general introduction to 
defaultthe rights of way provisions
default, is that Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area.
default&#xa0;
default140.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSchedule
defaults 14 and 15 to the1981 Act set out the procedure which applies where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made. There is provision for such things as the making of applications, the making of orders, notification, publicity, consultation, referral (of opposed orders), determination, and finally, confirmation. 
default&#xa0;
default141.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdministrative errors, such as a reference accompanying a path on a map to “FP23” when the path is in fact “FP33”, are often found in definitive maps and statements. There is currently not any separate procedure to deal with such cases. Surveying authorities are expected to follow the procedure in 
defaultSchedule
defaults 14 and 15 to the 1981 Act. This is unnecessarily burdensome in cases where errors are obvious and very unlikely to be contentious. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe e
defaultffect of the
default provision
default142.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe provision therefore inserts a new section 53ZA in the 1981 Act. Under this provision the Secretary of State may introduce a modified procedure for the correction of administrative errors. The procedure must follow the existing procedure in 
defaultSchedule
defaults 14 and 15 with such modifications as are prescribed in regulations. Subsection (3) provides that the exercise of this power is subject to negative resolution procedure.
default&#xa0;
default143.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSubsection (1
default)(
defaulta) to (c) specifies the circumstances where surveying authorities may use the new procedure. Firstly, authorities must be satisfied that an event of the kind specified in section 53(3
default)(
defaultc) of the 1981 Act must have occurred (these are known as “evidentiary events”). An evidentiary event includes such things as the discovery by an authority that a public right of way shown on the definitive map of a particular description ought to be shown as a way of a different description.  Secondly, they must be satisfied that the need for the modification has arisen because of an administrative error. Thirdly, they must be satisfied that both the error and the modification needed to correct it are obvious. Surveying authorities must have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State in judging whether subsection (1
default)(
defaulta) to (c) has been met.
default&#xa0;
default144.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe purpose of the provision is to provide a method to introduce a shorter procedure for correcting administrative errors in definitive maps and statements.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default145.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department
default envisages that the modified procedure will generally be same as the procedure in 
defaultSchedule
defaults 14 and 15 to the 1981 Act, with modifications to make it shorter and more appropriate given the subject matter of administrative errors. The existing procedure relating to changes to definitive maps and statements is prescribed in primary legislation. 
defaultThe department
default considers that the correction of administrative errors is important, but not so important as to require that the procedure for correcting administrative erro
defaultrs be subject to the degree of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny associated with primary legislation. As explained above in the description of the effect of the provision, the clause sets out in detail the circumstances in which surveying authorities may use the modified procedure.
default&#xa0;
default146.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department
default needs the flexibility afforded by a delegated legislative power. This will enable 
defaultthe department

defaultAs explained above in the description of the effect of the clause, the exercise of the power is subject to negative resolution procedure. As explained above the power to introduce a modified procedure is limited to relatively minor issues (administrative errors). 
defaultThe department

default&#xa0;
default149.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs described above in the general introduction, Part 3 of that Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review definitive maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. Part 3 also sets out the procedures which apply where someone applies to a surveying authority for a change to be made to a definitive map and statement.

defaultThe effect of the provision
default&#xa0;
default152.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe new provision states that regulations may provide that section 53B(1) does not apply with respect to applications made in England, or to any prescribed description of such applications, unless the authority serve notice under paragraph 1A(4)(b) of 
defaultSchedule
default 14 in relation to such an application. The effect of this is to confer a new delegated legislative power on the Secretary of State.
default&#xa0;
default153.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParagraph 1A(4)(b) refers to notice being given of an authority’s decision to determine an application having concluded under paragraph 1A that there is a reasonable basis for the applicant’s belief that the definitive map and statement should be changed.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the d
defaultelegation
default154.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department’s
default policy is that the duty to register applications generally should not apply with respect to applications made in England, unless the authority has served notice as described above. However, 
defaultthe department
default is still considering whether it might wish to make exceptions to this general policy in respect of certain categories of application. 
defaultThe department
default therefore needs the flexibility afforded by the delegation of legislative power. Section 53B(1) and (6) also provides a precedent for conferring delegated power on the Secretary of State to prescribe the information that might be contained in the register in regulations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary scrutiny
default155.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 
default53B(
default6) provides a precedent for regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure for prescribing the information that must be kept in the register. Whilst the exclusion of information from the register of all applications for changes to definitive maps and statements is an important matter, 
defaultthe department 
defaultdoes not consider it so important that the affirmative resolution procedure ought to apply. There is very little public interest in applications for changes to definitive maps and statements where there is no reasonable basis for such changes to be made. However, the private landowner over whose land the alleged right subsists, may have some, albeit mild interest in an application notwithstanding that there is no reasonable basis for it. 
defaultThe department
default therefor
defaulte considers that some level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny is merited and that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate and proportionate.

defaultIntroduction
default156.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis provision provides the Secretary of State with power to introduce a shorter procedure for changes to definitive maps and statements of public rights of way where landowners give their consent.
default&#xa0;
default157.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy way of background, as explained in the general introduction to 
defaultthe rights of way provisions
default, Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area.
default The local authorities concerned are referred to in that Act as “surveying authorities” and the maps and statements are referred to as “definitive maps and statements”.
default&#xa0;
default158.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPart 3 also sets out the procedures which apply where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made.
default&#xa0;
default159.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultHighways Act 
default1980 also deals with public rights of way. For example, it allows applications to be made, in certain circumstances, to extinguish or divert a public right of way.
default&#xa0;
default160.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnrecorded rights of way created before 1949 are sometimes discovered by surveying authorities. In such cases landowners might not object to the addition of the rights to definitive maps and statements if the right of way in question is reasonably diverted, to allow for current land usage. However, there is currently no provision for surveying authorities to modify definitive maps and statements and divert the right under the same procedure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect
default of the provision
default161.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe provision therefore inserts two new sections into the 1981 Act: sections 54B and 54C. The new section 54B sets out a new procedure by which an authority may by order modify the definitive map in consequence of certain kinds of application under section 53(5) of the Act. The new procedure is generally only available in respect of applications where evidence relates only to the existence of a right of way before 1949.
default&#xa0;
default162.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the features of the new 
defaultprocedure,
default is that a landowner over whose land an alleged public right of way subsists must consent to it being used. The authority may make 
defaulta ”
defaultdiversion order”, under section 54B(2)(a) in order to secure this consent. This may divert the public right of way in question. Section 
default54B(
default3) provides that the effect of a diversion order is twofold. It will create a new public path, and extinguish the public right over so much of the existing path as is necessary to enable the diversion.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default163.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department considers that the delegation is arguably a delegation of legislative power, and that the provision should be justified in this memorandum. As explained above under the description of the effect of the provision, a diversion order will have the effect of creating a new public path, and extinguishing the public right over so much of the existing path as is necessary to enable the diversion . As such, an order will affect the rights of the general public over the public over a public right of way being diverted.  A diversion order is therefore arguably 
defaultlegislative
default in character as a “creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases”.
default 
default&#xa0;
default164.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe provision confers power to make modification consent orders including special orders on surveying authorities. It is intended to give surveying authorities (which are generally local authorities) more scope to resolve disputes about the existence of public rights of way at a local level. The provision sets out the limits to the exercise of the power (for instance that the authority must obtain the consent of all landowners). There is also a precedent for the function of diverting rights of way to be delegated to local decision-makers (see section 119 of the 1980 Act which confers power on councils to by order divert certain
default kinds of public rights of way).
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of Parliamentary Scrutiny
default165.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe delegated power in this instance is exercised by order with no parliamentary scrutiny. 
defaultThe department 
defaultconsiders this to be appropriate as the power is delegated to local authorities. There is also a precedent for this. Orders diverting rights of way under section 119 of the 1980 Act are not generally subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

default166.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese provisions provide the Secretary of State with a method for prescribing the form of various documents associated with the procedure for ascertaining public rights of way in England.
default&#xa0;
default167.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs described above in the general 
defaultto the rights of way provisions
default, Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. Part 3 introduces Schedule 14 to that Act which sets out the procedures which apply where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made.
default&#xa0;
default168.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVarious provisions in Schedule 14 delegate power to “prescribe” something. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 14 states that this power is exercisable by the Secretary of State by regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure. 
defaultFor example, 
defaultparagraph 1 of Schedule 14 provides that an “application shall be submitted in the prescribed form”. In this example paragraph 1 confers delegated power on the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of applications made under paragraph 1 in regulations.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe effect of each of these new provisions is that where they refer to doing something “in the prescribed form” they confer a new delegated power. The power is, by virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 14 conferred on the Secretary of State and is exercisable by regulations pursuant to the negative resol

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is precedent in Schedule 14 to the 1981 Act for the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations the form of various notices and forms associated with the procedure for public rights of way in England (

defaultIntroduction
default173.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis paragraph widens the scope of the conditions and other provisions which the Secretary of State may include in any 
defaultorder
default he makes under section 24 
defaultof the 
defaultRailways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) (i.e. an 
defaultorder
default exempting passenger rail services from the franchising regime of sections 23 to 31 of that Act). 
default&#xa0;
default174.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMost main line passenger rail services in England and Wales are designated under section 23(1) of the 1993 Act as services to be provided under franchise agreements with the Secretary of State
default. These franchised services are provided by private rail operating companies under franchise agreements made with the Secretary of State under section 29. 
default&#xa0;
default175.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBecause, under the 1993 Act, the Secretary of State is the sole main line passenger rail franchising authority for England and Wales, other persons cannot directly procure themselves main line rail services which have been designated for franchising. However the Secretary of State may, by 
defaultorder
default under section 24 of the 1993 Act, exempt services from designation and thus carve them out of the franchising system. This would enable others to provide main line r
defaultail services 
defaultinstead of the Secretary of State. 
default&#xa0;
default176.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is envisaged that the section 24 
defaultorder
default making power would be used, in conjunction with clause 22 of the Bill, to enable Passenger Transport Executives to take over the provision of regional passenger rail services from central government.   
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default177.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese powers are exercisable 
defaultin relation to rail services in En
defaultgland and Wales, and in Scotland other than
default for rail services which start and end in Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of 
defaultSchedule 7 paragraph 8
default 
default178.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe effect of the paragraph is to insert a new section 24A into the 1993 Act which would expand the scope of conditions and provisions which the Secretary of State may include in a section 24 
defaultorder
default. 
default&#xa0;
default179.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 24A would enable the Secretary of State to apply similar railway asset protection, contract enforcement and asset transfer provisions in connection with an “operator agreement” (i.e. a contract for de-designated passenger rail services) as currently apply in connection with franchise agreements of the Secretary of State. 
default&#xa0;
default180.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore specifically section 24A would enable a section 24 de-designation 
defaultorder
default of the Secretary of State to: -
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default181.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSchedule
default 7 
defaultparagraph
default 8 only affects section 24 Railways Act 1993 de-designation 
defaultorder
defaults made by the Secretary of State (i.e. 
defaultorder
defaults which relate to passenger rail services other than ones which start and end in Scotland). 
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default182.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe new section 24A of the 1993 Act would enable the Secretary of State, in carving out passenger rail services from the franchising system, to apply equivalent railway asset protection, contract enforcement and asset transfer provisions as would have continued to apply had they remained within the franchising regime. In that sense the Secretary of State would be able to maintain substantial continuity in the legal framework which applied.
default&#xa0;
default183.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default These railway asset protection provisions would ensure that assets needed for railway operations were kept intact, such that upon operator default or failure the railway operations could be taken over as a going concern by a successor, thus enabling continuity of passenger rail services.    
default&#xa0;
default184.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The contract enforcement provisions would strengthen the ability of the procurement body to be able to secure compliance with the terms of the passenger services contract b
defaulty 
defaultproviding a statutory enforcement system to complement the normal civil law enforcement processes. 
default&#xa0;
default185.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe asset transfer provisions would enable a more effective and efficient transfer of railway assets from an outgoing operator to a successor upon contract expiry or early termination.   
default&#xa0;
default186.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The 
defaultdepartment
default envisages decentralisation of regional passenger rail services involving regional franchise operations being taken over by Passenger Transport Executives. This has led to a fresh look at relevant legislation to ensure any decentralisation could be made to work effectively. It seems logical in this context to enable de-designated regional passenger rail to be able to be underpinned by equivalent legal provisions to those that apply to franchised services. 
default&#xa0;
default187.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default The d
defaultepartment considers it is appropriate for these issues to be addressed in secondary legislation because this would allow the Secretary of State to determine in any specific case, and within the scope of the powers, what provision should be made to apply. 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultJustification of the level of p
defaultarliamentary
default s
defaultcrutiny
default188.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe power under section 24 of the 1993 Act to make an 
defaultorder
default is exercisable by statutory instrument subject to negative
default resolution
default. A section 24 
defaultorder
default is only made where the railway services in question are already subject to the franchise regime. The extended scope of the power would enable similar provisions to apply after franchise de-designation as already applied before de-designation. Any operator contracted to provide passenger rail services by a party in whose favour a section 24 
defaultorder
default is made would be engaged by entry into a freely negotiated commercial contract in the knowledge that su
defaultch provisions would apply. The d
defaultepartment therefore considers that the extended scope to such 
defaultorder
defaults, enabled by 
defaultSchedule
default 7 paragraph 8 of the Bill, is not such as to m
defaulterit application of additional p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny through the affirmative procedure.

defaultIntroduction
default189.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPermit schemes are designed to control the carrying out of specified works in the area covered by the scheme. Permit schemes cover both street works and works carried out by the local highway authority. A permit must be sought from the relevant local authority for works which are to be carried out in a street covered by a permit scheme. Currently, permit schemes prepared by local highway authorities in England must, before they are implemented, be submitted to the Secretary of State for approval and given effect to by an 
defaultorder
default made by the Secretary of State. This clause removes the requirement that the Secretary of State must approve and give effect to a permit scheme by 
defaultorder
default.
default&#xa0;
default190.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPart 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 provides for permit schemes. Section 34 concerns the implementation of local highway authority permit schemes. Section 34(2) provides 
default(in relation to England) 
defaultthat a permit scheme, previously submitted to the Secretary of State for approval, may be approved with or without modifications. Section 34(4) provides that a permit scheme shall not have effect unless the 
defaultSecretary of State
default gives effect to it by 
defaultorder
default.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default191.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe changes made by the Bill provide local highway authorities with a new power to give effect to permit schemes by order. The new power is exercisable in relation to 
defaultEngland only.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default192.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause, by the insertion of Part 1 of 
defaultSchedule
default 8 to the Bill makes certain amendments to Part 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004. A new section 33A (Implementation of local highway authority permit schemes: England) is inserted into Part 3 and replaces the requirement for the Secretary of State to give effect to a local highway authority permit scheme, by requiring that the local highway authority give effect by 
defaultorder
default to a permit scheme in its area. 
defaultThe authority can also vary or revoke a permit scheme by order. 
defaultSuch an 
defaultorder
default will be a local council 
defaultorder
default, which will not be a statutory instrument.  Accordingly, local highway authorities will be able to prepare and give effect to their own permit schemes.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default193.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe requirement for the Secretary of State to approve permit schemes is no longer required, given the generally high quality and consistency of such schemes. Providing local highway authorities with the ability to prepare and approve their own schemes is consistent with the principles of localism and removes an additional and unnecessary administrative layer which has resource considerations for the Secretary of State and local highway authorities. As local highway authorities will, in accordance with the 
defaultclause, prepare their own permit schemes it is entirely logical that they give effect to such schemes, as the Secretary of State will no longer have an approval role. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny
default194.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 39(2) of the Traffic Management Act provides for the Secretary of State’s current power to make an 
defaultorder
default giving effect to a permit 
defaultscheme  to
default be exercisable by statutory instrument. No parliamentary process is prescribed for such 
defaultorder
defaults and accordingly they are not laid before Parliament. Accordingly, although permit schemes will no longer be brought into effect by statutory instr
defaultument as there is currently no p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny of 
defaultorder
defaults made by the Secretary of State, the proposed ch
defaultange will not reduce or weaken p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny. Permit schemes will still be evidenced by a formal a
defaultdministrative decision but the d
defaultepartment considers that process should be placed in the hands of the authority that prepares and is to operate a permit scheme.

defaultIntroduction
default195.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently the Secretary of State has powers under section 90B of the Highways Act 1980 (
default“
defaultHA 1980
default”
default) to construct road humps. Local authorities also have these powers, by virtue of section 90A of the HA 1980. Paragraph 10 of 
defaultSchedule
default 8 removes the Secretary of State’s powers. These powers are no longer necessary because in practice the construction of road humps is undertaken by local authorities.
default&#xa0;
default196.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 90C of the HA 1980 sets down consultation requirements where there is a proposal to construct a road hump under section 90A or 90B (now to be repealed).  Section 90C(1) currently provides that there must be consultation with the chief officer of police and such other persons or bodies as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. These consultation requirements are amended by paragraph 11(2) of 
defaultSchedule
default 8. The reference to consultation with the chief officer of police is removed and the Secretary of State’s power to prescribe 
defaultconsultees
default expanded in consequence to cover any persons or bodies (
defaultie
default including the chief officer of police).
default197.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 90C also sets out requirements about the publication of notices and the procedures for dealing with objections. There is an existing delegated power in the form of section 90C(5) of the HA 1980 which provides that, where, as the result of the receipt of objections, a local inquiry is held, provisions in the Local Government Act 1972 apply, but with such modifications as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.  The requirements about publicity and procedures for dealing with objections are amended by paragraph 11(3) of 
defaultSchedule
default 8.  They are replaced with a power for the Secretary of State to specify in regulations the requirements about publicity and procedures for dealing with objections.  This power includes the power to apply the relevant provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 about inquiries and to do so with specified modifications.
default198.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 90D provides that the Secretary of State may by regulations make such provision in relation to the construction and maintenance of road humps as appears appropriate – for example, regulations about the size and maintenance of road humps etc. 
default199.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 325 of the HA 1980 provides that powers to make regulations are 
defaultexercisable
default by statutory instrument and that an instrument containing regulations under section 90C or 90D is subject to the negative resolution procedure.
default&#xa0;
default200.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese powers are exercisable in relation to England and Wales. 
defaultThe department is
default giving further consideration to whether it is appropriate for the changes to apply in relation to Wales.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of the provision
default201.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments of section 90C made by paragraph 11(3) have the effect of enabling secondary legislation to make provision about matters which are currently prescribed (in the main) in primary legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default202.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is now considered more appropriate to make provision in secondary legislation, as opposed to on the face of the HA 1980, about the publicity requirements and the requirements for dealing with objections where there is a proposal to construct a road hump. This will give the flexibility to revise the requirements from time to time, including 
defaultto take
default account of developments in methods of communications.  At the moment, section 
default90C(
default2) provides for publication of a notice in one or more newspapers circulating in the area of the highway authority and at appropriate points on the highway.  Alternative or additional and more advanced methods of giving publicity to the proposal may in future be considered to be appropriate.  Similar provisions relating to traffic calming matters are made using secondary legislation.  This is an opportunity to standardise the procedure.   
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny
default203.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs with the existing regulation making powers conferred by sections 90C and 90D of the HA 1980, it is considered appropriate for the new regulation making power being substituted into section 
default90C(
default2) of the HA 1980 to be subject to the negative resolution procedure.  It is a narrow power, concerned with detailed procedural points, where specialist traffic management knowledge and expertise may be required.  The negative resolution procedure is regarded as the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny.

default205.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSections 45 and 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 allow the Secretary of State to make provision by regulations for the examination of vehicles submitted for roadworthiness testing. In the case of section 45 these are any vehicles other than prescribed classes of goods vehicles and in the case of section 49 are prescribed classes of goods vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default206.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSections 46 and 51 provide for what may in particular be made by regulations under sections 45 and 49 respectively.

defaultParagraph 16(2) to (4) amends section 46 and paragraph 17(2) to (4) amend section 51. 
default&#xa0;
default209.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParagraphs 16(2) and 17(2) allow provision to be made for charges to be paid to the Secretary of State by those occupying premises which are designated as stations for the roadworthiness testing of vehicles; namely, public service vehicles (i.e. buses and coaches carrying paying passengers) in the case of paragraph 16(2) and prescribed 
defaultclasses of goods vehicles (i.e. those over 3.5 tonnes) in the case of paragraph 17(2). 
default&#xa0;
default210.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe charges may be in connection with the Secretary of State’s provision of vehicle examiners; the issue of test certificates or notifications of the refusal of test certificates; the issue of duplicate or copy test certificates and the correction of errors in test certificates. 
default&#xa0;
default211.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParagraphs 16(3) and (4) and 17(3) allow provision to be made for the occupiers of vehicle testing stations (for public service vehicles in the case of paragraph 16(3) and (4) and for prescribed classes of goods vehicles in the case of paragraph 17(3)) to keep registers of test certificates in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars, for the inspection of those registers by prescribed persons in prescribed circumstances and for occupiers of such stations to keep records and provide returns and information to the Secretary of State.
default&#xa0;
default212.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParagraph 17(4) allows, in relation to the roadworthiness testing of goods vehicles, provision to be made to require amounts in respect of charges in connection with the Secretary of State’s provision of vehicle examiners, the issue of test certificates or notifications of t
defaulthe refusal of test certificates, 
defaultthe issue of duplicate or copy test certificates or the correction of errors in test certificates to be paid to the Secretary of State on account and to allow the repayment of such amounts in prescribed circumstances. This paragraph also amends section 51 to allow provision to be made requiring payment 
defaultto 
defaultthe Secretary of State of charges for the supply of forms for test certificates and notifications of refusal of test certificates and to allow the repayment of such charges in prescribed circumstances.  
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default213.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultParagraph 16(2) to (4) expands the existing powers to make regulations under sections 45 and 46 and paragraph 17(2)
default 
defaultto (4) expands the existing regulation-making powers in sections 49 and 51. The department continues to consider that the power to make provision by regulation for the examination of vehicles submitted for roadworthiness testing should be delegated to the Secretary of State. The detail of such provisions is more appropriate to secondary legislation. There is also likely to be a need to amend such provisions and make further provision from time to time which would be less conveniently achieved if contained in primary legislation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of p

default214.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe negative resolution procedure applies, by virtue of section 195(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, to the existing powers to make regulations under sections 45 and 46 and 49 and 51 and the department continues to believe that this i
defaults appropriate. There 
defaultshould be p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny as the new powers extend to matters which include charging but these are not so significant as to merit the affirmative procedure.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe principal benefit of Part 6 will be to reduce the resources required by

defaultin processing exemption applications to their conclusions.  This is because the resources needed to produce an administrative 
defaultorder
default will be less than those required for preparing a statutory instrument and taking it through the parliamentary scrutiny process. The change will also save parliamentary time. In addition the

defaultexpects there to be a small benefit to applicants from the change by speeding up the process, so giving a decision sooner.

defaultThe scope of RVAR has been reduced since a similar proposal was made in the past (see below), such that they no longer apply to rail vehicles that are subject instead to EU accessibility rules. These rules require new, upgraded or renewed vehicles to comply with the technical specifications for interoperability for persons with reduced mobility (PRM TSI). The EU accessibility regime applies to mainline services, i.e. the majority of train services. RVAR now applies only to a minority (approximately one quarter) of rail vehicles – mostly light rail such as tramways, metros and underground. The two regulatory regimes have similar technical requirements.
default221.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EU accessibility regime is implemented in the UK by the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011. One difference between the two regimes is that exemptions from RVAR are made by statutory instrument, while exemptions from the PRM TSI can 
defaultby
default made in Great Britain by the Secretary of State making an administrative determination, subject in some cases to the approval of the European Commission – see regulation 14 of the 2011 Regulations. Removing the requirement for RVAR exemption 
defaultorder
defaults to be made by statutory instrument will therefore bring the light rail regime more in line with the EU regime, which we believe is more proportionate, particularly given that other safeguards will remain.
default222.

defaultThe requirement in the Equality Act 2010 for the Secretary of State to consult the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC
default) before granting an exemption is unchanged, as is the requirement for him to make an Annual Report to Parliament on the use of the exemption powers.  
defaultThe department
default believe
defaults
default that DPTAC’s continued involvement in considering the merits of each application will ensure that the needs of disabled people are given appropriate weight, while the Annual Report will allow Parliament to consider whether the powers had been used excessively in the past year and call Ministers to account if it so wished.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultdepartment
default made clear during consultation that there would be no reduction in the strength of argument required before an exemption was granted.  More background information about the proposal is set out in the 
defaultdepartment
default’s March 2013 consultation, which can be found with a summary of the consultation responses at:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA large majority of those who responded to the consultation supported the proposal, including DPTAC.
default&#xa0;
default225.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA similar proposal was made when the Disability Discrimination Bill was considered by Parliament before it became the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. That similar proposal was considered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Committee recommended that the proposal was not enacted - see paragraph 9 of the Committee’s Fourth Report for the Session 2004-5. In the end the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 amended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 maintaining the requirement for parliamentary scrutiny in all circumstances, with the procedure being either the negative or affirmative procedure. The rail vehicle accessibility provisions of Disability Discrimination Acts, without significant further change, were re-enacted in the Equality Act 2010.
default&#xa0;
default226.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn its Fourth Report for the Session 2004-5 the Committee was concerned about the lack of evidence to support the proposal – see paragraph 7. The 
defaultdepartment 
defaultnow considers that it does have sufficient evidence and in particular points to the improved efficiency in public administration and the predominately supportive responses to the proposal following the recent consultation. An impact assessment for this measure will be available before introduction of the Bill to Parliament.  The 
defaultdepartment 
defaultalso believes that the large reduction in the scope of RVAR that has taken place since th
defaulte proposal was first considered
default justifies looking at this issue again.

default227.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause provides the Secretary of State with an additional method for changing the model clauses for petroleum licences.
default&#xa0;
default228.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 2 of the Petroleum Act 1998 (a Consolidation Act) provides that Her Majesty has the exclusive right of searching for and boring and getting petroleum which exists in its natural condition in strata in Great Britain. Her Majesty has similar rights in respect of petroleum in areas of the UK which are outside territorial waters, by virtue of section 1(1) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964. Section 3 of the 1998 Act authorises the Secretary of State, acting on behalf of Her Majesty, to grant licences to others to bore for and get the petroleum referred to in both Acts. 
default&#xa0;
default229.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 4 of the 1998 Act places a duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations concerning various aspects of petroleum licences, such as the content and procedure for licence applications, licence fees, the areas in respect of which applications can be made and model clauses to be incorporated in licences. Regulations made under section 4 are subject to the negative resolution procedure.
default&#xa0;
default230.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe model clauses set out in regulations must be included in licences unless the Secretary of State thinks that they should be modified or excluded in any particular case. The model clauses have been amended over time, and so petroleum licences issued at different times contain different clauses. The model clauses for all licences granted before 5th March 2004 can be found in consolidated form in the Petroleum (Current Model Clauses) 
defaultOrder
default 1999 (S.I. 1999/160) and in  the Petroleum (Production) (Landward Areas) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/1436). The model clauses for more recently issued licences are contained in, or determined by reference to, regulations made in S.I. 2004/352, 2006/784, 2008/225, 2009/2814 and 2009/3283.

default232.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause amends section 4 of the 1998 Act in respect of the duty to make model clauses. It removes the current duty, in paragraph (1)(e), to prescribe model clauses in regulations and replaces it with new subsections (2A), (2B) and (2C) which provide that the Secretary of State must still prescribe model clauses, but may do so either in regulations or in a published document. 
default&#xa0;
default233.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhere the duty is discharged by prescribing model clauses in regulations, the negative resolution procedure will continue to used, by virtue of section 4(3) of the 1998 Act as amended by subsection (5) of the clause. Where the duty is discharged by prescribing m
defaultodel clauses in a document, no p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny procedure would apply.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default234.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe power to determine the terms of petroleum licences has been a delegated power since the introduction of petroleum licensing in the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934. The department continues to consider that it is appropriate to delegate this power to the Secretary of State. It enables the licensor to set new terms of licences which reflect the most up-to-date technical and commercial practices, where a need to use primary legislation would inevitably lead to delay and difficulty in keeping up with developments. It is a common feature of all regulated industries for the regulator – in this case the Secretary of State – to be given the power to determine the conditions of licences.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny
default235.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department considers that although the model clauses of petroleum licences are important, 
defaultthey are not so important that p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny is required in respect of all changes to them. The grant of an energy licence is an administrative act, and the model clauses do not set out matters that have proved to be controversial or of wider interest.
default&#xa0;
default236.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe generally more controversial aspects of petroleum extraction are regulated in other ways – through health and safety legislation, through environmental regulation, through the planning system and through the tax regime. The relevant regimes are set out in primary and secondary legislation 
defaultwith the appropriate degree of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny. 
default&#xa0;
default237.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a result, the department does not consider that the additional cost, procedural hurdles and occup
defaultation of p
defaultarliamentary time associated with the making of statutory instruments are appropriate in every case; the amendments will enable the Secretary of State to act more swiftly where necessary, and at lower overall cost to the public purse. They will also make it easier for the Secretary of State to publish fully consolidated copies of the model clauses with greater regularity – the resources required to make consolidating statutory instruments, and the costs associated with making large instruments, currently act as a disincentive to regular consolidation exercises. 
default&#xa0;
default238.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments will allow the Secretary of State to include model clauses in regulations, using the negative resolution procedure, wherever it is considered appropriate because the changes are controversial or because they implement a significant change of policy. It is very difficult to predict at this stage when changes to model clauses will fall on one side of the line or the other when assessing how significant they are. But the department anticipates that it will be clearer when individual issues are being considered whether model clauses ought to be prescribed in regulations, taking into account consultat
defaultion responses and the level of p
defaultarliamentary interest at the time. Where minor and technical amendments are being made, publication in a document is likely to be the preferable procedure.

defaultIntroduction
default239.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Environmental Protection Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”) enables a waste collection authority (“a WCA”) by notice to require the occupier of premises to place household waste for collection in receptacles of a kind and number specified (section 46). Failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with such requirements is an offence currently punishable with a fine of up to £1000 (section 46(6)).
default240.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs an alternative to prosecution, an authorised officer of a WCA may offer the opportunity of discharging any liability to conviction by payment of a fixed penalty (section 47ZA). The amount of such a penalty is the amount specified by the WCA in relation to its area, or, if no amount is so specified, £60 for offences in England (the ‘default’ amount). The WCA may make provision for treating the penalty as having been paid if a lesser amount is paid before the end of a specified period. The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision in connection with those powers of the WCA, and also has power by 
defaultorder
default to substitute a different amount for the ‘default’ amount (section 47ZB).
default241.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe London Local Authorities Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”) enables a London borough council to make regulations requiring occupiers of premises to place household waste for collection in receptacles of a kind and number specified (section 20). Unlike the 1990 Act, failure to comply with such requirements is not an offence, although a penalty charge is payable by any occupier of premises in respect of which there has been a failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any requirements imposed by such regulations (section 23). 
default242.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is the duty of the borough councils to set the levels of penalty charges, but they do not come into force until the Secretary of State has been notified and does not object to them on the ground that they are excessive. If, at any time before the levels of fixed penalties have come into force, the Secretary of State does consider them excessive, the Secretary of State may make regulations setting the levels of fixed penalties (sections 66 and 67). 
default243.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to appeals, section 62 provides that the Lord Chancellor has the power to make provision by regulations relating to an appeal to an adjudicator if a person’s representations to a borough council are not accepted. No such regulations have yet been made, and section 62 goes on to provide that, until such time as regulations are in force, any regulations under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to representations, appeals and adjudicators as if made under the corresponding provisions of the 2007 Act.
default&#xa0;
default244.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe delegated powers conferred by the clause and Schedule are exercisable in relation to 
defaultEngland only.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default245.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause amends the 1990 Act to remove, in England, the criminal offence under section 46(6). In place of the fixed penalty system available as an alternative to prosecution, this clause also introduces, in England, a more proportionate sanction for non-compliance, by making provision for the imposition
default of a fixed monetary penalty in 
defaultcases where a specified threshold is reached and procedural safeguards have been met. The amount of such a penalty is the amount specified by the WCA in relation to its area (new section 
default46B(
default1)(a)), or, if no amount is so specified, £60 (new section 46B(1)(b)). A WCA may make provision for treating a fixed penalty as having been paid if a lesser amount is paid before the end of a period specified by the authority (new section 46B(2)).
default&#xa0;
default246.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of the amendments to the 1990 Act, this clause confers on the Secretary of State the power, by regulations, to make provision in connection with the powers conferred on waste collection authorities under new section 46B(1)(a) and (2) (new section 46B(3)). In particular, such regulations may require an amount specified by the WCA to fall within a range prescribed in the regulations, and may restrict the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, a WCA can make provision under new section 
default46B(
default2). The amendments made by this clause also confer on the Secretary of State the power, by 
defaultorder
default, to substitute a different amount for the amount for the time being specified in subsection (1)(b) (i.e. the ‘default’ amount) (new section 46B(5)). 
default247.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause and 
defaultSchedule
default 10 amend the 2007 Act for the purposes of ensuring a degree of consistency between the penalty systems relating to household waste under the 1990 Act and the 2007 Act. 
default&#xa0;
default248.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments provide that a London borough council may require a person to pay a penalty charge for a failure to comply with requirements (imposed by regulations made under section 20(1)) relating to household waste receptacles (new section 20A). It is the duty of the borough councils to set the levels of penalty charges payable to them under section 20A (new section 
default20B(
default1)), and the borough councils may make provision for treating a penalty charge as having been paid if a lesser amount is received by the relevant council before the end of a period specified by the borough councils (new section 20B(3)).
default&#xa0;
default249.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNew section 20B(4) confers on the Secretary of State the power, by regulations, to make provision in connection with the functions conferred on the borough councils under new subsection 20B(1) and (3). In particular, such regulations may require the levels of penalty charges to fall within a range prescribed in the regulations, and may restrict the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, the borough councils can make provision under subsection (3).
default250.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNew section 20D makes provision relating to appeals against decisions to impose penalty charges. These extend the existing system of appeals provided for by the 2007 Act to the revised penalty charge system provided for by this clause. Subsection (1) 
defaultconfers on the Lord Chancellor power to include in regulations made under the existing power in section 62(2) provision relating to appeals to an adjudicator against a decision under section 20A to require a person to pay a penalty charge. Subsection (2) confers on the Secretary of State a power, exercisable by regulations, to prescribe modifications to the application of regulations under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 in relation to appeals against decisions to impose penalty charges  (subsection (2) applies regulations under section 80 until such time as regulations made by the Lord Chancellor are in force).
defaultJu
defaultstification of the delegation
default251.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendments to the 1990 Act conferring power to make provision in connection with the powers conferred on WCAs in England in relation to
default the amount of any penalty and 
defaultto make provi
defaultsion for early payment, and to 
defaultamend the ‘default’ amount, give the Secretary of State 
defaultpowers
default which are similar to those currently provided for by the 1990 Act. These powers enable the Secretary of State to exercise a degree of control over the amount of any fixed penalty that a WCA may impose (for example, by setting a range into which any fixed penalty must fall). The department considers it appropriate to continue the Secretary of State’s ability to exercise a degree of control over the amount of any fixed penalty that a WCA may impose under the new system of fixed penalties – this also enables the amounts to be “future proofed” to an extent, without the need for primary legislation when the amounts need to be changed. In 
defaultorder
default to enable a degree of consistency between the penalty levels and systems under the 1990 Act and the 2007 Act, the department considers that it is also appropriate to give the Secretary of State similar powers under the 2007 Act to make provision in connection with the powers conferred on London borough councils in relation t
defaulto the amount of any penalty and
default to make provision for early payment (there is no ‘default’ amount in the 2007 Act).
default252.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe department considers that the powers conferred on the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State in relation to appeals under the 2007 Act are a necessary consequence of extending the existing appeals system to take account of the amendments made by this clause. The Lord Chancellor already has power to make provision by regulations relating to appeals (section 62), and this power is extended to enable the revised penalty charge provision introduced by this clause to work properly within the existing appeal structure set out in the 2007 Act. Similarly, the amendments made by this clause to apply (until such time as regulations made by the Lord Chancellor are in force) regulations under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 in relation to appeals continues the existing approach taken by the 2007 Act; the department considers that the additional power conferred to enable the Secretary of State to prescribe modifications to those regulations is necessary to ensure that the application of such regulations works properly.
defaultJustification of the level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny
default253.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll the powers conferred by this clause and 
defaultSchedule
default 10 are to be exercised by statutory instrument subject to negative procedure (in relation to the 1990 Act, by virtue of section 161 of that Act; in relation to the 2007 Act, by virtue of section 82 of that Act). 
default&#xa0;
default254.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe powers conferred by way of amendment to the 1990 Act relate to the setting of amounts for fixed penalties rather than the circumstances in which fixed penalties may be imposed. They replace similar powers which were subject to negative procedure. Given the limited scope of the powers, the department considers that it is appropriate for their exercise to be subject to negative procedure (the similar powers which are replaced were also subject to negative procedure). 
default&#xa0;
default255.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to the powers conferred by way of amendment to the 2007 Act, the power of the Lord Chancellor exercisable under section 62(2) of that Act (relating to appeals) is already exercisable by way of negative procedure, so an extension of that power by virtue of the new section 
default20D(
default1) of that Act to cover different circumstances should, in the department’s view, be similarly dealt with. The power of the Secretary of State under new section 20B(4) relates to the setting of amounts for fixed penalties rather than the circumstances in which those penalties may be imposed and, as with the changes to the 1990 Act, the department considers that it is appropriate for the exercise of such power to be subject to negative procedure. The power of the Secretary of State to make modifications to the applicability of regulations made under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 is something which, as a consequential and technical provision, the department considers is suitably scrutinised by means of negative procedure.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause loosens the precondition applying before Ministers may make an 
defaultorder
default under section 10 of the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932.  By 
defaultsection 1 of that Act, Ministers are currently empowered to prohibit, or control by licensing, the importation into, and keeping within, Great Britain of musk rats.  By section 10(1) of the Act, Ministers are currently further empowered to make any such 
defaultorder
default as they are capable of making with respect to musk rats so as to apply with respect to any other non-indigenous mammalian species – but only where Ministers are satisfied that by reason of their destructive habits “it is desirable to prohibit or control the importation or keeping of them and to destroy any which may be at large”.
default&#xa0;
defaultDevolution
default&#xa0;
default257.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese powers are exercisable in relation to England and Wales. This area is devolved to Wales. The amendments affect the existing powers of both the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers. The department is discussing the need for a legislative consent 
defaultmotion  with
default the devolved administration.

defaultThe effect of the 
defaultprovision
default&#xa0;
default258.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe provision contained in paragraph 1(2) of 
defaultSchedule
default 11 of the Bill now dilutes the precondition that Ministers must first be satisfied that any members at large (of a species in respect of which they propose to make an 
defaultorder
default under section 10(1)) should be destroyed. By virtue of the amendment, it is, in the alternative, sufficient for Ministers to “
defaultkeep under review whether any which may be at large should be destroyed”.
default&#xa0;
default259.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdditionally, the provision
default (a new s.10(1A))
default contained in paragraph 1(3) of 
defaultSchedule
default 11 now 
defaultensures beyond all doubt that
default the power to make an 
defaultorder
default under section 10(1)
default 
defaultalso includes the power to revoke or amend such an 
defaultorder
default. Doubt as to this had arisen because, in relation to Acts passed after 1889 but before the commencement of the Interpretation Act 1978, the power under section 14 of that Act to revoke, amend or re-enact instruments only extended to rules, regulations and bye-laws (see paragraph 3 of 
defaultSchedule
default 2 to that Act).  Section 10(1) DIAA contains an 
defaultorder
default-making power, so is not expressly caught by section 14.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the delegation
default&#xa0;
default260.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe delegated power already exists; but the precondition to its use has been slightly loosened so that it refers to the 
defaultorder
default-maker being satisfied that it is desirable 
defaulteither
default to destroy any animals of the

defaultSection 14(4) currently requires maintained schools

default For that reason, it is considered appropriate to revoke the current requirements in section 14(4) of the Education Act 2005.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause allows Criminal Procedure Rules, made under sections 69 and 72 of the Courts Act 2003, (
defaulti
default) to extend the period during which a party to criminal proceedings may object to another party using the written statement of a witness, instead of calling the witness to give evidence in person; and (ii) to provide the supplementary procedure where a written statement is used.
default&#xa0;
default275.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 provides that in criminal proceedings the written statement of a witness shall be ‘admissible as evidence to the like extent as oral evidence to the like effect by that person’, if the conditions listed in that section are met. The conditions include requirements for a declaration by the witness, for signature by the witness, for the way in which the written statement must be delivered to (in the language of the Act, be ‘served on’) the other parties, for the way in which it must be presented to the court and, crucially, a requirement that none of those on whom the statement has been served has objected within 7 days. The section applies equally to prosecution and defence witnesses. In practice, it is the most commonly encountered provision by which evidence other than oral testimony is admitted in criminal proceedings. This clause amends that section.

default&#xa0;
default277.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe amendment made by clause 36(3) means that, where a written statement is served, other parties will never have less than the current 7 days in which to object, but Criminal Procedure Rules will be able to extend that period, in specified circumstances or generally. The point of allowing for a longer period is to remove any perceived need to enter a ‘holding’ objection, so as to keep the objector’s options open while they assess the statement. Objections can be withdrawn before the trial takes place, but experience demonstrates that that often is overlooked, with the result that witnesses attend court 
defaultwhen they need not have done. A longer time limit for objection would remove the need to object just out of caution.
default&#xa0;
default278.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCriminal Procedure Rules already provide generally for the content and service of documents in criminal proceedings, and for the way in which evidence and other material is presented to the court. Section 9 of the 1967 Act, passed long before the Criminal Procedure Rules first came into force in 2005, contains procedural requirements that constrain what the Rules can provide in relation to written witness statements. The repeals made by clause 36(4) mean that the Rules will be able to 
defaultprovide  the
default necessary supplementary procedure.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause allows Criminal Procedure Rules, made under sections 69 and 72 of the Courts Act 2003, to dispense with the present requirement for written material to be read aloud to magistrates where the defendant pleads guilty without attending court and where the magistrates can read the documents for themselves.
default&#xa0;
default282.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSections 12 and 12A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 allow a defendant to plead guilty in writing without attending court. The procedure can be used only for comparatively minor offences, and only where certain procedural requirements have been met. The procedure is widely used in minor road traffic cases and for TV licence evasion, for example. Even though the parties are absent and the court deals with the case on the papers, section 12 requires the prosecution case and the defence representations to be read aloud to the magistrates.

default need be read aloud, and in what circumstances. Though the parties themselves are absent, the proceedings are still a trial and members of the public may be present. The point of allowing rules to dispense with some or all of the current requirements is so that they can provide for the prompt and efficient disposal of court business in a way that is consistent with the defendant’s right to a fair trial and with the principles of open justice.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause provides for regulations to be made which will enable a wider range of organisations to be authorised to manage Child Trust Funds (“CTFs”) held by certain looked after children.
default&#xa0;
default295.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA CTF is a tax advantaged savings account held by an eligible child into which money up to a specified amount can be invested each year.  Until the account holder attains the age of 16, CTFs are managed on their behalf by a “registered contact” (for example, a person with parental responsibility for the account holder).  Special arrangements are set out in legislation for the management of CTFs held by certain looked after children.
default&#xa0;
default296.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 3(10) of the Child Trust Funds Act 2004 (“the Act”) provides that the Treasury may, by regulations, authorise the Official Solicitor (in England and Wales or Northern Ireland) or the Accountant of Court (in Scotland) to manage the CTFs of certain children.  Under the Child Trust Funds Regulations 2004 (“the CTF Regulations”) these persons are authorised to manage the CTFs of certain children who are looked after by local authorities, until someone with parental responsibility assumes that role or the child reaches the age of 16 and can personally manage their own account.
default&#xa0;
default297.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection 16 of the Act enables regulations to be made requiring local authorities to provide certain information relating to a child to HMRC, where the child is in, or enters, the care of the local authority.  This power has been used to make regulation 33A of the CTF Regulations which provides for the circumstances in which the Official Solicitor or Accountant of Court is to have authority to manage the accounts of looked after children notified by local authorities to HMRC.

default CTFs for looked after children
default may be similar
default to
default those in place for the Junior ISA accounts of certain looked after children, which are managed by an authorised third sector organisation under an agreement with the Department for Education.
default&#xa0;
default300.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, this clause amends section 16 of the Act (information about children in care of authority) so that regulations may place a requirement on local authorities to 
defaultprovide information relating to certain looked after children directly to the person so appointed by the Treasury or the Secretary of State for the purposes of facilitating the management of such CTFs.

These same powers, once amended by this clause, will enable regulations to be made by the Treasury which (
defaulti

Other than in specified circumstances concerning a child’s eligibility for CTF or payments to a child’s account, all regulations making provision of an administrative nature, such as management of accounts or provision of information, are made by negative procedure.  Further regulations made under the powers to be amended by this clause will continue to be subject to the negative procedure and the Treasury considers that the negative procedure continues to provide the appropriate degree of scrutiny.

defaultThis clause amends the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 so that the powers to make secondary legislation wherever they appear in that Act can be exercised so as to provide for a reference in the legislation to an international agreement to be interpreted as a

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current practice of implementing international maritime 
defaultconventions,
default and regular changes to them, by means of a mixture of primary legislation and secondary legislation has resulted in a complex regulatory structure that is confusing to industry and the regulator alike. It is also time consuming and resource intensive, leading to delays in implementation – which in turn can result in ships being challenged during inspections in foreign ports leading to delays and inconvenience to UK ships.
default&#xa0;
default305.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe clause has been designed to address these issues by making it possible to streamline the incorporation of the provisions of international maritime conventions so that, where it is considered appropriate to do so, the government would not need to make further secondary legislation or publish any other regulatory document in 
defaultorder
default to give effect to changes to international obligations and standards; changes to the text of an international agreement would be automatically incorporated into UK law in the circumstances specified in the secondary legislation.

defaultThe principle of allowing ambulatory references in legislation is now well established most notably in paragraph 1A(1) which was added to 
defaultSchedule
default 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 by section 28 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.

defaultInternational instruments in the marine sector such as SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) are often of a highly technical nature specifying standards of construction, equipment and procedures that must be complied with.  
defaultBecause of the international nature of shipping operations once the provision come into force they must be complied with by the UK shipping industry where it operates in the territorial waters of a signatory country, irrespective of whether the UK has incorporated the relevant requirements into its domestic law.  In addition once the UK has become a party to an international instrument which has come into force it is under an obligation to apply the terms of that instrument both to its own ships and, usually, to ships of other nations operating within its jurisdiction.  
default&#xa0;
default310.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn some cases therefore allowing a change to an international instrument to take effect through the operation of an ambulatory reference in the manner proposed in this clause represents the most timely and cost effective method of providing certainty to the industry and allowing the UK to comply with its international obligations.

default Subsection (5) provides that secondary legislation may authorise the Secretary of State to give a direction wh

default or delaying the operation of the ambulatory provision.  
defaultSubsection (6) extends this power of direction to include 
defaultdisapplying

default 
defaultThe reason that the
defaultse
default power
defaults are
default being sought is that there may be occasions when it is necessary to delay or prevent an obligation which arises as a result of an ambulatory change from having effect 
defaultand in
default 
defaultsome cases make alternative provision
default.  Such instances are expected to be rare; an example might be where the new provision would be inconsistent with an existing EU law obligation which is likely to be the case where the EU adopts higher standards than are required by the international agreement.  
defaultIn such cases it would be important that the existing secondary legislation did not remain in force
default. 
defaultIt would of course be possible to achieve the same result by amending the secondary legislation which gives effect to the ambulatory provision.  However, this is likely to be difficult to achieve in the required timescale particularly where the instrument requires the affirmative process and 
defaultwould be inconsistent with the g
defaultovernment’s policy of reducing the number of statutory instruments required to implement the international obligations.
default&#xa0;
defaultJustification of the level of parliamentary s
defaultcrutiny
default312.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs far as the exercise of delegation conferred by the making of the ambulatory reference itself is concerned this will only be possible where there is an existing power to make secondary legislation.  The level of scrutiny appropriate to the subject matter of such legislation will have already been co
defaultnsidered by Parliament and the d
defaultepartment sees no reason why, if an ambulatory reference is to be included in such legislation
default,
default that there should be any change to the level of scrutiny.  In a number of cases, particularly where the purpose of the legislation is to incorporate changes to the text of an international instrument, the secondary legislation is subject to the affirmative procedure.  Parliament will, in almost all such most cases, have the ability to consider the instrument containing the ambulatory reference under either the negative or affirmative procedure.
default&#xa0;
default313.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a further consideration which is that in most circumstances a change to UK law taking effect as a result of the operation of the ambulatory reference will only take effect following a change to an international agreement which will have been agreed to by the UK government and which will already been notified to Parliament. The only instances where this will not be are 
defaultcases  where
default the international instrument contains a process whereby supplemental provision can be made through the issue of a code or a standard or changes can be made to the terms of the instrument through the so called tacit agreement procedure whereby a change becomes effective and binds all the signatories of the agreement once a certain number of signatories have agreed.  However, in both cases the possibility of such changes being made without the further need for the explicit approval of the UK government was already present when the decision was made to accede to the agreement so this should not of itself demand additional scrutiny.   
default&#xa0;
default314.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs already noted to the extent that the power of the Secretary of State to issue directions 
defaultunder  subsection
default (5) is novel this should not necessarily mean that any additional scrutiny is needed.  Firstly, the inclusion of the power in secondary legislation will of it
defaultself be subject to the level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny that has already been considered appropriate for the relevant secondary legislation.  Secondly, the effect of the exercise of the power will 
defaultnormally 
defaultbe to preserve the existing le
defaultgal position. As a result, the d
defaultepartment does not consider the power should be subject to any additional procedure and that the additional cost, proced
defaultural hurdles and occupation of p
defaultarliamentary time associated with the making of a statutory instruments would not be appropriate in this case; the power will enable the Secretary of State to act more swiftly where necessary, and at lower overall cost to the public purse.

defaultClause 49 confers a power on Ministers to amend legislation – primary and secondary - by statutory instrument in 
defaultorder
default to spell out dates described in it. So, for example, if a section of an Act refers to “the day on which this section comes into force”, the power would allow the actual date to be substituted, when it becomes known. The amendments to be made by secondary legislation are therefore editorial rather than substantive.
default&#xa0;

defaultThe purpose of the power is to improve the accessibility of legislation, so that those reading legislation will be able to see on the face of the legislation what the relevant dates are without having to look them up, for example by searching through commencement 
defaultorder
defaults. The power can be used on an ongoing basis, in relation to legislation passed or made after the enactment of the Bill, to replace references to commencement dates with actual dates as and when they become known, but it will also be possible to use it to amend references to commencement dates in existing legislation.

defaultThe proposed new power is not subject to any form of parliamentary procedure. This is because the amendments made using the power will not involve any substantive policy decisions but will reflect decisions made previously. Similar powers have been included in previous legislation – for example, clause 7(2) of the Offender Rehabilitation Bill introduced in the House of Lords on 9 May. This power was not subject to any form of parliamentary procedure.  The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in their Report on that Bill said “we welcome the facility introduced by clause 7(2
default)(
defaulta), as we can see some real advantages for users of legislation in the replacement of references to commencement dates” (First Report of 2013/14; HL Paper 12). Clause 22(3) of the draft Pensions Bill, published on 2 January 2013, also included a similar power, although this was ultimately dropped as it became unnecessary.

defaultIntroduction
default321.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe purpose of clause 51 is to enable a Minister of the Crown to use delegated legislation to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation – Acts of Parliament and subordinate legislation made under such Acts -  which is no longer of practical use, thus  rationalising the law. Clauses 54-56 provide safeguards for the use of the power, including the need for appropriate consultation.

defaultThe effe
defaultct of the provision
default323.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis clause is intended to provide an accessible mechanism, distinct from, but supplementary to, the Law Commission’s Statute Law (Repeals) Acts and the mechanism provided by Part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, for removing legislation which is no longer of practical use. The main reasons are likely to be one or more of the following:-
defaultJustifying the use of delegated legislation
default324.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe use of delegated, rather than primary, legislation to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation which is no longer of practical use will facilitate the removal of 
defaultsuch  legislation
default, so that the statute book can be regularly rationalised in a way which is not unduly burdensome. 
default&#xa0;
default325.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Law Commission is responsible for modernising and simplifying the statute book to make it more accessible to those who use the law. This responsibility is fulfilled through the Statute Law (Repeals) Bills which are introduced every 
defaultthere
default or four years. The Scottish Law Commission and the Northern Ireland Law Commission have a similar remit. The reasons for using the power in clause 51 to 
defaultdisapply
default  legislation which is no longer of practical use – which are indicated in paragraph 323 above - are similar to those which the Law Commission takes into account in the context of their repeals work.  However, the advantages of using clause 51 might include the following:-
defaultJustifying the level of p
defaultarliamentary scrutiny 
default326.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultdepartment
default recognises that it will be possible to use the power in a wide range of situations, and that the question of whether legislation continues to be of practical use does not invariably have an obvious answer. Therefore, the procedure sets down a number of safeguards which the Minister must observe in 
defaultorder
default to proceed. These are as follows:- 
default327.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is anticipated that each House will amend its standing 
defaultorder
defaults to deal with the procedure for reporting on draft 
defaultorder
defaults laid before Parliament under the new power. 
default&#xa0;
default328.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe procedure is considered to provide adequate safeguards and an appropriate level of scrutiny for these 
defaultorder
defaults. It is based on section 16 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and, like that section, differs in important respects from the usual form of negative procedure under which an 
defaultorder
default may be made but is subject to annulment. It provides for an 
defaultorder
default to be laid in draft. It also provides that, if a committee of either House recommends that an 
defaultorder
default in terms of the draft should not be made, the Minister will not be able to proceed with the making of the 
defaultorder
default unless the committee’s recommendation is rejected by a resolution of that House. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default329.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClauses 58 to 61 of the Bill contain two delegated powers.  The first power, in clause 59(1), enables a Minister of the Crown to specify, by 
defaultorder
default, the regulatory functions to which the duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth (clause 58) and the duty to have regard to any guidance issued (clause 60(4)) apply.  The second power, in clause 60(1), enables a Minister to issue, and from time to time revise, guidance in relation to the exercise of the growth duty.
