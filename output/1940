[normal]Carbon Capture and Storage 
[normal](CCS) is a critical 
[normal]technology with potential to make a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions from the power and industrial sectors in the UK and worldwide. CCS offers the 
[normal]opportunity
[normal] to continue to utilise fossil fuels, and enjoy the energy security benefits this brin
[normal]gs, but with vastly reduced emissions. CCS is also a critical part of meeting emissions reduction targets in a cost effective way. 
[normal]Whilst CCS is not currently competitive with other low carbon forms of generation
[normal] 
[normal]there is the potential for costs to fall si
[normal]gnificantly as deployment increases. 
[normal]Modelling in both the UK and internationally indicates it will be significantly cheaper to meet emissions reduction targets with CCS in the energy mix, rather than without. 
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, there are currently
[normal] a range of
[normal] techn
[normal]ical and economic barriers to deployment
[normal] which impede projects coming forward independently in the UK
[normal] and elsewhere
[normal]. In recognition of the 
[normal]potential of CCS
[normal], the Government has introduced a comprehensive package of financial and regulatory support designed 
[normal]to 
[normal]help 
[normal]overcome these barriers.
[normal] The Commercialisation Programme will demonstrate the full integrated CCS chain at commercial scale, proving the technology and significantly reducing the 
[normal]commercial and financial 
[normal]risks currently associated with it. The Gove
[normal]rnment’s wider policies, as set out in the CCS Roadmap, look beyond the first projects and are designed to build a strong and successful CCS industry. 
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]measures introduced by
[normal] Government 
[normal]are amongst the most 
[normal]comprehensive
[normal] anywhere in the world. 
[normal]The Gove
[normal]rnment is also
[normal] continually 
[normal]engaging with other countries worldwide
[normal] to promote CCS and learn from their experience. We are also in close dialogue 
[normal]with the industry in the UK to drive forward development and deployment of this technology.  The Government wel
[normal]comes the Committee’s investigation into Carbon Capture and Storage and 
[normal]the contribution it can make to the Government’s programmes in this area
[normal]. 
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is the Government’s evidence to the 
[normal]Energy and Climate Change
[normal] Committee
[normal]’s
[normal] inquiry into 
[normal]Carbon Capture and Storage
[normal], following a call for evidence on 
[normal]17
[normal] 
[normal]July
[normal] 2013. 
[normal]It provides an overview of the key issues and policies
[normal];
[normal] further detail is available in the various reports referenced throughout the text. 
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a chain of technologies designed to remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from power and industrial sources and transport it for safe permanent storage in saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is
[normal] th
[normal]e only technology that 
[normal]has the potential to
[normal] 
[normal]turn high carbon fuels into genuinely low carbon electricity
[normal] and to decarbonise
[normal] many
[normal] industrial activities. 
[normal]It is a technology 
[normal]that the 
[normal]Government believes could play a significant role in 
[normal]low carbon 
[normal]electricity 
[normal]gener
[normal]a
[normal]tion
[normal].
[normal] Many Governments share this view 
[normal]and 
[normal]the UK is regarded as amongst the most supportive internationally.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CCS is not a 
[normal]single, specific 
[normal]technology
[normal] as such
[normal], but 
[normal]the term instead covers several types of similar technologies 
[normal]used in each part of t
[normal]he 
[normal]CCS Chain
[normal].  T
[normal]he main variations being in the area of capture technologies which can be tailored to suit the application. Fo
[normal]r example, in the power sector
[normal] 
[normal]post-combustion capture[bold] 
[normal]involves the 
[normal]separat
[normal]ion of CO2
[normal] from the flue gasses
[normal] produced by the power station. This is the approach 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]at the 
[normal]Peterhead gas 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]project
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another approach is 
[normal]Oxyfuel combustion[bold] whereby pure oxygen is used in place of air in the combustion process to yield a flue gas of highly concentrated CO2, a
[normal]s is proposed a
[normal]t the White Rose coal project
[normal]. 
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Alternatively where Syngas
[normal] (
[normal]a mix of hydrogen, CO and CO2
[normal])
[normal] is produced 
[normal]pre-combustion capture[bold] can remove CO2 to leave a combustible fuel. Finally, concentrated CO2 may be generated as an intrinsic part of the
[normal] production process
[normal], for example in gas processing
[normal] and in these cases 
[normal]inherent separation[bold] is used. 
[normal]Further details on the variety of technologies being developed within the CCS industry are available from the Zero Emissions Platform website
[normal].
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Governmen
[normal]t
[normal] does not believe that its role
[normal] is
[normal] to direct the development of 
[normal]these separate 
[normal]technologies that underpin CCS, 
[normal]and 
[normal]therefore
[normal] we
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]adopted a technology 
[normal]neutral
[normal] 
[normal]approach to CCS with an objective to create an environment which encourages technological 
[normal]development, removes barriers to deployment and encourages development of the industry
[normal] whilst leaving choices about technologies and projects to industry
[normal]. This is evidenced in the fact that the Commercialisation Programme has selected t
[normal]w
[normal]o projects
[normal] showcasi
[normal]ng different technologies
[normal] as preferred bidders
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The development of CCS in the UK
[normal] is likely to contribute to economic growth 
[normal]as well as in the longer term facilit
[normal]ate
[normal] a competitive energy mix and the cost effective achievement of climate change objectives. 
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We estimate that t
[normal]he 
[normal]deployment 
[normal]of commercial scale CCS projects could 
[normal]sustain 
[normal]4,000 – 8,000 jobs by 2020 in areas badly in need of growth. 
[normal] 
[normal]Public investment by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government through the CCS 
[normal]Commercialisation
[normal] Programme
[normal] will lever further private sector investment
[normal] in these projects
[normal].  
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]More broadly the 
[normal]availability
[normal] 
[normal]of CCS 
[normal]to enable
[normal] commercially deployable low carbon source
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]power 
[normal]generation is expected to secur
[normal]e
[normal] a
[normal] low-carbon energy mix, and reach our climate change targets in the most efficient manner. The E
[normal]nergy 
[normal]T
[normal]echnologies 
[normal]I
[normal]nstitute (ETI)
[normal] estimate
[normal] that successfully deploying CCS could cut the annual cost of meeting our carbon targe
[normal]ts by 
[normal]£32bn or 
[normal]up to 1% of G
[normal]DP by 2050.
[normal] 
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Having a diverse low carbon energy mix, including CCS, has further benefits including enhanced robustness of the electricity system, energy security benefits and increased 
[normal]competition between generators to the benefit of consumers
[normal].
[normal] CCS also of
[normal]fers the potential for flexible generation, 
[normal]especially important in a future low carbon mix dom
[normal]inated by inflexible 
[normal]or intermittent generation
[normal], and the opportunity to continue to utilise indigenous fossil fuel resources in the UK. 
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]CCS is also the only way for several important industrial sectors such as cement, steel and ceramics to decarbonise and is therefore likely to become critical to their competitiveness 
[normal]as those industries decarbonise
[normal]. That is why BIS and DECC are working wi
[normal]th academics and industry on a technoeconomic study in this important area to inform policy and financing regimes for industrial CCS. 
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is expected to be a strong global demand for CCS, with the I
[normal]nternational 
[normal]E
[normal]nergy 
[normal]A
[normal]gency (IEA)
[normal] estimating 
[normal]CCS
[normal] 
[normal]will co
[normal]ntribute one sixth of CO2 emission reductions required in 2050
[normal]. As an early leader, the UK CCS industry could export their expertise worldwide to the benefit of the UK economy. Research in this area
[normal] noted particular UK expertise in project management, en
[normal]gineering and financial and legal sectors. Further, the Technology Innovation Needs Assessment (TINA) estimated that CCS innovation could help create a UK industry with the potential to contribute further economic value of £3-16bn to 2050
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]could play a
[normal]n important
[normal] role 
[normal]in 
[normal]avoiding
[normal] dangerous climate change
[normal], especially if it is successfully 
[normal]deployed 
[normal]across the world.   
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Global energy-related CO2 emissions continue to rise. In 2011 they increased by 3.2%, reaching a 
[normal]recor
[normal]d high of 31.2 gigatonnes
[normal], by far the largest source of global GHG emissions
[normal]. The continued expansion of fossil fuel generating capacity over recent years, despite strong advances in clean energy technologies worldwide, means that fossil fuels will inevit
[normal]ably play a role in energy generation for many decades to come. 
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]CCS offers 
[normal]the potential to reduce
[normal] the emissions associated with this fossil fuel use. A power plant with CCS could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to an equivalent plant without CCS
[normal]. The IEA projects that CCS could contribute 14% of the total emiss
[normal]ion reductions through to 2050 in their 2°C scenario
[normal].
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As is the case in the UK, CCS is currently the only large-scale mitigation option 
[normal]that could potentially
[normal] make deep reductions in global emissions from industrial sectors 
[normal]which 
[normal]represent one-fifth of to
[normal]tal global CO2 emissions and 
[normal]which are
[normal] 
[normal]projected to grow over the coming decades. The IEA estimate that almost half (45%) 
[normal]of the CO2 captured between 2015 and 2050 
[normal]will need to come from industrial applications and 
[normal]conclude 
[normal]that “Failure to utilize CCS tec
[normal]hnology in industrial applications poses a significant threat to world capacity to tackle climate change” 
[normal](
[normal]IEA 2013 p8
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As long as fossil fuels and carbon-intensive industries play dominant roles in 
[normal]the global economy
[normal], CCS will be
[normal] a
[normal] critical
[normal] carbon abatement technology
[normal]. It
[normal] i
[normal]s also a cost effective solution, the IEA estimates that without CCS the cost of meeting a 50% global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 will be 70% higher
[normal]. Investing in CCS research, development and innovation now will p
[normal]lay an important role in reducing the costs of CCS around the world by developing cheaper and more efficient technologies and components, and contributing to characteri
[normal]s
[normal]ing storage sites.
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The benefits of CCS are therefore significant, not just for the UK b
[normal]ut for also for wider global efforts to prevent dangerous climate change. However, there are a number of barriers which have prevented widespread private sector deployment of the technology to date. 
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The individual components of the 
[normal]CCS chain 
[normal]use established technologies
[normal]. For example there is in excess of 6,000km of onshore CO2 pipelines in the USA
[normal] and CO2 has also been safely transported to stores offshore in Norway, with over 1MtCO2 stored per annum in Sleipner
[normal]. There is, however,
[normal] limited experience in full-chain CCS projects 
[normal]as there are
[normal] no large scale integrated CCS projects on power stations 
[normal]operational to date (although some are in advanced stages of construction)
[normal]. 
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Integration of the full chain at commercial scale presents bot
[normal]h technical and commercial challenges. For example
[normal], 
[normal]scaling up CO2 capture
[normal] technology
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]the technical and 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]risks with 
[normal]the characterisation
[normal] 
[normal]and proving 
[normal]of 
[normal]CO2 stores
[normal];
[normal] and commercial risks around novel business structures. 
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The novelty of integration and scaling up means that first-of-a-kind full chain CCS projects 
[normal]face significant barriers to investment 
[normal]and CCS is 
[normal]not yet cost-competitive with other low carbon technologies
[normal]. Initial projects have high
[normal]er
[normal] capture costs and ener
[normal]gy penalties. Building the first transportation infrastructure and proving the first CO2 stores is 
[normal]capital intensive
[normal]. 
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Because CCS is not an established technology t
[normal]he current banking and private finance climate also presents some additional challenges. It
[normal] can be more difficult to secure finance for new projects such as CCS than 
[normal]in the past
[normal], 
[normal]or 
[normal]where 
[normal]finance is provided 
[normal]it can be 
[normal]associated with high
[normal]er
[normal] costs of capital. 
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A strong carbon price should help strengthen the business case for CCS and counter the 
[normal]additional costs associated with the technology, however, the current price as seen in the EU E
[normal]missions 
[normal]T
[normal]rading 
[normal]S
[normal]cheme (ETS)
[normal] is not sufficient
[normal] by itself
[normal] to drive CCS adoption. 
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK Government has 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]designed its CCS policy to address these barrie
[normal]rs. 
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government has worked extensively to understand the barriers to deployment of the technology. 
[normal]Our assessment is that to be deployable on a scale necessary to contribute to the UK’s low carbon agenda CCS must be:
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Based on this we have developed a comprehensive package
[normal] of measures to bring forward the very first commercial scale CCS projects in the UK through our 
[normal]Commercialisation Programme
[normal], and also 
[normal]reduce or 
[normal]remove the barriers that stop projects coming forward independently.
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In April 2012 
[normal]the Government
[normal] published the first UK CCS Roadmap setting out a comprehensive package to take us to cost
[normal] competitive CCS in the 2020s.
[normal] This submission does not attempt to cover the complete br
[normal]eath of measures set out in the Roadmap
[normal], full details of which are available i
[normal]n the report on the Department’s website
[normal].   
[normal] 
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The five key components outlined in the Roadmap are: 
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The CCS Co
[normal]mmercialisation Pro
[normal]gramme
[normal] aims to support practical experience in the design, construction and operation of commercial scale Carbon Capture and Storage.
[normal] By demonstrating the technology at scale, and the successful operation of the CCS chain both technically and commercially, the Competition will 
[normal]go some way in 
[normal]address
[normal]ing
[normal] many of the barriers currently hindering independent project development. 
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Govern
[normal]ment has committed to making £1bn capital funding available
[normal] for up to two projects
[normal], and uniquely the UK is also providing operational support to projects through low-carbon Contracts for Difference.  
[normal]34.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Competition was launched alongside the Roadmap in A
[normal]pril 2012 and attracted significant interest from industry, with 
[normal]eight bids submitted when the competition closed on 3 July 2012.  Following detailed analysis, four bids were taken forward into a bi
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]improvement phase in late 2012. From this group, two Pre
[normal]ferred Bidders were announced as part of Budget 2013, with the other two bidders being assigned Reserve Bidder status. 
[normal]35.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposals put forward by bidders that have been designated as Preferred Bids are: 
[normal]36.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The proposals put forward by bidders that have been designated as Reserve Bids are:
[normal]37.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DECC is 
[normal]currently negotiating contracts 
[normal]with preferred bidders to agree the level of public support required for these projects to proceed. Initially these negotiations are focussed on the
[normal] 
[normal]Front End Engineering and Design (
[normal]FEED
[normal])
[normal] studies
[normal]. 
[normal]Reserve Bidders may be
[normal] called to participate in the next stage of the competition if one or both of the 
[normal]P
[normal]referred 
[normal]B
[normal]idders fails to enter in
[normal]to a FEED Contract
[normal].
[normal]38.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]These FEED studies are invaluable not just for providing technical and economic certainty for the projects involved, but also for the detailed information they provide to wider industry and academics through our dissemination programme. 
[normal]Previous FEED studi
[normal]es have been made freely available through the Government’s Knowledge Transfer programme and have been a valuable addition to the body of knowledge on the subject
[normal].
[normal]39.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Bringing forward these large infrastructure projects is a complex process, requiring develo
[normal]pment of innovative solutions to issues that have prevented widespread deployment to date. The FEED studies will inform final investment decisions, expected to take place in 2015.
[normal]40.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The White Rose project has also been put forward for funding through the Eur
[normal]opean Commission’s NER300 second call, the only CCS project in Europe to 
[normal]do so
[normal]. 
[normal]The NER300 is a mechanism
[normal] to finance commercial-scale CCS and innovative renewable projects from the sale of 300m EU ETS 
[normal]allowances 
[normal]over two rounds. 
[normal]Award decisions are expecte
[normal]d by June 2014.
[normal]41.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]These projects, and the ones that follow, will be able to benefit from the Government’s development of a new market for low carbon electricity through 
[normal]the 
[normal]Electricity Market Reform (EMR) programme
[normal]. 
[normal]Far-reaching re
[normal]form of the UK electricity market is needed to meet our renewables and carbon targets while maintaining security of supply and minimising consumer bills.
[normal]42.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]EMR is a central component of the Energy Bill currently being considered by Parliament, and will addre
[normal]ss the need to attract unprecedented levels of investment in the UK electricity sector over the coming decades as we replace our ageing energy infrastructure with a diverse mix of low-carbon generation, and meet the expected increases in electricity demand
[normal] as sectors such as transport and heat are electrified.
[normal]43.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Contracts for Difference (CfDs) will provide efficient long term support for all forms of low carbon generation – including CCS.
[normal] They will provide the certain
[normal]t
[normal]y investors and developers need to proceed with projects. 
[normal]The UK is unique worldwide in 
[normal]planning to 
[normal]provid
[normal]e
[normal] on-going financial support through CfDs for CCS projects,
[normal] providing a route to market for projects and strengthening business cases
[normal].
[normal]44.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]During the summ
[normal]er we published a suite of documents on EMR for consultation. These provide key detail on the policy proposals including draft terms of contracts and ar
[normal]e available on the DECC website
[normal].
[normal] These reforms will provide certainty, as well as financial suppo
[normal]rt, fo
[normal]r the long term development of CCS in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]45.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK 
[normal]has 
[normal]a 
[normal]world-
[normal]class 
[normal]CCS
[normal] research
[normal] base
[normal] 
[normal]and t
[normal]he Government is committed to supporting
[normal] this work. 
[normal]  
[normal]46.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Across the current spending review, we 
[normal]are delivering
[normal] a £125m CCS Research and Development programme with our funding partners (the Research Councils, Technology Strategy Board and Energy Technologies Institute) to support:
[normal]47.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In total, around 100 separate projects are being funded through this pro
[normal]gramme. A full list of these can be found on our project diagram (and database), available from our website
[normal].
[normal]48.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government has also supported the establishment of 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK CCS Research Centre
[normal] (UKCCSRC) – a 
[normal]c.
[normal]£13 million 
[normal]investment which
[normal] brings together th
[normal]e UK’s top CCS academics to promote and coordinate UK CCS research capability
[normal],
[normal] and increase academic collaboration with industry
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]49.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK has
[normal] le
[normal]d
[normal] the world in the development of a regulatory framework to facilitate CCS. The Government undertook a comprehensive review of the regulation necessary to enable CCS in 2007 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]quickly address
[normal]ed
[normal] barr
[normal]iers when they are identified. For example, adding po
[normal]wers to the Energy Act 2011 to address a barrier to the reuse of existing capital assets for the purpose of CO2 storage and transport. 
[normal]50.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is essential that the CCS industry has the right skills and supply chain it needs to develop. Therefore t
[normal]he Governmen
[normal]t is 
[normal]engaging with manufacturers’ organisations
[normal],
[normal] such as EEF and other partners
[normal],
[normal] to ensure UK companies are aware of the potential supply chain opportunities from the Commercialisation Programme, and beyond. 
[normal]51.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government also recognises the importance 
[normal]o
[normal]f long term regulatory and price signals for investor certainty. For this reason we have brought forward a ‘triple lock’ of 
[normal]policies designed to encourage deployment of CCS. These are (i) the National Policy Statement for Energy’s Carbon Capture Readiness 
[normal]requirements, and stipulation that there should be no new coal power plants over 300MW built without CCS
[normal]; (ii) the Carbon Price F
[normal]loor which gives an economic incentive to reduce emissions from fossil fuelled power stations; and (iii) the Emissions Perform
[normal]a
[normal]nce S
[normal]tandard which provides a regulatory backstop to the requirement of no new coal without CCS.
[normal]52.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]CCS projects
[normal] 
[normal]in the UK will be regulated by 
[normal]the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]53.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]HSE believes that existing legislation will allow for effective inspection and enforcement of health and safety standards associated with CCS projects. The Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 also imposes general duties on all pipeline operators, including a
[normal]ppropriate design, safety systems, maintenance, suitability to convey fluids, construction and installation, and prevention of accidental damage. 
[normal]54.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]At onshore CO2 capture sites the co-location of qualifying amounts of substances will mean that operators wil
[normal]l be required to produce a safety case under the permissioning regime set out in the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 (COMAH). The COMAH Regulations are enforced by a body called the COMAH Competent
[normal] Authority, which
[normal] brings together 
[normal]the re
[normal]levant
[normal] government bodies of Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales, and the HSE and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland.
[normal]55.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]HSE has held direct meetings with each of the 
[normal]Commercialisation Progr
[normal]amme
[normal] bidders 
[normal]to discuss 
[normal]suitable and proportionate process safety based approaches to their projects. In particular
[normal],
[normal] the capture and offshore injection and storage stages will follow the same process design and safety principles that are already well estab
[normal]lished at onshore major establishments and offshore oil and gas installations.
[normal]56.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]D
[normal]etailed CO2-specific standards are under development 
[normal]relating to pipeline transport 
[normal]and design assumptions are being empirically tested in trials. Progress is also being made b
[normal]y the Health and Safety Laboratory and others in the modelling of CO2 dispersion in the event of a large-scale release. 
[normal] This work has informed discussions between 
[normal]HSE 
[normal]and the potential Commercialisation Programme projects. 
[normal]57.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Government 
[normal]is 
[normal]continually engag
[normal]ing
[normal] with industry to identify the issues
[normal] which may constrain CCS deployment
[normal] and work to develop solutions. For example, recogni
[normal]s
[normal]ing the concerns about costs
[normal],
[normal] we convened a CCS Cost Reduction Task Force
[normal] tasked with investigating the potential for cost reduction and recommending actions to secure these cost reductions.
[normal]58.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Task Force 
[normal]concluded that UK gas and coal power stations equipped with carbon capture, transport and storage have clear potential to b
[normal]e cost competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation, delivering electricity at a levelised cost approaching £100/MWh by the early 2020s
[normal]. In its Final Report
[normal], the Task Force also 
[normal]provided recommendations for both industry and Government on a
[normal]ctions that could be taken to help secure the cost reductions identified
[normal]. 
[normal]These are being taken forward by the newly established Storage Development Group, Commercial Development Group, Knowledge Transfer Network and through DECC’s wider CCS Programme.  
[normal]59.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The IEA forecasts that CCS could contribute 14% of the total emission reductions through to 2050 in their 2°C scenario, and that 
[normal]without CCS the cost of meeting a 50% global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 will be 70% higher
[normal].
[normal]60.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Norwa
[normal]y, the Netherlands, 
[normal]the US, Canada and Australia are 
[normal]amongst 
[normal]the leading CCS countries.
[normal] 
[normal]These countries incentivi
[normal]s
[normal]e CCS with a combination of policies and financial support. In total these countries have provided $5.6bn
[normal] in support for their CCS projects
[normal]. 
[normal]However
[normal], the 
[normal]current main 
[normal]difference between CCS projects in the UK and North America is that the latter 
[normal]intend to
[normal] 
[normal]use the captured CO2 for 
[normal]onshore 
[normal]Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
[normal]. This allows them
[normal] to generate additional income t
[normal]hat
[normal] offset
[normal]s
[normal] capital and operati
[normal]ng costs
[normal], for example at
[normal] Boundary Dam in Can
[normal]ada and Kemper County in the US
[normal]. 
[normal]61.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Bringing forward the first com
[normal]mercial scale CCS projects is a challenge
[normal]. This is evidenced by the experience across Europe, where
[normal] 8
[normal] projects have been delayed or abandoned
[normal] since 
[normal]2010
[normal]. This despite 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]being
[normal] a central part of the EU’s energy and climate policy 
[normal]and introduction of 
[normal]a
[normal] CCS Directive covering both regulatory issues a
[normal]nd 
[normal]funding regimes through the EEPR and the New Entrant Reserve 300
[normal] (NER300)
[normal].  
[normal]62.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government is 
[normal]also 
[normal]engaging through regional, bilateral and multilateral relationships to collaborate and help overcome the challenges of commercial-scale CCS deployment.  We participate in a number of bilateral relationships as well as through international fora such as the
[normal] Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, the North Sea Basin Task Force, the Clean Energy Ministerial and the 4 Kingdoms CCS Initiative, working with countries facing similar challenges to 
[normal]CCS
[normal] deployment to address policy specific questions around CCS finan
[normal]cing and capacity-building.
[normal]CCS in a low carbon energy mix[bold] 
[normal]63.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government
[normal] believe
[normal]s
[normal] CCS could play a significant role in our future low carbon energy mix, and also in the global effort to reduce emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. Our policies are designed to give CCS the best possible opportunity to develop in the UK, with c
[normal]omprehensive financial and regulatory support as set out above. 
[normal]Our modeling suggests up 
[normal]to 12GW could be deployed by 203
[normal]0 and 40GW by 2050.
[normal]64.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Developing commercial Carbon Capture and Storage is an important part of the Government’s strategy for decarbonisin
[normal]g the power sector in line with the 2050 target at lowest cost. 
[normal]While 
[normal]our energy policies have been designed to bring forward all forms of low carbon electricity
[normal] so that that we are not 
[normal]dependent
[normal] on any one technology, 
[normal]i
[normal]f CCS is 
[normal]not successfully deployed t
[normal]here will be greater reliance on other low carbon technologies which would impose greater cost and risks 
[normal]in achieving decarbonisation.
[normal]   
[normal]65.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This memorandum has set out the importance the Government attaches to CCS, the barriers to 
[normal]development of 
[normal]projects
[normal], and the extensive package of measures being introduced to drive deployment of CCS. Further information on any of these areas noted in this memorandum is available on request.
