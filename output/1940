defaultCarbon Capture and Storage 
default(CCS) is a critical 
defaulttechnology with potential to make a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions from the power and industrial sectors in the UK and worldwide. CCS offers the 
defaultopportunity
default to continue to utilise fossil fuels, and enjoy the energy security benefits this brin
defaultgs, but with vastly reduced emissions. CCS is also a critical part of meeting emissions reduction targets in a cost effective way. 
defaultWhilst CCS is not currently competitive with other low carbon forms of generation
default 
defaultthere is the potential for costs to fall si
defaultgnificantly as deployment increases. 
defaultModelling in both the UK and internationally indicates it will be significantly cheaper to meet emissions reduction targets with CCS in the energy mix, rather than without. 
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there are currently
default a range of
default techn
defaultical and economic barriers to deployment
default which impede projects coming forward independently in the UK
default and elsewhere
default. In recognition of the 
defaultpotential of CCS
default, the Government has introduced a comprehensive package of financial and regulatory support designed 
defaultto 
defaulthelp 
defaultovercome these barriers.
default The Commercialisation Programme will demonstrate the full integrated CCS chain at commercial scale, proving the technology and significantly reducing the 
defaultcommercial and financial 
defaultrisks currently associated with it. The Gove
defaultrnment’s wider policies, as set out in the CCS Roadmap, look beyond the first projects and are designed to build a strong and successful CCS industry.

defaultThe Gove
defaultrnment is also

defaultwith the industry in the UK to drive forward development and deployment of this technology.  The Government wel

defaultThis is the Government’s evidence to the

default Committee
default’s

defaultCarbon Capture and Storage
default, following a call for evidence on

defaultCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a chain of technologies designed to remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from power and industrial sources and transport it for safe permanent storage in saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. 
defaultI
defaultt is
default th
defaulte only technology that 
defaulthas the potential to

default and to decarbonise

defaultIt is a technology

defaultCCS is not a 
defaultsingle, specific 
defaulttechnology
default as such
default, but 
defaultthe term instead covers several types of similar technologies 
defaultused in each part of t
defaulthe 
defaultCCS Chain
default.  T
defaulthe main variations being in the area of capture technologies which can be tailored to suit the application. Fo
defaultr example, in the power sector
default 
defaultpost-combustion capturedefault 
defaultinvolves the 
defaultseparat
defaultion of CO2
default from the flue gasses
default produced by the power station. This is the approach 
defaultproposed 
defaultat the 
defaultPeterhead gas 
defaultCCS 
defaultproject
default.
default 
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother approach is 
defaultOxyfuel combustiondefault whereby pure oxygen is used in place of air in the combustion process to yield a flue gas of highly concentrated CO2, a
defaults is proposed a
defaultt the White Rose coal project
default. 
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlternatively where Syngas
default (
defaulta mix of hydrogen, CO and CO2
default)
default is produced 
defaultpre-combustion capturedefault can remove CO2 to leave a combustible fuel. Finally, concentrated CO2 may be generated as an intrinsic part of the
default production process
default, for example in gas processing
default and in these cases 
defaultinherent separationdefault is used. 
defaultFurther details on the variety of technologies being developed within the CCS industry are available from the Zero Emissions Platform website
default.
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Governmen
defaultt
default does not believe that its role
default is
default to direct the development of 
defaultthese separate 
defaulttechnologies that underpin CCS, 
defaultand 
defaulttherefore
default we
default 
defaulthave
default 
defaultadopted a technology 
defaultneutral
default 
defaultapproach to CCS with an objective to create an environment which encourages technological 
defaultdevelopment, removes barriers to deployment and encourages development of the industry
default whilst leaving choices about technologies and projects to industry
default. This is evidenced in the fact that the Commercialisation Programme has selected t
defaultw
defaulto projects
default showcasi
defaultng different technologies
default as preferred bidders
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe development of CCS in the UK
default is likely to contribute to economic growth 
defaultas well as in the longer term facilit
defaultate
default a competitive energy mix and the cost effective achievement of climate change objectives. 
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe estimate that t
defaulthe 
defaultdeployment 
defaultof commercial scale CCS projects could 
defaultsustain 
default4,000 – 8,000 jobs by 2020 in areas badly in need of growth. 
default 
defaultPublic investment by 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment through the CCS 
defaultCommercialisation
default Programme
default will lever further private sector investment
default in these projects
default.  
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMore broadly the 
defaultavailability
default 
defaultof CCS 
defaultto enable
default commercially deployable low carbon source
defaults
default of 
defaultpower 
defaultgeneration is expected to secur
defaulte
default a
default low-carbon energy mix, and reach our climate change targets in the most efficient manner. The E
defaultnergy 
defaultT
defaultechnologies 
defaultI
defaultnstitute (ETI)
default estimate
default that successfully deploying CCS could cut the annual cost of meeting our carbon targe
defaultts by 
default£32bn or 
defaultup to 1% of G
defaultDP by 2050.
default 
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHaving a diverse low carbon energy mix, including CCS, has further benefits including enhanced robustness of the electricity system, energy security benefits and increased 
defaultcompetition between generators to the benefit of consumers
default.
default CCS also of
defaultfers the potential for flexible generation, 
defaultespecially important in a future low carbon mix dom
defaultinated by inflexible 
defaultor intermittent generation
default, and the opportunity to continue to utilise indigenous fossil fuel resources in the UK. 
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCCS is also the only way for several important industrial sectors such as cement, steel and ceramics to decarbonise and is therefore likely to become critical to their competitiveness 
defaultas those industries decarbonise
default. That is why BIS and DECC are working wi
defaultth academics and industry on a technoeconomic study in this important area to inform policy and financing regimes for industrial CCS. 
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is expected to be a strong global demand for CCS, with the I
defaultnternational 
defaultE
defaultnergy 
defaultA
defaultgency (IEA)
default estimating 
defaultCCS
default 
defaultwill co
defaultntribute one sixth of CO2 emission reductions required in 2050
default. As an early leader, the UK CCS industry could export their expertise worldwide to the benefit of the UK economy. Research in this area
default noted particular UK expertise in project management, en
defaultgineering and financial and legal sectors. Further, the Technology Innovation Needs Assessment (TINA) estimated that CCS innovation could help create a UK industry with the potential to contribute further economic value of £3-16bn to 2050
default.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCCS 
defaultcould play a
defaultn important
default role 
defaultin 
defaultavoiding
default dangerous climate change
default, especially if it is successfully 
defaultdeployed 
defaultacross the world.   
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGlobal energy-related CO2 emissions continue to rise. In 2011 they increased by 3.2%, reaching a 
defaultrecor
defaultd high of 31.2 gigatonnes
default, by far the largest source of global GHG emissions
default. The continued expansion of fossil fuel generating capacity over recent years, despite strong advances in clean energy technologies worldwide, means that fossil fuels will inevit
defaultably play a role in energy generation for many decades to come. 
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCCS offers 
defaultthe potential to reduce
default the emissions associated with this fossil fuel use. A power plant with CCS could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to an equivalent plant without CCS
default. The IEA projects that CCS could contribute 14% of the total emiss
defaultion reductions through to 2050 in their 2°C scenario
default.
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs is the case in the UK, CCS is currently the only large-scale mitigation option 
defaultthat could potentially
default make deep reductions in global emissions from industrial sectors 
defaultwhich 
defaultrepresent one-fifth of to
defaulttal global CO2 emissions and 
defaultwhich are
default 
defaultprojected to grow over the coming decades. The IEA estimate that almost half (45%) 
defaultof the CO2 captured between 2015 and 2050 
defaultwill need to come from industrial applications and 
defaultconclude 
defaultthat “Failure to utilize CCS tec
defaulthnology in industrial applications poses a significant threat to world capacity to tackle climate change” 
default(
defaultIEA 2013 p8
default)
default. 
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs long as fossil fuels and carbon-intensive industries play dominant roles in 
defaultthe global economy
default, CCS will be
default a
default critical
default carbon abatement technology
default. It
default i
defaults also a cost effective solution, the IEA estimates that without CCS the cost of meeting a 50% global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 will be 70% higher
default. Investing in CCS research, development and innovation now will p
defaultlay an important role in reducing the costs of CCS around the world by developing cheaper and more efficient technologies and components, and contributing to characteri
defaults
defaulting storage sites.
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe benefits of CCS are therefore significant, not just for the UK b
defaultut for also for wider global efforts to prevent dangerous climate change. However, there are a number of barriers which have prevented widespread private sector deployment of the technology to date. 
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe individual components of the 
defaultCCS chain 
defaultuse established technologies
default. For example there is in excess of 6,000km of onshore CO2 pipelines in the USA
default and CO2 has also been safely transported to stores offshore in Norway, with over 1MtCO2 stored per annum in Sleipner
default. There is, however,
default limited experience in full-chain CCS projects 
defaultas there are
default no large scale integrated CCS projects on power stations 
defaultoperational to date (although some are in advanced stages of construction)
default. 
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIntegration of the full chain at commercial scale presents bot
defaulth technical and commercial challenges. For example
default, 
defaultscaling up CO2 capture
default technology
default;
default 
defaultthe technical and 
defaultcommercial 
defaultrisks with 
defaultthe characterisation
default 
defaultand proving 
defaultof 
defaultCO2 stores
default;
default and commercial risks around novel business structures. 
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe novelty of integration and scaling up means that first-of-a-kind full chain CCS projects 
defaultface significant barriers to investment 
defaultand CCS is 
defaultnot yet cost-competitive with other low carbon technologies
default. Initial projects have high
defaulter
default capture costs and ener
defaultgy penalties. Building the first transportation infrastructure and proving the first CO2 stores is 
defaultcapital intensive
default. 
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBecause CCS is not an established technology t
defaulthe current banking and private finance climate also presents some additional challenges. It
default can be more difficult to secure finance for new projects such as CCS than 
defaultin the past
default, 
defaultor 
defaultwhere 
defaultfinance is provided 
defaultit can be 
defaultassociated with high
defaulter
default costs of capital. 
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA strong carbon price should help strengthen the business case for CCS and counter the 
defaultadditional costs associated with the technology, however, the current price as seen in the EU E
defaultmissions 
defaultT
defaultrading 
defaultS
defaultcheme (ETS)
default is not sufficient
default by itself
default to drive CCS adoption. 
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Government has 
defaulttherefore 
defaultdesigned its CCS policy to address these barrie
defaultrs. 
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government has worked extensively to understand the barriers to deployment of the technology. 
defaultOur assessment is that to be deployable on a scale necessary to contribute to the UK’s low carbon agenda CCS must be:
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBased on this we have developed a comprehensive package
default of measures to bring forward the very first commercial scale CCS projects in the UK through our 
defaultCommercialisation Programme
default, and also 
defaultreduce or 
defaultremove the barriers that stop projects coming forward independently.
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn April 2012 
defaultthe Government
default published the first UK CCS Roadmap setting out a comprehensive package to take us to cost
default competitive CCS in the 2020s.
default This submission does not attempt to cover the complete br
defaulteath of measures set out in the Roadmap
default, full details of which are available i
defaultn the report on the Department’s website
default.   
default 
default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe five key components outlined in the Roadmap are: 
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe CCS Co
defaultmmercialisation Pro
defaultgramme
default aims to support practical experience in the design, construction and operation of commercial scale Carbon Capture and Storage.
default By demonstrating the technology at scale, and the successful operation of the CCS chain both technically and commercially, the Competition will 
defaultgo some way in 
defaultaddress
defaulting
default many of the barriers currently hindering independent project development. 
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Govern
defaultment has committed to making £1bn capital funding available
default for up to two projects
default, and uniquely the UK is also providing operational support to projects through low-carbon Contracts for Difference.  
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Competition was launched alongside the Roadmap in A
defaultpril 2012 and attracted significant interest from industry, with 
defaulteight bids submitted when the competition closed on 3 July 2012.  Following detailed analysis, four bids were taken forward into a bi
defaultd
default 
defaultimprovement phase in late 2012. From this group, two Pre
defaultferred Bidders were announced as part of Budget 2013, with the other two bidders being assigned Reserve Bidder status. 
default35.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals put forward by bidders that have been designated as Preferred Bids are: 
default36.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe proposals put forward by bidders that have been designated as Reserve Bids are:
default37.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDECC is 
defaultcurrently negotiating contracts 
defaultwith preferred bidders to agree the level of public support required for these projects to proceed. Initially these negotiations are focussed on the
default 
defaultFront End Engineering and Design (
defaultFEED
default)
default studies
default. 
defaultReserve Bidders may be
default called to participate in the next stage of the competition if one or both of the 
defaultP
defaultreferred 
defaultB
defaultidders fails to enter in
defaultto a FEED Contract
default.
default38.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese FEED studies are invaluable not just for providing technical and economic certainty for the projects involved, but also for the detailed information they provide to wider industry and academics through our dissemination programme. 
defaultPrevious FEED studi
defaultes have been made freely available through the Government’s Knowledge Transfer programme and have been a valuable addition to the body of knowledge on the subject
default.
default39.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBringing forward these large infrastructure projects is a complex process, requiring develo
defaultpment of innovative solutions to issues that have prevented widespread deployment to date. The FEED studies will inform final investment decisions, expected to take place in 2015.
default40.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe White Rose project has also been put forward for funding through the Eur
defaultopean Commission’s NER300 second call, the only CCS project in Europe to 
defaultdo so
default. 
defaultThe NER300 is a mechanism
default to finance commercial-scale CCS and innovative renewable projects from the sale of 300m EU ETS 
defaultallowances 
defaultover two rounds. 
defaultAward decisions are expecte
defaultd by June 2014.
default41.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese projects, and the ones that follow, will be able to benefit from the Government’s development of a new market for low carbon electricity through 
defaultthe 
defaultElectricity Market Reform (EMR) programme
default. 
defaultFar-reaching re
defaultform of the UK electricity market is needed to meet our renewables and carbon targets while maintaining security of supply and minimising consumer bills.
default42.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEMR is a central component of the Energy Bill currently being considered by Parliament, and will addre
defaultss the need to attract unprecedented levels of investment in the UK electricity sector over the coming decades as we replace our ageing energy infrastructure with a diverse mix of low-carbon generation, and meet the expected increases in electricity demand
default as sectors such as transport and heat are electrified.
default43.
default&#xa0; 
defaultContracts for Difference (CfDs) will provide efficient long term support for all forms of low carbon generation – including CCS.
default They will provide the certain
defaultt
defaulty investors and developers need to proceed with projects. 
defaultThe UK is unique worldwide in 
defaultplanning to 
defaultprovid
defaulte
default on-going financial support through CfDs for CCS projects,
default providing a route to market for projects and strengthening business cases
default.
default44.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the summ
defaulter we published a suite of documents on EMR for consultation. These provide key detail on the policy proposals including draft terms of contracts and ar
defaulte available on the DECC website
default.
default These reforms will provide certainty, as well as financial suppo
defaultrt, fo

default&#xa0; 
defaultAcross the current spending review, we

default a £125m CCS Research and Development programme with our funding partners (the Research Councils, Technology Strategy Board and Energy Technologies Institute) to support:
default47.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn total, around 100 separate projects are being funded through this pro
defaultgramme. A full list of these can be found on our project diagram (and database), available from our website
default.
default48.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government has also supported the establishment of 
defaultthe 
defaultUK CCS Research Centre
default (UKCCSRC) – a 
defaultc.
default£13 million 
defaultinvestment which
default brings together th
defaulte UK’s top CCS academics to promote and coordinate UK CCS research capability
default,
default and increase academic collaboration with industry
default.
default 
default49.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK has
default le
defaultd
default the world in the development of a regulatory framework to facilitate CCS. The Government undertook a comprehensive review of the regulation necessary to enable CCS in 2007 
defaultand
default 
defaulthas 
defaultquickly address
defaulted
default barr
defaultiers when they are identified. For example, adding po
defaultwers to the Energy Act 2011 to address a barrier to the reuse of existing capital assets for the purpose of CO2 storage and transport. 
default50.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that the CCS industry has the right skills and supply chain it needs to develop. Therefore t
defaulthe Governmen
defaultt is 
defaultengaging with manufacturers’ organisations
default,
default such as EEF and other partners
default,
default to ensure UK companies are aware of the potential supply chain opportunities from the Commercialisation Programme, and beyond. 
default51.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government also recognises the importance 
defaulto
defaultf long term regulatory and price signals for investor certainty. For this reason we have brought forward a ‘triple lock’ of 
defaultpolicies designed to encourage deployment of CCS. These are (i) the National Policy Statement for Energy’s Carbon Capture Readiness 
defaultrequirements, and stipulation that there should be no new coal power plants over 300MW built without CCS
default; (ii) the Carbon Price F
defaultloor which gives an economic incentive to reduce emissions from fossil fuelled power stations; and (iii) the Emissions Perform
defaulta
defaultnce S
defaulttandard which provides a regulatory backstop to the requirement of no new coal without CCS.
default52.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCCS projects
default 
defaultin the UK will be regulated by 
defaultthe Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
default.
default  
default53.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHSE believes that existing legislation will allow for effective inspection and enforcement of health and safety standards associated with CCS projects. The Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 also imposes general duties on all pipeline operators, including a
defaultppropriate design, safety systems, maintenance, suitability to convey fluids, construction and installation, and prevention of accidental damage. 
default54.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAt onshore CO2 capture sites the co-location of qualifying amounts of substances will mean that operators wil
defaultl be required to produce a safety case under the permissioning regime set out in the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 (COMAH). The COMAH Regulations are enforced by a body called the COMAH Competent
default Authority, which
default brings together 
defaultthe re
defaultlevant
default government bodies of Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales, and the HSE and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland.
default55.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHSE has held direct meetings with each of the 
defaultCommercialisation Progr
defaultamme
default bidders 
defaultto discuss 
defaultsuitable and proportionate process safety based approaches to their projects. In particular
default,
default the capture and offshore injection and storage stages will follow the same process design and safety principles that are already well estab
defaultlished at onshore major establishments and offshore oil and gas installations.
default56.
default&#xa0; 
defaultD
defaultetailed CO2-specific standards are under development 
defaultrelating to pipeline transport 
defaultand design assumptions are being empirically tested in trials. Progress is also being made b
defaulty the Health and Safety Laboratory and others in the modelling of CO2 dispersion in the event of a large-scale release. 
default This work has informed discussions between 
defaultHSE 
defaultand the potential Commercialisation Programme projects. 
default57.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultGovernment 
defaultis 
defaultcontinually engag
defaulting
default with industry to identify the issues
default which may constrain CCS deployment
default and work to develop solutions. For example, recogni
defaults
defaulting the concerns about costs
default,
default we convened a CCS Cost Reduction Task Force
default tasked with investigating the potential for cost reduction and recommending actions to secure these cost reductions.
default58.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Task Force 
defaultconcluded that UK gas and coal power stations equipped with carbon capture, transport and storage have clear potential to b
defaulte cost competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation, delivering electricity at a levelised cost approaching £100/MWh by the early 2020s
default. In its Final Report
default, the Task Force also 
defaultprovided recommendations for both industry and Government on a
defaultctions that could be taken to help secure the cost reductions identified
default. 
defaultThese are being taken forward by the newly established Storage Development Group, Commercial Development Group, Knowledge Transfer Network and through DECC’s wider CCS Programme.  
default59.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe IEA forecasts that CCS could contribute 14% of the total emission reductions through to 2050 in their 2°C scenario, and that 
defaultwithout CCS the cost of meeting a 50% global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 will be 70% higher
default.
default60.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNorwa
defaulty, the Netherlands, 
defaultthe US, Canada and Australia are 
defaultamongst 
defaultthe leading CCS countries.
default 
defaultThese countries incentivi
defaults
defaulte CCS with a combination of policies and financial support. In total these countries have provided $5.6bn
default in support for their CCS projects
default. 
defaultHowever
default, the 
defaultcurrent main 
defaultdifference between CCS projects in the UK and North America is that the latter 
defaultintend to
default 
defaultuse the captured CO2 for

defaultEnhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
default. This allows them

default, for example at
default Boundary Dam in Can
defaultada and Kemper County in the US
default. 
default61.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBringing forward the first com
defaultmercial scale CCS projects is a challenge
default. This is evidenced by the experience across Europe, where
default 8
default projects have been delayed or abandoned
default since 
default2010
default. This despite 
defaultCCS 
defaultbeing
default a central part of the EU’s energy and climate policy 
defaultand introduction of

defaultnd 
defaultfunding regimes through the EEPR and the New Entrant Reserve 300

default.  
default62.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government is 
defaultalso 
defaultengaging through regional, bilateral and multilateral relationships to collaborate and help overcome the challenges of commercial-scale CCS deployment.  We participate in a number of bilateral relationships as well as through international fora such as the
default Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, the North Sea Basin Task Force, the Clean Energy Ministerial and the 4 Kingdoms CCS Initiative, working with countries facing similar challenges to 
defaultCCS
default deployment to address policy specific questions around CCS finan

defaultCCS in a low carbon energy mixdefault 
default63.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government
default believe
defaults
default CCS could play a significant role in our future low carbon energy mix, and also in the global effort to reduce emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. Our policies are designed to give CCS the best possible opportunity to develop in the UK, with c
defaultomprehensive financial and regulatory support as set out above. 
defaultOur modeling suggests up 
defaultto 12GW could be deployed by 203
default0 and 40GW by 2050.
default64.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloping commercial Carbon Capture and Storage is an important part of the Government’s strategy for decarbonisin
defaultg the power sector in line with the 2050 target at lowest cost. 
defaultWhile 
defaultour energy policies have been designed to bring forward all forms of low carbon electricity
default so that that we are not 
defaultdependent
default on any one technology, 
defaulti
defaultf CCS is 
defaultnot successfully deployed t

defaultThis memorandum has set out the importance the Government attaches to CCS, the barriers to 
defaultdevelopment of 
defaultprojects
default, and the extensive package of measures being introduced to drive deployment of CCS. Further information on any of these areas noted in this memorandum is available on request.
