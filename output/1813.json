"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Essex County Council (LPG 18)To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?At Essex County Council (ECC) the Procurement team, in collaboration with frontline Directorates, was set a four year goal of delivering £150 million cost savings by March 2013, half of the total ECC targeted transformation savings of £300 million. Following internal and external consultation, ECC identified the key procurement challenges that the transformation programme needed to address: -\n&#xa0;\nThere was a belief within ECC that in addition to delivering significant procurement savings that there was an opportunity to leverage the supply chain to support local businesses and seek opportunities to provide employment opportunities, particularly apprenticeships, through targeted contracts. With this three pronged approach in mind, the vision was expressed as the “Golden Triangle” of Procurement. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTasked with delivering £150m in cost savings over four years, the procurement team needed to reorganise in order to deliver value for money and ECC social aspirations. To do this effectively the procurement team was required to change its structure, approach and capability. The primary aim was to get closer to the business and assist them make more informed commercial decisions. As a consequence, the \nteam has undergone a major transformation, as it has shifted from being predominantly a transactional buying team to one now viewed as a commercial partner to the business.\n&#xa0;\nECC developed the existing internal resources and recruited additional employees with broader commercial experience. \nThis was a difficult transition to make, as it required existing employees to undertake a very different role. One of the key tasks was to empower the team to challenge the spending patterns of the business, in a constructive manner, and encourage them to adopt new buying behaviours; ultimately to achieve improved outcomes at a lower total cost.\n&#xa0;\nECC has built a procurement team that has: \n&#xa0;\nThe introduction of a category management approach has enabled ECC to achieve efficiency savings through a combination of re-tendering / negotiation; demand management and market-shaping initiatives. Additionally, there has been a high degree of relationship development with strategic suppliers that has been enabled by long-term agreements that lend themselves to much more collaborative working. Examples include:\n&#xa0;\nConsolidated all Highways requirements into a single long-term (10+5) contract with one provider, Ringway Jacobs (RJ), in a move away from the traditional supplier/buyer contractual arrangement into a strategic relationship where RJ and ECC staff sit alongside each other to jointly deliver defined outcomes. Savings of £5m have already been achieved and there is potential for this to develop into a joint venture or similar arrangement in the future.\n&#xa0;\nPreviously, all Property Management &amp; Facilities Management services were contracted individually and ECC had multiple small contracts with many suppliers to manage. The PM/FM approach was to combine both requirements into a single prime contractor long-term (10 + 5) arrangement. The result has been a significant reduction in numbers of internal staff and savings delivered of £3.1m with further savings to be achieved from Supply Chain Management initiatives. In addition a number of other services have now been added to the initial contract. The agreement was set up on a flexible basis i.e. it provided MITIE with a set of core services and there were optional services that could be added depending on performance and demonstration \nof value for money. As a consequence of this approach ECC has now included stationery and energy buying to the core MITIE contract and other potential services continue to be reviewed.  \n&#xa0;\nWhere appropriate, ECC will involve local residents / users of a service in the procurement process. For example, in the Commissioning of Children’s Centres, families were engaged in the procurement process to select suppliers.\n&#xa0;\nA consultation exercise was undertaken to gain families views on questions to ask suppliers and what a good response would look like, to inform the evaluation criteria.\n&#xa0;\n The outcome of this consultation shaped and changed the specification and a separate “family volume” was included within the tender documentation.\n&#xa0;\n A small number of families volunteered to be involved in evaluating the responses and ECC provided training and support (childcare) to enable families to participate fully in the sessions.\n&#xa0;\nTheir input was extremely beneficial to ECC and the individuals felt involved and included in the decision making process. \n&#xa0;\nAs a result of all the changes, \nECC now has a strategic central procurement team that punches well above its weight in terms of involvement with the business and achievements, when compared to other organisations with similar spend. These include: \n&#xa0;\nProcurement is now seen as a commercial partner rather than a transactional buying function, with personnel embedded in a number of frontline service delivery / commissioning teams, which is not always the norm for local government.  \n[1024 words]&#xa0;\nDo authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.The ECC experience of collaboration is somewhat mixed:-\nWe have been working collaboratively with the previous Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), NHS England and CCGs for almost a year, developing strategies for joint working between Health and ECC. The integration activity covers Children’s, Adults and Older People’s services, as well as Mental Health, Learning Disabilities and Physical &amp; Sensory Impairment with a view to: \n&#xa0;\nECC Commissioning Directors will support the integration with Health and they are members of the CCG boards. Both Health and ECC will create strategies and relationships that deliver long-term benefits for partner organisations and sustainable improved outcomes for patients and the people of Essex. \n&#xa0;\nThere are also examples of good collaborative working with other County Councils in certain commodities (e.g. Norfolk on Next Generation Networks) and with the Unitary authorities and Districts / Boroughs. However, despite ECC trying to take a proactive approach to collaboration with other authorities, our experience could best be described as “variable” – there is still a tendency to take a “cherry pick” approach to collaboration (i.e. only collaborate on certain commodities) rather than a more strategic / long-term approach. \n&#xa0;\nECC does use central government frameworks such as GPS but these tend to be used more for convenience and speed rather than for commercially advantageous reasons. Ultimately frameworks have a role to play but they do not guarantee suppliers any business and in general securing the most advantageous commercial outcome is still best achieved by running your own tender process, which is disappointing, particularly for indirect expenditure commodities, as you utilise scarce resources to do this and they could be better deployed to focus on direct expenditure commodities e.g. social care.   \n[306 words]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?&#xa0;\nIn order to secure the right expertise, ECC recognised that investment was required to develop the existing central Procurement team to turn them into a commercial partner to the business. To help successfully complete this major transformation, ECC needed more resources and a different mix of skills and experience than were available in-house. In addition to recruiting new members of the team with a broader set of skills and experience, ECC \nappointed a Chief Procurement Officer in 2010 and a key priority was to focus on mentoring, coaching and individual training &amp; development to up-skill the existing team. \nBy developing the internal resources and recruiting additional employees with broader commercial experience, ECC has successfully built a team that works collaboratively with the Directorates but can challenge their spending patterns and service delivery in a constructive manner. \n&#xa0;\nTo do this consistently and ensure savings are sustainable ECC has adopted Category Management as the procurement methodology and as part of this process, ECC formally considers how best the category plan can balance commercial benefits with social and economic objectives. The social and economic opportunities are captured in what ECC call Corporate Impact Assessments and since the introduction of the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, these have been expanded to include SVA requirements.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of promoting economic growth there was \npolitical support to use ECC’s procurement leverage to increase opportunities but not at the expense of targeted savings. For certain categories of spend, a requirement was introduced, as part of the tender process, for bidders to deliver a number of apprenticeships, which would count towards their “added value” score. In the case of the PM/FMS contract, once the successful bidders had been selected, the Chief Procurement Officer and Cabinet Member for Procurement met with the short listed bidders to reinforce ECC’s commitment to supporting the local supply chain, encouraging social employment schemes and delivering a number of apprenticeships. ECC sought a commitment of one – two apprenticeships for each £1m of spend; MITIE the eventual winner, committed to almost doubling this amount.  As part of this drive, ECC has already secured commitment to over 270 new apprenticeship opportunities through a range of contracts.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the suppliers have gone further than just committing to increasing the number of apprenticeships and have worked with the Procurement supply chain manager on promoting social employment schemes and supporting local suppliers. For example, MITIE have committed to a share of their sub-contracted work to go to local SMEs; have supported a number of Essex charities; run ‘world of work’ days at Essex schools; raised money for the Youth enquiry scheme in Essex and hold volunteering days, which last year refurbished rooms and the garden at the Helen Rollason hospice.  A pioneering addition to the contract was ‘Essex Unite’ - a partnership with Jobcentre Plus and the Essex Coalition for Disabled people that organises work placements to get disabled people into employment. This scheme was highly commended recently in the ‘Business in the Community Awards’. \n&#xa0;\nECC has been using an e-Sourcing system since 2007 and is a mature user of this technology. However, the system was predominantly used for tendering and as a contract repository. Whilst the system worked well, it did not have the functionality to allow broader use in the procurement process.\n&#xa0;\nIn late 2011, ECC became the first Public Sector organisation in the UK to implement Ariba, as its e-Sourcing solution, mainly as it provides a number of key functionality enhancements including:\n&#xa0;To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?ECC applies a standardised approach to Procurement according to complexity and level of risk involved. Procurement activity is categorised as low, medium, high or very high risk, based on a combination of the estimated total contract value, the anticipated contract term and the nature of the procurement.\n&#xa0;\nLow Risk\n - in general these are carried out by non- procurement professionals. A minimum of three written quotes must be obtained where an estimated total contract value falls between £2,000 and £50,000. Where appropriate suppliers should be selected from those registered with ECC’s eSourcing tool and must include at least one local supplier. Procurements with a total value less than £2,000 should be made using a P-Card. \n&#xa0;\nMedium Risk - a\n simplified tender procedure is required for all medium risk procurements with an estimated whole of life contract value between £50,001 and the current EU Thresholds. \n&#xa0;\nHigh and Very High Risk - w\nhere a procurement activity is identified as high or very high risk (above EU threshold), then an OJEU procurement procedure will be conducted by an appropriate Procurement professional. \n&#xa0;\nClearly there are other types of risk that are required to be understood and managed, particularly the ongoing supplier risk. In this regard, ECC has devised a tiering system for its suppliers. There are four tiers in total and the ECC supply chain strategy has been developed around managing the most important i.e. ECC dedicate professional resource to manage key supplier relationships. The factors that determine which tier the supplier is assigned include: annual contract value; total length of contract; criticality of the service provided and how easily this could transfer to another supplier; strategic importance; and impact of failure. Where risks are identified there will be mitigation plans in place e.g. contingency plans in the event of a temporary or long-term failure /default; exit strategies developed and updated throughout the life of the contract.\n&#xa0;\nECC contract managers will also manage the performance of the suppliers to ensure they are delivering on contractual promises and a number of other key aspects including monitoring suppliers financial health; security / confidentiality of personal data; insurance indemnities.  \n&#xa0;\nAt a category level, risks are managed at different levels. For example, within \nPM/FM, there is a corporate risk management system (JCAD), which is used to log and manage risks that are very high / high for ECC as an organisation. Operational risks are managed through joint MITIE/ECC meetings within the service. Contract risk is jointly shared with MITIE in an open and honest environment. A register held by the contract manager is reviewed periodically by the joint senior management team and escalated concerns become part of the agenda for the quarterly strategic review meeting. This approach in the spirit of partnership means that concerns are aired and mitigations are a formulated jointly to support risk reduction.\n&#xa0;\nThe client function within Essex Property and Facilities has embedded functions working as part of the team. This includes a finance business partner and an information and intelligence officer, as well as contract and supply chain management. Flexible working arrangements allows co-location between ECC and MITIE, which enables more effective joint team working and a more open approach ensuring that ECC corporate objectives and risks are clearly identified and understood by all. Ultimately the contracts are moving away from output based specifications and moving to a focus on outcomes. This enables greater flexibility in being able to meet ever changing demands. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition to performance reviews and audits being carried out as part of SCM, business audits are also conducted, which help to manage risk.\n&#xa0;\nFor example, in Children’s these audits will highlight issues relating to data protection and frequency of healthcare checks for young people. Clearly any issues identified will be pursued with the providers.\nHow is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective? &#xa0;Our Internal Audit Team undertake assurance reviews of procurement rules design and effectiveness. ECC has a dedicated Counter Fraud Team whose work encompasses prevention / detection and investigation. In terms of procurement/commissioning fraud ECC have undertaken the following activities:\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Financial Scheme of Delegation, all Procurement activity is subject to oversight and scrutiny. \nECC has in place appropriate governance arrangements for the proper and effective transaction of business and for making decisions on important issues. In order to demonstrate that our decision making processes are clear and robust, enabling well-informed decisions to be made quickly and openly, ECC has a number of guiding principles, including: \nDecisions will be taken by Full Council, Cabinet, Cabinet Members or Chief Officers depending on a range of factors including value; risk; sensitivity; staffing / employment; cross-cutting nature, etc.\nIs local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?&#xa0;\nECC is keen to use objective measures to assess how the Procurement team is performing. In late 2012, ECC engaged a recognised external organisation to carry out a ‘peer review’ of its Procurement Function. The procurement function was reviewed against 7 key attributes and compared to both public and private sector organisations. The summary of the findings were as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nECC is very confident that given the total achievements of its Procurement team that it can provide central government with the necessary assurances that value for money (in the broadest sense) is routinely delivered. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
