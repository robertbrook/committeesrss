default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Palestinian Authority lacks power and de jure and de facto sovereignty.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAid is being used to sustain a failed peace process and the occupation itself
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAid, especially in the case of the West Bank, treats the Israeli 
defaultoccupation as a temporary condition which is masking the nature and status of the occupation as a permanent fixture and thus it can be argued that aid is not assisting the Palestinians in the long term
default.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe reliance on aid is a direct result of the Israel
defaulti occupation.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe political basis for the humanitarian crisis that generates conditions of aid remains unchallenged
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a result of the occupation, the wall, restrictions by Israel and 
default‘
defaultland grabs
default’
default, they are now unable to access their lands and therefore n
defaultow reliant on aid

defaultAid to OPT can be significantly reduced, saving millions, if Israel ended its illegal occupation of Palestine.

defaultIbrahim and Beaudet in Table 1 highlight how the actions of the donor community (we include DFID) do not meet any of the six principles for effective engagement
default. 
default              
default            Table 1. Assessment of Fragile States Principles in the OPT
default             Principlesdefault                     Reality in the OPTdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTake context as the             starting pointdefaultMajor donors (the United States in particular) do not agree that 
defaultthe core problem of the OPT is occupation. The starting point remains a series of social and economic problems related to governance issues while, in reality, the perpetuation of the occupation remains the core problem.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDo no harmdefaultDonors have done harm 
defaultby not opposing physical destruction, human rights violations and disrespect for international law perpetrated by the Israeli occupation. They have also enhanced Palestinian divisions and opposed attempts to reconcile the different factions.
default&#xa0;
defaultFocus on defaultstate-buildingdefaultPalestinians so far have been unable to build their state. Moreover, the PNA is often neglected by donors who prefer quick-impact projects either under their own direct control or through private Palestinian or foreign entities.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrioritisedefault preventiondefaultLittle preventive action was taken despite the predictability of recurring conflicts. The intensive clashes since 2000 were the result of the non-resolution of fundamental issues including the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Donor
defaults have many times focused on the consequences rather than the causes of the impasse.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecognise links between political, security and development objectivesdefaultDevelopment objectives are usually secondary to political and security goals of Israel.
defaultA large 
defaultpart of the aid programme has been directed to security forces whose mandate is to police the Palestinian population rather than to defend their rights. Closures and illegal repression by Israel have been justified by some donors even if they are in contra
defaultdiction with the aid programme.
default&#xa0;
defaultPromote non-discriminationdefaultfor inclusive and stabledefaultsocietiesdefaultThere is clear-cut discrimination against Gaza and other parts of the OPT where local authorities or population disagree with PNA
default’
defaults policies. (In Gaza, 
defaultdevelopment cooperation has been frozen, leaving only emergency aid programmes in place).
default&#xa0;
defaultAlign with local prioritiesdefaultPalestinian actors (not only PNA) have been repeating that the priority is to end the occupation and, in the meantime, to improve social
default and economic conditions. Yet this priority has not been respected by donors.
defaultPractical coordinationdefaultCoordination with Palestinians has been minimal and erratic, even with the PNA. Coordination amongst donors is not systematic and does not cover some of 
defaultthe main actors, such as USAID.
default&#xa0;
defaultAct fast and stay engageddefaultResponses to crises have been ambiguous, especially with Gaza. Long-term commitments are unclear. Currently, aid commitments are being reduced.
default&#xa0;
defaultAvoid pockets of exclusiondefaultMany areas and sectors 
defaultin the OPT, particularly in Gaza, have been excluded by donors.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultIbrahim and Beaudet
default’
defaults analysis highlights that 
default“…
defaultas long as the occupation continues and the Israeli closure policy
default 
defaultdecimates the Palestinian economy, foreign aid can only address 
defaultshort-term humanitarian needs rather than long-term development goals that remain the priority of the Palestinians and the international donor community
default”
default. This is due to the underlying root causes of the conflict not being addressed, namely the occupation
default of Palestine by Israel.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. default              default              defaultRelieving Israel of its responsibilitiesdefault&#xa0;
defaultSince the blockade of the Gaza strip in June 2007 a humanitarian crisis has enveloped the Gaza strip with nearly 34% of the population being unemployed in 2012 including over half i
defaultts youth. 44% of Palestinians in Gaza are food insecure and nearly 80% are aid recipients. 35% of Gaza
default’
defaults farmland and 85% of its fishing waters are totally or partially inaccessible due to Israeli imposed restrictions. Furthermore a severe fuel and electri
defaultcity shortage results in outages of up to 12 hours a day. Some 90 million litres of untreated and partially treated sewage are deposited illegally in the sea each day and finally over 90% of the water from the Gaza aquifer is unsafe for human consumption w
defaultithout treatment
default due to the above actions of Israel. Although under the disengagement plan of 2004, Israel made clear it no longer held responsibility for those living within the Gaza strip, this is contrary to IHL.
default              
defaultUnder Article 42 of the 1907 Hague Reg
defaultulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land
default it is clear that responsibility is determined based on 
default‘
defaulteffective control
default’
default. As Al Haq illustrates, Israel continues to directly exercise control over parts of the Gaza strip. Israel
default’
defaults control of the 
defaultGaza strip includes controlling goods and services on land and air via the Gazan airspace (i.e: blocking the delivery of gas and electricity, controlling border points which control people and goods into Gazan territory), right through to its control over 
defaultareas that would traditionally be under the ruling authorities control such as population registry to military duties (by conducting raids within the Gaza strip
default). 
default              
defaultIsrael
default’
defaults control has not relinquished since its disengagement from Gaza but has rather tig
defaulthtened over the years. 
default              
defaultTherefore regardless of Israel
default’
defaults biased interpretation it must still assume full responsibility for the needs of those not only in Gaza but the West Bank and East Jerusalem as provided for by the Geneva Conventions discussed earlie
defaultr. 
default              
defaultTaghdisi Rad argues that by subsidising the PA, (in the form of official development assistance (ODA), it has allowed Israel to sustain the occupation without taking responsibility for the basic humanitarian needs of the people under this occupation. 
defaultThe understanding of the international community is on the premise that the PA is responsible for the welfare of those in the West Bank and Gaza yet it is clear the PA does not have real control in order for it to assume such responsibilities. 
default              
defaultA similar 
defaultunderstanding can be reached of humanitarian aid in the Gaza strip given this was the main reason that the ICRC decided to withdraw from the oPT
default’
defaults. It reiterated in 2004 when terminating two major humanitarian programs
default              
default 
default“
defaultthat the obligation to take care o
defaultf the basic needs of any civilian population living under occupation does not lie with humanitarian organisations
default”
default 
defaultand that humanitarian aid
default              
default“
defaultis never more than an exceptional and temporary measure designed to help the most vulnerable members of a 
defaultsociety facing an acute humanitarian crisis. Under no circumstances should such aid become a substitute for the long-term measures necessary to ensure economic
default&#xa0;
defaultstability
default”
default.
default 
defaultWhat is visible is that the occupation of the oPT
default’
defaults and its consequences has now l
defaulted to a shift in the perception of the government and the public of being a humanitarian crisis rather one of being an illegal occupation which has led to humanitarian crisis.
defaultUnder the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel is engaged as the occupying power ther
defaulteby also placing responsibility on Israel to rectify the situation (i.e to rebuild the demolished houses, where it has illegally caused damaged to properties
default). 
defaultThe international community has abstained from holding Israel accountable for its actions and 
defaulttherefore the donor community needs to ensure that Israel either compensates the owners of the houses demolished or that it pays compensation to the donor community for the repairs it has to make
default, as well as ensuring that assistance is provided to those l
defaultiving in oPT
default’
defaults. The donor community needs to do so urgently as by simply providing funds to rebuild infrastructure or humanitarian aid, the donor community is implicitly encouraging violations of international law and indirectly permitting Israel to contin
defaultue to operate outside the framework of its legal responsibilities
default. 
default              
default              
default3.default              default              defaultFunding the Administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its effectsdefault              
default              
defaultThe flagship development of the PA has been universally recognised as the cornerstone of the donor c
defaultommunity
default’
defaults vision for providing aid to the oPT
default’
defaults. The donor community from the time of the Oslo accords have made their investments with the belief that they were helping to build a future Palestinian state that was politically and economically self suffic
defaultient
default.  
default              
defaultOne of DFID's main objective has been that of state building. There recurrent aid donations have been with the view of supporting the PA on the path to self-sufficiency, however a number of problems have emerged along the way. 
default              
defaultThe PA
default’
defaults inabilit
defaulty to generate sufficient economic growth means they have suffered permanent budgetary problems
default. 
default              
defaultThe underlying reasons for the PA
default’
defaults lack of economic growth stem from its lack of real economic base. Clearance revenue during 2013 continued to be the main 
defaultsource of Palestinian public revenue and accounted for 70 per cent of total revenue covering 84 per 
defaultcent of the public wage bill and 45 per cent of current expenditure
default. As part of the Paris Economic Protocol a clause was set allowing Israel to collect rev
defaultenue on behalf of the PA which was subsequently transferred to the PA. This revenue was generated from VAT and Import taxes Israel levied on Palestinian imports transiting Israel
default. 
default              
defaultHowever 
default“
defaultthis arrangement gives Israel leverage over the Palestinian Auth
defaultority, leaving it hostage to political pressure
default”
default. On a number of occasions Israel has withheld such clearance revenue, most recently in the aftermath of Palestine becoming a non 
default–
default 
defaultmember observer state of the United Nations in 2012
default. This leverage has 
defaultleft the PA at the mercy of Israel thereby leaving them unable to pay the salaries of the 170,000 civil servants in the West Bank and Gaza
default. 
default              
defaultClearance revenue remains the main source of income due to Israel
default’
defaults continued control over the oPT
default’
defaults, which has 
defaultstifled the economy of the oPT
default’
defaults. Israel
default’
defaults closure policy which includes its restrictions on free movement of people, goods and services via its checkpoints, roadblocks, separation wall and its external and internal border control
default, prevents workers from a
defaultccessing their places of work. Israel
default’
defaults expansion of settlements means that many Palestinians have been dispossessed of fertile agricultural land. Many previously grew produce that they subsequently exported. Furthermore Israel
default’
defaults security restrictions sinc
defaulte 2000 means that certain products which Israel regards as dual use are restricted or delayed in entering the West Bank and in particular Gaza, causing widespread difficulties for businesses within the oPT
default’
defaults.  
default              
defaultWithout a functioning economy the PA, as a r
defaultesult of its inability to generate income, remains highly dependent on international aid
default for budgetary assistance. 
default“
defaultThe
defaultPalestinian economy would have robust growth under better political and security conditions
default”
default, namely Israel bringing an 
default“
defaultend to its bor
defaultder closures, roadblocks, curfews, and travel restrictions
default”
default 
defaultand therefore ultimately its occupation of the oPT
default’
defaults. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultLe More therefore highlights how aid amidst the total collapse of the PA and the economy
default  has created an environment where 
default“
defaultaid [is being
default used] to keep the PA alive (rather than build institutions) and pay for its running costs and the salaries of its civil servants
default”
default. 2008
default. This is in addition to 
default“
defaulthumanitarian aid which almost doubled, from $491m in 2005 to $885m in 2008
default”
default. The statistics 
defaulttherefore highlight that official aid assistance is predominantly spent on budgetary support, emergency assistance and humanitarian relief
default.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultThis is in contradiction to the original purpose of the PA which was to help create an economy that was able to g
defaultenerate sufficient income and to create an economically prosperous Palestinian state. It is important to remember that the role of Aid is not to prop up a government but rather help it to achieve its goals, which currently the PA is not doing. It is in fac
defaultt doing the opposite in maintaining the status quo within the oPT
default’
defaults, thereby disguising the true effect of the occupation on the oPT
default’
defaults.  The PA ultimately lacks sovereignty to influence and create its own policies.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultSayigh similarly argues that the donor 
defaultcommunity is
default 
default“
defaultlocked into policies that are bringing about the very humanitarian crisis it seeks to alleviate, while generating long-term dependence on external funding
default”
default. 
defaultQarmout and Beland advocate further  that not only is this bringing about the humani
defaulttarian crisis but in fact aid has helped to perpetrate the humanitarian crisis by supporting the international aid community to take over the responsibilities of a dysfunctional government  and by assisting the government to meet the needs of its people wh
defaultere it has limited autonomy. They argue this has created greater instability
default and ultimately reinforces the lack of sovereignty that the PA currently has.
default              
default              
defaultA 2013 World Bank report has highlighted how if Israeli restrictions were lifted this would ensure
default an increase in GDP, which in turn would significantly help the oPT
default’
defaults fiscal position with an increase in revenue of $800 million dollars. It would reduce the fiscal deficit of the PA by almost half, which would then reduce the need for donor recurrent bud
defaultget support. To conclude it is extremely important the international community places a greater emphasis on encouraging Israel to lift its restrictions which are currently stifling the Palestinian economy, as opposed to simply providing ever increasing amo
defaultunts of aid to the PA which is not assisting the Palestinians in the long term
default nor is it allowing the PA to perform its designated role.  
default&#xa0;
default4. Recommendationsdefault&#xa0;
defaultBased on the information detailed above, Friends of Al-Aqsa make the following recommendations:
default 
default&#xa0;
default1. Aid given to the Palestinian Authority should be made dependent on improvements to the system of governance and routing out corruption. 
default&#xa0;
default2. Aid should be structured in a manner that enables Palestinian society to progress towards independence with achievable targets put in place. Thus, it should build indepdence and not dependence. 
default&#xa0;
default3. The British government should promote an end to Israel
defaulti occupation, and recognize that the continuing Palestinian need for aid is a result of occupation policies such as land confiscations which deprive families of sustainable incomes.
