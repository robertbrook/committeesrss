[[[Introduction:]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0; Gatwick Airport is sincerely sorry to all passengers whose travel plans were disrupted on Christmas Eve as a result of the flooding and disruption at the airport.1.2&#xa0; This document sets out the circumstances faced by Gatwick Airport on 24 December. It is not intended in any way to excuse what happened, but to go some way to providing context and explanation.&#xa0;

[[[Circumstances]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1 On 23 December all advance Met Office weather warnings for the storm that has been battering Britain over the last fortnight were focused on high winds. Gatwick planned its response accordingly alongside its airport partners.2.2 However at 4:15am on 24 December Gatwick received a flood warning call from the Environment Agency warning that the River Mole would burst its banks within 30 minutes for the first time since 1967.2.3 This was the first warning that the threat to the airport's operations was from severe flooding as well as high winds. This obviously requires a very different sort of contingency planning. Overnight rainfall of over 68mm in the area significantly exceeded Met Office forecasts causing the worst flooding in the airport's living memory.2.4 Gatwick issued its first passenger communications via twitter at 4:29am about possible      disruption.2.5 As a result of the rain two of the six switch-rooms located in the North Terminal flooded, knocking out much of the power.2.6 Simultaneously on the airfield three substations flooded and the Runway Instrument Landing System was disabled. This is a known and understood risk and the contingency worked with the backup generators kicking in to provide continuity of power. The South Terminal continued to operate as normal and the airfield remained operational throughout.2.7 However by 7:30am it was clear that the damage to the North Terminal switch-room was severe and that full power would not be reinstated to the North Terminal on Christmas Eve.2.8 By 9:00am we had issued a statement to all media outlets about the situation at the airport.&#xa0;

[[[Performance]]]&#xa0;3.1 With Christmas in mind and the imperative to get passengers to their destination rather than cancel all flights from the North Terminal, the decision was taken jointly with airline partners to move the majority of these flights to the South Terminal. This is logistically very challenging at the best of times.3.2 66 additional back office staff were deployed into the Terminal buildings to assist passengers.3.3 Overall on 24 December of the originally scheduled 258 departures, 186 departed the airport, albeit some with delays.3.4 However 67 of the North Terminal departures were ultimately cancelled, many of them quite late in the day.3.5 A rapid recovery enabled Gatwick to fly a full schedule on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and onwards.&#xa0;

[[[Preparations]]]&#xa0;4.1 Since the change of ownership in 2009, Gatwick has, with the full backing of its new shareholders, invested over £1bn with the end aim of transforming Gatwick into a world-leading airport capable of competing successfully.4.2 This investment programme included over £20 million in mitigating and alleviating flood risk.4.3 The majority of this investment has been focused on the South Terminal, which had been assessed as having a 1 in 20 year risk of flooding. These works were successful in preventing flooding of the South Terminal during the recent exceptional weather.4.4 The North Terminal had been assessed in 2008 as being at a low risk of flooding- less than a 1in 100 year risk.4.5 Gatwick will be working with the Environment Agency to reassess all flood modeling, and provides an unqualified assurance that all necessary further investment will be carried out as a matter of urgency.&#xa0;

[[[Passengers]]]&#xa0;5.1 Despite the lack of warning and despite the flooding and the subsequent loss of the switch rooms at the North Terminal it is clear that there is a lot more Gatwick could ·and should · have done with its airport partners to help make the disruption as painless as possible for passengers.5.2 Gatwick did attempt to communicate with passengers via twitter, issuing over 300 tweets on the day. It also issued three media statements which were sent to key news rooms and media outlets as well as briefing local and national media throughout the day.5.3 As an Airport Gatwick sets itself very high standards in performance and customer service. It has worked hard along with its airport partners to achieve a good reputation for dealing with disruptions. On this occasion Gatwick's actions and those of its airport partners fell short.5.4 Gatwick has offered each passenger whose flight was cancelled £100 of high street vouchers as a goodwill gesture. The McMillan review {see 6.1) will focus in particular on how Gatwick can learn the lessons for the future. At times like this passenger information and comfort must always be a priority.&#xa0;
