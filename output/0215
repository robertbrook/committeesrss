[normal]Footnote
[normal]Although the demise of the FSS, and particularly the speed of it, contributed to current difficulties within the market, it was not the primary cause of them. Treating it as such will distract from the true causes and 
[normal]delay proper and urgently needed 
[normal]remedy.
