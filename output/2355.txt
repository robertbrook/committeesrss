[[[David Leng – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;I enclose here specific evidence relative to a number of suggestions for inclusion in the DDB.&#xa0;Current regulations are not sufficient or efficient at dealing with the growing problem of off road driving (motorbikes and 4x4) on green lanes and Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs). This is resulting in:&#xa0;a.              

[[[Economic damage]]]

[[[ ]]]to our National Parks and areas of natural beauty as walkers, mountain bikers, birdwatchers and equestrian sports are being forced to go elsewhere.&#xa0;b.              

[[[Unnecessary use of police time]]]

[[[ ]]]is costing the taxpayer as overstretched police resources are attempting to catch drivers using these routes at excessive speeds but without the equipment needed.i.               See emails from PC Phil Maycock- Derbyshire police have an Operation Blackbrook team specifically to deal with these issues (Doc 1, 18)&#xa0;c.              

[[[Unnecessary road maintenance costs]]]

[[[ ]]]are being incurred by the county councils as they are obliged to repair these unsealed unclassified roads which are being intentionally destroyed by off roaders to make the byways more challenging to drive on.i.              Bridget Gould- Derbyshire cCC letter (Doc 2,3)ii.              Neil Hickman- Derbyshire CC letter (Doc 4)&#xa0;d.               

[[[Wasted administration and legal costs by County councils]]]

[[[ ]]]responding to BOAT reclassifications via the wildlife and countryside act 1981, driven by the off road lobby to prevent the protection of these routesi.              See Derbyshire cc letter Mike Rhodes (Doc 5)ii.               See Derbyshire CC letter ref LD/MH/36060 john McEiveney (Doc 6)iii.               See Jim Nixon Derbyshire CC chief exec letter (Doc 7,8)&#xa0;e.               

[[[Additional costs incurred by the National park authorities]]]

[[[-]]]

[[[ ]]]each authority employs people specifically to fight the plethora of BOAT reclassification claims that are being created by the off-road lobby- each claim requires a reply and there are thousands of claims on some of the more contested routes.i.               4500 responses to TRO for long causeway see Mike Rhodes letter (Doc 5)ii.               Huge legal costs in the high court caused by poor legislation at Chapelgate­ also see Mike Rhodes letter (Doc 5)iii.               Evidence of costs incurred- Richard Pett letter- Peak Park Authority (Doc9,18)&#xa0;f.               

[[[Excessive drain on the Health Service]]] as walkers and bikers injured by either the vehicles or the unsuitable surfaces caused by the vehicular damage are admitted to casualty departments across the country.&#xa0;g.              

[[[Unrequired costs of environmental impact assessments]]] are being incurred as people try to demonstrate the patently obvious damage being done to the countryside.i.              DEFRA Letter See the extensive work done by DEFRA on this subject at a cost of thousands of pounds (doc 10, 11,12)http://archive.defra.gov.uk/rural/documents/countryside/crow/regulating-motorvehicles.pdf&#xa0;h.              

[[[Significant waste of our elected representatives time]]] (ministers, MP,s  County councillors, parish councillors, Peak Park officials, Police authorities etc) attempting to piece together solutions from laws which are over-regulated to the point of being unworkable.i.              Mary Creagh MP letter. (Doc 13)ii.              Rt Hon Patrick Mcloughlin MP letters (Doc 14,15,16 117)iii.              Rt Hon Richard Benyon MP letter (Doc 11112)iv.              Mike Rhodes- Peak Park letter (Doc 5)v.              Jim Dixon- Chief Executive Derbyshire CC (Doc 718)&#xa0;i              

[[[Impingement of our human right to peaceful enjoyment of our National Parks]]]j              

[[[Distraction of ]]]

[[[private industry]]] -I am spending a lot of personal time on this issue when I could be growing my business faster (Synseal extrusions employ 850 people currently- grown from 500 23 years ago) (Doc 19)&#xa0;The solution to much of the above loss of revenue and waste of taxpayers’ money is to add some additional rights of way clauses into the Bill which would have the following effect:&#xa0;&#xa0;What I am suggesting would for the most part either be highly deregulatory or have a nil net effect on regulation and red tape. (Reclassifying green lanes to become restricted byways will eliminate altogether the costs and bureaucracy involved in the processing of rights of way claims on them. The downgrading of BOATs to restricted byways would have a net nil effect in terms of red tape/bureaucracy. The creation of a right to appeal against a highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order would not be deregulatory but it does, however, fit squarely within the government's localism agenda.)&#xa0;Everything suggested will have the key benefits of protecting the environment of the national parks and non-vehicle users, and it would eliminate the waste of the public money which is being spent by highway authorities on repairing and re-repairing unsealed lanes damaged by 4x4s and motor bikes.&#xa0;Overall the economic benefit to the British tourist industry would be significant.&#xa0;&#xa0;David Leng3 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Enclosures not published here.
