defaultThe London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority
default (LFEPA)
default run the London Fire Brigade
default (LFB)
default and is a functional body of the Greater London Authority. 
default 
defaultLondon’s fire and rescue service is the busiest in the country and one of the largest firefighting and rescue organisations in the world. We provide services acro
defaultss the whole of the Greater London area, serving London’s 8.2 million residents as well as those who work in or visit the city.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultAround 6,500 staff work for the Brigade. This includes over 5,500 operational firefighters, 100 Brigade Control staff dealin
defaultg with 999 emergency calls and a range of non-operational staff working behind the scenes to deliver support services such as getting fire safety messages across.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThe LFB
default has reviewed its data relating to domestic fires resulting from electrical causes
default (not including white goods/portable appliances) and does not have substantive evidence of an increased risk of fire or danger to the public, due to the operation of the electrical competent persons scheme.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultHowever, the LFB does has significant concern
default regarding a closely related issue, which is that of on-going electrical safety inspections in rented domestic accommodation. Unlike the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, where landlords have a duty (annually) to make sure gas appliances,
default fittings and flues provided for tenants are safe, there is currently no statutory requirement to have annual safety checks carried out on the electrical installation or electrical equipment.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThrough the work of the Brigade’s fire investigation team, s
defaultignificant qualitative data has been accumulated which shows that serious fires have occurred due to dangerous and untested electrical installations in rented properties. Cases involving extensive property damage and even fatalities have been recorded. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTh
defaulte LFB would be happy to provide detailed evidence to support the need for change and ask 
defaultD
defaultCLG to consider making annual landlords electrical safety checks 
default(and ideally portable appliance testing) mandatory, to either match the Gas Safety (Installation and 
defaultUse) Regulations 1998, or else to take place at reasonable intervals e.g. 1-3 years.

defaultIn support of this submission, please see a

defaultThematic Rep
defaultort on Electrical Fires
default (
defaultFEP 1953
default)
default’ - which can be found on the London Fire website and 
defaultwhich was agreed
default at the LFEPA
default’s Strategy Committee
default.  The report
default looks at the occurrence of accidental dwelling 
defaultfires where the source of ignition is powered by elect
defaultricity.  The report also highlights the prevention work undertaken both to change human behaviours and work to improve electrical supply and appliance design.
