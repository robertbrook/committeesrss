&#xa0;Written evidence from Sam Kuper (CYS0083)&#xa0;As a citizen of the UK, who uses cycling as his primary form of transport, I am writing in a personal capacity. I wish to make two points:&#xa0;&#xa0;Point 1=======&#xa0;The following document was commissioned by the Department for Transport:&#xa0;Title:     Driversâ€™ perceptions of cyclists Authors:   L Basford; S Reid; T Lester; J Thomson; A Tolmie Date:      01/01/2002 Reference: TRL549 ISBN:      1-84608-548-9 ISSN:      0968-4107&#xa0;It addresses issues central to your committee's concerns. Your committee should not conclude until every member has read that document. It is only 38 pages long, so this should be quite manageable.&#xa0;For convenience, I note that the document has been mirrored at: http://www.southamptontriclub.co.uk/storage/TRL549.pdf&#xa0;&#xa0;Point 2=======&#xa0;It is better for the committee to take a little longer, and to draw sound conclusions, than for the committee to conclude sooner and draw invalid conclusions.&#xa0;Additionally, it is dangerous to draw conclusions on a topic from a position of ignorance in relation to that topic.&#xa0;There are many forms of ignorance. The Transport Select Committee on cycling safety, in taking (ostensibly) knowledge-based submissions from a range of stakeholders, is trying to reduce the ignorance of its members, to improve the quality of the eventual findings of the committee. That is laudable.&#xa0;However, as the following two articles makes clear, several members of the Transport Select Committee on cycling safety lack - and apparently are likely to remain lacking - in not only knowledge but also in recent and extensive *experience* relating to cycling on the public highway in the UK.&#xa0;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/dec/03/transport-committee-cycling http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/dec/05/cyclists-select-committee-london&#xa0;Unless that is remedied, the committee's conclusions will be made from a position of significant ignorance, no matter how extensively the committee consults. Fortunately, this is easily and inexpensively remedied - assuming that the committee members are sincere in their desire to understand the dangers cyclists face.&#xa0;I therefore propose the committee adopts the following rule:&#xa0;Before any contribution from a member of the Transport Select Committee on cycling safety can be included in the committee's written findings, that member must prove that he or she has:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; travelled, by pedal cycle, on each of at least 100 days of the preceding 365 days, a distance of at least one mile on the public highway in the UK; and-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; travelled, by pedal cycle, at least 20 miles in total on A-roads within the preceding 365 days.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
