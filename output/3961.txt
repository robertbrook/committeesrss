[[[Written evidence from David ]]]

[[[Tredrea]]]

[[[ (GMC0017)]]]&#xa0;

[[[GMC effectiveness concerns]]]&#xa0;I write this letter in a personal capacity as David Tredrea, 12 Harley Street, London W1G 9PG. &#xa0;1: I regret feeling obliged to bring this sordid affair to your attention.  I feel it is something which affects the very DNA of the GMC and its inability to deal with complex but important rogue doctor cases.  &#xa0;              2:  For me, the matter started in 2008 when I made serious allegations to the               GMC about physician BB.  She so abused one of her young daughters               there was a suicidal crisis.  I was brought in to assist this child, safeguard her               future and help the family re-establish its moral compass.  In the main I was               successful and achieved all objectives.  The daughter is now an adult,               independent and has completed a university degree.  BB has divorced and               now lives alone, estranged from family. &#xa0;3: I submitted evidences to the GMC in 2008 but they felt then there was insufficient evidence to challenge her ‘fitness to practice’.  I have supplied various evidences since and now there are some 90 independently verified               and dispirit threads showing this doctor to be an exceptional risk to others – professionally and otherwise.  The catalogue showing 66 of these was sent to the GMC 12 months ago.  The bottom line is the GMC makes some noises of grunt but fails to take robust action.  This is largely because BB has the hallmarks of a vexatious litigant and constantly Appeals in the various Courts (criminal and civil) in which she has regularly appeared since 2008.  &#xa0;4:  On 19th November 2013 I wrote to the GMC with:  ‘I have your email of November 15th informing me of the GMC position but note there is still nothing tangible by way of evidence or effort.  My anxiety is that in 12 months I will be fobbed off with similar platitude and secrecy.  As a victim of serious crime               committed by BB 5 years ago, I am no longer prepared to accept the GMC               lack of progress report as satisfactory.  If, as you say, this case is at a crucial point, I need to alert the Police to ramp up protection because of BB’s past history and evidence the GMC already has of her retaining the disreputable for nefarious activities. Clearly she would see me as a prime target that needs to be quietened so she can continue with her various mischiefs.  I see no evidence of change in her alarming mental disorders. The GMC shares duty with me to protect my family and home as much as possible.’  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              5:  On November 27th 2013 The GMC replies with:  ‘Finally, in terms of               protection for you and your family this is not a matter for the GMC and if you               have concerns for your safety and well-being you should raise these with the               Police’.  &#xa0;              6:  On its Internet home page, the GMC shows five core organisational               values which underpin everything it does:  &#xa0;                            1: We protect the public through the work that we do.                            2: We treat everyone fairly.                            3: We are honest and strive to be open and transparent.                            4: We are committed to excellence in everything we do.                            5: We are a listening and learning organisation.&#xa0;              These values form the basis on which our organisation operates. We want               every decision we make, every interaction we have and every email we write               to embody our values.&#xa0;              7: There is evidence the GMC has previously lied in aspects of this case.  The               conclusion I reach is that the GMC is unable to address this case with               appropriate seriousness, resource and priority.  BB has shown on many               occasions that Harold Shipman and similar reprobates are cases she has               studied carefully.  This doctor actively lied to a GMC FtP about 12               months ago that led to a ‘no sanctions’ verdict despite being dismissed for               gross professional conduct and lack of trust from her NHS employers.  BB               was sacked with immediate effect because of sustained dishonesty.                              8:  BB submitted her own Application to the Supreme Court of Judicature               that               she ‘lacked mental capacity’ concerning another case she was running at the               time her NHS suspension started – yet still saw fit to see private patients.                             9: Despite knowing this information, the current position is the GMC has               absolutely no restrictions on her current licence to practice despite knowing in               detail about 66 independent, separately evidenced challenges to her probity               and risk to patients.  &#xa0;10;  It is my view that whilst the GMC has gloss and fine words for its web-site and publications, when faced with tough, rough doctors it is easily subjugated and lacks the spirit, wherewithal and other means to meet its objectives.  &#xa0;              11:  In complaint to the PSA they take a similar stance of timidity.  Their               Chairman recommends the case is taken to the Privy Council.  &#xa0;

[[[Recommendation:  ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I would like the HSC to highlight this case as an example where the GMC ‘talks the talk’ but stridently and knowingly fails in its core duty to protect patients and public. I would also like the HSC to continue to monitor the progress of this important case.  &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
