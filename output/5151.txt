&#xa0;Written evidence from SICPA UK [TOB19]&#xa0;1.    I am writing to you in order to contribute to the evidence which you are considering in the course of your inquiry into tobacco smuggling and the trade in illicit tobacco. In this letter we seek to explain how the UK could make progress in combating the illicit trade in tobacco products and increase tax revenues through the application of the latest secure tracking and tracing technology.  We stand ready to provide additional information as required.&#xa0;

[[[Our expertise                                     ]]]&#xa0;2.    SICPA is the leading international provider of security inks to central banks and high security printers for the production of bank notes. SICPA is also a

[[[es]]]. The company’s SICPATRACE® platform is the basis for a number of successful national systems which have significantly raised tax revenues and reduced levels of fraud. Systems covering a range of products have been implemented in a diverse range of countries across the globe including e.g. Turkey (since 2007), Brazil (since 2008), the states of California and Massachusetts. Currently almost 80bn units of product are being marked and controlled by our systems annually. In consequence the company has extensive firsthand experience of the daily problems faced by governments and enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat the illicit trade in tobacco products and to maximise tax revenue collected. &#xa0;3.    Since its inception and initial deployment the SICPATRACE® platform has been continually developed in order to broaden the range of solutions available to our government clients. Attention has also been given to ensuring minimal interference with the activities of manufacturers and other stakeholders and to assure a level playing field for large and small manufacturers alike. The latest innovations and developments take full account of the requirements of the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) including the provisions of the Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco products (IPT) adopted in late 2012 in Seoul and which requires the introduction of a global tracking and tracing regime as a means of combating the illicit trade.&#xa0;

[[[ tracing and tracking functionality]]] would have significant positive impact and should be part of a comprehensive approach.  &#xa0;In summary this positive impact would result from:&#xa0;

[[[What is a secure track and trace system?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.    A secure track and trace system begins by securely marking a unit of product (e.g. a pack of cigarettes) and assigning to it a unique identity which is stored in a government owned and controlled database. This can be done in such a way as to provide a fully reliable test of authenticity and to be information rich (linked to data about e.g. product type, time and place of manufacture, intended market of sale et al). The unique identity and the database are the building blocks of a tracking capability which allows the unit to be followed throughout the supply chain - if required up to the point of sale to the consumer.  They also provide the means to trace backwards in real-time to point of origin/manufacture etc. at anytime during the product lifecycle. 

[[[A properly secure system is essential to meet the challenge of ever more sophisticated organised crime groups.]]]&#xa0;

[[[The key components]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.    The 

[[[quality of the marking system is key]]]. Marks that are properly secure and well-designed to meet the needs of the different stakeholders, such as those recommended by SICPA, are easy to use, make counterfeiting virtually impossible and provide information that enables enforcement. We assess that the current UK protection system (which we understand combines an easy-to-copy black ink ‘UK tax paid’ mark combined with a material-based feature on the tear tape) to be relatively weak. Moreover illicit cigarettes in high quality counterfeited packaging are difficult for enforcers to identify in real-time and need to be verified by manufacturers, which can cause inconvenience and delay.&#xa0;7.    SICPA recommends a 

[[[multi-layered approach combining material-based ]]]

[[[security ]]]

[[[features]]] (security inks which are both visible and invisible),

[[[ ]]]

[[[IT security]]]

[[[ features]]] (2D secure matrix, visible and/or invisible) and 

[[[forensic features]]].  Secure overt features can be seen by consumers thus encouraging good citizenship; additional semi-covert features can be made available to e.g. retailers so they can protect themselves from unscrupulous suppliers; covert features can be verified by enforcers using bespoke checking equipment and used as evidence.&#xa0;8.    Both domestically produced (including for export if required) and imported product can be marked, but by definition it is only possible to mark product which is produced in a declared/legitimate manufacturing facility and/or legitimately imported. This does not mean (as some manufacturers might claim) that the implementation of such a system has no impact on the black and grey markets (where product moves between illegitimate and legitimate channels). Illegal product (i.e. produced illegally such as ‘illicit whites’ or illegal by virtue of being non-tax paid) would be immediately identifiable to all stakeholders by the absence of the appropriate secure mark. Checks by enforcers (linked back in real-time to the national database and able to share with and interact with other government databases) produce data not only to answer the question ‘is this genuine or not?’ but to other enquiries such as ‘Is this supposed to be coming here?’ and ‘What tax has been paid?’  &#xa0;

[[[Business intelligence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.    Techniques for exploiting data are progressing every day and, as more data is collected over-time, become ever more powerful. Data analysis and automated comparison of different data sets can identify patterns and anomalies which allow enforcers to make interventions against targets that would otherwise not have been spotted and to identify changes in criminal behaviours. It also allows performance management of enforcer interventions (e.g. by locality or type) clarifying which interventions worked best.  &#xa0;

[[[International agreements]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]10.    The UK was an adopting party to the Protocol of the WHO FCTC to ‘Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products’ in Seoul in November 2012. As on so many topics where the UK has taken the lead, what the UK does in relation to the Protocol will be watched by other countries and followed by them. Much of the UK’s problem has its origin overseas (‘upstream’) and proper implementation in these countries would positively impact on the UK.&#xa0;11.    The Protocol recognises the crucial global dimension of the illicit trade in tobacco products and the need to ensure international co-operation and joint working. Among the measures agreed is, in Article 8 of the Protocol, 

[[[the requirement to implement national track and trace systems which are globally inter-operable]]]. The Protocol foresees a five year period after coming into force for compliant national systems to be in place. In order to maximise value for money and longevity it is important that any system foreseen in the UK takes full account of the provisions of the Protocol, which includes the requirement that any system be 

[[[fully controlled by government and independent of the tobacco manufacturers]]]. &#xa0;12.    Having followed the process of negotiation with care and adapted our Research and Development programme to take account of it, we are conscious that implementing the spirit as well as the letter of the Protocol in an efficient way will not be a straight forward exercise e.g. it requires accurate aggregation (linking a single unit to higher level packaging i.e. a pack of cigarettes to its carton, and a carton to its mastercase et al) which requires high-level technical and engineering expertise as well as advanced IT. In this area, as in others, SICPA is a patent holder. &#xa0;

[[[Common approaches]]]

[[[ between Ireland and UK]]]&#xa0;13.    The Committee has specifically noted its interest in the interrelationship between Ireland and the UK. Ireland currently has a tax stamp containing security features but no track and trace functionality. We believe that in the absence of a decision in the UK to follow suit, the implementation of standardised packaging in Ireland is likely to have little short term impact in the UK. Irish tax paid product (in contrast to tax paid product in some other EU countries) is at least as expensive as UK tax paid product and not attractive to illicit traders. It is possible that implementation of standardised packages may encourage a rise in counterfeit product which imitates the standardised packs but this is likely to be essentially an Irish problem. These packs could be traded in Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK, but they would be clearly identifiable as non-UK tax paid. In the longer term and in view of proximity, current smuggling routes and the WHO FCTC IPT requirements, there would however be advantage in ensuring joint or fully compatible implementation of compliant control systems in Ireland and the UK. &#xa0;&#xa0;
