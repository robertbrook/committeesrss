[normal]Submission from Paul Wicks[bold]My name is Paul Wicks and I have been a full scope electrician for over 25+ years and I work in the Domestic, Commercial and Industrial sector.
[normal]I have seen a lot of changes over the years but since the introduction of Part P there has been a massive 
[normal]increase of company’s that have grown on the back of Part P.
[normal]I was a member of an electrical scheme operator for 5 years from June 2008 to June 2013 and I was assessed once when I joined and then NEVER EVER assessed again and yet I paid my scheme fee’s eve
[normal]ry year which has an assessment fee built in.
[normal]I have qualifications that were gained through a college course that was just short of 4 years long, I also have Inspection &amp; Testing and the current electrical 17
[normal]th
[normal] edition, this I feel is the minimum 
[normal]standard
[normal] that an electrician should have to be classed as an electrician as with the years at college teach you the fundamental basics of electricity.
[normal]One of the massive increases I have seen is these 6 week courses that have flooded the market since Part P, this 
[normal]has to end before someone is seriously injured or worse killed as you cannot learn to be an electrician in 6 weeks.
[normal]I have watched the government talks where you address the money making schemes that have ripped off genuine tradesmen for a long long time, 
[normal]I feel it would be a better path to make to scrap all schemes and bring a ONE government monitored scheme that I know I would join, I feel that nearly all electricians would join this ONE scheme as the general public and tradesmen are confused by the vario
[normal]us registers and schemes that have flooded the market since Part P.
[normal]In short get rid of the schemes and have one government monitored scheme.
[normal]To join this scheme you need to have all the qualifications that are needed with the core courses covered in a col
[normal]lege at least one day a week for 3 years.
[normal]In the long run you will have qualified electricians carrying out electrical work. 
[normal]If the government were to make it a legal requirement to get the rental market to have their electrics checked every year like gas
[normal] has to be then the safety will increase in homes across the country.
[normal]Thank you for taking the time to read this
