"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Wolverhampton City Council (FDC24)Executive SummaryRecommendations Wolverhampton City Council asks for the following recommendations to be considered. That central government:\nLifts the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing and encourages prudent borrowing to stimulate growth.\nResponses to questions&#xa0;There are already a number of schemes \nwhich \noperate on a Black Country basis, including \noffsetting local priorities for\n \nfunding streams from the European\n Regional Development Fund\n and\n the\n European Social Fund\n. \nIt\n would be sensible to create the devolved area along Black Country lines, where relationships and structure\ns already exist and new powers c\nould work alongside existing schemes. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCentralised skills and employment training do not meet Wolverhampton’s needs. If such public services were fully devolved they could be adapted to fit business demands, offering \ntraining \nin\n \nskills areas in line\n \nwith \nlocal \nva\ncancies\n. \nRather than just ‘complementing’ devolution, these public services should be an integral part of de-centralisati\non\n.\n This would enable them to provide a holistic approach to service provision and \nuse funding in the most e\nffective\n way. \nHowever such devolution would need to be complemented with sufficient investment from central government to tackle problems \nprevalent in\n deprived areas like the Black Country. \nResolving issues\n around employability and skills gaps would need to be \na key\n par\nt of the devolution process, or regional growth could not be realised. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Black Country devolved area would be governed via the joint committee model. \nThis structure \nhas \nalready been established to\n \ndeal with the Government’s agenda for greater local decision making under\n the\n City Deal and Growth Deal\n, and existing relationships \ncould\n be \nexpanded\n. \n&#xa0;\nAny decision made by the Joint Committee is in law a dec\nision of all four councils’ Cabinets. The membership of the Joint Committee is made up of the four leaders of the Black Country councils. The chair of the LEP has a right to attend and speak at meetings but cannot cast a vote. There is also an existing sup\nplementary Advisory Group which presents proposals to the Joint Committee. Such proposals \ncan come from\n any of the councils, individually or jointly, and/or the Black Country Consortium and LEP. \n&#xa0;\nThis existing structure would be used to implement fiscal d\nevolution in the Black Country. Each council would remain independent in other matters and hold their own elections. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe devolved area would be governed by the existing joint committee structure. Each authority would maintain its independence and hold its own elections. There would also be a local authority representative on each LEP board. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;There is already evidence of suc\ncessful joint working in Wolverhampton.\n Recently, Jaguar Land Rover \nselected\n the i54 si\nte as the location for its new engine plant\n.\n This was brought about by joint working between \nWolverhampton City Council\n, Staffordshire County Council and South Staffords\nhire \nDistrict \nCouncil.  \nMOOG also opted to move its new plant to\n \ni54 and stay within the region. This was only made possible \nwith support from Wolverhampton City Council, Staffordshire County Council and Staffordshire Council. \nWolverhampton City Council\n and Staffordshire County Council have borrowed £37 million against the business rates they will receive from the Enterprise Zone. This loan will fund the changes to the M54 slip road, \ngiving\n \neasier access to the Zone. It\n is believed that this \nis the first\n time local authorities have been responsible for funding major changes to a motorway. Evidently, greater economic freedoms coupled with effective partnerships allow more innovative ways of working. \nGreater economic control would incentivise more private i\nnvestment in joint ventures, and would enable Wolverhampton to plan for the long term. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFiscal devolution to the Black Country would provide wider geographical benefits. The subsequent economic growth would act as a catalyst for wider growth and enable further opportunities for expanded partnership w\nork. Additionally, a vibrant job market in the Black Country would\n create jobs for both Black Country residents and our catchment areas whilst\n encourag\ning\n relocation to its surrounding areas.  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReform of the existing system is essential, but t\nhere is no preference as to whether it would precede or be part of large scale constitutional change, as long as it happened. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAll of the taxes mentioned above would be welcomed as part of \na \ndevolution\n scheme\n. Even if the regulation of council tax was relaxed, instead of fully devolved, the impact \non Wolverhampton \nwould be positive. \nRe-banding properties and the removal of the referendum threshold would give far greater freedom\n and enable the local authority to respond to local needs\n. The de-centralisation of stamp duty would enable \nWolverhampton City Council\n to encourage regeneration in\n certain\n local areas\n, by reducing\n or waiving stamp duty. The tax could also be used to discourage development in overcrowded areas. \nThe devolution of business rates\n has the potential to be beneficial\n, if such devolution is comp\nlemented by Single Pot funding\n. It would enable \nWolverhampton City Council\n to invest to save\n,\n and enter into long term commitments with LEPs and other private sector partners, \nwith \na secure funding stream\n in the future\n. \nIt would cut red tape, by enabling t\nhe local authority to give reductions when appropriate\n to encourage economic growth\n, rather than businesses having to negotiate a complex system of applying for a discount. Business owners would be able to scrutinise more closely the setting of business ra\ntes, as they would be established on a local basis. It would enable the authority to \nbetter \nengage with business leaders\n,\n and react more quickly to changing economic circumstances across the city. \nHowever such freedoms would only produce economic growth if\n they were supplemented by LEP Growth Deal funding to help tackle the barriers to growth in the Black Country. \nThese include contaminated land and a lack of infrastructure. \n&#xa0;\nFlexibility regarding council tax and business rates would be welcomed in the short term before full devolution \noccurs.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Wolverhampton City Council\n would welcome the \nremoval\n of the c\nap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing. This would enable increased housing construction and a future revenue stream \nof rents\n paid to the council. Some l\nevel of monitoring could remain\n to ensure \nsensible construction\n. \nIf councils were given full control o\nver business rates and their revenue, then more borrowing would not \nnecessarily be needed. \nFurthermore, a secure revenue stream would give councils more confidence to borrow. There should also be a change in the dialogue surrounding borrowing - rather than\n being seen as bad \ndebt it should be encouraged, if carried out prudently \nand sensibly, to stimulate growth. \nSupport from central government and Europe \nfor land remediation\n \nwould be necessary in order to make such projects financially viable for private investors. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe most appropriate scope would be to enable \nlocal authoritie\ns to raise funds by any means, \nbut not levy new taxes, unless they were accompanied with a very low administrative burden. \nRevenue raising methods such as a local VAT would most likely result in excessive amounts of\n local\n \nbureaucracy\n and re\nd tape.\n \nTraded and non-statutory services should be allowed to make a profit, which would be re-invested back into the council. The local authority should have full discret\nion regarding fees and charges\n, including services such as licensing and planning. \nFurthermore, such discretionary charges could help discourage undesirable licenses being granted, or mitigate their effects, in a similar way to the night time levy (which should also be discretionary to adapt to local circumstance\ns\n).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Redistribution of \nthe \nproceeds \nof growth \nwould need to be treated carefully. Some areas will still suffer from disproportionate stagnation and will need add\nitional funding, but local authorities should\n not\n be dis-incentivised to succeed. The level of revenue allowed before being re-distributed should be proportionate to the levels of deprivation within the area – the level of reward should match the effort in\nvested. If some areas are very successful solely because of their location, their threshold should be lower. \nThe economic landscape of \nBritain\n is not a level playing field and such \nfinancial \nredistribution should \nbe used to \nhelp \naddress\n this inequity. \nWolverhampton City Council\n strongly emphasise the need for fairness in the redistribution of funds, and for the levels of deprivation within each devolved area to be taken into account when allocating funding. \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
