defaultThe report examined two key issues within the context of newspaper coverage during the London 2012 Olympics.

defaultFirst,

defaultthe
default interdependent relationship 
defaultof mainstream media and certain sports and second, the gendering of
default sport and media.

defaultMedia platforms have over the past twenty years developed technologically and 
defaultsome sports have benefited
default more than others from building relationships with media in general and in particular TV. The revenue from
default 
defaultTV rights has been import
defaultant in the growth and global dominance of men’s football/soccer. G
defaultolf
default, boxing and cricket are

defaultalso 
defaultwinners
default as are big events like the Olympics. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMore than any other event the Olympics provides a platform for men and women athletes from many sports to deli
defaultver entertainment to global audiences. The sporting drama of failure and success, resilience and heroism, leadership and loyalty is spellbinding and for millions of people is a window into the sporting world.

defaultSuch media and sport

defaultare unique, yet they have become a widespread benchmark for judging media approaches to different sports and sporting events. Alongside this benchmark is often an argument suggesting that media should be more open to a model of fairness which means shared 
defaultcoverage 
defaultand as such greater access to financial success.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Gender Hub who undertook this research believe gende
defaultr, sport and media are a nexus
default which together can effect greater understanding about the value of social change 
defaultand serves to diminish
default social
default inequalities. In order for such change to be realised sport and media organisations have an important role
default that
default can be enhanced by engaging with gender specialists who work in these sectors.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWomen are increasingly breaking down barriers in business, ar
defaultts, science and sport
default. W
defaulthile superficially numbers are greater in all areas, structural change is slow.  Drawing on the analysis of newspaper data (over 2000 pages) collected during four weeks in 2012 when the London Olympics were held
default we want 
defaultto encourage
default more sophisticated debates
default. Such debates could include professionalism and grassroots sport, resource allocation of finance and media, leadership and governance of sporting bodies and the influence of gender in all aspects of sport.  We want to
default facilitate
default more effec
defaulttive and inclusive strategies that can
default be employed by 
defaultsporting bodies and media owners to deliver a broader and deeper menu of men’s and women’s sport
default.
