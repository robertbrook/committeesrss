[normal]The report examined two key issues within the context of newspaper coverage during the London 2012 Olympics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]First,
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] interdependent relationship 
[normal]of mainstream media and certain sports and second, the gendering of
[normal] sport and media.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Media platforms have over the past twenty years developed technologically and 
[normal]some sports have benefited
[normal] more than others from building relationships with media in general and in particular TV. The revenue from
[normal] 
[normal]TV rights has been import
[normal]ant in the growth and global dominance of men’s football/soccer. G
[normal]olf
[normal], boxing and cricket are
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]winners
[normal] as are big events like the Olympics. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]More than any other event the Olympics provides a platform for men and women athletes from many sports to deli
[normal]ver entertainment to global audiences. The sporting drama of failure and success, resilience and heroism, leadership and loyalty is spellbinding and for millions of people is a window into the sporting world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Such media and sport 
[normal]relationship
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are unique, yet they have become a widespread benchmark for judging media approaches to different sports and sporting events. Alongside this benchmark is often an argument suggesting that media should be more open to a model of fairness which means shared 
[normal]coverage 
[normal]and as such greater access to financial success.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Gender Hub who undertook this research believe gende
[normal]r, sport and media are a nexus
[normal] which together can effect greater understanding about the value of social change 
[normal]and serves to diminish
[normal] social
[normal] inequalities. In order for such change to be realised sport and media organisations have an important role
[normal] that
[normal] can be enhanced by engaging with gender specialists who work in these sectors.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Women are increasingly breaking down barriers in business, ar
[normal]ts, science and sport
[normal]. W
[normal]hile superficially numbers are greater in all areas, structural change is slow.  Drawing on the analysis of newspaper data (over 2000 pages) collected during four weeks in 2012 when the London Olympics were held
[normal] we want 
[normal]to encourage
[normal] more sophisticated debates
[normal]. Such debates could include professionalism and grassroots sport, resource allocation of finance and media, leadership and governance of sporting bodies and the influence of gender in all aspects of sport.  We want to
[normal] facilitate
[normal] more effec
[normal]tive and inclusive strategies that can
[normal] be employed by 
[normal]sporting bodies and media owners to deliver a broader and deeper menu of men’s and women’s sport
[normal].
