[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Solid Fuel Association (HOT03)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Solid Fuel Association is the organisation which represents the producers, distributors, retailers and manufacturers of the British domestic solid fuel sector
[normal] including wood fuel
[normal] producers
[normal]. We provide consumer guidance and technical support for installers, other industry professionals and the general public. 
[normal]The SFA also administer the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme in accordance with the requirements of Tradin
[normal]g Standards and in this capacity work very closely with the Coal Merchants Federation.
[normal]We have recently launched the Approved Woodfuel Merchant Scheme to protect consumers in this rapidly growing sector of the solid fuel industry.
[normal]Coal mining
[normal] itself
[normal] is wor
[normal]th around £1 billion to the UK economy. 
[normal]Around 
[normal]5
[normal],000 British people are employed directly in the industry and at least another 20,000 are dependent on the various support industries around coal for their living. Many of this number are in areas that are a
[normal]lready economically disadvantaged.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]The SFA 
[normal]believe
[normal] that the 
[normal]true value of coal to the UK
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]including
[normal] its potential 
[normal]contribution to the
[normal] domestic sector
[normal],
[normal] is currently being completely 
[normal]disregarded
[normal].
[normal]Recent initiatives from government and in particular the Green Deal seem to completely 
[normal]dismiss
[normal] the
[normal] benefits of solid fuel heating. There is a dichotomy at the heart of government policy which sets solid fuels
[normal] apart 
[normal]from other fossil fuels
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have set out
[normal] below in simple terms what our industry has to offer 
[normal]in terms of economy, security and sustainability 
[normal]and why coal 
[normal]has 
[normal]all 
[normal]the credentials to be a fuel of the future.

[normal]olid

[normal]uel 
[normal]heating 
[normal]compares very favourably with 
[normal]its competitors
[normal]. 
[normal]This is
[normal] of 
[normal]particular
[normal] note
[normal] 
[normal]when solid fuel is compared 
[normal]with
[normal] the fuels available to consumers who are beyond the 
[normal]reach of the 
[normal]gas grid.

[normal]within the

[normal]),
[normal] 
[normal]a switch to

[normal] for central heating could yield savings of 17% against

[normal]The direct
[normal] comparison 
[normal]of 
[normal]solid fuel running costs
[normal] 
[normal]against those of its competitors
[normal] 
[normal]make
[normal]s
[normal] it all the more incredible 
[normal]that 
[normal]no solid fuel measures 
[normal]qualify for Green Deal finance. This effectively means that 
[normal]under an initiative 
[normal]designed in part
[normal] to alleviate fuel poverty, 
[normal]solid fuel customers are not able to up
[normal]-
[normal]grade their heating without switching fuels. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is 
[normal]highly un
[normal]likely that 
[normal]a switch away from solid fuel would yield 
[normal]any financial savings and it is 
[normal]even possible
[normal] that 
[normal]such a switch would plu
[normal]nge the consumer
[normal] into fuel poverty.
[normal] 
[normal]Ironically
[normal], the
[normal] installation of an 
[normal]anthracite burner 
[normal]or a 
[normal]multifuel stove 
[normal]with boiler 
[normal]could result in
[normal] an
[normal] 
[normal]immediate and 
[normal]consi
[normal]derable improvement for very little capital cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The economic advantage of solid fuel is even more clear-cut 
[normal]when considering 
[normal]secondary space heating. 
[normal]For a number of years, s
[normal]mokeless solid fuel 
[normal]has
[normal]

[normal]In 
[normal]addition
[normal], the cost of solid mineral fuel has shown a marked stability compared to the volatile fluctuations seen in the prices of 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]competitors
[normal] i
[normal].
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal] gas and electricity
[normal].  Solid fuel costs 
[normal]have risen
[normal] in a steady way 
[normal]and 
[normal]have
[normal] stayed consistently lower than the other f
[normal]uels. More
[normal] importantly
[normal], solid mineral fuel is
[normal] 
[normal]dramatically
[normal] less expensive than 
[normal]all
[normal] 
[normal]other fuels
[normal] in the off-grid sector.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]Security of [bold]s[bold]upply[bold] and sustainability[bold]The majority of solid fuel supplied to the domestic market is from indigenous sources. The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]market
[normal] for mineral fuel
[normal] is 
[normal]estimated to be 
[normal]around 1 million tonnes. 
[normal]Total domestic production of coal is currently 
[normal]around
[normal] 17 million tonnes and with a l
[normal]evel playing field and 
[normal]a 
[normal]proper coal 
[normal]strategy in place
[normal] to give more certainty for invest
[normal]ors
[normal], this could easily be increased to over 20 million tonnes. With 
[normal]proven 
[normal]reserves of 
[normal]over 1.5
[normal] billion tonnes
[normal] and potential reserves of over 3.5 billion
[normal], this level of
[normal] production could be sustained for many years into the future.
[normal]We believe it is fair to say that 
[normal]in the UK and the rest of the world, 
[normal]solid mineral fuel is the most secure of all fossil fuels. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]security
[normal] of solid fuel supplies 
[normal]contrasts starkly with nat
[normal]ural gas
[normal],
[normal] for example
[normal]. During 
[normal]periods of sustained colder weather
[normal] in 
[normal]Central 
[normal]Europe,
[normal] history shows that
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]gas price rises steeply along with demand from both domestic and power markets. Other factors that 
[normal]impact on 
[normal]the security of 
[normal]gas include
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]errorism 
[normal](
[normal]g
[normal]as supply lines from 
[normal]abroad
[normal] 
[normal]and LNG storage terminals in the UK are obvious targets for terrorism
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]geo-
[normal]p
[normal]olitical impacts (
[normal]s
[normal]upplies 
[normal]across borders
[normal] 
[normal]have been
[normal] interrupted for 
[normal]arbitrary
[normal] reasons)
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]emporary shortage 
[normal](d
[normal]uring periods of shortage, domestic su
[normal]pplies 
[normal]for 
[normal]gas producing countries will take precedence over exports
[normal])
[normal] all of which 
[normal]have the potential to 
[normal]constrain supplies 
[normal]and massively
[normal] increase 
[normal]the gas price
[normal].
[normal] Moreover, as the gas price is
[normal] also
[normal] inextricably linked to oil, household heating costs are subject to the volatility of world energy prices.
[normal]Th
[normal]is year’s spring 
[normal]cold snap saw natural gas reserves plummet to dangerously low levels and the UK become 
[normal]wholly
[normal] dependent on shipped supplies from t
[normal]he 
[normal]M
[normal]iddle 
[normal]E
[normal]ast.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the individual 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]solid fuel 
[normal]consumer, 
[normal]the 
[normal]security of supply 
[normal]benefit of solid fuel 
[normal]is further 
[normal]enhanced by the fact 
[normal]that 
[normal]they
[normal] 
[normal]themselves 
[normal]can hold stock. This not only insulates against the effect of price increases but it also gives a degree of self-sufficiency that other fuels just cannot match. 
[normal]Moreover, a
[normal] solid fuel or multifuel boiler stove does not need electricity to heat  a room or 
[normal]produce domestic hot water
[normal] and b
[normal]ecause of its high calorific value (about four times that of wood),
[normal] it is likely that
[normal] one full bunker of solid mineral fuel  could sustain a stove through the worst of the winter.
[normal]A roomheater or stove of the type that many 
[normal]people use for secondary heating could easily heat one or more rooms throughout the winter with just one full bunker
[normal] of fuel
[normal]. If the stove was flat-topped, a kettle of hot water would also be available - even during power cuts.
[normal](A jacket potato cooked in t
[normal]he ashpit or hot buttered toast could also be on the menu
[normal] with solid fuel
[normal]!)
[normal]In summary, 
[normal]we believe that 
[normal]s
[normal]ecurity of supply and stability of price are two
[normal] sides of the same coin and that indigenous 
[normal]solid fuel 
[normal]is stronger in both 
[normal]these 
[normal]areas than its competi
[normal]tors
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]Environment[bold]Modern coal mining practices are very much 
[normal]geared towards
[normal] protection of the environment. Where coal extraction at a site has ceased, mining companies 
[normal]are duty bound to 
[normal]restore the area affected
[normal]. I
[normal]n 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]restoration projects
[normal], 
[normal]reclamation of derelict land means that 
[normal]the appearance and amenity 
[normal]of a site is an improvement on what was there before mining commenced
[normal].

[normal] vivid

[normal]the industry’s commitment to the environment

[normal] to respect natural environments 
[normal]and 
[normal]to 
[normal]accommodate conservation
[normal] 
[normal]as part of the planning requirements of
[normal] their projects.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. [bold]Emissions[bold]Many solid mineral fuels are authorised for use in smoke control areas. This is because they are very low in 
[normal]moisture and 
[normal]volatile organic content (less than 10% 
[normal]volatiles 
[normal]compared to around 
[normal]50-
[normal]60% for wood fuel)
[normal]. Smokeless mineral fuels
[normal] 
[normal]burn very cleanly 
[normal]with low levels of organic gaseous and particulate emissions. 
[normal]With regard to 
[normal]greenhouse gas 
[normal]emissions, 
[normal]it is an indisputable fact that when anything burns, carbon dioxide is emitted. However, 
[normal]the SFA believe that an artificial distinction is 
[normal]being 
[normal]made be
[normal]tween coal and other 
[normal]competing 
[normal]fuels. For instance, woody biomass is assumed to be carbon neutral when in fact this is only partially true even for wood from a sustainable source. 
[normal]Any type of fuel requires the input of energy to bring it to the market – me
[normal]chanical harvesting, transport and preparation/processing must be taken into account to arrive at an energy return against
[normal] energy
[normal] invest
[normal]ed
[normal]. This is sometimes expressed as an EPR (Energy Performance Ratio). An EPR of less than 1 indicates that more energy h
[normal]as been invested than returned. 
[normal]For timber 
[normal]obtained 
[normal]from non-sustainable sources, the carbon dioxide emissions are at least as great as for coal. For a highly processed 
[normal]and imported 
[normal]product such as wood pellets, the
[normal] CO₂
[normal] emissions 
[normal]are likely to
[normal] 
[normal]be greater 
[normal]than for coal.
[normal]In reality, the total indigenous supply of sustainable wood fuel is 
[normal]extremely limited and when added to the growing demand from electricity generators, 80% of wood fuel 
[normal]will be imported in bulk carriers from overseas. In many cases, this imp
[normal]orted timber is produced by the clear felling of thousands of acres of virgin forest which is not replanted. This not only has a catastrophic effect on local ecosystems but also means that this material is by no means renewable. Even if trees were replante
[normal]d, it would take many decades or even centuries to re-sequester the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during combustion. This is known as a “carbon debt”. Because biomass emits more carbon dioxide than 
[normal]mineral fuel
[normal] per kW of 
[normal]heat energy
[normal] generated, emissions
[normal] over any sensible timescale are greater than for coal.
[normal]To make matters worse, the pellets themselves are a highly processed product requiring high levels of energy input throughout their production and transport.
[normal]We understand that t
[normal]he Government’s own an
[normal]alysis shows that the use of whole trees as power station feedstock will increase greenhouse gas emissions by at least 49% compared to coal (Searchinger 2012). 
[normal]Power station use is likely to completely eclipse the domestic supply chain and eliminate
[normal] even
[normal] t
[normal]he 
[normal]very 
[normal]dubious environmental benefits of biomass.
[normal]It should be obvious to all, regardless of political affiliation or views on climate change that measures aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions should not increase them. 
[normal]As far as wood fuel is concerned, the SFA firmly believe that the very limited supplies of indigenous wood fuel would be better burnt 
[normal]alongside mineral fuel 
[normal]on domestic stoves at 70% efficiency rather than in power stations at 30% efficiency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A 
[normal]2012
[normal] report by 
[normal]Princet
[normal]on academic Timothy Searchinger entitled “Dirtier than coal?”suggests that emissions from biomass are 49% greater than for coal.
[normal]Locally sourced
[normal],
[normal] well-seasoned logs will have the 
[normal]lowest emissions among biomass products. 
[normal]Indeed, a
[normal] multifue
[normal]l stove burning a 50:50 mix of coal and logs from a sustainable 
[normal]woodland 
[normal]source could have a smaller “carbon footprint” than a gas boiler.
[normal]If we compare coal
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]natural gas
[normal],
[normal] carbon dioxide emissions 
[normal]for gas 
[normal]at the point of use are lower than for coal, givi
[normal]ng 
[normal]it
[normal] a lower 
[normal]“
[normal]carbon intensity
[normal]”
[normal]. However,
[normal] the total 
[normal]“
[normal]global warming potential
[normal]”
[normal] of gas may be very much greater than 
[normal]this
[normal] figure
[normal] indicates
[normal] due to
[normal] unintentional releases, 
[normal]leakage
[normal]s
[normal] from pipelines etc. 
[normal]This is because 
[normal]methane
[normal] (natural gas)
[normal] is considered to have a global 
[normal]warming potential 
[normal]23
[normal] times 
[normal]greater than carbon dioxide.
[normal] 
[normal]Shale gas has been widely touted 
[normal]in
[normal] some quarters as a “silver bullet” for energy supplies. Unfortunately, despite the hype, shale gas has one massive problem-the gree
[normal]nhouse gas emissions and environmental damage are likely to be far greater than for coal.
[normal] 
[normal]According to a recent study (European Commission 1 September 2011), 
[normal]the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas is greater than that of 
[normal]both 
[normal]coal
[normal] and
[normal] oil.
[normal]Losses of 
[normal]methane occur during the development of the wells, the extraction process and during the transport, storage and distribution of the gas.
[normal]Overall, the life cycle estimated losses of methane emissions from a typical shale gas well amount to 3.6 to 7.9 per ce
[normal]nt of the total amount of gas produced by the well. This compares with methane losses of 1.7 to 6 per cent of total gas production from conventional wells.
[normal]As we have already seen, accepted 
[normal]climate
[normal] theory has it that methane
[normal]’s
[normal] global warming potential 
[normal]is 
[normal]2
[normal]3 times as great as carbon dioxide. Therefore, the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas production-primarily due to these uncontrollable methane emissions- could be up to twice the footprint for coal (data based on a European Commission report 1 September
[normal] 2011).
[normal]Other drawbacks for shale gas include the risk of groundwater contamination by the fracturing fluids, risk of earthquakes beneath residential areas and also the sheer number of wells that would be necessary to maintain 
[normal]a reasonable level of 
[normal]product
[normal]ion 
[normal]because of the short-lived l
[normal]ifespan of each individual well. T
[normal]his could be as many as 10,000 wells across the UK
[normal] (estimated by 
[normal]Bloomberg New Energy Finance
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]In summary, if climate change theory is accepted, the substitution of gas for coal as an energy source results in increased rather than decreased global warming.
[normal]If the security of natural gas supplies depends on the rapid development of a UK shale gas ind
[normal]ustry, then even the very dubious
[normal] 
[normal]environmental advantage of conventional gas over coal is completely lost. 
[normal]One could easily argue that if global warming can be safely ignored in the case of shale gas, why not in the case of coal?
[normal]Moreover, if we are able
[normal] to ignore risks from global warming, why try to reduce coal’s contribution to the UK energy
[normal] and heating
[normal] mix in the first place?
[normal]The SFA fully supports 
[normal]the drive
[normal] to exploit new sources of fossil fuels. However, it needs to be emphasized strongly that repla
[normal]cement of coal with shale gas has no environmental justification.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]Growth[bold] in the solid fuel market[bold]The appeal of a real fire has n
[normal]ever
[normal] diminished
[normal] and w
[normal]e believe that 
[normal]no other heating system can match the “wow” factor of a real fire or the cosy sense of 
[normal]comfort and well-being that an open fire or stove lends to a home. To many people, the cosy glow and flickering flames are part of what makes a house into a home.
[normal]The current fashion for
[normal] open fires and
[normal] 
[normal]wood burning
[normal] stoves
[normal] has resulted in a
[normal] corresponding
[normal] ri
[normal]s
[normal]e in
[normal] demand for mineral fuel as most “wood burners” should more correctly be called multi-fuel
[normal] stoves
[normal]. 
[normal]It is fortunate for the reputation of the stove industry that mineral fuel is still widely available. A
[normal] rapidly expanding wood market 
[normal]which
[normal] exceed
[normal]ed
[normal] supply
[normal] would lead to shortage and result in stoves being abandoned as a 
[normal]reliable
[normal] source of heat or lead to the burning of poor quality wood 
[normal]fuel 
[normal]with dangerously high levels of moisture. 
[normal]Mineral fuels are
[normal] to a large extent
[normal] facilitating the sustainable gro
[normal]wth of a domestic wood fuel market. 
[normal]The distribution system for coal is very well established and well regulated under the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme. 
[normal]After many years of decline, t
[normal]he number of 
[normal]approved 
[normal]coal merchants in the UK has stabilised and we ar
[normal]e 
[normal]now 
[normal]seeing 
[normal]many 
[normal]new entrants 
[normal]coming into the industry
[normal]. 
[normal]Many c
[normal]onsumers
[normal] who start off burning wood, later switch to mineral fuel or a mixture of the two 
[normal]fuels 
[normal]because they recognise the benefits of mineral fuel in terms of comfort, convenience and cost. 
[normal]The 
[normal]continuing popularity of solid mineral fuel is amply illustrated by the fact that the 
[normal]Approved Coal Merchant Scheme is now welcoming applicants 
[normal]who started out as

[normal] but have identified 
[normal]the
[normal] growing market for coal
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As well as our commitment
[normal] to coal, t
[normal]he SFA is committed to increasing the 
[normal]availability
[normal] of good quality wood fuel on the market
[normal] 
[normal]through our
[normal] “Approved Woodfuel Merchant Scheme”. This runs alongside the coal merchant scheme and promotes good practice and quality fuel by adherence to 
[normal]a strict voluntary code of conduct.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6. [bold]Conclusion[bold]The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]coal industry 
[normal]stabilised
[normal] 
[normal]at the end of the last decade 
[normal]after many years of decline and given the right conditions 
[normal]there 
[normal]is
[normal] potential for growth. 
[normal]D
[normal]omestic 
[normal]solid
[normal] 
[normal]fuels
[normal] are of excellent quality and
[normal] are 
[normal]gradually 
[normal]gaining in popularity as consumers seeking a less expensive, more secure 
[normal]and 
[normal]more 
[normal]self-sufficient 
[normal]method of heating become aware of 
[normal]the 
[normal]advantages
[normal] of 
[normal]solid
[normal] fuels
[normal].
[normal]The only barriers to growth for solid fuel are the artificial constraints imposed by 
[normal]government.
[normal] 
[normal]These are now hurting the industry and the lack of certainty is discouraging much-needed financial investment for the future.
[normal]We believe that the current appro
[normal]ach is 
[normal]completely 
[normal]flawed.
[normal]S
[normal]olid fuel 
[normal]heating 
[normal]currently accounts for 
[normal]an estimated
[normal] 2% of the 
[normal]total market in the UK. Using the government’s own figures, a
[normal] 
[normal]switch from solid fuel to LPG
[normal] 
[normal]could
[normal] reduce carbon emissions 
[normal]for a heating system 
[normal]by 
[normal]a 
[normal]maximum
[normal] of around
[normal] 19%
[normal]. 
[normal]Unfortunately,
[normal] 
[normal]any
[normal] consumer making this switch will 
[normal]also 
[normal]see their heating bill double
[normal] and be placed at the mercy of the international oil price. 
[normal]To put things into their proper pers
[normal]p
[normal]ective, total domestic heating emissions from all fuels in the UK only amount to around 0.2% (1/500th) of the World’s anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (based on International Energy Agency estimates and assuming domestic 
[normal]heating at 15% of total UK em
[normal]issions)
[normal]. Even if solid fuel was completely eliminated
[normal] from the 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]market
[normal], the carbon saved would be a few 
[normal]hundredths
[normal] of a per
[normal] 
[normal]cent
[normal] 
[normal]at most.
[normal]The 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]solid fuel industry is looking for a level playing field so that we can sustain and increase the
[normal] market for our product based on its advantages and benefits. 
[normal]We urg
[normal]e
[normal] the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment to put the comfort, safety, security and prosperity of British people 
[normal]first
[normal] by 
[normal]acknowledging the importance of
[normal] the British coal industry
[normal].
