[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;This evidence is submitted on a corporate basis by Equality Challenge Unit (ECU). ECU is a charity which works to further and support equality and diversity for staff and students in higher education across all four nations of the UK, and in colleges in Scotland. ECU receives its core funding from Universities UK, GuildHE, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, the Scottish Funding Council and the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;

[[[Athena SWAN Charter]]]One of ECU’s core activities is the Athena SWAN Charter. Founded in 2005, the Athena SWAN Charter is a scheme that recognises excellence in science, engineering, technology, mathematics and medicine (STEMM) employment for women in higher education. The Charter receives additional funding from the Royal Society, the Biochemical Society, the Department of Health and the Scottish Funding Council.Any university or research institute embedded within a university that is committed to the advancement of the careers of women in STEMM can become a member of the Charter, accepting and promoting the six Charter principles:There are currently 91 members of the Charter. Once Charter signatories, universities and their STEMM departments are encouraged to submit for Athena SWAN Charter recognition awards at Bronze, Silver or Gold level.The Charter recognises the commitment of universities and university departments to reduce the decline in the numbers of women in STEMM academic careers further up the career ladder, and retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers.This response is based on ECU’s work, in particular the experience of working with universities on Athena SWAN.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Appraisals – e.g. regular appraisals carried out and career development discussed=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Diversity and unconscious bias training – e.g. training provided for all staff involved in recruitment and promotion decisions=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transparency of procedures and processes – e.g. individuals selected for posts or given more senior responsibilities through a fair and clear process=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Committee structures and balance of representation – e.g. women at least proportionally represented and not restricted to the least influential committees=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Departmental openness and inclusivity – e.g. all staff invited to a weekly coffee morning, at which senior staff are accessible=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Departmental roles and responsibilities – e.g. less desirable tasks assigned fairly and transparently =&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Visibility of women – e.g. care taken to ensure that the images around the university are not male-dominated, and a good balance amongst invited speakers=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Valuing staff contribution – e.g. achievements of men and women equally valued, and teaching, research and pastoral activities all recognised and rewarded=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Workload allocation – e.g. all staff workloads modelled and analysed transparently to make sure individuals are not overburdened, such as with administration=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Induction and training – e.g. all staff given a comprehensive induction and may be assigned a mentor, with the opportunity to express a preference about that person’s identity.=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Data collection (so the university/department knows what it must act on and can prioritise)=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Induction, networking and mentoring (see the ECU report Mentoring: progressing women's careers in higher education)=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Skills development=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Appraisal and performance management=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Inclusion and communication (e.g. consulting staff systematically and utilising or setting up an early career researcher forum)=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Parental leave.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the Department of Health (who contributed £199,700 to Charter development in 2012, after deciding to link funding for NIHR Biomedical Research Centres and Biomedical Research Units to a requirement that the academic partner has achieves a Silver Athena SWAN award)=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research Councils UK (who recommend participation in schemes such as Athena SWAN)=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Royal Society of Edinburgh (whose Tapping all our Talents report recommends that the Scottish Government should expect university STEMM departments to achieve the minimum standards for an Athena SWAN Silver award or equivalent, amongst other recommendations that are applicable across the UK)=&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the London Mathematical Society (who’s recently launched Good Practise Scheme dovetails with the Charter).This groundswell of support indicates that now is a very apposite time to capitalise on this.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Athena SWAN Gold department award application form, http://www.athenaswan.org.uk/sites/default/files/Athena-SWAN-gold-dept-award.docx Moss-Racusin, C, A. et al, 2012.
