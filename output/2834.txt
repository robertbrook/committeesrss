Exceptions to the residence test for cases under paragraph 9 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO would only apply to cases under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to children, When a prisoner attends a disciplinary hearing before a governor the prisoner is asked whether they want to obtain legal advice or representation. If the prisoner does not want any legal assistance the hearing proceeds. However, if the prisoner requests legal advice, the adjudicating governor will consider each of the following criteria (resulting from the case of R v Home Secretary ex parte Tarrant) and record their reasons for either refusing or allowing representation or a friend:  the seriousness of the charge/potential penalty;  a substantive point of law being in question;  the prisoner being unable to present their own case;  potential procedural difficulties;  urgency being required; or  reasons of fairness to prisoners and staff. &#xa0;If the adjudicating governor allows the request they will adjourn the hearing for a reasonable time to allow the prisoner to telephone or write to a solicitor.
