"BRC29\nWritten Evidence Submitted by David Hodson (Senior)&#xa0;I have the online recording of the House of Commons Communities and\nLocal Government hearing on building regulations applying to electrical installations\nand repairs in dwellings, that was held on 2nd \nSeptember, and am writing to\ncomment.\n&#xa0;\nI am 64 years old and am currently working as a self employed electrician. I \nserved my electrical/electronics apprenticeship in the Royal Corps of Signals\nand have had a career in electronics ever since.\n&#xa0;\nI semi reti\nred in January 2010 but decided that I needed to carry on working until\nat least I was 65. My chosen path was as an electrician. It turned out to be quite\nan ordeal having to go back to college (albeit by correspondence\n) and having to learn\nall the regulat\nions that go with working with electricity.\n&#xa0;\nHaving succeeded in gaining the relevant\n qualifications\n by September 2010, I had\nthen to join a 'competent\n persons' scheme' in order to work on 'notifiable' \ninstallations. But which one? This was a question a\nsked by one of the select \ncommittee members and none of the four in the 'dock' seemed to be able to \ngive a straight answer.\n&#xa0;\nAs an outsider and very ignorant of the industry, I chose NAPIT. It could well have\nbeen any other but their fees seemed to be mi\nd-range.\n&#xa0;\nThe choice should not have been there. There should be only one scheme that \npromotes the raising of standards by those working in the industry at the same\ntime raising the general awareness of the public and one 'flag' under which we all sail.\n&#xa0;\nI get most of my work by advertising in the local press. I do subscribe to other marketing\nwebsites (both of which were mentioned in committee) but these bring in very little work.\nSo I always ask my customers why they chose my ad over the others and it's \nusually\nbecause it stands out. Nothing to do with part P, NAPIT or NICEIC. The public just\ndo not know. They all know about CORGI though and GasSafe.\n&#xa0;\nI don't really care what the flag is. Electric Safe or Electrical Safety. But there should only\nbe one.\n&#xa0;\nPlease bang their heads together and make them work together, although I think they \nwill try to put as many obstacles\n in the way as possible.\n&#xa0;\nA very easy solution is to put the control into the Local Authority Building Control, just \nas we have done for \npersonal licences in the liquor trade, and issue a similar licence to\noperate. No licence, no work.\n&#xa0;\n25 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
