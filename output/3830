[normal]“It would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group, like the 
[normal]federation, or even a single public-spirited taxpayer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of locus 
[normal]standi
[normal] from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawfu
[normal]l conduct stopped. The Attorney 
[normal]General
[normal], although he occasionally applies for prerogative orders against public authorities that do not form part of central government, in practice never does so against government departments. It is not, in my view, a sufficient answer to say that judicial revi
[normal]ew of the actions of officers or departments of central government is unnecessary because they are accountable to Parliament for the way in which they carry out their functions. They are accountable to Parliament for what they do so far as regards efficien
[normal]cy and policy, and of that Parliament is the only judge; they are responsible to a court of justice for the lawfulness of what they do, and of that the court is the only judge.”

[normal]ondon 
[normal]C

[normal] to obscene publication. The Countryside Alliance was able to mount a major challenge to the hun
[normal]ting ban because of the modern approach to standing.
