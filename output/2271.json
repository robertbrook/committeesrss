"&#xa0;\nDavid Clough – Written evidence&#xa0;\nAs a long standing supporter of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance and as someone who spends time walking in the Dales, I write now to say that I feel that it is vital to take the present opportunity to include the enclosed clauses in the current ‘Deregulation Bill’.\n&#xa0;\nThe damage to and wilful misuse of the green lanes is a long and continuing saga but it would be a major step in the right direction to take action, as suggested in the formal submissions by GLEAM.\n&#xa0;\nThose of us who actually observe the selfish behaviour of the offroad vehicle drivers find it increasingly worrying that this problem has not yet been decisively deal with.\n&#xa0;\nThis opportunity is now here.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5 September 2013\n.........\nT\nwo proposals which would greatly improve the safety of green lanes...\n&#xa0;\n1. The first is based on two crucial distinctions. One is the distinction between ‘sealed’ and unsealed’ ways.  Green lanes are substantially ‘unsealed’ – ie they are not ‘sealed’ with tarmac or concrete.  The other distinction is between, on one hand, ‘the ordinary roads network’ – ie the sealed, tarmacadamed motor roads that we all need and take for granted – and, on the other, the unsealed tracks – the green lanes – that thread through the countryside.  Using these distinctions, which are both founded in highway law and its official interpretations, we are proposing that:\n&#xa0;\nAll unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.&#xa0;\nBOATs and UCRs are categories that comprise Dales green lanes.  Restricted Byways have rights of way for pedestrians, horses, horse-drawn carriages, pedal-cyclists and motor vehicles needed for access to premises (eg farm vehicles, fire engines), but not for recreational motors.\n&#xa0;\n2. Our second proposal seeks to remedy a serious problem with the procedures for imposing Traffic Regulations Orders – the legal mechanisms whereby non-essential motors are prohibited from green lanes.  At present, no matter how cogent and popular a request from the public to the local authority for the imposition of a TRO may be, the Authority can turn down the request flat.  There are no grounds for appeal.  (You will recall YDGLA’s campaign for a permanent TRO on Deadman’s Hill, in Nidderdale.  North Yorkshire County Council chose not to impose a permanent TRO, deciding instead to impose only a temporary TRO on just part of the route.  This temporary order is due to expire shortly.) We propose that:\n&#xa0;\nWhen a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. \n&#xa0;\n"
