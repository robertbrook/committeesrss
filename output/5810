defaultgave evidence.  
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I welcome 
defaultmembers
default of the public to this sitting of the Foreign Affairs Committee. This is the first evidence session for the Committee’s inquiry into FCO consular services. We will start by reviewing the FCO’s consular policy in co-operation with the travel industry, and follow that with two panels covering the FCO’s provision of consular assistance for British nationals who encounter some of the more serious problems, such as becoming involved in legal and detention systems abroad or experiencing the death of a family member abroad. Our first witness today is Mark 
defaultTanzer
default, the chief executive of ABTA. He stands welcome. It is good to see you here. Is there anything you want to say by way of an opening remark? I have a general question to start with.
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default I imagine that the Committee is aware of ABTA as a travel association that is very much involved in the protection of its members and its customers, whether that is financial protection or operational protection in destination. In that capacity, we work very closely with the Foreign Office and with consular services.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you. Looking at the Government’s approach to consular services, have you seen any shift in that in recent years?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default Yes, we have seen an improvement in their engagement with the tour operators and the industry, which is welcome because it has delivered a much better service on the ground than we had previously. As I say, the dialogue is much more continuous than it used to be, not just around crises but between crises, which is beneficial. We have also seen the Foreign Office and the consular services taking a more risk-based approach to travel advice. If a “Do not travel” notice is going to be put on a particular destination, it is important for our members that it is well considered, it is the right advice and it takes into account the local reality. We are seeing a more pragmatic approach to that, which is welcome.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The Government has made consular services an overarching priority. Do you welcome that, and does it manifest itself, as far as you are concerned, in any way? 
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default It is not for me to judge what the Government’s other priorities are, in terms of 
defaultoverarchingness
default, but any attention they give to consular services is welcome. We are aware, given the numbers of 
defaultUK
default citizens for whom we are responsible overseas, that this is a big 
defaultpart of their lives and a big part of our responsibility. The assistance that we and 
defaultUK
default citizens can get overseas is a very important factor indeed, so any focus on that is welcome. 
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn Clwyd:default Hello, Mr 
defaultTanzer
default. Based on your members’ experience, how do British consular services compare to the services given to people from other countries? 
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default That’s difficult for us to say, because our members are predominantly UK-based. We deal with 
defaultUK
default customers, so we don’t have much direct experience, through our members, of other consular services. Anecdotally, I hear that the Germans have a very good consular system, but I don’t have any direct evidence of that, compared with ours. I’m afraid I can’t really give you an answer on that. It is not something that we deal with on a day-to-day basis.
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn Clwyd:default What measures do you think the FCO could use to make those kinds of comparisons? It is always good to make comparisons with other countries and the services they provide. 
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default Well, it’s a data-rich environment, in terms of numbers of assistances and the categorisation of events that consular officers have to deal with. What is less easy to get at is the efficiency—how many were dealt with and how they were dealt with—which tends to be more subjective. How you measure the efficiency of our consular services will be based on the kind of evidence that you get back from the tour operators and the customers themselves. It is not in a tabular form so you can do a like-for-like comparison.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn Clwyd:default Have your members been affected by the withdrawal of full consular service on the ground and the substitution by honorary consuls, and if so, have you got any examples?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default The global response centre, which is now dealing with out-of-hours emergencies, seems to be working quite well. We haven’t had a problem, in terms of the withdrawal of on-the-ground cover in out of hours, so we are happy with that. There have been examples where there was no consul at all, and through discussion with the Foreign Office, we made that clear and there is now an honorary consul in place. I probably haven’t got enough experience yet of how that works as a system. I guess how effective it is depends on the location and the honorary consul, but the Foreign Office listens to our concerns if there is no consular representation at all. 
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default I have a very quick question. Has emergency passport provision been affected by the changes? 
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default I can’t give you an answer on that. I don’t know. I can come back to you in writing. I haven’t had any evidence from my members that they have seen a change.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default What is your assessment overall of the FCO’s travel advice?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default I am very positive about it. As I said, it is a very important component of the travel equation. All sorts of things happen if a “Do not travel” is imposed on a destination in terms of customers’ right to cancel, but also then having to repatriate people. So we watch very closely, and we liaise very closely with the Foreign Office over the quality of that advice. In a tourist destination, in particular, we will be in very close contact with the ambassador and the consular staff on the ground as well as with the Foreign Office here. I think it is good. 
default              
defaultI can give an example from last year. There was a lot of disruption in 
defaultEgypt
default, and other countries in Europe put a blanket “Do not travel” across the whole of 
defaultEgypt
default, yet the vast majority of tourists were in the 
defaultRed Sea
default area, where there was not an immediate risk. We were able, talking to the Foreign Office, to help them with information about what was happening on the ground. I think they took a more risk-based approach to their travel advice. That enabled people to carry on travelling when they were safe, and also to prevent repatriation. Subsequently, the other European countries followed that advice and said, “You can travel back to the 
defaultRed Sea
default.”
default              
defaultAs an association, we are not in the business of saying that we want customers to be able to continue to travel, come what may. We will always err on the side of caution, as will the Foreign Office. We are contractually and morally responsible for customers. So we are never there to try to push for a different decision. We just want it to be as well informed as possible about what is happening at airports and whether there are disturbances on the street. Often, as I am sure you are aware, the media will present something which is very localised but will give the impression of an entire destination in upheaval, and it is not always the case.
default              
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Can you give us examples of when the advice was either not accurate or timely and was problematic?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default No, not recently or in the time I have been there. 
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default So with the Icelandic dust cloud, for example, was there nothing problematic then? I remember as a Member of Parliament having lots of phone calls from people who were very worried. 
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default There were lots of problems, but I don’t think they were to do with “Do not travel” advice. That was more the CAA saying, “Do not fly,” if I recall rightly. The issue there was one of safety of aircraft. That created huge disruption and inconvenience, but I don’t think it was caused by a consular or a Foreign Office decision; it was more to do with air safety. There are possibly occasions where the ambassador has the decision-making power because it is out of hours and he or she is local. There you may not get such an informed decision. One of the things that we like to see is ambassadors and ambassadorial staff having experience of what the issues are in destinations. If they are called on to intervene with advice, it is an informed view of what the real tourism situation is. But I cannot give you an example of where particular travel advice from here has been manifestly wrong.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Going back to the point you raised earlier about travel advice from other countries, do any come to mind that you would say are better than the United Kingdom?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default No. I honestly can’t say that. The one example that I could give where the different countries all took an attitude, which was 
defaultEgypt
default, I thought we got it right. The fact that they subsequently changed back would suggest that. They had their own reasons and their own methods of determining this. They were quicker to close the whole country down. I think it is very encouraging that the Foreign Office and the consular staff here work with the industry to get as much information as they can before they put that travel advice out.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Mr 
defaultTanzer
default, there is perhaps concern that the British public have unrealistic expectations of what to expect from consular services. On the other hand, is the FCO doing enough to get the message out? The FCO has listed examples of the sort of service that they consider inappropriate and ludicrous. The uncharitable among us might suggest that such an 
defaultapproach was somewhat pompous and snooty. Having said that, could you give us your assessment as to whether the public have unrealistic expectations and, perhaps just as importantly, to balance it out, whether the FCO should be doing more to temper those expectations?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default The answer to the first part of your question is, almost certainly, yes, they do have unrealistic expectations. They either have no expectations until something happens and then they suddenly think, “Where on earth can I get help?” They do not really go out thinking, “What are the services I could expect to get from a consular office?” Or they expect everything. They are not in the middle ground. It is either, “I do not have any expectations,” or “I expect them to basically be a concierge service.” Neither of those is appropriate.
default              
defaultJust as a prelude to answering the second part of your question, the tour operators do fill a lot of that middle ground in terms of support for their customers: they have a contractual duty to do that, and for health and safety, advice, illness, and so on, you often find that people will turn to the tour operator, with a representative there as their first line of support, rather than people going to the consular office. That assumes that you have travelled with a tour operator and not under your own steam.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Do you think the tour operators should be doing more to help the FCO get the message across?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default There are a lot of messages that go to customers before they travel. Some are done jointly with us and the FCO: “know before you go” advice, what to look out for, and so forth. We are putting a lot of messages out to the customers prior to travel. We would then rely, when people are travelling as part of an organised holiday, as opposed to on their own, on tour operators to act as that link as to what consular services are available, if people need them.
default              
defaultI hate to say it, but you could do a lot of public awareness campaign spending and not get the desired result on this. Holidays are things people do intermittently, rather than regularly, and they do not want to think about things going wrong—that is not a part of the holiday experience. Ears have walls, as they say, and they do not want to hear messages about this.
default              
defaultIf there were going to be strong messages, around travel insurance would probably be the kind of way to get more people taking out travel insurance before they go. That would probably help everybody’s lives, and it is a simple message that we would certainly support.
default              
defaultIf something serious happens—a crime or an assault, or a serious illness—I think people are aware that the consul is there to support them.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Finally, what is the most common complaint that you or your members hear about FCO consular services, and do you think it is fair?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default I don’t know; I would not say that there is a single complaint that is typical of the consular service. It is localised; it depends what the event is and how the consul handles it. I do not think there is a particularly category of complaint that I could refer you to on that. By and large, our members are happy with the relationship they have, not just through 
defaultLondon
default, but actually in resort with the local consuls, and they think it is a good relationship and it works well.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Gapes:default You refer to advice that could be given. How would you characterise the relationship between the FCO and tourism companies and trade associations with regard to the consular assistance issue and public safety campaigns? Is it a good relationship?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default Yes, I think it is excellent. We have a very high level of engagement, planning and communications. We do communications programmes hand in hand, such as on balcony safety—to stop people getting drunk and jumping off balconies. These are things we will do together. The consular offices understand the challenges of looking after enormous numbers of holiday makers, and we understand the challenges they have. They have relatively thin resources at a destination, yet have to be available for any eventuality. This is at every level: from the strategic—we will be planning what is going to happen around the football in Brazil with the “Know Before You Go” campaign; it is not all reactive—through to working on simulated crises and crisis management; and down to practical help on the ground. It is a very good relationship.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Gapes:default The FCO used to have an online database—FCO Locate—but that was got rid of last year. Now you are talking about using social media more and so on. How do you assess how effective this “Know Before You Go” campaign is at getting information out to people?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default As I said earlier, this is not an audience that is sitting there waiting to hear these messages. It is definitely worth persevering with, because some of it will perhaps go in subliminally, rather than being at the top of people’s minds. The challenge with Locate was one that we had ourselves, in that the idea was that people would voluntarily give up their mobile contact details and we would be able to get an instant text alert to everybody in a destination. It sounded ideal, but people are very reluctant to give up personal data or contact data, so you are automatically in a position where you will have a challenge identifying who is in a resort and how you are going to get messages to them. I fear that that is one of the Government’s challenges.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Gapes:default Did the customers of your member companies use the service before it was scrapped?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default No, not in great numbers. That was one reason why it was scrapped—it was difficult to get customers to take it up.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Gapes:default You think the FCO was right to get rid of it and to try other ways?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default Yes, although it was a good initiative. We ourselves have travel bulletin alerts for our members, which are vast e-mails, so if there is an airport closure or a crisis, we are able to get messages out, but that goes through the trade and we rely on people in resorts to contact their customers there, rather than trying to contact consumers directly.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Gapes:default That applies to people who have booked through your particular companies. Is it that people who just get a flight and find their own accommodation are not contactable?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default No, they are not. Just understanding how many people are there and where they are is a huge challenge for the Foreign Office. At least with our membership—we account for quite a significant percentage of the market, but by no means all of it—we know where they are and when they are due back and so forth. For the independent traveller who has just got on a low-cost flight and found their own accommodation, you are right that it is a challenge to find them, let alone communicate with them.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The FCO beefed up its crisis response systems after a series of events over the past two or three years. As I understand it, you have been running some joint exercises with it. What is your opinion of the crisis response systems and the new centre?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default I was not part of that exercise, but my colleagues who were said that it was a very effective simulation of what would happen, especially if two big crises happened simultaneously. Both our members and the Foreign Office will have learned a lot from that simulation. I suppose that the tsunami or a large financial failure are the kinds of really large-scale crises for which you have to put in place big repatriation schemes at very short notice. That depends on working with the industry, which has the 
defaultaeroplane
defaults, to be able to mobilise those very quickly, get people assembled and get them out. Historically that has worked quite well, certainly for our members. We have not had situations when we have been frustrated in crisis management by the Foreign Office not delivering. We will wait to see how the next crisis goes, and I am not going to say that it always works, but so far, I think, I am confident that we could deal with that.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Your evidence in the past 20 or 25 minutes seems to be fairly positive. Is that a fair summary of your opinion of the consular services?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default Yes, it is, Sir. As I say, it has changed over the last few years, and I think it has improved enormously. It is fair for that to be put on record. It is a good relationship, and a very important one for us.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I am sure they will be very pleased to hear you say that. Are there any other points you would like to make?
default              
defaultMark defaultTanzerdefault:default No, thank you.
defaultChair:default In that case, thank you very much indeed for coming along. It is very much appreciated.
defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultWitnesses: 
defaultKevin Lauedefault, Legal Advisor, REDRESS, and 
defaultBruno Mindefault, Assistant Co-ordinator, Fair Trials International, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I welcome our next two witnesses, who are going to allow us to explore legal and detention systems abroad. We have 
defaultMr Bruno Min, 
defaultthe a
defaultssistance 
defaultc
defaulto
default-
defaultordinator
default at
default Fair Trials International
default,
default and 
defaultMr 
defaultKevin Laue, 
defaultthe 
defaultlegal advisor
default at
default 
defaultREDRESS. I thank you both very much for coming. Would you like to make a few remarks by way of an opening statement? We will start with Mr Min.
default              
defaultBruno Min:default Yes, thank you. Fair Trials International has been helping individuals who are facing criminal charges outside their own country for about 20 years. Our experience of dealing with these kinds of cases has given us an insight into how consular services work, not only in the 
defaultUK
default, but in various other countries as well. We certainly welcome the Foreign Office’s decision to prioritise consular assistance, and we are delighted with this opportunity to submit evidence today.
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default If I can repeat what has been said, we are very grateful to the Committee for inviting us to give evidence. REDRESS has been concerned about this issue for many years. 
defaultIndeed, we were formed more than 20 years ago by a British survivor of torture. Although we work in very many different ways, we have always had a particular interest in the torture or mistreatment of British nationals abroad. We are very pleased to be here.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you; you are very welcome.
default              
defaultMr 
defaultLaue
default, have you seen any change in the delivery of consular services and the performance of the Foreign Office in recent years?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default As we explained in our submission, our focus is very much on consular assistance to people in trouble who are facing torture or mistreatment. In that sense, yes, we have seen a welcome improvement, at least in theory, in how the consular directorate responds to allegations of torture and mistreatment with, for example, the just-finalised new guidelines. More generally, there seems to be a more serious commitment to try to engage with and assist British nationals in vulnerable positions. The proof will depend, as we tried to set out in our paper, on how things are actually done in practice in the future.
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Have you noticed any shift in how things are done in practice?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default It is a bit soon to say, to be frank. Where we have also seen a welcome improvement, if I can put it that way, is in our own relationship with the consular directorate. We are very grateful for the fact that it is engaging with us and that we can engage with it in several different ways—that is good.
default              
defaultBruno Min:default I think that I would largely reiterate what Mr Laue has said. We are certainly grateful that we have built up a much closer relationship with the Foreign Office over the past few years. In terms of actual impact on individuals who have been arrested abroad, we have not seen much of a change in the quality of service being provided to British nationals arrested abroad. That is all that I can say.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Last year, the FCO launched a consular excellence strategy. As a result of that, have you seen any changes in service delivery?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default Again, I would say that, from our perspective, it is possibly too early to say, but we welcome the commitment—it is quite a commitment—to make the UK’s consular services the best in the world.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Have you noticed any specific change in how services are provided to nationals arrested and detained abroad?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default We have a rather limited sample of people with whom we have been in touch. There does seem to be an improved policy, or a tendency to try to help people and even to mention that REDRESS can help them when they get back. The sample is rather small. We are keen to have this monitored in the years to come by hearing more from people when they get back to this country so that we can find out how they perceive what happened to them. We have actually suggested ways that could be done.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Min, have you spotted any shift in the last couple of years?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default We have not spotted any particular patterns or impact that have resulted from the Foreign Office’s policy changes. Our main concern is not so much the policy, but 
defaultrather the consistency and the standard to which services are divided on a case-by-case, post-by-post basis.
defaultChair:default I think we will 
defaultbe
default coming on to consistency a little later on.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default Have you seen any evidence that the FCO is reducing the consular assistance that it provides due to a reduced budget?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I would say no, not directly.
default              
defaultMay I mention something that I heard the previous witness say in response to the question about honorary consuls? We did not deal with it in our written submission, but it would be of concern to us if, in situations when a 
defaultUK
default national was facing serious threats of torture, an honorary consul did not show the same commitment to rendering urgent assistance. In that sense, if there has been a reduction, it could have an impact, but we do not have any evidence for that yet. We hope that we do not get such evidence.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default If you do not have evidence, what makes you make that point to the Committee?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default Well, from some limited cases that we have had, that kind of problem has arisen. It was not as a result of a cutback—as far as I know—in the employment of British consular staff. I think of one case where a British national was in prison in Ecuador—this was some time back—and he was not visited by a British consular official. He had a lot of complaints about the way that he felt that this other person was not taking him seriously. 
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default So it is nothing to do with the budgetary position? You feel that the standard of service by honorary consuls leaves something to be desired?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I think it is something that we would hope is monitored closely in situations where British people are in trouble. 
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default If more money were available to employ or provide more financial support for those who carry out that task, do you feel that it would make a difference?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default Yes, I would imagine that it would. 
default              
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default Okay, that is interesting. Thank you. 
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you want to add anything to that point, Mr Min?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default One of the areas in which we understand that there have been cutbacks is the withdrawal of some staff on the ground in certain European consulates. We do not really know if that has had any significant impact on the levels of consular assistance provided to Britons arrested within the European Union. Our main complaint about how services are provided to British citizens within the European Union relates to the number of visits by consular staff, but we understand that that policy was in place in 2009, before this new consular strategy was established. 
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Gentlemen, in relation to the FCO’s partnerships with NGOs, do you think that this is a good initiative to secure specialised assistance or is it just a cheaper option of outsourcing the FCO’s work?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default So far, we are very delighted that the FCO has shown this initiative to work more closely with organisations like Fair Trials International. You will have no doubt noticed from the written submissions that we have been consulted to advise on the quality of the lists of lawyers and training for consular staff in recognising serious violations to the right to a fair trial. However, we understand that there has been a general tendency by this Government to outsource public services—obviously, Fair Trials International does not have a general position on that—but we believe that consular assistance is a key public service that cannot be replaced by civil society.
default              
defaultCivil society does provide invaluable assistance to British nationals arrested overseas, but it does not have the network of staff across the world and the expertise that consular staff have on the ground. We do not have the diplomatic leverage that the Government have, which is absolutely crucial, especially in cases where there have been very serious allegations of fair trial abuses, including torture and the death penalty.
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default Very much so, and of course we do not have the right to go and see somebody in prison under the established treaty laws that the 
defaultUK
default has.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Does that mean that outsourcing is right or wrong or that outsourcing is fine, but only to a certain degree?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default We are delighted with civil society in terms of consultation. From Fair Trials International’s point of view, we are happy to be consulted, with the expertise that we have gained over a number of years being used to help the Foreign Office to improve the levels of consular assistance being provided. What we are trying to say is that the role of civil society must be to complement the assistance being given by the Foreign Office—it should definitely not be seen as a cheaper alternative or a replacement service for consular assistance. 
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultSandra Osborne:default In relation to the fact that British nationals do not have a legal right as such to consular protection, do you think that they suffer a disadvantage?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default Yes, in principle I do. If you have a right you can enforce it, but if it remains at the discretion of the Government you are in a weaker position. As a human rights organisation, we would like to see something entrenched and enforceable. If you ask whether it would make a difference, we don’t know, but in principle it should. If you have a right to something, rather than it being at the Government’s discretion, the chances of it being taken seriously are improved. 
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultSandra Osborne:default What is the position of Fair Trials International on that matter? 
default              
defaultBruno Min:default This issue is obviously something that must be exercised in the minds of Foreign Office lawyers. We all agree that there is a certain obligation for the Foreign Office to provide consular assistance, but the question is whether it is a moral or legal obligation. We certainly don’t see any reason why it should not be a legal obligation. Courts will have difficulty in practice, we think, in determining cases in which the Foreign Office is challenged in relation to its provision of consular assistance. We are having to consider many complicated issues to do with international relations. We are dealing with different countries with different legal systems and different challenges. 
default              
defaultWe don’t really know what the actual impact will be, although in 2009 we had a look at a number of different consular services provided by different countries. It was a very small sample, 
defaultand the only country that seemed to recognise that there is a legal right to consular assistance was 
defaultGermany
default. Our report did not find that there were significant differences between how the German authorities provided consular assistance and how the other countries did it, but it is very difficult to predict, and it was a very small sample. 
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultSandra Osborne:default Would it be correct to say that the FCO’s desire to avoid creating a legitimate expectation, and therefore an obligation to fulfil it, means that it cannot provide thorough explanations about the types of consular assistance it can and cannot provide to British nationals? 
default              
defaultBruno Min:default The problem that we’ve had from many individuals contacting Fair Trials for assistance is that they have unrealistic expectations of the kind of services that the Foreign Office can provide. Many say that they simply expect the Foreign Office to intervene in their case and to take on the role of their lawyers. In a way, we have found that the message is not being delivered thoroughly. On the other hand, we also have the problem of people complaining that the Foreign Office emphasises too much what it cannot do, and not enough what it can do. We think that there is a risk there. Individuals arrested abroad are genuinely in need of the kind of assistance that the Foreign Office can provide, and they might not have the confidence to approach it to ask for that sort of assistance. 
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default If I could add to that, the terminology is important. We must use the correct description, “consular assistance”, which is a legal and policy term. As we said in our paper—this confirms what Bruno said—there is a bit too much emphasis on assistance at the expense of protection. Although we don’t want to use the term “consular protection” because it’s not accurate, in practice that is what we are getting at. We hope that whatever the law is and whatever the legitimate expectation may or may not be, there will be a real commitment by the FCO to protect people facing torture in whatever way it can. 
default              
defaultRemember, we are talking about a relatively small number, although it seems to be on the increase. Millions of 
defaultUK
default nationals have travelled abroad, there are fewer than 
default3,000 in
default prison and there are something like 100 complaints a year of ill treatment, so it is a relatively small number. If those people had a really clear legitimate expectation or right we feel more would be done to help them. 
default              
defaultI want to add another point without going on too long. It is not just in relation to these individuals. The REDRESS position is that this whole thing needs to be looked at in a wider context. We referred to the FCO’s torture prevention strategy, which is very welcome. It came into force in 2011. I know that the Committee examined this a year or two ago. In that strategy there is reference to the problem of 
defaultUK
default nationals abroad. We think that if a focus is put on trying to assist people like that, it will have a wider impact. It will not just relate to their own predicament but will be a way of engaging with other countries on how they treat their own nationals and the whole torture prevention, torture prohibition policy. There are quite a lot of other areas involved.
defaultChair:default Can I 
defaultdraw
default the Committee’s attention to the fact that there is a vote coming, in which case we will have to suspend the sitting for 12 minutes. I hope you don’t mind. 
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn Clwyd:default In your paper you say, 
default“Regarding terrorism suspects, we concluded that when consular assistance was most urgently required, it was frequently lacking, delayed or not 
defaultprovided.” 
default Are there geographical areas where this happens or are there particular issues in which the FCO shows a lack of consistency?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default This was a problem a few years ago. From my recollection, some of these cases arose in 
defaultPakistan
default where consular officials were either prevented or voluntarily stood aside. This is a controversial area, because it is still part of the whole inquiry relating to complicity. The point we are trying to make is that in addition to examining whether the 
defaultUK
default security services were complicit—that is a question in itself—there have been allegations that consular officials failed to exercise the basic policy at that time, which would have been to visit people and so on. 
defaultPakistan
default is one country where I think this happened.
default              
defaultSitting suspended for Divisions in the House. 
default              
defaultOn resuming—
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I apologise to members of the public and witnesses for the delay, but that is what happens in Parliament. Ann Clwyd had the floor and she has been held up, unfortunately. She had one more question before I give the floor to Mr Baron. Based on your experience, can you say how the consular assistance to nationals in foreign legal systems or detention compares with assistance provided to nationals from other states? How do we compare with the French, the Germans, the Italians, the South Africans or the Australians?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default As the Committee is aware from the written evidence, we did a report, what we called the Nuffield report, comparing the assistance provided to their nationals by five ministries of foreign affairs. The overall findings were that there is generally not that much difference between the consular services provided by different countries, but again this is a very small sample. The report is quite narrow in the sense that it is focused on trial attendance. There were notable exceptions: the German example of funding representation in certain death penalty cases, and the Australian example of having a general policy of consular staff attending the trials of Australian nationals.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Does 
defaultGermany
default fund the legal costs of people detained overseas in capital punishment cases?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default That is our understanding. That was our finding in this report, but 
defaultGermany
default is not the only example. My understanding is that 
defaultMexico
default also has a similar system of funding the representation of their own nationals in death penalty cases. I believe that there are a couple more examples, and I think 
defaultAustria
default might be one of them. However, obviously, we are not experts on death penalty cases, so we are not in the best position to comment on that.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you have anything to add, Mr 
defaultLaue
default?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default As we referred to in our written submission, some states have a right to consular protection in their constitutions or in their legislation, but as we do not know how that impacts in practice our comparative expertise is a bit limited. It is also interesting that many of the states which seem to have this right are former iron curtain countries, so it may well have just been a paper right anyway. Their citizens probably weren’t allowed to travel abroad much, so it would not really have had any relevance. We don’t really know whether other states
default 
defaultare better in practice.
defaultCdefaulthair:default 
defaultThank
default you.
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default The right to a fair trial is one of the basic tenets of English common law. We are all too aware of the fact that this right is not globally acknowledged. Many countries do not allow their citizens a fair trial, or do not have the institutions to see it through. What can the FCO then do to ensure that citizens have access to a fair trial? What more can they do than they are already doing? Have you made any recommendations to the FCO in that light?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default The FCO actually has two key roles in providing assistance to British nationals arrested abroad. One is to help British nationals with some of the additional difficulties they face as foreign-national defendants. The second obligation or crucial role of the FCO, as you suggested, is to help ensure that international standards are respected
default 
defaultin countries where fair trial rights are systematically abused.
default              
defaultOn the first point, helping British nationals to overcome additional difficulties, the FCO can help to ensure that they have access to legal representation by providing lists of criminal lawyers, for example. The FCO also helps people to understand their rights, so that they are in a better position to exercise them. We accept that it is a lot more problematic in countries where fair trial rights are systematically abused. However, as a good starting point, our recommendation is that consular staff should be trained in the first place to identify where serious violations of fair trial rights have taken place. After that, they have to take a much more case-specific and country-specific approach. Obviously, when dealing with over 200 different legal systems, they are facing different challenges and different cultures.
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default After agreeing with everything Bruno said, I would just add from a slightly different perspective an important issue relating to consular assistance and torture specifically. If the consular officials can be engaged from the beginning, then that would hopefully have some effect on preventing torture-induced confessions. That is only one aspect of an unfair trial, but it is an important element to which is probably worth drawing attention.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Speaking of how local consular services can help in these sorts of situations, can we move on briefly to lawyers lists, because that has been another area where perhaps more could have been done? There has been no shortage of complaints to say that the lists produced in the past have been inadequate. The information has been incorrect and there have been inconsistencies—for example, in language, competencies and even lawyers broken down by regions and specialities. That has been recognised by the FCO and there has been input by FTI. Can you tell us more about that? How far are we down that road? What more needs to be done? 
default              
defaultBruno Min:default So far, Fair Trials International has taken on the task of providing expertise, in terms of providing best practice guidelines for the compilation of lawyers lists. As part of that project, we surveyed the number of posts in the FCO consular network. We had a go at trying to compile a few lawyers lists ourselves. We have produced basic products so far. A few still need to be finished. Now we need to monitor the extent to which our guidelines are being followed and how our recommendations are being followed in practice by posts. I am hopeful that the Foreign Office will take on the challenge of monitoring and ensuring that lawyers lists are produced to a similarly high standard in all countries, despite the difficulties faced in many jurisdictions.
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default In summary, with regards to consular services and the FCO actually helping British citizens abroad on these matters, are we suggesting that the only other improvement we can make—we are making one on the lawyers lists—that has any effect is to train staff in 
defaultconsular services better to ensure our citizens are aware of their rights? As far as we are concerned, we are not lawyers and there are consular services, so we will then let it go. 
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I would not put it like that. What you say is partly true, but certainly, if you are looking at torture, consular staff need to understand how to recognise torture, how to keep records of torture, how to deal with particularly vulnerable people, and how to keep proper records and relate back to London. All that is on track, in the sense that there is a renewed commitment to it in the internal guidelines. It requires quite a lot of work over and above training. It means actually doing it, monitoring it and getting feedback in time from the customers—if you want to call them that. It is more complex than just paying one or two visits and then leaving it to the local lawyers. It is about having real understanding of what torture is and how dreadful it is. As I have said, the FCO could have a wider perspective on how it is not just a matter of protecting a relatively small number of 
defaultUK
default nationals and how this fits into their overall torture prevention strategy worldwide. There is that link. 
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Briefly, are you satisfied that the FCO has clear procedures in place? Should there be what it considers to be contravened rights, illegalities and so forth, will those procedures flow through? Do you think the training is there to deal with, for example, a British citizen who has been tortured? 
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default It is looking much better than it was. I go back to the new guidelines. I do not know whether the Committee has read them; they are not a public document. The internal guidelines are much more detailed than they ever were before. The FCO consular director is committed to training. They have invited REDRESS and others to participate. Fair Trials does training. I am hopeful that things will get better, but, to repeat, we will not know unless the consular directorate in due course is more forthcoming, seeks feedback from people and makes statistics
default 
defaultpublic. There is a lot that can be done, which will then show what is really happening. 
default              
defaultBruno Min:default Training is just the first step. What is really required at the moment is training but the more important issue is what is done with the training thereafter. What we are trying to say is that in order for the Foreign Office to take a more proactive, objective approach in terms of getting involved in cases where serious fair trial abuses have taken place or are about to take place, training needs to be there. But they also need to take a more proactive approach in future where they are able to recognise these kinds of violations taking place. 
default              
defaultAt the moment, we find that the approach being taken is rather inconsistent, in the sense that the Foreign Office will be more likely to make representations to foreign Governments where there is political backing and where there is some media coverage in a particular case. It should not really be like that. The level of assistance being provided by the Foreign Office should not depend on these factors. They should be in a position to be able to decide for themselves, where serious violations have taken place, what the appropriate action should be.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Min, before I hand you over to Mr Stewart, may I just return to the answer you gave a second ago when you spoke about FCO officials being present at trials? If there was an FCO official present at a trial, will it make any difference as to whether that is a fair trial? The guy just sitting in the second row, does that help?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default I appreciate that that is quite a tricky issue. As part of the Nuffield report that I referred to earlier, we asked consular officials what they thought the possible benefits of their attendance would be. It is difficult for us to assess to what extent trial attendance has a positive outcome. Certain consular officials seem to believe that it does have a positive impact 
defaulton cases because the courts are much more aware that there is some outside interest in a particular case. They may make more of an effort to ensure that international standards are complied with. Certain consular officials found that there is no impact at all. Fair Trials International at the moment are not necessarily pushing for consular officials to attend all trials, but we might say that there may need to be objective criteria for consular officials to use to decide whether to attend trials.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But the Foreign Office in their submissions to us say that approximately 6,000 Britons get arrested every year. That is over 
default100 a
default week, of which I would imagine a fair amount end up on trial. Are you suggesting that the Foreign Office should send officials to 100 trials a week around the world?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default Those are not our submissions. We are not saying that the Foreign Office should attend trials for every single British citizen who has been arrested in another country. We are in a very good position to understand that the Foreign Office faces many difficulties when it comes to the provision of consular assistance. We know the problems with limited resources and limited personnel which may make it very impractical for them to attend these trials. What we were hoping to do with the Nuffield report was to highlight the kind of difference in the consular assistance being provided by different ministries of foreign affairs. We recognise, however, that there may be certain cases where trial attendance might be beneficial, especially in cases of vulnerable defendants.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default Just to bring it down to a concrete level, I have recently been dealing with one of my constituents, Mr John Armstrong, who is a private security contractor who managed to be arrested in India when his ship was swept ashore, apparently by a storm. He is being detained with his colleagues in an Indian prison. It looks as though they may not be brought to trial for some months or even longer. Bail has been refused. What sort of things would you imagine that the Foreign Office should be doing in a case like that, particularly a case where it appears as though a British citizen hasn’t done anything that seems particularly wrong?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I would hope that, at the minimum, the consular service is fully exercising its rights to have access to him, to hear from him in private how he is being treated, whether he has any allegations of torture, how his food, hygiene, medical needs and all that kind of thing are being catered for, and if there is any concern arising then, with his agreement, to do what they can to persuade the authorities to engage. The guidelines deal with this. You start at a certain level and if necessary, you escalate up until eventually it is a full-blown diplomatic confrontation, in theory. That is the way these things ought to work.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default Just to clarify a bit more, one response that might come back is that 
defaultIndia
default has an independent judiciary; it has its own functioning legal system. The Indian Government might well turn around and say, “Okay, you feel that the delay in justice in 
defaultIndia
default is too long. Maybe from your perspective people are kept too long in prison before they are tried, but that is normal procedure; we have an independent judiciary, and there’s nothing we can do about that.” What would your response be to that?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I have been emphasising that no matter how long a person has to be in detention before trial—that is a concern, of course—the treatment while a person is waiting, from the moment of arrest to the time they get released, there is nothing which prevents the consular service taking a very keen interest in his welfare. There is a commitment to do that, on paper. Bruno can speak more on the legal, trial side of things.
default              
defaultBruno Min:default The Foreign Office isn’t in a position to decide whether somebody is guilty or not guilty; that is up to the independent judiciary to decide. The Foreign Office is not in a position to replace the role of local lawyers in representing them, giving them case-specific legal advice, but the very least that it should be doing in these cases is to equip the individual concerned with information and referrals, so that they are in a better position to understand and exercise their rights. Obviously, there are countries where there are systematic problems. Even if somebody is being treated in line with local laws, even if in a particular legal system it is quite normal for individuals to be detained for three or four years before their trial goes ahead, the Foreign Office should be aware that there are international standards which 
defaultIndia
default may have signed up to. Where there have been serious violations of an individual’s rights, the Foreign Office is in a position, in Fair Trials International’s point of view, to point out some of the obligations they fail to comply with.
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultRdefaultory Stewart:default Do you feel that, in general, to leave the particular case, that FCO consular officials carry out sufficient numbers of prison visits? Should there be a defined, obligatory number?
default              
defaultBruno Min:default Again, we are talking about many different countries with many different problems. There may be cases, especially when there are vulnerable defendants in very poor prison conditions, where the Foreign Office should be in a position to make more prison visits. On the other hand, there are individuals who could do without a prison visit every week or so. What we disagree with is the complete withdrawal of prison visits within the European Union, perhaps based on the assumption that there is a very strong guarantee that all rights will be respected. That is a position that we recommend the Foreign Office to review.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default Neither of you would like a minimum standard—for example, a visit once a month?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I am not sure that that would be the way to really deal with things. Where there is any evidence of serious mistreatment, or mistreatment, then there should be a capacity and a commitment to pay more attention to that person. Where somebody has never raised any complaint and is completely satisfied with everything, one or two more formal visits—going through the motions, even—would be adequate, just to make sure that nothing has come up. One would accept a flexible approach, but not so flexible that it does not fulfil the need when the need arises.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default I caught the end of Mr Baron’s question, and I apologise if I am repeating it in any way, but in comparing the British Government’s willingness to follow up on torture with that of other Governments, how would you rate the British Government?
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default I referred to how on paper some other states seem to have stronger mechanisms, but in practice we do not know where the 
defaultUK
default fits on the ranking tables. We think it is important for the 
defaultUK
default to be the leader. If it is going to be the best consular service in the world, as it says it wants to be, it should try to be better than some of those other states. I know that the Committee is not looking closely at diplomatic protection and the espousal of claims, but we have emphasised the link between consular systems and helping people, when they finally get home, to take up their cases with the torturing states. That is a way of developing the long-term policy against torture. I’m sorry; I haven’t really answered your question.  
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default I believe that you have also been talking about the importance of publishing Foreign Office guidelines on mistreatment. 
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default It is a suggestion. The new guidelines are excellent compared with previous ones. They are internal—it is not a public document—and if they were made public, even without people having a right to consular assistance, their legitimate expectation would be much clearer, as they would know what to expect in terms of the guidelines. I think that that would be valuable, and it would be a way of holding the consular services to account. It would allow people to come back and say, “You said you were going to do this, this and the next thing, but you didn’t. Why not?”—that kind of thing. 
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Do you think there is a disconnect between consular services on the ground that try to ensure that justice is done and the reaction from the FCO more generally when that doesn’t take place—because there has been a miscarriage of justice, there hasn’t been a fair trial, there has been torture or whatever? Is the reaction from the top sufficient to match the expertise and the training on the ground? It is all right doing something on the ground competently, but if there is a lack of bite at the top, there is a disconnect. Is that a fair criticism or not? We have heard one or two complaints suggesting that that may be the case. 
default              
defaultBruno Min:default Again, the problem is that we are dealing with a very large network of consular posts across the world, and there are good examples of posts that have taken a much more proactive approach than 
defaultWhitehall
default would have done. Then there are examples where it is the other way around—where posts do not take the initiative to help individuals in distress. 
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default So it is very patchy.
default              
defaultBruno Min:default The point is that it seems quite inconsistent. One way of addressing the problem is, as we have suggested, by ensuring that the relevant training is delivered to all consular staff so that they know what they are supposed to be doing and how to recognise certain problems, but it is difficult to generalise about how it all works. A lot of the things that take place in the Foreign Office are done behind closed doors, so we do not necessarily get to see when diplomatic notes are being exchanged or anything like that, so it is a difficult area for us to comment on. 
default              
defaultKevin Laue:default Very briefly, it probably is patchy. The samples that we have had over the years are relatively small, but there is enough to show that it can vary a lot from state to state. Partially, I think it is just about personnel, but it is also about the politics and the foreign policy of the particular country—whether it is an ally and so on. It is not consistent. 
defaultChair:default Thank you both very much indeed. It has been very helpful to us, and it is much appreciated. 
default              defaultExamination of WitnessdefaultWitness: 
defaultEve Hendersondefault, 
defaultDirector and Co-founder
default,
default Support After Murder and Manslaughter Abroad, gave evidence.
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The next witness is Eve Henderson, director and co-founder of SAMM Abroad. Am I pronouncing that correctly?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Yes.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I understand that you co-founded the organisation in 2001 after your husband was murdered in 
defaultFrance
default. 
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default That is right.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The poor service that you felt you encountered from the FCO motivated you to found the charity to support others. Since then, you have directly helped more than 250 families—congratulations. 
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Thank you.
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would you like to make an opening remark?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default No, but I would like to say that the subject is really vast. What I touch on today will probably be just a minuscule part of what we do.
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are quite focused on the provision of consular services. Can you summarise the main complaints that you hear from your members about the FCO’s service?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default As I set out in the written submission, this is not a criticism of desk officers individually; it is the position that they hold and the fact that they are dealing with traumatised families. I would like to emphasise that these are not like any other deaths. We all experience death in our families and we are all bereaved. Following a homicide, there is shock and trauma, and families cannot get past that. I just need to emphasise that this is like no other death. Somebody once asked me whether I would want my daughter to be a desk officer. The answer is no, because they are dealing with people who are going to be cross and angry, which is understandable. That is why in the written submission we talked about having a specialist unit to deal purely with homicides. 
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We very much appreciated your written submission.
default              
defaultIs it fair to say that the Foreign Office is a bit of a curate’s egg—good in some parts and not so good in others? Is it patchy? Can you identify any weak spots?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default It is very patchy. It is down to individual desk officers—we are talking about consular services abroad—if they have contact. Many of the families are here in the 
defaultUK
default when their loved one is murdered abroad, so they may deal only with the Foreign Office in 
defaultLondon
default until the time of the trial, when they will engage with the consular staff in a foreign country. 
default              
defaultIn the Foreign Office, it is almost as though the responsibility lies with somebody who is dead. It is about repatriating the body and making sure that the process is managed. Well, actually, you can’t help a dead person—it is too late for them—but you can help the family, and there is where the problem lies. It is not dealt with sympathetically; it is about the process and the practicalities of it. They cannot offer any money or provide emotional support themselves. What we do is peer support, basically—this is what you can do. The first thing we recommend to people is that they go and see their MP. 
defaultChair:default And they regularly do.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Have the service improvements that have supposedly been made seen a greater emphasis from the FCO? For example, with murder and manslaughter cases, has the FCO given more prominence to the service it provides to people like you?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default No, I don’t think so.
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Not 
defaultat
default all.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default They have outsourced some of it, and that is one of the things that we will probably come to, and I am not sure whether that is a good thing.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultMr Roy:default The FCO has said that over the last three years it has placed greater importance on—
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, that is about training, and the problem with desk officers is that they are passing through the Foreign Office. We raised the topic of having a homicide unit more than 10 years ago, and we were told, “There is no way you can have that. This is the way the Foreign Office works and you have got no chance.” We persisted, and now it is looking at it, but I can send you a parliamentary question raised by 
defaultPriti
default Patel, who has a constituent with a homicide in the family.
defaultChair:default We 
defaulthave
default copies of her report.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default They are talking about the autumn. We raised it and it was being taken seriously at the end of 2012. Charles Hay, the former director of consular services, came to a meeting, met the families in March and said, “Yes, we are dealing with it; we are going to do it.” That was March last year. We are coming up to a year now and we are talking about the autumn. Bear in mind that that is 10 years, so if you are asking me whether I feel progress is being made, if it is, it is slow.
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Are you confident that the FCO is moving in the right direction or is there stagnation?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I am not confident. I am not confident about things like the MOU being reviewed and how it is being monitored. A previous witness talked about guidelines. It asked us to look at the checklist that it is currently conducting, but when we ask for the guidelines that go behind that checklist, we get “No, that’s classified.” Well, can we have the 
defaultorganogram
default to tell us where the desk officers sit? “No, sorry, that’s classified.” We are up against it. We are not professionals; we are supporting families—that is my remit.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default Can I raise a point that I have come across as a Member of Parliament, and that is attitude, whether face to face or on the phone? Is that something that you recognise?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I am not sure that this is the right place for anecdotes. Feel free? When Charles Hay came to our meeting—he has moved on, and that is the other problem. You get this revolving door and you are speaking to the next person. When you think someone will be there to help you through the system, it doesn’t happen. 
default              
defaultWe have families who phone up and the officer gets the name wrong of the deceased. They get letters to the dead person with “deceased” in brackets. There are administrative things—they are stupid, but someone should be looking at them. These things distress families—“Does anyone care about my loved one who is dead?” It speaks for itself.  That is a training issue—
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Roy:default I was told about 10 years ago by one family I dealt with that, with hindsight, they wished that the Foreign Office people had experience of “death counselling”, which you can expect from other organisations in the United Kingdom. If you go to the DWP, for example, you speak to someone who is experienced in that type of counselling. Certainly my constituent felt that that was missing. Is that still the case?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I think that desk officers do experience bereavement counselling, but that is about a normal death—it is not about homicide, which is a really specialist area. The needs of these families are the same as if the murder had occurred in the 
defaultUK
default. They need access to accurate information, not to be misled. We have people missing trials—there is a vast range. One of the things that was promised, probably about five years ago, was that every family would have a FLO—a family liaison officer—and this was written by a Minister, but we do have cases when that does not happen. I had a family liaison officer without a senior investigation officer looking at it and giving some instruction. FLOs struggle—even a police FLO will struggle without background information. As I say, the subject is massive and that was why the memorandum of understanding covered it.
default              
defaultThe FCO has a coronial department, but we have never had access to it. We have one family for whom the husband is lying in a mortuary in this country—the body was returned and the coroner agreed to keep it until the trials had taken place. That was five years ago and it is still in the mortuary. The wife has had to move; she could not drive past the mortuary with her husband’s body there without having had the trial. Maybe that coroner made a mistake, but whatever the reason was for his agreeing to that, the Foreign Office has a coronial department and it should be advising.
defaultChair:default We are coming to the MOU in a minute.
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default Just to confirm that we have understood what you have said, you have essentially said that you are not satisfied with the training that the Foreign Office currently receives, you believe that this responsibility should be taken out of the hands of desk officers, and you are not confident that the Foreign Office has been—from your point of view—sufficiently open and constructive in dealing with your recommendations. Is that correct?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default That is right. 
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default Could you please give us a concrete example of the sort of thing that might go wrong? You have talked about the administrative problem and receiving and getting a name wrong. Do you have any stories or examples of what happens when somebody gets in touch with a desk officer and the sort of things that the desk officer would not be good at doing?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default The first thing is about repatriation and how we get the body home. Does the desk officer tell the family that, without repatriation, there will be no inquest? Families are distraught and they might think that an inquest will mean cutting up their loved one again. That would be their immediate thought—“That is not what I want”—but that is not the real issue; the real issue is that you need to bring the body back complete. It is no good bringing ashes back as it will not provoke an inquest. That was one of the first things that we said.
default              
defaultRegarding forensics, there is a very recent case where the clothing of the dead person was posted back to the family and had not been analysed in the foreign country. That leaves a role for our police or for somebody to look at preserving that evidence, as it may be needed. Regarding witnesses that are with the person, in my case my husband and my son-in-law were 
defaultboth attacked and nobody spoke to them once we were home, nobody supported them at the police station, nobody came to the hospital while he was dying, even though we had engaged with the Foreign Office. I do not want to go back to my case because it was some time ago, but I hear of that sort of thing happening.
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultRory Stewart:default Concretely, taken out of the hands of the desk officer, we would be looking for somebody who you feel should, presumably, have spent a minimum amount of time doing this job, with a specific type of homicide training? Is the way to fill this to take a member of the Foreign Office staff, a civil servant, and give them the homicide training, or is your recommendation that one would instead go for somebody who has a background in dealing with homicide and bring them into the Foreign Office? In other words, there are two models. You could take somebody on a conventional Foreign Office career, maybe on their way to becoming an ambassador, and post them for a minimum length of time in a homicide department, or you could bring in someone from a non-profit background, from the police or some other area, and put them in a specialist cell. Do you have an instinct on which would work better?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default My instinct is that retired police officers who have done their 30 years and are young when they come out have that background, that nose for when things are going wrong and when we should be intervening. According to the speech that William Hague gave in, I think, April 2012, 10% of all homicides of British people are abroad. That is 10%. Then we talk about £100,000 being given—it is a drop in the ocean against what is spent on homicide here in the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultFor perpetrators of crime—I might 
defaultadd that sometimes it is a British perpetrator of crime abroad who has killed the loved one of our families—it has a different connotation. I do not want to say all the support is given to the British perpetrator, but a certain amount is. They have rights. They are alive, so they have rights. That is what I gathered from the information here: people who are alive have rights and people who are dead have none, but the families of those dead people expect it, and that raises the thing about expectation. 
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Just to reiterate, congratulations and well done on what you are doing and the service you have provided. 
default              defaultEve Henderson:default Thank you. 
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Baron:default Is it just a question of training, though? In a couple of the examples you gave—you talked about the return of personal belongings and so forth—it seemed as though the system was partly to blame as well. There is a need for an improvement in training, personnel skills and all the rest of it—how you approach it and so forth—but is it the system as well that needs to be looked at, in your view? 
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Absolutely. I would like much more emphasis—these are vulnerable families, and I believe that that needs to be looked at in isolation. I know every time I raise it at the Foreign Office, they say, “What about the rape victims?” or whatever, but actually, they are standing. It is not that I have no sympathy for that, but I am dealing with homicides. These people have a loved one who is dead. Who is speaking for them? 
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Am I correct in saying you are dissatisfied with the written guidance from the FCO?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default We haven’t seen their written guidance, except for what goes out to the public, but of course—
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I am talking about the FCO’s publications on dealing with bereavement.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, that is not especially about homicide; it is about all bereavement. It has to be specific. Families don’t even read leaflets. They are incapable. They need an advocate, usually a policeman. 
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The FCO has produced a booklet called “Guide for Bereaved Families”. As I understand it, you have expressed dissatisfaction with that publication. 
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default 
defaultI have not expressed dissatisfaction with that, because it will work very well. To quote it, 4,000 British nationals die abroad every year. I am not interested in 3,940 of them; I am actually only interested in the 60.
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultSandra Osborne:default I believe you were involved in drawing up the memorandum of understanding between the FCO, ACPO and the Coroners’ Society. You described it in your written submission as groundbreaking, but you don’t sound as if you are very impressed by it or have seen much difference since it came in. Is that the case?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, it hasn’t been monitored. It hasn’t been reviewed. It does say that after one year, it will be reviewed annually, for cases that go on longer. We have asked them on numerous occasions how that is. Just recently, within the last couple of weeks, I have had an “It’s too early to review”. It will be coming up for two years in August. In the making of it, that was all being talked about. It is about getting something done. It is quite frustrating for it to be there while we do not see the improvements. 
default              
defaultOf course, for lots of families, the problems do not arise immediately. It is when they discover—they read newspapers and see what help is there after the event, and then say, “Well, why didn’t I get that?” It is about whether it is high-profile, how much press involvement there is and whether their MP supports them. Those people who are articulate get a lot more done. I worry about the families who never come anywhere near us and just had to bury—sorry, unfortunate word—suppress what they would really like to do or say. Who is following up on them? The Foreign Office is not proactive in contacting people. If you do not ring them regularly, they will not interact with you. 
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultSandra Osborne:default Does your organisation provide trauma counselling? 
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default No. I don’t know whether I’ve said this, but the one good thing to have come from outsourcing is 
defaultTrauma Assist
default, which does an excellent job. It also deals with 
defaultUK
default homicides, which is its expertise. The unfortunate thing is that Trauma Assist tries not to take people until after a trial, because trauma is quite long term. They are the experts and we have no trouble, but we are not funded by the Ministry of Justice and 
defaultTrauma Assist
default cannot take referrals from us. I do not understand all of that. Either we are doing a good job or we are not, and somebody should be assessing that. Why does the fact that we are not funded by the 
defaultMoJ
default mean that 
defaultTrauma Assist
default can’t accept people from us? That leaves me not understanding how it all works.
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If you say that the one good thing is Trauma Assist, does that mean that the rest of it isn’t very good?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I can’t say that in every case, but I can say that it’s patchy. Trauma Assist is one of the good things that has come from it.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The FCO makes it quite clear that it uses specialist partners for different aspects. Do you welcome that? Are they up to the mark?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Who is looking at what they are doing?
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Good. The Foreign Office says things like, “We are helping with repatriation, translations and interpreters.” Take the first one, repatriation. Are we talking about the cost of it, or are we just telling people where the international undertaker is? We can do that. One family was offered £400 towards the £4,000 repatriation cost. Is that what we call assistance? Either we are going to provide money for repatriation or not. Most people are insured. I do not think that there would be very many per year who do not have insurance that would cover repatriation.
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you think the Foreign Office should be doing more itself? Should it have in-house training to deal with this? It doesn’t have the capacity at the moment.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I query how outsourcing is a good thing unless it is open and transparent. That applies to repatriation. Who is helping, when, why and how much? Families talk to us about this. There has just been an Adjournment debate on a case in the House, which I don’t know whether anyone has seen. Stella 
defaultCreasy
default raised it on behalf of one of her constituents. For the first time, Victim Support has come up with £1,800—which is not a lot—so that the family can engage a lawyer. Our families are told that there is no help available for that.
default              
defaultI have no objection to that family getting the funding, but it is inconsistent. Who is picking who gets that help? £1,800 is not going to go anywhere. The review into the needs of homicide victims by 
defaultLouise Casey
default was excellent, and it showed that our families were paying out something like £60,000 to employ a lawyer and so on.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default On that very point, we have the Victim Support National Homicide Service. Do you have any experience of that?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, they don’t engage with us. We pass out the leaflets, and obviously we tell people immediately. From November 2010 we tell people that they are entitled to the Victim Support National Homicide Service. Some of them come back and say that it is a bit tea and sympathy, and it’s not very structured. Are they doing a tick-box exercise? I don’t know. I can’t comment on it. I just hear from families after the event. I don’t want to be derogatory about people who are trying to do their best, and perhaps it is underfunded and you can’t offer everything to everybody, but it needs to be transparent and it needs to be effective.
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I must say that in my experience of looking at the various organisations here, every one of them say that they could do with some more funding, including the Foreign Office for that matter. As a last question, you have been fairly critical of the Foreign Office: on a scale of nought to 10, where nought is very bad and 10 is excellent, where do you pitch the Foreign Office’s performance?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I think they think they are doing a brilliant job and from everything that I have written to me from Ministers, parliamentary questions we ask, reference to our guidelines, I honestly think they think they are doing a good job. Well, come and talk to our families.
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultCdefaulthair:default So where do you put it? At five? Three? Seven?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I give them five for effort and three for achieving what families need. Sorry.
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Baron just says it reminds him of his school reports.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default I would just like to ask Sandra Osborne whether she is aware that one of her constituents has been murdered abroad. Do you cover 
defaultMinishant
default? 
defaultSandra Osborne:default Yes.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, I might just ask this family to come and talk to you if that is okay.
defaultSandra Osborne:default Sure.
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I’ve got two constituency cases right here in front of me: Mrs D. Ashton, whose son was shot on a beach in 
defaultThailand
default about this time last year. Were you involved in that case?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default No. My assumption is because it was high-profile and there was not a financial problem for the family.
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default They were insured?
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, yes, but they can afford lawyers. The insurance won’t cover a lawyer. That is not something that is covered by our insurance companies. The Foreign Office, the first words out of their mouth to our families are: “Get yourself a lawyer because we can’t interfere in a foreign judicial process.”
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Fortunately, in this case the insurers covered the lawyer.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, that is amazing.
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It was because he paid for the holiday with his credit card.
default              
defaultEve Henderson:default Well, I paid for mine but I had to pay my own repatriation.
defaultChair:default Which only goes to show, Ms Henderson, it is an uncertain world. We really value you coming along here today. It has been very interesting. Thank you very much indeed.
