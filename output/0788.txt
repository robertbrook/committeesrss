[[[Background]]]&#xa0;1.1. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) is a fluctuating long-term condition that affects around 250,000 men, women and children in the UK. It causes symptoms affecting many body systems, more commonly the nervous and immune systems. Around 25% of patients are severely affected, and may be confined to bed or unable to leave the house without the use of a wheelchair. &#xa0;1.2. Action for M.E. is the UK’s largest charity for people affected by M.E. We provide information and support, campaign for better services and more effective treatments, and drive and invest in research.&#xa0;1.3. Our submission focuses on four terms of reference from the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into the management of long-term conditions.inquiry into the Management of long-term conditions inquiry into the Management of long-term conditions It is based on responses to a 14-question survey for people with M.E. in England, devised by Action for M.E. and publicised via our Online M.E. Centre and social media sites from 4 to 30 April 2013.&#xa0;1.4. The survey was answered by 252 people with M.E. This was a good response given the short time frame. Results of the survey reflect what we expected and are broadly representative of people with M.E., with who the charity is in daily contact.&#xa0;1.5. The duration of respondents’ illness is as follows:&#xa0;(250 respondents answered this question)

[[[.]]]&#xa0;2.1. Of the 244 people who answered the question “Do you have any other conditions?”-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 27.9% (68 respondents) said no-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 72.1% (176 respondents) said yes&#xa0;2.2. These conditions most commonly include fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and thyroid-related conditions.&#xa0;2.3. Respondents were asked to tick all the statements that applied to them. Responses were as follows:&#xa0;(209 respondents answered this question)

A respondent in Buckinghamshire said: “Some of my GPs are often biased by the diagnosis of M.E. when I try and discuss another issue or want to seek further advice or tests. It can also take some time to discuss a condition properly in light of other conditions I have, which can be difficult in a 10 minute slot.”&#xa0;2.5. Action for M.E. supports the view that a holistic approach, encouraging patients to discuss more than one symptom and condition, in each appointment, would be helpful. We appreciate that GPs must operate within strict time constraints, so it would be helpful if patients with M.E. and other long-term conditions could be encouraged to book double appointments.&#xa0;2.6. Respondents were asked to tick all the statements that applied to them. Responses were as follows:&#xa0;(231 respondents answered this question)

[[[Number of respondents]]]My healthcare professional treats me as a person, not just as an illness or illnesses&#xa0;61141My healthcare professional sees me just as a collection of symptoms to be treated&#xa0;3990&#xa0;2.7. Action for M.E. was pleased to see that a majority of patients agreed that their healthcare professional treats them as a person, not just as an illness or illnesses. However, the Aviva health of the nation index found that M.E./CFS was the condition that GPs find most challenging to refer for specialist attention, and has been so for the last ten years.&#xa0;2.8. We believe awareness and understanding for patients could be improved if GPs were able to access better education about M.E. Charities such as Action for M.E. and local M.E. support groups could help facilitate this. &#xa0;2.9. Respondents were asked to tick all the statements that applied to them. Responses were as follows:&#xa0;(235 respondents answered this question)

[[[.]]]&#xa0;3.1 We asked respondents to indicate which healthcare professionals they have been treated by for their M.E. &#xa0;(241 respondents answered this question)

Around 90% of respondents (221 out of 241) had been seen by more than one healthcare professional for their M.E. We asked if these healthcare professionals complemented each other in delivering their care. Of the 227 people who answered this question, -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 54.2% (123 respondents) said yes-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 17.6% (40 respondents) said no-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 29.5% (67 respondents) said they weren’t sure.&#xa0;3.3. We asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and 125 did so. Examples include:&#xa0;3.4. “I had to keep repeating myself every time I saw somebody different, even if they were members of the same team, which was exhausting for someone with M.E.” (Respondent in Yorkshire)&#xa0;3.5. “I access all the people via the CFS/M.E. North East service (based in Newcastle) which I was referred to via my GP. The service updates my GP well so he can offer advice mid sessions.” (Respondent in Northumberland)&#xa0;3.6. “Bristol has a wonderful M.E. centre at Frenchay Hospital where there is multi-disciplinary care from medics, OTs, physiotherapists, psychologists etc. My GP (both now and where I lived before) acknowledged both that I am an expert patient when it comes to this and the superiority of the knowledge of the M.E. team, and so will go along with what they suggest.” (Respondent in North Somerset)&#xa0;3.7. “The consultant copied letters to me to my GP. She referred me to a psychologist who was trained in offering CBT for M.E. patients and knew a lot about M.E. Again, he copied his assessment to my GP. I've also seen a psychologist for depression, referred to by my GP, and she also copied assessments to my GP.” (Respondent in Oxfordshire)&#xa0;3.8. We asked respondents what social care services they had been offered in the last year.&#xa0;(240 respondents answered this question)

A respondent in Suffolk told us: “After contacting Social Services in October 2012, I am still waiting for an appointment to discuss what care I am entitled to. Three out of five appointments have been cancelled within 48 hours of the scheduled appointment, by the social worker.”&#xa0;3.10. Many respondents told us they rely on their immediate family for care. &#xa0;3.11. We asked if respondents if social care professionals working with them complemented each other in delivering their care. Of the 83 people who answered this question, -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 67.5% (56 respondents) said no-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 6% (5 respondents) said yes-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 30.1% (28 respondents) said they weren’t sure.&#xa0;3.12. We asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and 32 did so. None were able to offer examples of effective integration of services.&#xa0;3.13. A respondent in Ipswich told us: “I have been advised by my social worker that they cannot and will not get involved with any care relating to my children and therefore any care provided for me is for me and me alone. This is particularly unhelpful, especially as I am no closer to getting a care package in place for me after making first contact with social services more than six months ago.”&#xa0;3.14. A majority of people with M.E. (86% - see paragraph 3.6) told us they have been offered no social care services in the last year. Given the disabling physical symptoms of M.E., and the fact that 25% of patients are severely affected (house- or bed-bound), we believe it is important to have a national approach to improving quality and developing social care, with specific guidance for specialist conditions such as M.E.&#xa0;

[[[he interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions]]]

[[[.]]]&#xa0;4.1. Living with a long-term condition such as M.E. is no easy task. Some people with M.E. find themselves facing a mental health issue, such as depression or anxiety, as a result. We asked respondents to tell us about their experience of this, and 217 did so.&#xa0;4.2. Many respondents spoke of the anxiety, depression and isolation that comes from living with a long-term, fluctuating condition that is still little understood. Some felt that their GP understood this reaction, while others are wary of discussing mental health issues alongside their M.E.&#xa0;4.3. A respondent in Greater Manchester said: “I fear saying anything because my GP and healthcare professionals have so many times tried to attribute any symptoms I have down entirely to me being depressed.”&#xa0;4.4. We asked respondents if their mental health issue was considered separately from their M.E. by their healthcare professional. Of the 213 people who answered this question, 23.8% (50 respondents) said this question wasn’t relevant to them. Of the remaining 163 respondents,-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 43.6% (71 respondents) said yes-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 35% (57 respondents) said no-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 21.4% (35 respondents) said they weren’t sure4.5. We asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and 105 did so.&#xa0;4.6. A respondent in West Sussex said: “Sometimes I have felt that healthcare professionals consider my health issues and physical symptoms to be caused by depression or anxiety, which I find extremely frustrating as I feel my anxiety and depression are brought on by the M.E. and not the other way around.”&#xa0;4.7. M.E. is a neurological condition, not a mental health problem. While it is encouraging to see that 43.6% (see paragraph 4.4.) reported that their mental health issue was considered separately from their M.E. by their healthcare professional, just over a third did not, while more than a fifth said they weren’t sure, indicating a lack of clarity in communication from their healthcare professional. Understanding and awareness of M.E. among health professionals must be improved.

[[[ offered personalised services, and patient contribution to better outcomes.]]]&#xa0;5.1. We asked respondents if they have a care plan based on their individual needs. Of the 230 people who answered this question, -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 87% (200 respondents) said no-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 7.8% (18 respondents) said yes-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 5.2% (12 respondents) said they didn’t know.&#xa0;5.2. We asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and 57 did so.&#xa0;5.3. One respondent in Greater Manchester said: “Since moving to my current address five months ago I have found it very frustrating that my care support plan has not been adhered to. I have received mostly help with domestic tasks and no personal care. It has not addressed my individual needs and has also been too expensive for me to afford, meaning that I have had to cancel care and am now making a formal complaint.”&#xa0;5.4. We asked respondents if they thought that their healthcare professional valued their ideas when it came to working out treatment. Of the 223 people who answered this question, -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 37.7% (84 respondents) said yes-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 34.5% (77 respondents) said no-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 30.9% (69 respondents) said they weren’t sure.&#xa0;5.5. We asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and 120 did so. Some examples of effective patient contribution to better outcomes include:&#xa0;5.6. A respondent in Kent said: “The fluctuations and limitations of my illness (dysphonia/sensory sensitivity) make consultations either difficult to attend or very long (always double appointments). So about a year ago my GP provided me with his surgery email address so that I can provide him with updates and relevant research material prior to consultation to inform my on-going care. As a result his knowledge of my illness and support for me has increased and my consultations with him are more constructive.”&#xa0;5.7. Listening to patients as individuals, as well as through national bodies such as Healthwatch England, is key to better patient outcomes. Action for M.E. is encouraged to see that more than a third of patients have had this experience – but they are still in the minority. A fundamental shift in attitude is required.&#xa0;May 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; www.actionforme.org.uk www.facebook.com/actionforme and www.twitter.com/actionforme  Aviva health of the nation index, 2013, p 22, www.aviva.co.uk/library/pdfs/health/hotn-index-2013-gen4805.pdf
