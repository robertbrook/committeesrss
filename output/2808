[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Dr Phillip Ambler, on behalf of Karenaid[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][bold] [bold]1.[bold]Given the rapidly changing environment in Burma, how should DFID’s programme develop?[bold]It needs to ensure that investment and development centrally in Burma is matched with a programme on the borders to rehabilitate people who have been displaced for generations, and whose homelands and communities destroyed. A joint action plan between the government of Burma and its armed forces and NGOs and agencies working with the displaced people needs to be applied and monitored.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][bold] [bold]2.[bold]The balance of DFID’s programme in Burma. What should DFID do less of, and what should it[bold]&#xa0;[bold]do differently?[bold]DFID needs to remain active in its humanitarian work with displaced people, and use the opportunity to prepare them to resume their lives as active participants in a democratic Burma. The target of 155,000 falls far short of the need; that number are in recognised camps, but the numbers outside are nearer ten times that. DFID needs to engage with all organisations working in these settings. The same would apply to education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][bold] [bold]3.[bold]Given the extraordinary opportunity Burma has to move towards democracy, is [bold]DFID[bold]’s programme giving sufficient attention to assisting this process?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]No. It is failing to link aid with an obligation on Burmese forces to stop their continued conflict and abuses. DFID also needs to deal directly with displaced communities to see how they might become involved in the process. Without that, there can be no lasting, stable 
[normal]peace or democracy. It also needs to assist these communities themselves to develop democratic processes in anticipation of their return. Many have been generations in camps, or in no structured community outside the camps.  Of further concern, with time their leaders have died of been relocated to third countries, leaving a vacuum and the potential for disorder and radicalisation. 
[normal]Clearly the UNHCR has a role here, but NGOs working with those who are not registered can help where the UNHCR has no remit.
[normal]These objectives are laid out in DFID’s Summary Statement issued in June this year
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Help local community groups to work together to give people more of a say in decisions that affect their lives and increase political right and civil liberties. 
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Provide humanitarian assistance to people affected by conflict in eastern Burma, and to Burmese refugees in Thailand. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][bold]4.[bold] DFID provision of funding and advice to civil society organisations in Burma, particularly for strengthening coalitions, advocacy, research and monitoring capabilities. How successful has this been?[bold]The above response also applies to this. The same input should occur in the displaced communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][bold] [bold]5.[bold]What role should DFID play in helping to resolve ethnic tensions?[bold]For a long time people of different ethnicity have co-existed peacefully in the camps on the border. Tensions have started to develop where leadership has been lost and hope too. There is a great opportunity to use NGOs who work unconditionally with all ethnicities to help forge stronger understanding and partnerships in achieving specific goals that benefit the whole community such as welfare, health and education.
[normal]Again this will achieve DFID’s aim to:
[normal]
[normal]
[normal]Help local community groups to work together to give people more of a say in decisions that affect their lives and increase political right and civil liberties. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][bold]6.[bold] How effective is donor coordination and how well is DFID working to improve such coordination.[bold]Historically there has been good co-ordination, but given the number of organisations it can prove a challenge. My concern is that the smaller organisations such as Karenaid find it very difficult to have a voice. I will give you an example which I think illustrates a general point.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One of our key projects is the delivery of eye surgery to the displaced people of Burma; last financial year we undertook 2015 operations. Our main facility on the Thai-Burmese border is Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot, which is run by the internationally recognised Dr Cynthia Maung. This was visited by a Douglas Alexander during his time as Secretary of State for International Development, and he sent message to us subsequently that our work was exactly what DFID wanted to support, and we should apply for funding. This we did, seeking advice on the process, but were unsuccessful. To their credit, DFID ran a series of seminars
[normal] 
[normal]to advise those who had failed on how to do better.
[normal]I attended in my capacity as Chair of the Trustees of Karenaid, and as a member of the eye team who has worked on the border since 1990. Two related facts became clear, which I believe raises some important principles.
[normal]The first is that any organisation that is serious in expecting DFID support must be big enough to employ a full time fund raiser, which is excluding a considerable number of small but very effective and experienced participants.  The second point is that the application process was out-sourced to an agency who knew nothing of the Secretary of State’s personal interest in our applying. Whilst at one level that shouldn’t matter, it does reinforce the difficulty for small organisations to engage and also for DFID to deliver its intended objectives through them.
[normal]I suggest that there is a place for DFID to have a specific stream of funding available to small organisations with a proven track record, for whom the application process is easier. Should funds be granted, the monitoring process must be one that they can reasonably handle with their limited administrative capacity. If such funds were modest, say £50-100,000, the risk would be small. To minimise the burden on DFID of establishing and monitoring these projects, they would need a simplified system internally. However, if this were established, it would enable DFID to engage through these organisations a section of Burmese society that they are likely to miss on the grander scale projects. They could then through these organisations use this population as a measure of whether the changes in Burma are enabling displaced people to return; a form of “focus group”, though I dislike that term.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]It is our view that DFID needs to develop a strategy of engagement of smaller organisations with experience of the situation in Burma. To do this they need a more flexible approach. This will compliment the larger scale projects which it is rightly taking forward. Such a dual approach will avoid 
[normal]the exclusion
[normal] of marginalised groups in Burma, and help build a stable democracy
[normal].
