Under the Hirst (No. 2) test, besides ruling out automatic and blanket restrictions it is an essential element that the decision on disenfranchisement should be taken by a judge, taking into account the particular circumstances, and that there must be a link between the offence committed and issues relating to elections and democratic institutions (ibid., § 82).”&#xa0;“The essential purpose of these criteria is to establish disenfranchisement as an exception even in the case of convicted prisoners, ensuring that such a measure is accompanied by specific reasoning given in an individual decision explaining why in the circumstances of the specific case disenfranchisement was necessary, taking the above elements into account. The principle of proportionality requires a discernible and sufficient link between the sanction and the conduct and circumstances of the individual concerned (ibid., § 71).” (para 34-35)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[approach in the ]]]

[[[draft Bill]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“The draft Bill sets out three different potential approaches for the Committee to consider. Presenting a draft Bill with that range of options reflects the spectrum of views that we know exist on this question. However, it will of course be for the Committee, once established, to consider whether approaches beyond those canvassed in the draft Bill should also be considered by Parliament in due course. The first approach in the draft Bill is for prisoners sentenced to less than four years to be entitled to vote. A four-year bar has previously been discussed by Parliament. The second approach would limit the vote to prisoners sentenced to six months or less. The final approach would effectively restate the current position that anyone incarcerated following conviction would not have the vote. The Committee will want to consider these approaches, their consequences if they were in due course adopted by Parliament, and whether there are other options—for example, the Italian system, found to be compliant by the Court, which disfranchises prisoners post-release. The Committee will, I am sure, consider evidence on this and other approaches.”&#xa0;Sentence length as an approach to prisoner enfranchisement&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[WRITTEN EVIDENCE – ANNEXES]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Annex A – The Electoral Registration System]]]&#xa0;In the draft the Bill, the Government has set out one possible way in which sentenced prisoners who may be enfranchised under the options in the Bill might register under the current electoral registration system – but the Committee may of course wish to consider other system. A short summary is included below to assist the Committee’s with its consideration of the practical implications of proposals for prisoner enfranchisement. &#xa0;Current household registration system&#xa0;Under the current household registration system most applications to be added to the electoral register are made during the annual household canvass period. This begins in July/August and electoral registers must be published by 1 December. Prisons are not canvassed by Electoral Registration Officers; this is expressly prohibited by section 10(3)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and this would not be changed by the draft Bill. &#xa0;If the provisions in the draft Bill were adopted an eligible prisoner would therefore need to initiate their own registration by completing a registration application. Under the provisions in the Bill as currently drafted, eligible prisoners would register at the address in the UK at which they were resident immediately before they became a prisoner or, if the prisoner has no such address, at an address in the UK where they have resided when they were not a prisoner. If the prisoner has no previous residence in the UK (for example, if they were previously of no fixed abode), the draft provisions allow the prisoner to register at a place where they spent a substantial amount of time when not a prisoner. A prisoner would be barred from registering in the constituency in which they are detained, unless they were treated as resident in that constituency through one of the routes described above.&#xa0;All applications would have to be accompanied by a statement from the prison governor or director (or his delegate) that the prisoner is eligible to vote (i.e. not barred from voting as a consequence of their sentence). Prisoner registrations would last for 12 months, at which point the prisoner would need to submit another application. In order to vote, the prisoner would need to apply for either a postal or proxy vote by completing an application for an absent vote and returning this to the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO).&#xa0;If a person was already on the register when they are sent to prison and their sentence was such that they were not disenfranchised, their existing registration would remain in place so long as their period of detention was so short that they were regarded as remaining resident at their registered address. However, if they wanted to make a new application for registration while they were in prison, they would have to do so in the manner set out above.&#xa0;Individual Electoral Registration (IER) system&#xa0;The Committee will wish to note that from the summer of 2014 in England and Wales and 1 October 2014 in Scotland, all new applications to register must be Individual Electoral Registration (IER) applications made on paper or through the IER Digital Service. Those who become eligible, register for the first time, or move house will need to make an IER application. During the transition to IER all current registers will be matched against trusted government databases, with most electors being added to IER and those that did not match being invited to re-register.&#xa0;Individuals making an application from the summer of 2014 (1 October in Scotland) will be required to supply their national insurance number (NINO) and date of birth as part of their application; this data will then be verified against trusted government databases before an application is accepted.&#xa0;The committee may wish to consider how any eligible prisoners under the options in the Bill would register to vote under this new system.&#xa0;

[[[Annex B - ]]]

[[[Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Draft Bill – Data on prison populations and receptions ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Note on the information contained in the tables below]]]&#xa0;The prison population tables presented in this document are provided to give an indication of number of prisoners who may be enfranchised at a given election if Parliament chose to enact one of options 1 or 2 of the Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Draft Bill. These figures are based on the prison population as at 30 June 2012 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and a 2011-12 average for Scotland.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;It is not possible to give an exact figure for the number of prisoners who would be entitled to vote in a given future election if either option were enacted. This is because the prison population is not static and fluctuates throughout the year, as well as from year to year. Exactly how many prisoners might be able to vote depends on how many prisoners sentenced to the relevant custodial term are serving that sentence in prison when an election is held, and have had sufficient time to be added to the register. So prison population data appears the best available proxy for estimating the numbers of prisoners who would be eligible to vote in a given future election, since it represents a snap-shot of the numbers of individuals serving sentences of particular lengths on a given day: but it is not an exact predictor of numbers of prisoners who might be entitled to vote under options 1 and 2 in the Bill.  The data given simply shows the breakdown of prisoners serving sentences on a specific day, in this case 30 June 2012.              &#xa0;For completeness we have also included receptions data, which is currently only available for England and Wales (covering those received into prison in the 12 months to June 2012) and Scotland (covering all receptions in 2011-12) to show the flow of prisoners through the prison system in a year. Prison receptions tables are included below showing the total number of persons sentenced to immediate custody of i) up to 4 years, and ii) 6 months and less in a single year. These figures do not represent the number of prisoners who may be eligible to vote in an election, as many would have completed their sentence and left prison before a given election date; it represents the annual flow of prisoners sentenced to different custodial terms across a year. &#xa0;Given that the Bill as currently drafted applies to all elections, the data here represents those included in the Local Government franchise (which includes EU citizens): the prison population and receptions data provided for England, Wales and Scotland therefore includes prisoners who are aged 18 and over and are UK, EU or Commonwealth nationals. The Northern Ireland data includes all prisoners aged 18 and over as data regarding the nationality of prisoners in Northern Ireland is currently not available.&#xa0;Data on recalls is reported separately to prisoner population by length of sentence data. It was therefore necessary, in some instances, to apportion recalls appropriately to arrive at the total number of prisoners, as some recalled prisoners would be serving sentences below the thresholds set by the options. The process for doing this is set out in the end note at the end of this annex. &#xa0;Data is presented separately for England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland due to differences in data quality, collection methods and the categorisation of prisoners by sentence type.&#xa0;

[[[Summary ]]]Tables 1 and 2 provide summaries of prisoner population on 30 June 2012 for England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the 2011-12 average for Scotland. Tables 3 and 4 show receptions data.  Figures are rounded to the nearest 100.              &#xa0;Prison population&#xa0;

[[[Northern Ireland ]]]Due to ongoing data quality issues, prison population and receptions breakdowns by sentence length, type and prisoner nationality are not available for Northern Ireland. The data is being revised and an update publication is expected on 25 July 2013. We will provide updated figures to the Committee shortly thereafter.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Endnote:]]]The recall population was re-apportioned amongst each sentence length band based on the size of each sentence length band relative to the prison population liable to be recalled. No recalls were apportioned in estimating the total population of prisoners serving sentences of 6 months and less in England and Wales. These prisoners are eligible for release on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) licence before their automatic release date (and could be recalled from that) but they are not currently subject to any licence or recall during the second half of their sentence. Therefore, recalls from HDC represent only a very small proportion in the total population of recalls. In Scotland, prisoners serving sentences of less than 4 years are in most cases not eligible for release on licence – no recalls were therefore apportioned. No recalls were apportioned in Northern Ireland due to low total populations of recalls.     &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Full or Partial Prisoner Voting Rights]]]

[[[Legal or ]]]

[[[de facto]]]

[[[ Ban on Prisoners Voting]]]&#xa0;

[[[Albania ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;All Albanian prisoners, regardless of conviction or sentence are eligible to vote under the same criteria as the rest of the population (minimum age, mental competence etc.).&#xa0;Prisoners vote in the constituency where the prison/pre-trial detention centre is located. A special polling station is established in any residential institution (prison, hospital etc.) with more than 15 voters, as provided for under Article 59 of the Electoral Code (there is no postal or proxy voting in Albania).&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the law. The issue of prisoner voting has not been raised in the recent political and media debate around amendments to the Electoral Code. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Andorra]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In practice, prisoners cannot vote, although they are not specifically banned from doing so. The very small prison population is mainly composed of foreign nationals, who could not vote anyway. There have been no recent legal challenges either before the ECtHR or domestically.&#xa0;

[[[Armenia]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Prisoners do not have any voting rights in Armenia. Article 30 of the Constitution sets out a clear ban on prisoner voting. The ban was confirmed in Article 2.3 of the Electoral Code passed in May 2011.There have been no recent legal challenges either before the ECtHR or domestically.&#xa0;

[[[Austria]]]In Austria, convicted prisoners generally retain the right to vote, unless the court decides to withdraw it on an individual basis. While the decision is at the court’s discretion, the following criteria must be provided: (1) either, the prison sentence is over five years without probation; (2) or, the sentence is over one year without probation for offences against the state, notably electoral fraud, treason, or denial of the Holocaust.  &#xa0;Background: The relevant law was changed in October 2011, following an Court’s ruling (Frodl v. Austria) against Austria’s former statutory ban on prisoner voting (for sentences over one year). The Austrian case is hence comparable to the UK’s current position. In Austria, political reluctance to implement the judgement meant that law-makers came up with the “compromise” described above, according to a Ministry of Interior official. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]De jure, the voting ban is lifted immediately upon leaving prison. (De facto, the release date has to be at least 68 days from the next election, to allow for the ex-convict’s inclusion in the electoral roll).

[[[&#xa0;]]]No challenges have been mounted to date.&#xa0; 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Previous positionAustrian Federal Elections Law excluded all persons from the right to vote who have been sentenced by an Austrian court as a result of one or more premeditated criminal acts to imprisonment for a period of more than one year. This exclusion ended six months after the end of the jail term and after any preventative measures related to this imprisonment were carried out or conclude.&#xa0;However, Austria lost a case before the Court in April 2010 because this exclusion is too vaguely formulated. Austria contested this but its appeal was turned down by the court in November 2010. As a result, Austria is reworking its law on this point. No information on when an amendment is expected to be adopted.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Azerbaijan]]]&#xa0;All prisoners have voting rights in Azerbaijan. The key issue here is general concern over the practicalities of voting (the accusation is that prisoners are often forced to vote for the ruling party) rather than their actual enfranchisement. The question of prisoners voting just isn’t a issue for politicians or the media. There have been no recent legal challenges either before the ECtHR or domestically and no changes made to the policy in recent years.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Belgium]]]&#xa0;The Belgium system&#xa0;for enfranchising offenders is based entirely on judicial discretion, and linked to sentence length. Disenfranchisement can continue after an offender has been released, or even if they have not been sentenced to custody. The law was recently changed.&#xa0;Since 15 April 2009 disenfranchisement is subject to judicial discretion. Persons convicted to the criminal sentences (felony) of life-imprisonment or custody in excess of 10 years: may be disenfranchised for a period between 20 and 30 years or permanentlyPersons convicted to the criminal sentence (felony) of custody between 5 and 10 years: may be disenfranchised permanently or for a period between 10 and 20 years.Persons convicted to correctional sentences (custody between 8 days and 5 years or up to 10 years in the case of repetition or aggravating circumstances) may be disenfranchised for a period between 5 and 10&#xa0;years. Need not have been sentenced to custody to be disenfranchised.An exception to the judicial discretion for disenfranchisement is article 123 sexies of the Criminal code which apply in case of infraction against the external security of the State. In some cases, depending of the gravity of the offense, the disenfranchisement may be automatic.&#xa0;The law of 14 April 2009 was adopted following a Belgian Constitutional Court (187/2005 -14 December 2005) ruling that automatic disenfranchisement was discriminatory and contrary to Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution.&#xa0;

[[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;All prisoners have voting rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina except those persons sentenced or indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Court of Federation of BiH, Court of Republika Srpska or Court of Brcko for the violation of the humanitarian law or failed to comply with an order to appear before all above mentioned Courts for whom disenfranchisement lasts the duration of the sentence. Therefore, the scheme operates by reference to offence type.&#xa0;There have been no recent legal challenges either before the ECtHR or domestically and no changes made to the policy in recent years.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Bulgaria]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Convicted prisoners cannot vote. &#xa0;In 2009, two prisoners brought a case before the Court over voting rights, which the Court is expected to rule on next year. This is the first such case against Bulgaria. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Croatia]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Head of prison service has just confirmed that prisoners in Croatia have the right to vote. Polling stations are organised within the prisons. Croatia has no penalties for not voting.Prisoners’ voting doesn’t represent an issue for Croatia.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Cyprus]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The default position in Cyprus is that prisoners do have voting rights. However this right is sometimes removed from them as part of their sentence.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Czech Republic]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]All prisoners have the right to vote in the Czech Republic. There have been no challenges to the legal framework and no changes have been recently made in this area.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Denmark]]]Voting rights are not removed from prisoners in Denmark – no matter for how long, or for what they are convicted. Voting rights are established in the Danish written constitution and by legislation. This would make any changes very difficult to get through.&#xa0;The argument used to defend prisoner voting rights is that it helps with the rehabilitation process. Prisoners, by being able to vote, continue to feel part of society and have a say in it – helping them to prepare for life after parole.&#xa0;The only exception to the above is when a person is deemed (by medical and municipal authorities) incapable, through mental illness for example, for managing their own affairs. Then they temporarily have the right to vote removed.&#xa0;There is no real debate on whether prisoners should have the vote or not, it is accepted as being ‘right’. Even the political parties with the harshest tone on criminality would not suggest removing the right to vote for prisoners. The right to vote is deemed a universal right alongside freedom of speech in Denmark.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Estonia]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Estonia does not allow convicted prisoners to vote due to a statutory ban which in nature is time-limited i.e. a ban is in place during the serving of the sentence only. &#xa0;The issue of prisoner voting is a matter of political debate in Estonia rather than in the media. The Estonian Parliament recommended to the Minister of Justice in a letter in 2007 to amend this law to allow certain categories of prisoner to vote. They asked for a draft bill to be drawn up to be presented to the Parliament to amend the existing legislation, however, there seems to be no political will in government to amend the existing legislation. &#xa0;The Ministry of Justice has not begun working on the draft bill to this date and is unlikely to do so under the present government.&#xa0;

[[[Finland]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]All prisoners have the right to vote in Finland. There have been no challenges to the legal framework and no changes have been recently made in this area.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[France]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Those convicted of crimes can be deprived of their right to vote in France as part of a criminal sentence. &#xa0;Disenfranchisement vote is at the discretion of the judge. It tends to be applied in offences relating to citizenship – e.g. fraud – rather than for serious crimes. It can be applied as part of a non-custodial sentence, i.e. it’s not “prisoners” being banned from voting but “convicts”. &#xa0;However, disenfranchisement is fairly rare – probably fewer than 2000 convicts are currently disenfranchised.  &#xa0;In 2009, the Constitutional Council decided that automatically depriving someone of the right to vote was unconstitutional – and so it can only be applied at the explicit discretion of the judge. At the time the decision was not controversial. &#xa0;What has been controversial, though, is the organisation of prisoners’ voting, in particular polling stations inside prisons. Postal voting is illegal in France, so a prisoner wishing to vote must either obtain permission from a judge to leave for the day or nominate a proxy. (Nominating a proxy is a much more complicated business than in the UK; you need to sign a document in the presence of a registrar.) Obviously this means very few actually vote – of the approximately 50,000 eligible, only around 1300 actually do so. Some are calling for polling stations inside prisons to enable prisoners to exercise their rights, which others do not see as a democratic imperative (turnout is also low in most depressed urban areas) nor a good use of resources. &#xa0;Another controversy turns on prisoners’ registered addresses. Historically all prisoners voted in the constituency in which they had been registered prior to incarceration. But recently the law was changed so that homeless people could be registered at the prison, meaning by extension that it was (at least theoretically) possible for all prisoners to register at the prison. There are some communes, especially in Ile-de-France, where the prison population is roughly equal to the resident population. There are fears this could give prisoners unwarranted political clout or even that they might elect their own Prisoner-Mayor. &#xa0;But prisoner voting is well accepted in France, and the controversies described above are pretty low-level. &#xa0;

[[[Georgia]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Prior to 2011, only those detainees in pre-trial detention were able to vote. In 2011 the law was amended to allow those prisoners serving sentences for ‘less grave crimes’ (e.g. petty crime, theft - as defined by Georgian law) to vote. Prisoners serving sentences for ‘grave crimes’ are not eligible to vote. Disenfranchisement is therefore dependent on the severity of the crime committed. Once any sentence has been served (grave or not), ex-prisoners are re-eligible to vote. The law was changed in 2011 to bring Georgia in line with international standards.&#xa0;Voting takes place in the prisons where eligible prisoners are housed. In practice, voting takes place in open and semi-open prisons, where those serving sentences for ‘less grave crimes’ are detained. Those serving sentences for ‘grave crimes’ are kept in closed prisons, where no voting is allowed. The new arrangements were tested for the first time during parliamentary elections on 1 October 2012. &#xa0;Prisoner voting rights are not a prominent matter of political and media debate in Georgia.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Germany]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]All prisoners are allowed to vote in Germany, unless they have been incarcerated for a crime whose explicit aim was to undermine the “free democratic or constitutional order” of the German State, such as political insurgents. These prisoners lose their right to vote and this loss of voting right continues until the full sentence has been served. Therefore, disenfranchisement depends on the type of offence. Active voting rights are only withdrawn on the express orders of a judge as part of a punishment, and this can occur for a period of between two and five years. A recent university dissertation found that this measure had been imposed in just 1.4 cases per year over the period studied, i.e. virtually never. With regard to passive voting rights, prisoners serving a sentence in excess of one year are automatically barred from standing for office or belonging to a political party for five years. &#xa0;As the German penal system is based on a philosophy of restorative justice and re-socialisation of offenders, prisoners are in fact actively encouraged to vote as the practice is thought to replicate normal living conditions outside prison and to promote the prisoner’s active interest and stake in society. The law regulating prisoners’ rights has not been amended recently and the government has no plans to do so. Voting rights for German prisoners is not a topic of political, public or media debate.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Greece]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Certain categories of convicted and sentenced prisoners lose their right to vote as part of their forfeiture of ‘political rights’ more generally. Those sentenced to life imprisonment lose their right to vote permanently.&#xa0;Prisoners who do have the right to vote exercise their right after being registered in special electoral lists and in special polling stations located in prisons or other detention facilities.&#xa0;&#xa0;According to the Criminal Code, the loss of the right to vote is imposed on the convicted and sentenced prisoner by the court as a supplementary sentence, i.e. a sentence that functions as an accessory to the main conviction sentence.&#xa0; It is in the court’s discretion to impose such supplementary sentences for up to five years, depending on the type of the criminal act committed and the overall circumstances.&#xa0; Disenfranchisement for all the above categories lasts throughout the prison term and, additionally, for the period determined by the court, starting from the day of release from prison.&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the law. The issue is not currently a matter of political or media debate in Greece. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Hungary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]To Note: The previous blanket ban was challenged and judgment was delivered in May 2010. The Court ruled in the Alajos Kiss v Hungary case that the absolute ban violated the right to free elections of Article 3 of Protocol 1 ECHR. However, Mr Kiss is a person with mental health problems put under partial guardianship. Since the Court issued its ruling, a number of legal experts and lawyers have urged the Hungarian Government to amend the relevant part of the Constitution but this is unlikely.&#xa0;This case is being supervised by the Committee of Ministers.&#xa0;Due to recent changes in legislation, there is no blanket ban on all convicted prisoners’ voting anymore. Prisoners barred from participating in public affairs are excluded from the right to vote for the duration of the ban. The exclusion from participation in public affairs is an additional penalty applied by the Court on a case-by-case basis (judicial discretion). &#xa0;The grounds for suffrage right restrictions are stipulated in Article XXIII (6) of the new Fundamental Law (Constitution) of Hungary, complemented (as of April 2013) by Article 24 in the Closing and Miscellaneous provisions. &#xa0;Article XXIII (6) of the Fundamental Law&#xa0;“A person disenfranchised by a court for committing an offence or due to his or her limited mental capacity shall have no suffrage. No citizen of any other member state of the European Union who is a resident of Hungary shall have passive suffrage if he or she has been disenfranchised in his or her native country under any law, court or official decision of his or her state of citizenship.”&#xa0;Closing and Miscellaneous Provisions of the Fundamental Law &#xa0;“24. (1) A person prohibited from public affairs under a final sentence at the time of the coming into force of the Fundamental Law shall not have suffrage while the sentence is in effect. &#xa0;(2) A person under guardianship restricting or excluding his capacity under a final judgement at the effective date of the Fundamental Law shall not have suffrage until such guardianship is terminated or until a court determines the existence of his or her suffrage.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Iceland]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]All Icelandic citizens remain on the voter registry regardless of crimes they may be convicted of. All prisoners have the opportunity to vote in the prison when elections take place.&#xa0;

[[[Ireland]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are now no legal restrictions on prisoners voting in Ireland. The right for prisoners to vote was introduced in Ireland by way of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006. It followed a Private Members’ Bill that was introduced into the Dáil (parliament) in 2005 by a Fine Gael TD. Opposition parties and bodies such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust had lobbied hard for a change in legislation in light of the European Court of Human Rights’ 2004 Hirst vs. UK ruling.&#xa0;Liam Herrick, Executive Director of the Irish Penal Reform Trust has been quoted in local media as saying that the nature of the debate on prisoner voting rights is very different in the Ireland to that in the UK.&#xa0; According to the IPRT: “There was no voiced opposition to the passing of the (2006) bill, and the media paid no attention at all”. The IPRT attributes the government’s decision to support the passage of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 both to its support for “encouraging the rehabilitation of offenders through underlining their responsibility to themselves and society by way of voting rights” and a desire to meet fully their obligations under the provisions of the ECHR.&#xa0;&#xa0;The issue of the constitutional rights of prisoners being affected by their imprisonment had been the subject of several previous Supreme Court cases. Until 2006, the Irish Government had previously chosen not (not) to provide prisoners with the right to vote. It argued that no legislation in Ireland prohibited or excluded prisoners from voting but relied on an interpretation of the Irish Supreme Court’s ruling that the State had no constitutional obligation to facilitate prisoners’ exercise of the right to vote. The Supreme Court had also ruled in 2001 that it was a consequence of lawful custody that certain rights of the prisoner (such as the right to vote) were curtailed, lawfully.&#xa0;At the time the Electoral Amendment Act was passed in 2006, there were slightly over 3,000 prisoners in Irish jails (the figure is now estimated to stand at around 4,500). The Act can be found at: http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/a3306.pdf&#xa0;All prisoners in Ireland are eligible to vote by post in elections once they place themselves on the electoral register. The postal vote is registered in the constituency in which the prisoner would otherwise have been resident. Prisoners, however, have no right to be given physical access to a ballot box by temporary release or any other way.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Italy]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Disenfranchisement in Italy is established by law according to the seriousness of crimes and repetitive criminal behaviours (ref. art. 29 of the Italian Criminal Code). It may be temporary (between one and five years) or permanent. Life-sentences and custodial sentences of more than five years imply permanent disenfranchisement. Habitual or repetitive offenders are disenfranchised permanently. &#xa0;Custodial sentences between three and five years attract disenfranchisement for five years. However, after serving their sentence, offenders with a custodial order between three and five years reacquire the right to vote. &#xa0;Certain specified offences attract disenfranchisement, all related to dishonesty (see FLAG B).The recent Court judgment (22 May 2012) on Scoppola vs Italy ruled that Italy’s legislation does not contravene art.3 of the first Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights, in that it does not provide for a blanket ban on prisoner voting rights, but only applies disenfranchisement in specific circumstances and allows reacquisition of the right to vote for offenders with a custodial sentence between three to five years.At present there is no intention of modifying the existing legislation and even more so in the light of the recent Court judgement.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Latvia]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In Latvia all prisoners have voting rights (regardless of sentence) in all elections apart from local elections. A prisoner is entitled to vote in European Parliament elections, Latvian General Elections, and National Referendums.&#xa0;This has not always been the case. Prior to the Court’s ruling in Hirst v. the United Kingdom, Latvian prisoners did not have voting rights. In 2008 Latvia introduced new legislation opening the vote to all prisoners.&#xa0;A representative from Latvian Ministry of Justice said that prisoner voting rights were introduced because of the Court  judgement Hirst vs. UK, where the Court had ruled that general, automatic and uncritical limitation to vitally important rights was against the European Convention Human Rights. She said that Ministry of Justice had introduced a practice of analysing the Court judgements early, and make changes to the Latvian laws to forestall future cases.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Liechtenst]]]

[[[ein ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Liechtenstein have included the following into their Civil Rights Act (Volksrechtegesetz, article 2):&#xa0;Excluded from right to vote (active and passive) are persons:&#xa0;-              convicted to more than one year in prison for crimes relating to treason (espionage), high treason (coup, assassination), attacks on state organs, punishable actions against defence organs, punishable actions related to elections and votes, criminal violations of official duties, disrupting foreign affairs and genocide.-              convicted to more than five years in prison for any other criminal action.&#xa0;

[[[Lithuania]]]All prisoners can vote. There have been no recent changes of policy.&#xa0;

[[[Luxembourg]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Convicted and sentenced prisoners keep their right to vote unless a court judgment specifies otherwise.&#xa0;Any prisoner sentenced to more than 10 years imprisonment is automatically barred from voting and all lose their right to vote for life. On the basis of the offence type, a judge can bar from voting any prisoners whose sentence is between 5 and 10 years and this loss of voting rights may last for the duration of the sentence, for 10 to 20 years or for life.&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the legal framework by the Court or the domestic courts and there have been no recent changes to policy.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Macedonia]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]All prisoners in Macedonia can vote. They vote (along with those unable to go out for medical reasons) one day before polling day. &#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the legal framework by the Court or the domestic courts and there have been no recent changes to policy.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Malta]]]The Maltese Constitution currently disqualifies from voting anyone who is serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) exceeding 12 months, including suspended sentences.&#xa0;As far as we know there haven’t been any recent challenges to the legal framework by the Court.&#xa0;It seems unlikely that there will be a change in the law anytime soon, as a constitutional amendment needing a two-thirds majority in favour would be required for it to pass through Parliament.&#xa0; There is limited political debate and no current momentum behind a move for change, a view confirmed by a local prisoners rights organisation (which nevertheless intends to present a paper to all political parties requesting a change to current practices).&#xa0; However we do know that the Maltese are closely following developments in the UK.&#xa0; A change there may influence the situation here.&#xa0;Periodically the issue is raised in the media.&#xa0; The trigger has often been the debate on the issue in the UK, or following decisions taken in the Court.&#xa0; However there is no concerted media campaign in favour of votes for prisoners.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Moldova]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Since June 2010, according to the Moldovan Electoral Code, detained persons (including prisoners, persons under pretrial detention and those detained under administrative arrest) have the right to vote unless they have been deprived of the right to vote by a final court decision (art 13, para 1). There is, however, a ban on sentenced prisoners and “individuals who have pending criminal records for deliberately committing crimes” getting elected (art 13, para 2).&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the law, and this is not a matter of political nor media interest in Moldova.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Monaco]]]All prisoners can vote in principle, although this right can be revoked in individual cases.&#xa0;

[[[Montenegro]]]All prisoners have the right to vote. There have been no challenges to the legal framework and no changes have been recently made in this area.This issue is not a matter of political debate in Montenegro.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Netherlands]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Prisoners sentenced to one year or more may have their right to vote removed by a Court if they have committed a crime “affecting the foundations of the state” (e.g. forgery of ballot papers, assault on the Monarch). However, in practice the Courts have not used this power for some time.&#xa0;There is full judicial discretion.&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the legal framework by the Court or the domestic courts and there have been no recent changes to policy.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Norway]]]All prisoners have voting rights. There is legislation that allows for these to be removed in cases of treason, electoral fraud or national security; but to the best of our knowledge there have been no cases where prisoners were disenfranchised.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Poland]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Offenders who have committed a crime with intent; and been sentenced to imprisonment for a period&#xa0; not less than three years, may be disenfranchised&#xa0;Disenfranchisement is applied in addition to the principal custodial sentence, at the judge’s discretion, for a period between 1 and 10 years. The judge decides on the precise start day, e.g. either it starts together, during or after the custodial sentence. As such the period of disenfranchisement may continue beyond the custodial sentence. &#xa0;There have not been any changes to existing legislation recently and there are no plans for any in the near future. &#xa0;The issue is not a matter of major political or public debate. However, politicians recognise the need to reach out to prison population in their campaigning. In comparison to countrywide election turnout (48% in 2011), the prison population participation in election is much higher (almost 60% - approx. 800 000 of those holding voting rights).&#xa0;The Polish Prison Service do not have any hard evidence statistics with regards to lessons learnt or benefits of prisoners voting rights, but they argue that for some groups of prisoners (especially those sentenced for the first time or with lower charges) the ability to maintain their public rights is an important factor in their rehabilitation process. The Polish experience shows that strong ties and interest in public/social life outside prison are important factors in prisoners’ development and rehabilitation programmes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Portugal]]]Prisoners can vote, unless they have been deprived of their “political rights” as part of their sentence.&#xa0; &#xa0;This deprivation might be imposed on a person convicted of a crime against the state or a crime related to elections or public office.&#xa0; &#xa0;We are not aware of any recent changes to policy or challenges to the legal framework.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Romania]]]The following categories of prisoners are allowed to vote:&#xa0;• prisoners under preventive arrest• prisoners still awaiting conviction • prisoners sentenced by first instance decision• sentenced prisoners that were not explicitly barred from voting by the Court (voting rights (and other rights) are determined by the judge on a case by case basis at the final conviction stage of the trial)&#xa0;Prisoners are not allowed to vote if they have been explicitly barred from voting by the Court.&#xa0; Depending on the nature of the criminal offence, the Court can decide whether to limit prisoner voting rights. This is on a case by case basis.&#xa0; Disenfranchisement lasts for the duration of the time spent in prison. It can also continue upon release – if the sentenced is undergoing further rehabilitation. &#xa0; &#xa0;There have been no recent policy changes or legal challenges.&#xa0; There is no policy or media debate about prisoner voting rights in Romania.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Russia]]]&#xa0;Russia does not permit any prisoners to vote.&#xa0;This stems from electoral law and the Criminal Procedural Code which explicitly disenfranchise prisoners.&#xa0; When released, they regain their right to vote (but not to be elected).&#xa0;Persons under investigation (either under suspicion or accused) are entitled to vote, even if in custody.&#xa0;We are not aware of any challenges to the law re: disenfranchisement itself. (but possible challenges to the conduct of voting for those under investigation – ballot boxes are brought to their cells which doesn’t guarantee secret voting)&#xa0;Public and government opinion is against changing the law.&#xa0; When the Justice Secretary met with the Chair of the Constitutional Court, the latter expressed interest in our approach and the ECtHR challenge and what the UK could do to retain a de facto bar on prisoner voting – they will have a vested interest that the ECtHR ruling does not alter Russian law/practice.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[San Marino]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Prisoners sentenced to more than one year cannot vote. This is  provided for by San Marino’s Electoral Law. &#xa0;Offenders can reacquire their right to vote after serving their sentence.  &#xa0;San Marino’s detention context is quite different from any other countries. They only have one prison and cases of detention are very rare. Also their criminal code is far milder than any other countries (i.e. there is no life sentence and there are a number of alternative measures to detention). They do though have a bilateral agreement with Italy allowing them to dispose of their prisoners in specific circumstances.&#xa0;

[[[Serbia]]]All prisoners, regardless of length of sentence, type of crime, or detention facility, are entitled to vote. Polling stations are set up inside prisons and detention centres on election day (as colleagues from this Embassy witnessed on 6 May in a youth detention facility near Valjevo in western Serbia for this year’s parliamentary, presidential and local elections) to facilitate this.&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the law, nor do we judge it likely that Serbia will change its legislation on this in the near future.&#xa0;The issue of prisoner voting is not a matter of political or media debate in Serbia, nor is it likely to be. If the UK ends up in conflict with the Court, it is more likely that the UK’s policy will be the subject of media focus, rather than Serbia’s own.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Slovakia]]]Some prisoners have the right to vote. The nature of restrictions is determined with reference to sentence length. Prisoners sentenced for more than ten years in prison cannot vote. Sentence length limits are set by the legislation and the judge can also take into account the circumstances of the case. &#xa0;&#xa0;Disenfranchisement lasts for the whole duration of the sentence and does not continue upon release. &#xa0;There have not been any recent challenges to the legal framework for disenfranchisement before the Court or Slovakia’s domestic courts. &#xa0;Issue of prisoner voting is not an issue of either political or media debate in Slovakia.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Slovenia]]]The right to vote is set in Article 43 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. All prisoners, regardless of their conviction or length of sentence have the right to vote at elections at all levels.. The Slovenian Penal Code has no provision for offences that would attract disenfranchisement. There are legal consequences related to some types of convictions where prisoners can be removed from public office and/or are banned from taking up such offices.&#xa0;&#xa0;There have been no recent challenges to the law.&#xa0; There is no realistic likelihood of any changes to this law.&#xa0;&#xa0;There is no public, political or media debate on this issue in Slovenia.&#xa0; Other justice issues (e.g. prison overcrowding) are the focus of discussion.&#xa0;

[[[Spain]]]All prisoners have been able to vote since 1995 with the introduction of a new Criminal Code which removed the punishment of disenfranchisement. Before this individual prisoners could be banned from doing so. (Any prisoners sentenced under the previous criminal code will still be subject to its rules).  There have been no recent changes to the policy and the issue is not subject of debate.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Sweden]]]In Sweden, all Swedish citizens, other EU citizens and citizens of Norway and Iceland who are 18 years or older (convicted and sentenced prisoners included) are entitled to vote in municipal general elections, if they are residents in the municipality. In addition, all foreign nationals who are 18 years or older and have been residents in Sweden for at least three years, are entitled to vote and stand for elections in municipal elections (at local and regional level). &#xa0;In general elections to the Riksdag - the Swedish Parliament - all Swedish citizens who are 18 years or older and who are residing in – or at some point in time previously have been residents in – Sweden are entitled to vote. In elections to the European Parliament, voting rights are afforded to all Swedish citizens that have voting rights in general elections to the Riksdag, as well as to other EU citizens according to directive 93/109/EC. &#xa0;There is no difference in treatment in law concerning prisoners' voting rights with regard to the sentence passed by a court. On the contrary, all prisoners have equal rights to vote, as long as they fulfil the general requirements that apply for such rights to be afforded (age and residency requirements). No changes have been made to the policy or law in recent years and as far as our contacts know, none are planned either. &#xa0;We have not noticed any political or media debate on the issue of prisoner voting rights.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]

[[[Switzerland]]]All prisoners have the right to vote. There have been no recent challenges to the legal framework by the Court or the domestic courts and there have been no recent changes to policy.&#xa0;

[[[Turkey]]]Certain categories of prisoners can vote: those with a sentence of less than one year, those on pre-trial detention, and those who have committed minor offences. &#xa0;Turkey is in the process of drawing up a new constitution. Within this forum, three of the 4 main political parties (including the ruling party) have recently opened the topic, saying that all prisoners ought to be able to vote. However the representatives from the far right nationalist party oppose, saying that&#xa0;for example, the imprisoned terrorist Abdullah Ocalan (leader of the PKK) ought not to be able to vote, and that there ought to be provisions to prevent him from voting.&#xa0;There has not been a firm decision on this in the constitution. For the new constitution, unanimity between all 4 parties is needed on all clauses.&#xa0;Not a major media issue so far, but may become so if the PKK/Ocalan link is introduced. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Ukraine]]]All convicted and sentenced prisoners have the right to vote in the presidential and parliamentary elections. &#xa0;They do not have the right to take part in local elections (in line with the 2010 amendments to the Law of Ukraine on Local Elections) – but this is not because of their sentence/conviction but due to the fact that during the period of their sentence/conviction they are not regarded as members of certain local communities (same restrictions for participation in local elections are also applicable to military servicemen, citizens who temporarily leave and work abroad, etc.) &#xa0;There&#xa0; have been no recent challenges to the legal framework for disenfranchisement before the European Court of Human Rights&#xa0;or domestic courts.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]June 2013UNCLASSIFIED 52&#xa0; Voting Rights of Convicted Prisoners Detained within the United Kingdom Second Stage Consultation. Consultation Paper CP6/ 09. Published 8 April 2009. As set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003: punishment of offenders; reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence; reform and rehabilitation of offenders; protection of the public; and making reparation by offenders to people affected by their offences http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{"dmdocnumber":["908352"],"itemid":["001-111044"]} Paragraph 106: “In the Court’s opinion the legal provisions in Italy defining the circumstances in which individuals may be deprived of the right to vote show the legislature’s concern to adjust the application of the measure to the particular circumstances of the case in hand, taking into account such factors as the gravity of the offence committed and the conduct of the offender. It is applied only in connection with certain offences against the State or the judicial system, or with offences which the courts consider to warrant a particularly harsh sentence, regard being had to the criteria listed in Articles 132 and 133 of the Criminal Code, including the offender’s personal situation, and also to the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The measure is not applied, therefore, to all individuals sentenced to a term of imprisonment but only to those sentenced to a prison term of three years or more.”  Applications for an absent vote (postal or proxy) can be made for an indefinite period, for a definite period or for a particular election. The application form for an absent vote is not prescribed but certain information must be provided. All registered electors have the option to vote by post, except in N.I., where certain criteria must be met. In the case of applications to vote by proxy, there are requirements to be met for all UK voters in terms of the reasons for the application and attestation, which depend on whether the application is for a single election or for a longer period. Recalls are&#xa0;offenders&#xa0;who have been released on licence but are then recalled to custody because they have breached their licence conditions. Data on prisoners in Scotland sentenced for common assault is not included in the ‘Violence against the person’ category due to differences in the definition of assault. Instead, these prisoners are included in the ‘Other offences’ category.  Only British citizens resident overseas can register to vote as Overseas electors, for a maximum of 15 years from the date they were last registered in the UK.
