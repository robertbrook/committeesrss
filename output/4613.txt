[[[About the LGA]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.&#xa0;We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.&#xa0;The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Evidence]]]&#xa0;The LGA’s understanding is that there is not a ‘rule’ as such in legislation or statutory guidance which states that children cannot or should not be placed more than 20 miles from home, although the Department for Education (DfE) would be best placed to confirm this.  &#xa0;However, councils are required to record information on the distance from home at which looked after children are placed and to report this to the DfE.  &#xa0;The distance is measured by reference to the definition included in ‘Department for Education (DfE) Statistics SSDA903, Return Guidance Notes Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England, 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013’, which states that:&#xa0;

[[[“2.2.1 Home Postcode ]]]The postcode of the address where the child was living when they first became looked after, if the child becomes looked after while in hospital after being born, use the mother’s home address.” &#xa0;This information is published annually by the DfE as ‘Children looked after by local authorities in England, including adoption’ and includes the number of children placed at more than 20 miles and at less than 20 miles. This publication also breaks the data down further according to whether placements are inside or outside the authority’s boundary.  &#xa0;This information is also required by Ofsted for individual children in respect of case sampling and case tracking as part of the single inspection framework for children in need of help and protection, children looked after and care leavers.  Therefore, although it may not be in legislation, the fact that this information is part of mandatory reporting requirements to central government and is a consideration in inspections will act as a driver of behaviour and may account for the confusion that appears to exist about whether or not there is a ‘rule’.&#xa0;In any case councils, as corporate parents, will want to ensure the best placement for each looked after child.  Indeed, they are required by the Children Act 1989 to place a child in the most appropriate placement and, so far as is reasonably practicable, the placement should allow the child to live near their home. &#xa0;It is important to recognise that in some cases it will be in the child’s best interests for them to be placed at a distance from their home.  It may be for their own safety, for example in cases of exploitation or gang involvement.  Children’s needs may also require specialist care which is not available locally.  It is also important to recognise the differing geography of local authorities when discussing out of area placements; a child placed in a neighbouring authority could, for example, be closer to home than a child placed within the boundaries of a large shire county.  &#xa0;The clustering of residential children’s homes in certain geographical areas contributes to the number of out of authority placements made. Developing councils’ market shaping role is one of the reasons the LGA commissioned the OPM action research, referred to in written evidence submitted to the Committee in September, into more effective strategic commissioning of residential children’s homes.  &#xa0;The Government has consulted on introducing a requirement that Directors of Children’s Services must ‘sign off’ decisions to place children out of area and at distance.  While we understand and appreciate the intention of this proposal, it is important that it does not create unnecessary bureaucracy.  Also, as noted in our previous written evidence to the Committee, regulation can be helpful, but can only achieve so much.  It is also important to consider the broader issues presented by the market for residential children’s homes and, in particular, the imbalance of provision across the country which contributes to children being placed out of area. &#xa0;Introducing a more stringent ‘rule’ that councils could not place children more than an arbitrary distance away would be unworkable and could potentially act against the best interests of children for the reasons set out above.  1&#xa0; http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/g/ssda903guidancenotes201213v12.pdf&#xa0; http://www.local.gov.uk/safeguarding-children/-/journal_content/56/10180/4086610/ARTICLE&#xa0;December 2013
