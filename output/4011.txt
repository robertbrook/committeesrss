[[[Future of the BBC]]]&#xa0;The BBC should be true to its origins and exist to inform, educate and entertain. A series of platforms for celebrating life through world class content, from investigative, impartial journalism, to the best drama arts and sports coverage in the world. &#xa0;The BBC should have the capacity to reach out to everyone across the UK and the wider world and be a source of trust and excellence. There have been a number of high profile major issues which everyone is aware of and which have impacted on public confidence and reputation of the BBC. The organisation must learn from this and attempt to regain confidence and the worldwide respect that it has enjoyed for decades. There have been many successes within the charter period also and the world has changed significantly within the period. The BBC still has a wealth of creative talent in terms of artistry and innovation but other countries are catching up.Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?&#xa0;There is still much to be done in terms of truly addressing equality issues within the BBC and within the BBC’s content. There needs to be much more done to address the diversity agenda across the board; Race, Colour, Gender, Age etc The above should be reflected more within the public purposes of the charter.The relocation of a large part of the BBC to the North of England is having a positive effect on Film &amp; TV production which I witness first hand within my work and we must build on this momentum. The North has always produced good content but there feels to be a renewed vigor and more opportunities for people with the right skills. There is still much work to do in ensuring that future generations are equipped with the right skills and motivated and determined in order to succeed in the sector. There is also more to do in ensuring that the regions are represented. The Big Screen Network (Live Sites) established mainly as part of 2012. One in every nation and region were abandoned by the BBC and LOCOG. This was a missed opportunity and could have been a lasting legacy from the London Olympics. It was not managed very well throughout and lessons should be taken from this. Many local authorities across the UK feel very let down by the way this was handled. I say this from a position of authority as someone who has been involved in the Big Screen project since 2005.There are increased opportunities for more hyper-local content across some of the platforms on the BBC. Links to community websites, events etc. Encouraging more active citizenship through the use of technology.The commitment that 50% of the network TV programming spend will be outside of London is welcomedLarge scale live events have had a really positive impact in recent years, most notably the Manchester Passion, Frankenstein’s Wedding and Bollywood Carmen Live and have provided brilliant opportunities for young people entering the industry to get involved as well as stimulating the local economy (hotels, catering, logistics etc). More should be done to encourage these types of events to celebrate the true diverse of the UK. The BBC should be a beacon of excellence from the local to the regional, national and truly international. An institution that is the envy of the world. That gives a voice to the unknown as well as the super stars. It should be about discovering and developing new talent and allowing that talent to grow alongside more established talent. The BBC’s output continues to diversify but perhaps not fast enough. There needs to be an opportunity for more risk taking, more ambitious projects. Encouraging quality but on a big picture scale. At the same time not to judge everything on ratings. Popular, doesn’t necessarily mean quality or meaningful to people (see You Tube). There should be a balance. But new organisations should continue to be encouraged. We need to continue to develop skills and provide opportunities. The BBC has to be at the driving edge of technology innovation and should continue to actively encourage developments in this field as a strength for the UK. To this end, more people should be encouraged to tell their stories using a range of methods and technologies from the humble paper and pen to interactive gaming. Give us a poem on National Poetry Day.I feel that there is still a need for a license fee but that where commercial opportunities exist (BBC Worldwide / BBC Sports etc) they should be exploited fullyDoes this not already happen to a degree with Chanel 4? Perhaps there could be a little more competition introduced between public service providers. Due to the nature of my job I travel a lot and have contacts in over 40 cities around the world though the UNESCO Creative Cities Network. The BBC is still the ultimate name in terms of broadcasting in the view of many of these other cities/ countries. I am still surprised that many of the countries involved don’t have a national broadcaster or a national lottery that subsidises the arts.The BBC Trust model works but perhaps the trust could have more visibility and spend a little more time getting across the UK and advocating on behalf of the sector.The only thing that is constant throughout everything is change. The BBC has shown that it can be pioneering and adaptable but an organisation that size needs a sense of stability and this requires long term planning. A ten year agreement is reasonable as long as there are measures in place to ensure adaptability and delivery. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
