"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n \nthe Highways Agency Trade Union Side\n (SRN 012)\n \nThis submission is made by the Highways Agency \nTrade Union Side (HATUS).  The HATUS is made up of the Public and Commercial \nServices Union (\nPCS\n) and Prospect Union. The two unions represent\n staff at all grades below the Senior Civil Service in the Highways Agency including members in the Traffic Officer Service. \nIn the notice for the inquiry the Committee asked \nHow should the \nHighways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”?\n;\n and  \nHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environ\nment? \n In this submission we set out our views on those two points.\nSummary\n&#xa0;\nThe \nHATUS\n are opposed to the intention set out in \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n to change the status of the Agency from an Executive Agency to an as yet undefined publicly-owned com\npany \n(\nPubCo\n). \n&#xa0;\nWe do not believe that a change in status is required \nto improve the efficiency of the Agency \nand that \nPubCo\n is the final staging post to privatisation of the strategic road network in \nEngland\n. \n&#xa0;\nPrivatisation will inevitably lead to tolling of \nmajor routes\n which will have a detrimental impact on the environment, road safety and local economies.\nHow should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? 1.\n              \nIn the foreword to \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n, the Secretary of\n State maintains that reform of the Agency is required and that “more certainty, clearer instructions and less political interference will mean greater efficiency, better service to motorists and the environment.”  \n2.\n              \nTo substantiate this, t\nhere is much r\neliance on the fact that the current Non-Executive Chairman of the Agency, Alan Cook, in his \nindependent\n 2011 report “A Fresh Start for the Strategic Road Network” recommended a change in status for the Highways Agency\n. However\n,\n any deci\nsion on this was \npost\nponed to allow time for a feasibility study announced by the Prime Minister in late 2011 to look at alternative ownership and financing options. This was made clear in the Government’s response to the Cook report published\n in May 2012\n. The then Secreta\nry of State said “I do not propose to make any decisions on the need to change the Agency's status ahead of the feasibility study concluding\n”\n.\n3.\n              \nThe outcome of this feasibility study has not been published. Instead \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n contains \nthe \nunsubsta\nntiated claim\n that a change in status \nof the Highways Agency \nis \nthe only way to \ndeal with a number of barriers to efficiency as summarised in Chapter 4 figure 4.1\n of the document\n.\n4.\n              \nWe disagree that a change in status of the Agency as suggested is the ans\nwer. We believe that greater efficiencies can be delivered through full implementation of the recommendations first made in “Better Government Services – Executive Agencies in the 21\nst\n Century” published by HM Treasury in 2002. That was “to ensure agencies\n have three-year funding agreements and full end year flexibility” over this funding period.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nGreater \nautonomy from the central department was the reason why the Agency was \nfirst \ncreated in 1994. \nIt was \nformed as part of the government’s “Next Steps” \nprogramme that began in 1988. The stated aim of that programme was to ensure that executive functions of government should be carried out as far as possible by units clearly designated within departments. A key element was to use private sector and more co\nmmercial approaches to deliver public services. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nCommon features of Next Steps agencies were:\n&#xa0;\n●\nClearly defined tasks aims and objectives;\n●\nKey performance targets;\n●\nA chief executive; and \n●\nAn emphasis on customer service.\n&#xa0;\nThese are the same \nobjectives set out in \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nThe original framework document \n(published 1 April 1994) \nstipulated that the Agency would be responsible for managing and maintaining the trunk road and motorway network as well as managing and delivering agree\nd programmes of new and improved schemes aimed at removing bottlenecks. That same framework concluded that ministers would remain responsible for overall policy on trunk roads in \nEngland\n and by extension the size and shape of work \nprogrammes set for the Ag\nency. \n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nThe Highways Agency was subject to a \n“Next Steps” \nreview in 1999. It concluded that the Agency had made considerable progress in improving efficiency over the first five years of its existence, had successfully switched focus to become a network\n operator in line with the then Government policy set out in the White Paper\n&#xa0;\n “\nA New Deal for Trunk Roads in England” published in July 1998, and had introduced innovative cost saving measures such as value engineering. \n&#xa0;\n9.\n              \nThe review concluded that\n&#xa0;\n grea\nter efficiencies might be achieved if there was greater clarity in the respective roles of the Agency and the central department; if better use was made of external Board members; and if a measure of performance was introduced that did not rely solely on q\nuantified targets for maintenance and construction. The suggestion was also made that a service level agreement for the road network with some form of independent roads’ inspector to monitor it could usefully be established\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10.\n              \nA wider government revie\nw of all executive agencies undertaken in 2002 reached similar conclusions – that the Agency was efficient but that the working relationship between the Agency and the department and the lack of definition of roles and accountability was a barrier to great\ner efficiency. This same issue was identified by the Nichols report of 2007 (Review of Highways Agency’s Major Roads Programme) which found \n&#xa0;\n“There is some Confusion regarding accountabilities, roles and responsibilities between the Department for Transpo\nrt (\nDfT\n), the Highways Agency (HA) and the regional bodies; and responsibilities for the TPI (\nTargeted Programme of Improvements) \nare split within both \nDfT\n and HA. HA is stated to be responsible for delivery but, because of increasing costs, \nDfT\n staff incr\neasingly intervene. Given the size of the forward investment programme, these arrangements must urgently be clarified and enhanced. …….with the \nDfT\n taking on a stronger strategy and sponsor role, and HA becoming more clearly responsible for delivery.”\n&#xa0;\n11.\n              \nSo there is long standing common consensus that greater efficiency could be achieved if the Agency had more freedom than it currently enjoys\n, and if there was \ngreater surety of funding\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n12.\n              \nAll of this can be achieved without changing the status of the \nAgency. \nAs we now have fixed parliaments there is no reason why a five year funding agreement could not be put in place from 2015. We recognise that such surety of funding will mean that the department will have less flexibility to meet its departmental ex\npenditure limit, but if there is robust governance of budgets across the department this should not present an insurmountable problem.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14.\n              \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n makes two new claims for inefficiency that have not previously been identified. These are that government regulations around \nprocurement and contract management make the Agency less efficient and that \ncivil service pay restraint makes it difficult to attract suitable staff.\n&#xa0;\n15.\n              \nIt is not clear how changing status would overcome either of these barriers. As a public company the Agency would still be bound by public procurement rules and its contract management arrangements would still be subject to scrutiny by the National Audit O\nffice, Public Accounts Committee and the Transport \nSelect\n Committee. The current contract arrangements \nthat the Agency follows \nwere largely driven by recommendations made by all of these bodies.\n16.\n              \nSimilarly, all public sector pay is subject to restraint \nand we doubt that an exception would be m\nade for the Agency. No evidence is provided to substantiate the claim that the Agency finds it hard to compete for staff on the international labour market. Has it tried? We do agree that pay constraints are an issu\ne and our concerns previously provided to the Select Committee to its inquiry on the work of the Highways Agency \nremain \n(Eighth Report of Session 2002-03 HC453)\n.\n Low pay does impact adversely on morale, and anecdotal evidence from our members is that \nmany \nexperienced staff \nare\n contemplating early retirement as a result.\n \n17.\n              \nHATUS\n believe that the real intention behind changing the status of the Agency is to make it easier to privatise it in future. Alan Cook confirmed this in a recent interview with a nati\nonal newspaper.\n \n&#xa0;\n18.\n              \nPrivatisation will only be possible if a revenue stream can be created. The most obvious means to achieve this is to levy tolls. The Department for Transport announced a pilot project on 2 October 2013 to \nplace a network of sensors al\nong \na 50-mile stretch of the A14 \nto \ncreat\ne\n a smart road \nthat can\n monitor traffic by sending signals to and from mobile phones in moving vehicles.\n As reported in the Guardian newspaper this is seen as \na first step in building the infrastructure for charging\n motorists to use busy roads.\n \n&#xa0;\n19.\n              \nTolls are not \npopular in the \nUK\n and all the evidence is that they do not work. Part of the problem is the availability of diversionary routes. The road network in \nEngland\n is well connected and built to a high density. A \nreport issued by consultants Atkins in November 2012 found that tolls on the A14 could result in up to 35 per cent of traffic using the existing road being diverted onto other local roads. Most traffic congestion occurs on local roads rather than the strat\negic network so this sort of shift will see severe environmental impacts.\n&#xa0;\n 20.\n              \nThe one major toll road already built through private investment – the M6 toll in the \nWest Midlands\n opened in 2003 has proved a disaster both as an investment and as a relief r\noad (\nits\n original purpose). As well as losing money the scheme did not avoid the need for further public investment \nbecause traffic continued to use the alternative M6 which has recently been improved by the Agency in an attempt to alleviate congestion.\n&#xa0;\n2\n1.\n              \nMotorists are a highly vocal campaign constituency and are unlikely to accept widespread tolling of existing routes. When proposals for road pricing were put forward in 2007, over 1.8 million people signed a petition against the proposal. This remains a\n record for an on-line petition. In a Daily Telegraph poll taken in 2012 over 80% of participants rejected the question “can privatised roads get \nBritain\n moving again”\n&#xa0;\n22. The likelihood is that any form of direct charging for access to the strategic road\n network will result in diversion of traffic to other “free” routes. This will be bad for safety, bad for the environment and bad for local economies.\nHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?23.\n              \nThe language used throughout \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n is disappointing. The environment seems very much an afterthought.  The focus \nis \non providing more road space, quicker and cheaper\n, turning the clock back to the late 1980s/early 1990s when predict and provide were the watchwords. \nThere is no recognition of the \n1994 \nSACTRA report\n into induced traffic\n,\n \nthe threat posed by climate change, or the impact of \ntraffic-\ngenerated \npoor air qua\nlity.\n24.\n              \nThere seems to be an acceptance \nby the department \nthat traffic volumes will grow at least in line with predictions\n;\n and that the challenge is to \nprovide a strategic road network to cater for \nthis\n. As long ago as 1997 the Agency recognised that th\nis was not sustainable. We are therefore disappointed that there is no mention in \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n of modal shift or reducing car dependency.\n \n&#xa0;\n25. Climate change, if unchecked, will have a devastating effect on our environment and hence economy. \nIn our \nopinion the major task of the department is to fundamentally change our transport systems; to move them from being run on fossil fuels to ones running on sustainable, clean energy; for public transport to be really accessible to all the public, not only in\n terms of coverage and capacity but in terms of price; public transport must be cheap enough for all to use. If these things are done then it will boost the \nUK\n's long-term economic growth. \n \n&#xa0;\n26. The Strategic road network is vitally important to the econo\nmy and the way that it is managed can\n,\n and should\n,\n have a major impact on the \nUK\n meeting the targets set out in the Climate Change Act. Why for example is there no mention of \ntraffic \nspeed in \n“\nAction for Roads\n”\n? Managed motorways could be used to manage sp\need to both reduce fuel consumption and noxious emissions.\n \n&#xa0;\n27. It remains the case that more deaths are caused by transport-related air pollution than by \nroad traffic accidents. As the \nHouse of Commons\n \nEnvironmental Audit\n \nCommittee\n report on Air quality published in March 2010 stated in the summary:\n&#xa0;\n“\nPoor air quality reduces the life expectancy of everyone in the \nUK\n by an average of seven to eight months and up to 50,000 people a year may die prematurely because of it.\n”\n \n……. \n“\nTransp\nort causes the most exposure to harmful air pollutants, and air quality targets will not be met without a significant shift in transport policy.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\nRoads policy should not therefore be treated in isolation from policies on demand management, land-use plann\ning, public transport and future technologies. \nAny policy which diverts traffic from the strategic road network onto the local road network \nshould not be contemplated.\n Transforming the Highways Agency into a \nPubCo\n is such a policy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \n6\n of \n6\n"
