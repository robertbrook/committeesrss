"&#xa0;\nCinema Exhibitors’ Association – Written evidenceDDB0039&#xa0;&#xa0;PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON THE DEREGULATION BILLLICENSING OF COMMUNITY FILM EXHIBITION &#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.              Summary&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe Cinema Exhibitors’ Association \n(CEA) \nrepresents the interests of well over 90 per cent of UK \ncinema operators by number and market share.\n \n Our membership includes single sc\nreen/owner-\nmanaged sites as well as the largest circuit and multiplex operators.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe CEA welcomes the Government’s commitment to deregulate\n in\n area\ns of legislation where \nev\nidence \nexists \nthat current regulation is unnecessary o\nr ineffective. \n However, i\nn this \nsubmission\n, which also formed its response to the DCMS consultation, \nthe CEA argues that\n:\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nIn addition, the deregulation proposal\n carries significant risks, including:\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nAlthough it can be argued that some CEA members (who operate not-for-profit business models and/or who are firmly rooted in local community venues) may benefit from slightly reduced \nlicensing costs, even those members have made plain to CEA that they do not support this deregulation proposal.  Licensing laws protect the quality of the exhibition of a film and service to customers and, having consulted with our members, there is a unit\ned view from both larger cinema circuits and smaller independent operators that the current process is logical and serves its purpose well.  The CEA and its members believe that, amongst other disbenefits, deregulation of certain venues could potentially d\nevalue the cinema business and be damaging to the industry as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nThe overall effect of th\ne DCMS\n proposal would be to reduce, not enhance, the quality of film exhibition services to the public. \nThe CEA therefore has urged the Government not to proceed with their proposal and to pursue Option 1 of their consultation document.&#xa0;\n2.              Comments on the Options as laid out in the DCMS Consultation on Community Film Exhibition.&#xa0;2.1\n              \nThe Impact Assessment (IA) suggests that the policy objectives and \nintended effects of this\n proposal are as follows\n:\n&#xa0;\n“\n1.   Remove unnecessary costs and burdens from suitable community film exhibitions\n 2.   Help grow activities that encourage positive social outcomes\n 3.   Ensure suitable child protection arrangements\n”\n&#xa0;\nIt is suggested that these “\nwill reduce costs to civil society organisations and stimulate supply by removing a barrier to the exhibition of film\n”.\n  \nHowever, neither the \nIA nor the \nconsultation \ndocument offer\n evidential support for these claims.\n  Without s\nuch evidence, Option 1 is the only sensible course of action.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n \nNo demand for deregulation has been demonstrated\n&#xa0;\n2.2.1\n              \nThe IA goes through tortuous logic to estimate the possible number of community venues\n,\n using a variety of survey sources and unexpla\nined assumptions.  At no point, however, does the IA – or the consultation document – give hard evidence that there is an unmet demand.  There is nothing other than assumption that the barrier to entry that the Government seeks to remove actually exists.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.2\n              \nThe Minister’s foreword to the consultation document says, “\nwe’ve\n found many local screening and film clubs stop before they start\n”.  No examples are given in the body of the document.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.3\n              \nNo relevant data have been offered on the effect of Tempor\nary Event Notices (TENs) – which are a deregulatory target of this proposal.  Rather, the IA states that such a “\nlack of data makes it difficult to assess the impact of policy measures on TEN licensing\n” (IA, para 6.9)\n&#xa0;\n2.2.4\n              \nIt cannot be correct – and is a\n negation of evidence-based policy making – to pursue any other course of action that Option 1.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n \nNo \nadditional and distinct \nsocial benefit value has been quantified\n&#xa0;\n2.3.1\n              \nNo evidence has been offered that community film exhibition delivers the “\npositive social outcomes\n” claimed by the impact assessment.  In any case, the IA itself chooses not to make any claims for the value of \nadditional or distinct \nsocial benefits and concedes that there “\nis little research on these wellbeing effects\n” (IA, para\ns 6.19, 6.20).\n&#xa0;\n2.\n4\n \nEconomic and social disbenefits have been ignored\n&#xa0;\n2.4.1\n              \nBoth t\nhe consultation document and the IA assert without evidence that the proposal will not affect the viability or distribution of commercial cinema operators, stating “\nrisks as\nsociated with an increased number of film exhibitions do not materialise\n.” (IA, key assumptions, \npage 2)  Rather, conveniently, the IA suggests that “\nany costs arising from substitution between not-for-profit and commercial cinema would be indirect and out\n of scope\n”. (IA, para 9.2)\n&#xa0;\n2.4.2\n              \nAdditionally, since licensing authorities do not receive fees from community-based venues at present, any deregulation increases costs to local authorities, since they will be responsible for the administrative decision-ma\nking incumbent in \ndetermining whether an organisation fitted within the \n‘\ncommunity premises\n’\n definition\n.\n  \nArguably this task is more subjective and so could be more labour-intensive and time-consuming than the current established process of granting a \npremises licence.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.3\n              \nIt is, in our view, inevitable that relaxations of the licensing regimes such as those proposed will increase the risks of film piracy. It is highly improbable\n that a community venue \nwill \nhave the expertise or \nresources to \nenforce\n \nthe type of strong controls on \nillegal recording of films adopted by all \ncommercial \noperators, which has seen the UK become a beacon \nof good practice in this regard\n. This is quite aside from the likelihood that such a relaxation would offer implicit encour\nagement to other venues such as pubs and clubs to show films, increasing the piracy risk.  \n&#xa0;\n2.4.4\n              \nFilm piracy is a real and continuous challenge for the film industry and it is a stated aim of Government - and in particular DCMS and BIS - to tackle such o\nffences. This deregulation proposal is inconsistent with that aim.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.5\n              \nAs stated elsewhere in this response, t\nhe benefit of a \nstrict \nlicen\nsing regime for filmed entertainment is tha\nt each venue would be clearly\n registered and therefore on the radar of e\nnforcement authorities such as FACT\n,\n who\nse \nrole it is to support cinema venues in the fight against piracy\n, a problem which latest estimates indicate \nannually \ncost\ns\n the industry \nat least \n£220 million per year in lost box office alone.  \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n \nChild \nprotection measures remain opaque\n&#xa0;\n2.5.1\n              \nSince proposals in this area were first raised,\n the\n CEA has been concerned to ensure that the current, effective, controls on admission of children to film exhibitions remain in place.  This proposal does not delive\nr assurance.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.2\n              \nThe IA asserts that beneficiaries of the proposal “\nare likely to have a formal relationship with some form of local council and are likely to be governed by a formal organising committee\n”. (IA, para 6.16)  However, a deregulated environ\nment would remove strong local authority oversight and visibility of ‘community groups’ and it cannot be realistic that all organisations wishing to take advantage\n of the deregulation will be \ntraditionally-constituted bodies.  Indeed, \nad hoc\n groups appear \nmore likely to be created, perhaps to show material without certi\nfication from dubious sources.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.3\n              \nThe consultation document notes that age classification must be obtained for “\nevery film that is intended for national distribution in the UK\n”\n \n(Consultat\nion, para 12)\n.\n \nIt is easy to envisage small populations with religious, ethnic or other special interests who might wish to exhibit films outwith this definition\n. I\nn\n the most extreme cases, this may pose a risk to public safety and \nwould not, we assume, be\n the kind of activity which Government would wish to see fly beneath\n relevant\n authorities\n’\n radars\n.\n \nThe consultation document recognises that the proposal would lead to “\nless direct licensing authority control over the operation of film content in the \nvenues in question\n” (Consultation, para 34)\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.4\n              \nWhilst the consultation document suggests that “\nfilms that do not have such\n [a formal age] \nclassification would not be permitted for exhibition\n” (Consultation, para 44), the ‘education, instruction, infor\nmation’ exemptions of Part 2, Sch 1 of the 2003 Act would still offer comfort to unlicensed film exhibitors if this proposal were to be enacted.\n&#xa0;\n3.              Further concerns about Option 2&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe CEA do\nes\n not believe the current structure of Option 2 will me\net\n the DCMS’ desired objectives. \nRather, deregulation as reflected in the proposal would create new loopholes in strong oversight of film exhibition and may add perverse incentives to avoid such oversight.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe \nCEA recognises that the\n upper audience limi\nt of 500 is intended to reflect parity with deregulation of theatrical and dance venues\n.  However, this limit is far too high when considered in the context of film exhibition\n.\n \n \nOn this basis, a significant \nmajority of independent \ncinema theatres \nwould fal\nl within that capacity\n and (as will be demonstrated) would also qualify under other requirements for this dispensation\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nParagraph \n34\n \nof the Government consultation document \nwould introduce a significant loophole when it comes to the sensible regulatio\nn of premises\n. \n The consultation document and the draft clauses are not \nclear \non \nwhether \npremises would need to self-\ndeclare \nas \na community venue\n to the \nl\nicensing \na\nuthority\n.  If they must\n \ndo \nso\n, enforcement authorities will then have to assess each declara\ntion to determine if \nthey meet \nthat\n definition\n.  If they do not, but have declared a desire to exhibit film, would they then be \nsubject to\n the \nnormal \nlicensing provisions\n?  If they do not self-declare and begin to exhibit films, it is also unclear whether \nthey are in contravention of any law\n.\n  To call\n the consequent position one which involves\n “\nless direct licensing authority control over the operation of film content\n” is a considerable understatement.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nWithout \nsuch \nrobust \nprocess in place\n,\n many venues could fall beneath the radar, \nself\n-\ndefining \nthemselves\n as operating within\n a community venue\n without any further scrutiny\n.\n \n We would be concerned that this poses \na risk to public safety if authorities \nwere\n unaware of \nactivities within venues o\npening their doors to the public\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nPubs and clubs, for example, could claim community venue status to enhance their customer footfall through the exhibition of film.  A village publican is unlikely to agree that his/her venue is not a community resourc\ne. The \n“not-for-profit” restrictions outlined in the consultation document would, we submit, be almost impossible to determine in this and similar cases – such as film exhibition within local bingo venues, for example.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nOption 2 therefore deregulates t\noo far. It creates a real and considerable risk of venues open to \nthe public \nwithout \nreadily \nenforceable \nlegislative control not only over film content, but \nalso \non health and safety, environmental and hazard procedures, fire safety and the many other \npublic protections\n which\n commercial film exhibitors provide and which film-going audiences \nrightly \nexpect.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nMoreover, even\n with strict sanctions in place for those not following age classification guidelines, authorities would not be aware of venues ex\nhibiting films and so unable to track and \ntackle any\n malpractice. \n This is not, as the Minister’s foreword suggests, “\na sensible way forward\n” consistent with strong child protection and community benefit.\n&#xa0;\n4.              Variations on Option 2&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe \nCEA does not be\nlieve that Option 2 should be pursued.  If the Government wishes to explore deregulation of community-based film exhibition further, we would be happy to contribute.  However, it should not be the case that the sector must work to the arbitrary timetable o\nf the current draft Deregulation Bill.  It is more important to reach safe and robust decisions than to reach rapid ones.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nIn this context, \nthe \nCEA wishes to outline areas where options for change may be considered\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.              Conclusions&#xa0;5.1\n              \nThe CEA does not believe there is sufficient evidence to justify the need \nfor deregulation of premises l\nicenses for community premises.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nOption 2 potentially creates a series of loopholes.  It fosters a lack of proper oversight and assurance of safety and child protection which audiences of all types have come to expect and \ndemand.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nNew costs and burdens on the licensing regime for venues exhibiting films could adversely affect the time spent by licensing authorities on managing queries and categorising venues.  In the view of the CEA and its members, large and small, \nthis risks public safety, especially if there is no means of tracking venues who consider themselves community premises.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nLack of clarity over\n the\n definition of community venue status in particular opens loopholes which give implicit encouragement to p\nrofit-making venues to flout copyright and content controls.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nWe do not oppose proportionate, thoughtful and well-defined deregulation to enable community film exhibition to flourish.  However, \nfor\n the reasons stated in this response, we strongly beli\neve that the \nproposal \nput forward \ndoes not meet these criteria.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
