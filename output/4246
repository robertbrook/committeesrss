[normal]Abstract
[normal]Food security and what it means needs to be taken in the context of the increasing global trade in food and farm products and t
[normal]he challenges 
[normal] 
[normal]facing the agricultural industry 
[normal]to meet projected global demand.  The default position -  i.e. that this needs to be met with further food production, and by implication, greater intensification of food animal production
[normal] 
[normal] - needs to be reconsidered.  Achieving a healthier diet, cutting down on food waste and assessing what the UK or Europe can or cannot produce (given increasing global trade and reducing subsidies) all 
[normal]need to be 
[normal]addressed first.   The EU’s progress in securing animal w
[normal]elfare improvements in  sectors such as pigs, chickens and laying hens
[normal] in the last seven years must not be undermined
[normal].  However
[normal],
[normal] these improvements could be contrary to meeting present forecasted global demand for meat and could put the EU at a disadvantage to products being more intensively 
[normal]produced
[normal] in other countries.  Further work is required in this area.  
[normal]Climate change is another parameter to be included before any framework can be developed on food security.  Progress on agreeing what s
[normal]cientific data 
[normal]indicates and getting political agreement on what is required from the British livestock industry 
[normal]to m
[normal]eet UK greenhouse gas reductions has been 
[normal]patchy.
