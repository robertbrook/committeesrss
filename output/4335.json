"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by International Service&#xa0;Executive Summary and recommendations&#xa0;\nInternational Service \n \nInternational Service is a development organisation that has been changing lives for the better for more than 60 years by empowering some of the \nworld’s poorest and most marginalised people.\nOur international programmes are in West Africa, Latin America and the occupied Palestinian territory where social and economic inclusion for all people is central to our work.\nInternational Service’s developme\nnt\n \nworkers support local project partners\n \nwith specialist skills and knowledge so\n \nthat they and their organisations grow\n \nin effectiveness and impact.\nOur work is also about influencing the development and delivery\n \nof human rights policies in the countries \nwhere we operate on\n \nbehalf of vulnerable and excluded groups of people.\nInternational Service is currently part of the consortium of agencies delivering the International Citizenship\n Service (ICS) \nfunded through DFID.\nOur inclusion programme has a focus on\n disability and we also work with disability projects as part of our work within the ICS programme. \nFurther information on International Service and our work can be found at \nwww.internationalservice.org.\nuk\n \nReasons for submissionWe are submitting evidence to this enquiry as we firmly believe that disability is still marginalised in international development. The omission of disability in the Millennium Development Goals \nled to disability being left ou\nt of many development programmes.  A targeted approach is needed to redress the existing imbalance and the influence and action of DFID is vital in taking forward this agenda.\n \nIdentified issues and proposed responsesOver 15% of the world\n’\ns population \nhave a disability. Disability is closely linked to poverty\n,\n and in developing countries this group is known to be one of the most marginalised and vulnerable in society.\nIt is commonly accepted that disabled people have lower employment rates and lower edu\ncational attainment (WHO) – and in developing countries access to employment and education is significantly reduced\n or non \n-\nexistent\n.  There is also a financial loss for governments through lost productivity, and lost taxes through non or low employment of\n disabled people, alongside high health and social care costs. So inclusion makes sense economically and in terms of reducing poverty – a central aim of DFID policy.\nDisability has been \nfurther \nmarginalised through its omission from the Millennium Developm\nent Goals (MDGs)\n and\n as a result is\n frequently side-lined within mainstream development work. DFID has a clear role to play in influencing the formation of whatever replaces the MDGs in 2015 and ensuring that disability is firmly placed within the new fram\nework.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD)\n should underpin any disability development work – specifically the implementation of articles 4,\n \n9,\n \n24,\n \n27 and 29\n – awareness raising, accessibility, education, work and \nemployment, and participation in political and public life\n.\n The CRDP \nprovides a clear international framework which 158 out of 193 UN member states have signed up to. Therefore, the CRPD provides a strong \nand commonly accepted \nplatform on which to build \nfuture development wor\nk and measure achievement and impact.\nThe UK has in the past been a leader in disability development and in promoting inclusion and \nthe \nsocial model of disability. We still have much to share with other countries\n and specifically with\n NGOs and communities in developing cou\nntries through empowerment, cap\nacity building and advocacy. The development of a separate disability strategy by DFID \nwould reinforce their commitment to the issue following \nthe recent announcement that all\n new DFID-f\nunded schools will be made accessible to \ndisabled children. A focused strategy would demonstrate that DFID give equal importance to disability as they do to other development areas and recognise the need to address some of the unique challenges across the \ndisability sector in international development. \nDisability should still remain part of DFIDs sector programmes, for example in education, health\n, livelihoods\n \netc., \n but a stand-alone disability strategy and \nprogramme of \nfocused development work would rais\ne the profile and importance \nof this work and make a greater, more sustainable \nimpact.\n Active engagement of disabled people – including children and young adults is vital in developing any strategy\n and i\nn any development work overseas including in the plan\nning, management and monitoring of DFID programmes.\n This could be facilitated by development organisations already working with disabled peoples\n’\n organisations\n both in the UK and\n in developing countries.\nData and statistics on disability are weak, and ofte\nn inaccurate or incomplete in most developing countries\n,\n making it difficult to benchmark activity against need. Any influence or contribution DFID could make to strengthen this area would be valuable in enabling accurate identification and meeting of need\n.\n ConclusionInvestment in d\nisability\n with\nin \ninternational \ndevelopment remains marginalised. It is important that DFID sets a strong example in promoting the need to address disability not just as part of its sector \nprogrammes\n but in its own right. A stra\ntegic framework developed with the full engagement of disabled people\n,\n and working alongside international development agencies with a disability focus would be the first step to achieving this. \nInvestment in supporting research, data collection, capacity \nbuilding and advocacy would underpin the development of services and opportunities for disabled people in developing countries\n,\n empowering and equipping them to make a valid, economically and socially productive, contribution to society.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
