[[[&#xa0;]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I cycle regularly and I am a volunteer Sustrans Ranger.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I walk regularly in the Peak District, and have often had my walk disturbed by all-terrain vehicles of various sorts; 4-wheel drive cars, trail bikes, quad bikes.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The worst aspect of all-terrain vehicles is the way they spoil the surface of the path badly making walking and cycling very difficult if not impossible in some parts of the Peak District.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Even where there are barriers to prevent entry to paths by off-roading vehicles these can often be got round – trail bikes and quad bikes can quite easily go through the normal barriers for cyclists; on Sunday 25th August 2013 while carrying out our regular Sustrans route litter-pick and general check, 2 quads and a trail bike roared through Beeley Woods between Claywheels Lane and Oughtibridge in Sheffield so we reported this on 101 (incident number 511).e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I would therefore request that you consider: &#xa0;&#xa0;2 September 2013&#xa0;
