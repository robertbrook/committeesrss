[normal]Written evidence from Royal College of Nursing (PHE001[bold]2[bold])[bold]1.0 [bold]              [bold]Introduction[bold]1.1 
[normal]              
[normal]With a membership of more than 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and nurse cadets, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world. RCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promotes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the UK Governments, the UK Parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.
[normal]1.2 
[normal]              
[normal]The RCN welcomes this opportunity to make a submission to the Health Select Committee in advance of Public Health England’s (PHE) annual accountability hearing on Tuesday 19 November.

[normal]2.0[bold]              [bold]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0[bold]              [bold]Nursing in Public Health[bold]3.1 
[normal]              
[normal]Nursing staff carry out public health interventions in nearly every context and at every level of health care provision, including public health services and preventing ill health. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]              
[normal]Nurses also play a pivotal role at all levels of health care commissioning. It is, therefore, essential that nursing expertise is both recognised and utilised at all, including the most senior, levels of public health service planning and delivery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]              
[normal]The RCN has previously highlighted the importance of designated nursing posts at PHE. We were therefore
[normal] pleased to see the appointment of Deputy Director of Nursing Joanne 
[normal]Bosanquet
[normal] in August 2013, which shows recognition from the Chief Executive of PHE of the important role of nursing in public health.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 
[normal]              
[normal]There is also a strong case for including professionals with a nursing background in the appointment criteria for Directors of Public Health in local authorities. We were, therefore, disappointed to find only minimal reference to nurses or nursing in PHE’s recently published guidance on appointing Directors of Public Health.  Nurses as well as medical professionals have a wealth of skills and experience to bring to this role and their potential contribution should not be overlooked.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0[bold]              [bold]The role of Public Health England [bold]4.1 
[normal]              
[normal]PHE has been operating for just over seven months so it may be too early to make a precise or fair assessment of how successfully it is carrying out its functions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]The RCN supports localised public health planning and supports local authorities to have the necessary autonomy to deliver this. 
[normal]We also agree in principle with the responsibilities assigned to local authorities for health improvement. In order for this to best serve local public health needs across England, PHE should play a key role in providing national oversight of this activity. This will reduce the risk of fragmentation of services, inequality of service provision and the subsequent risk of a public health postcode lottery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]              
[normal]While we support, in principle, autonomy for local authorities to commission and deliver services, only a third of the grant allocated to local authorities for public health is connected to mandated services. This means two thirds of the allocation is not ring fenced.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Services which are not currently covered by mandating regulations include obesity, smoking cessation and substance misuse. In the current financial climate and without ring-fencing, there is a risk that local authorities may drastically reduce or cut these services altogether, in order to save costs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]PHE should, therefore, take a lead role in ensuring that local authorities provide appropriate public health services based on the needs of their local populations. Without this oversight, there is a real risk that public health provision may become fragmented to the detriment of patients.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]We have raised concerns previously about how PHE, health and social care commissioners, providers and regulators will work together to maintain services that are safe, efficient and of high quality. We would expect to see clear evidence of this when the first Public Health Outcome Framework indicators are published. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.0[bold]              [bold]Public Health workforce planning issues[bold]5.1 
[normal]              
[normal]Because of its expertise, PHE has an important role to play in advising local authorities on the best public health workforce structure for meeting the requirements of the Public Health Outcomes Framework. 
[normal]5.2 
[normal]              
[normal]Nurses working in public health for local authorities should have appropriate pay and terms and conditions of service, to ensure the recruitment and retention of key members of the public health workforce. This is a challenge to local authorities, which have not previously employed clinical staff.
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is important that each workforce structure includes nursing skills and experience. While we welcome the introduction of the role of Deputy Director of Nursing at PHE, it is clear that further steps are necessary to ensure appropriate representation of nursing at a local level. 
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]As the expert body on public health with a clear remit for both advising local authorities and participating in the recruitment process, PHE should ensure that nurses are considered for Director of Public Health positions in local authorities, as well as those with a medical background such as doctors and dentists.
