"7/\n8&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the London Cycling Campaign (CYS0071)              The London Cycling Campaign welcomes the opportunity to contribute to th\ne Transport Select Committee’s follow up\n inquiry into cycling. We share the committee’s concern at the tragic death of 6 people in \njust two weeks on London roads.\n The continued growth of cycling in London and the UK must be accompanied, and assisted by, a reduction of road danger to cycle users \nand pedestrians\n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;. \nLondon Cycling Campaign&#xa0;\nT\nhe London Cycling Campaign is a charity \nwith more than 4\n0,000 supporters of who\nm\n \n12,000 \nare full \nmembers. We \nspeak up on behalf of\n everyone who cycles, or want\ns\n to cycle, in Greater London. Our aim is for London to be a world\n \nclass cycling city. Founded in 1978, our organisation campaigns for every street in the city to be cycle\n \nfriendly so\n that\n millions more Londoners\n, whatever the\nir\n age or ability,\n can enjoy the benefits of cycling, helping to creat\ne a cleaner, healthier and \nless \ncongested capital.\n&#xa0;\nLCC, and its 33 local groups, regularly respond to planning consultations, inquiries into cycling and \nprovide\n informed input to \npolicy making at both the local \nand London-wide-levels. Our input and lobbying work led to the comprehe\nnsive revision of London’s cycling programmes now encapsulated in the Mayor’s Vision for Cycling in London. While the LCC would like to\n see\n a significant acceleration in the pace of implementation of the Mayor’s Vision\n, we recognise it\n as a \nmajor step\n towards improving cycling conditions in the capital.  \n&#xa0;1. reducing road danger&#xa0;\n1.1\n \nCycle journeys in London have increased by 176% on main roads in the past decade\n,\n and cycle commuting by Hackney residents now accounts for more than 15% of journeys\n –\n doubling\n in a decade.  \nYet even the capital, where cycle journeys \nnow exceed 57\n0,000 per day, \nstill has a low o\nverall share of cycling at a little more than \n2% of all journeys, well below cities like \nBerlin (\n15\n%) or Amsterdam (36%). \nThe overall figure for\n the UK\n is\n 2% - significantly below the potential rate. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nThe key factor in deterring more people from cycling in the UK is road danger and perceived road danger. Recent surveys, both in London\n \nand the UK, consistently show that a quarter, or more, o\nf the population would like to cycle or cycle more often. \nS\nurveys carried out for LCC and British Cycling show that the number one factor deterring people from cycling is fear of road danger. \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nAs the \nDfT\n funded programme of Cycling Demonstration towns\n has shown\n,\n cycling offers an exceptionally cost effective investment in the transport sector. \nThe Cycling Demonstration Towns showed a cost/benefit ratio of £2- £3.5 for every pound spent and this is described as a conservative \nestimate\n. \nA cost\n/\nbenefit s\ntudy in Copenhagen (a city with high cycling levels) found that the total socio\n-\neconomic cost of cycling (including travel time, health factors, pollution and congestion) \nwas 0.60 DK\n (Danish Krone\n) per\n kilometre compared to 3.74 DK per kilometre for cars\n. \n Cyclist fatality rates in Holland and Denmark compared to distance travelled are half those in the UK. \n1.4 \nThe NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) report on walking cycling, published in December 2012, makes clear that the health cost\ns\n of an inactive population are enormous and comparable to those of smoking.\n \n1.5 \nLCC led the Love London Go Dutch campaign in 2012 that secured 42,000 signatures asking the future Mayor to make our roads \n‘\nas safe and inviting for cycling \nand walking as th\nose in Holland\n.’\n The elected Mayor made a commitment to realise this pledge and his response has \nbeen his\n Vision for \nCycling\n \nwhich commits to both significantly improved infrastructure and safer lorries.\n&#xa0;\n2. POLITICAL LEADERSHIP&#xa0;2.1 In common with the Transport Committee LCC believes that political will, within Government and within Local Authorities, is the single most important fundamental and overarching factor that will deliver improved conditions for cycling in the UK, and unlock the huge latent demand there is for cycling as an everyday means of transport. That political will needs to be reflected in a clear national cycling strategy, backed by adequate resources and funding, which lead to its implementation at local level throughout the country.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nLCC \nshares the view expressed by the Transport Committee, in its 2012 recommendations on cycling\n, that\n local authorities must work together \nwith central Government \nto achieve improved cycling conditions and therefore we are seeking to secure the sup\nport of all local council candidates in the 2014 local elections for cycle-friendly measures in \nLondon \nwards.\n Our recommendations to candidates. \n These \nwill follow six themes\n all related to reducing road danger and removing barriers to cycling. \n&#xa0;\n2.3 Space for Cycling 2014 : key themes&#xa0;\n2.4 \nA key element of the process \nof switching people from \nshort \ncar trips (half \nof which\n are \nless than\n 5\n miles \nin the \nUK)\n to walking and cycling \nis the re\nversal of the policy followed in the 60’s of re-designing cities to enable high-speed motoring. \nI\nf we are to \nachieve the levels of cycling across all demographi\nc groups that are \nseen in the Netherlands\n then motor traffic must be deprioritised in favour of cycling\n and walking\n most notably for urban, local journeys\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nThis is, at heart, a political rather than a technical matter. To fulfil the \nGovernment’s and Local \nAuthorities’ declared\n commitment to sustainable transport\n, and the numerous environmental, economic and health benefits that follow\n,\n \ncycling \n(and walking) \nmust be given \npriority in both time and \nspace over motor traffic\n in the UK’s u\nrban spaces\n,\n as \nit is in the Netherlands and Denmark.\n In this context the Government must re-emphasise \nthat the Traffic Management Act must be used to \nprioritise \nthe movement of \npeople\n, wherever possible by \ncycling and walking\n, \nahead of \nthe movement of \nmotor vehicles\n.  \nA lesson learned in London is that pre-occupation with \nmaintaining or increasing\n road capacity for cars can lead highway authorities to overlook, or discard, traffic schemes that can reduce road danger to vulnerable road users and serve to\n encourage walking and cycling. \n&#xa0;3.  Safety Concerns&#xa0;\n3.1 \nSafety concerns are a primary deterrent to cycle use. The factors identified by London r\noad users include: \n&#xa0;\n3.2 Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.  Cycling Infrastructure&#xa0;\n4.1 \nA\nll urban road infrastructure impacts on the safety of cyclists. The main issues restraining more cycling in London and identified by Londoners \n are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2 Cycle Networks&#xa0;\n4.3 \nIt is evident from successful cycling countries that cycle routes need to build into a network to give people the confidence that they will reach their destination along cycle-friendly roads without encountering major barriers.  \n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nAs the Dutch Design M\nanual for Bic\nycle Traffic (CROW) makes clear\n,\n \ncycle networks \nmust offer\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n \nUK cycle networks, whether in London or\n elsewhere, invariably fall down \non some or all of these principles\n.\n The Mayor of London has announced that a network of ‘\nQuietways\n” across London and “Grid” of cycle-friendly streets in central London will build into a network. The quality of such\n \na network\n must meet continental standards to give people the confidence to \ncycle. \n&#xa0;\n4.6 Main road network cycle provision &#xa0;\nThe level of provision for safe cycling on \nUK main\n roads\n remains inadequate.\n London’s \nMayor initiate\nd\n a review of major junctions\n, \nfollowing previous\n deaths,\n in recognition of the problems across the capital\n. \nCycling infrastructure \non main roads \nis either non-existent or seriously inconveniences cycle journeys\n. \n \nI\nn some cases\n,\n new infrastructure increases risk for cyclists as at recent work on \nHenley’s\n Corner \n(\nA406\n)\n.\n This problem is certainly not exclusive t\no London and must be addressed right across the \ncountry. \n&#xa0;\n4.7 One Way Road System Removal&#xa0;\nO\nne way road \nsystems (\nor \ngyratories\n) remain one of the biggest barriers to \nboth safety and \nincreased cycle use\n.  Progress on removing the \ngyratories\n that blight large parts \nof \nUK cities \nhas been very slow.  A major programme of one way road system removal \nand the introduction of \nhigh grade provision for cycle users and walkers is overdue\n.\n&#xa0;4.8 Filtered Permeability Measures &#xa0;\nSuch schemes allow people on foot or on bikes access through locations where through motor traffic is blocked \n(often by low cost bollards or a no entry sign) \nfor amenity or traffic management reasons. The \nimpetus for such s\nchemes often come\ns\n from residents seeking to eliminate rat running. Permeability schemes such as those in De Beauvoir \nTown,\n Hackney \nand Claremont\n \nSquare,\n Islington, attract thousands of cyclists per day (\nup to 1500 per hour - \nhigh even by Dutch standards\n).\n \nThe virtual absence of moving motor vehicles means that collisions are unlikely. \n&#xa0;4.9 Speed Reduction&#xa0;\nIn combination with measures such as filtered permeability, speed reduction can create pleasant cycling routes that attract more riders\n as well as reducing collisions\n. \nFollowing r\necent changes\n,\n \nDfT\n guidance allow\ns\n 20mph limits on main roads such as the \nTfL\n network\n, under certain specified conditions\n.\n4.10 Cycle Superhighways&#xa0;\nThe cycle superhighways \nIn London \nhave pro\nvided very visible way marking \nbut they have introduced only a limited number of safety improvements, as acknowledged by \nthe\n Mayor’s commitment to re-design them with far greater use of mode separation notably at junctions where most collisions occur. \n&#xa0;Cy\ncle superhighway 2 in East London is a sad case where six cyclists have \ndied in 3 years\n. LCC advised against implementation of this\n highway as originally proposed and welcome\ns\n the Mayoral commitment to re-design it \nwith protected cycle lanes and \ntreated junctions.  \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.11 GreenwaysC\nycle paths through Hyde Park and Green Park in central London are highly popular. \nWell designed\n Greenway routes and links \ncan make \na significant impact on improving conditions for both walkers and cyclists. \n&#xa0;\n4.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5. Children &amp; Cycle Training&#xa0;5.1 \nCycling, which enables children to stay active\n and healthy\n, \nneeds to be \nincorporated\n in\nto\n the educational system\n,\n as it is in the Netherlands\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nIncorporating an element of cycle training into the driving test would enable drivers to understand the on-road strategies of cycle users and help reduce the incidence of collisions.\n&#xa0;5.3 Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.  Improving Street Design &amp; Management&#xa0;\n6.1 \nDutch planners and engineers consider cycle and pedestrian traffic from the outset of any design process.  It is clear that this does not happen in much of the UK.\n \nConsideration of \n‘people’ capacity rather than just motor vehicle capacity would lead to more people friendly planning.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nNot all the transport modelling software used by \nTfL\n and other Highway Authorities allows cycle flows as inputs or outputs. \nTfL’s\n guidance suggests \nthat junction capacity modelling is unreliable where cycle flows make up 20% \n(no longer uncommon in London) \nof the traffic flow\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3 \nSafety audits must properly consider cycle users. \nWe note\n, for example\n, that\n \nTfL\n guidelines for safety audits of road sc\nhemes do not require auditors to have any detailed knowledge of cycling provision or London Cycle Design Standards\n. \n&#xa0;\n6.4 Recommendations&#xa0;5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;7.  Engaging with Cycling Groups&#xa0;\n7.1 \nDfT’s\n Cycle Infrastructure Design document\n recommend\ns consultation with user groups\n. \nCycling groups can provide highway authorities with significant and valuable local input\n to reduce road danger and improve scheme \ndesigns.\n&#xa0;7.2 Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n              \n              \n              \n              \n8.  Best National &amp; International Practice&#xa0;\n8.1 \nBest practice from abroad should inform UK planning and design for cycle users. \nWe provide refe\nren\nces below. \nTfL\n has\n recently commissioned an \nindependent \nstudy of \ninternational \nbest practice\n. \nThat forthcoming study notes the following common themes\n in best\n practice cities\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.2 \nTransport for London \nand local\n authorities have complained about \nDfT\n restrictions that prevent the adoption of European best practice\n in road design\n.\n&#xa0;\nBest practice guides:\n&#xa0;\n8.3 Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.  SPENDING PRIORITIES&#xa0;\n9.1 \nCycle \nuse in\n the UK has increased in those towns and cities where funding\n has been \nprovided –\n London and the \nDemonstration Cycle Towns \nare the obvious examples. \n&#xa0;\n9.2 \nT\nhe \nRod \nEddington\n report on Transport specifically \nhighl\nighted that investment in cycl\ning offered \nparticular \nvalue for money\n: \n“Improving the attractiveness of walking and cycling, e.g. by creating \nor upgrading routes, can provide strong returns with wider BCRs (benefit cost ratios) sometimes over 10.”\n \nEddington’s\n conclusion was that \n“some\n of the best projects are small-scale, such as walking and \ncycling \n.”\n \n&#xa0;\n9.3 \nWe note that a \nDfT\n estimate of the a\nnnual costs of traffic delays, accidents\n,\n poor air quality\n,\n physical inactivity, greenhouse gas emissions and noise resulting from motor traffic in urban areas was put at £38 - £48 billion pounds\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.4 Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;\n10. HGV DANGER&#xa0;\n10.1 \nIn London 9 out of 14 \ncycling fatalities\n in 2013 \nwere\n the result\n of collisions with \nlorries\n. \n&#xa0;\n10.2 \nLCC has been in the forefront of the campaign to reduce danger from heavy goods vehicles\n,\n most recently with the Safer Lorries for Safer Cycling campaign targeting all London \nboroughs\n,\n and the design of an urban lorry that significantly increases a driver’s direct vision. \n&#xa0;\n10.3 LCC\n, advised by a transport expert and ex lorry driver, lobbied \ns\nuccessfully \nfor \nthe inclusion in \nTfL\n contracts of a requ\nirement for lorry operators to:\n&#xa0;\n10.4 \nLCC shares the view of other cycling organisations that the volume of goods vehicles on \nurban \nroads at busy times must be reduced \nboth \nthrough traffic manage\nment solutions and consolidation\n depots. \n&#xa0;\n10.5 Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2012\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n 2011 national census\n Attitudes to Cycling, \nSynovate\n for \nTfL\n 2009\nC\nycling\n demonstration\n towns – an economic evaluation,\n Cycling England 2009 \n Collection of Cycling Concepts 2012 , Cycling Embassy of Denmark \n Dr Harry Rutter, who led the NICE study said: \"Only a minority of people in England get enough physical activity to improve their h\nealth,\" \"This creates a huge and often invisible burden of illness and reduced quality of life, but most people seem to be unaware of the scale of that burden.
