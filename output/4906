[normal]The Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) has over 23,000 members who work in the public, private, v
[normal]oluntary and education sectors.
[normal] It is a charity 
[normal]whose
[normal] purpose
[normal] is
[normal] to develop the art and science of town planning for the benefit of the public. 
[normal]T
[normal]he RTPI develops and shapes policy affecting the built environment, works to raise professional standards and supports members through continu
[normal]ous education, practice advice, training and development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Up and down the country planners are working on the creation of rou
[normal]nded communities 
[normal]together 
[normal]with the homes, 
[normal]jobs 
[normal]and facilities 
[normal]they need. The centralisation of most investment decisions by the public sector and regulated industries causes delay and 
[normal]makes it harder to deliver 
[normal]plans to 
[normal]shape and 
[normal]improve individual places.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is merit in choosing 
[normal]functional economic areas
[normal], for example 
[normal]travel to work
[normal] areas
[normal] for devolution
[normal]. In practice 
[normal]many of 
[normal]the areas of local enterprise partnerships have a lot to recommend them – voluntary formation, suitable size, and some institutional memory. However some solution to the issue of overlapping LEPs 
[normal]is
[normal] needed.
[normal] 
[normal]We note that the areas of LEPs bear some resemblance to the areas proposed by the Royal (Redcliffe-Maud) 
[normal]Commission on Local Government 
[normal]in 1969. It is interesting that associations based on voluntary cooperation can resemble areas drawn up by technical exp
[normal]erts
[normal].
[normal]Our forthcoming policy paper on strategic planning (mid 2014) will address how planning over areas larger than a single local authority could best be undertaken.
[normal] Some key issues such as housing and waste need solutions at subnational level. 
[normal]T
[normal]he use o
[normal]f larger areas makes the scope for initiatives for investment now to save later easier. 
[normal]This is because savings in one sectoral budget may only be realised by investments in another. Larger areas 
[normal]could be
[normal] more able to absorb the peaks and troughs on spendi
[normal]ng involved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The right public services 
[normal](and other functions, including 
[normal]policy making
[normal]) 
[normal]should be delivered at the right level.  There is substanti
[normal]al sco
[normal]pe for devolution of services c
[normal]urrently administered by Whitehall; however a subregional level is not necessarily the only level to which they might be devolved.  Individual local authorities may also be suitable
[normal], as indeed may areas larger than subr
[normal]egions, depending on the function
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are some advantages in allowing
[normal] 
[normal]for a variety of forms of governance of devolved areas so 
[normal]as to 
[normal]enable them to choose.  
[normal]Prof
[normal]essor
[normal] Janice Morphet
[normal] of University College London
[normal] has identified several possible 
[normal]current 
[normal]models
[normal]:
[normal]Joint Committee [bold]set up by two or more local authorities using 1972 Local Government Act s101. It would have directly elected councillors (not necessarily lea
[normal]ders) as members and it can pool part or all of any powers or services for which the constituent local authorities are responsible including planning, transport, waste, environment, regeneration. Once policies and powers are pooled, all decisions must be t
[normal]aken by the joint committee and cannot be taken again in any of the individual local authority member authorities i.e. principle of one vote per issue remains. A joint committee can be set up quickly; local authority experience of using this approach 
[normal]is 
[normal]co
[normal]nsiderable; 
[normal]it is 
[normal]easy to use once established; 
[normal]and there is 
[normal]clear accountability
[normal]. On the other hand decisions taken by a group of l
[normal]ocal authorities
[normal] may not suit an individual 
[normal]one
[normal] so 
[normal]there 
[normal]need
[normal]s to be
[normal] good pre-decision processes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Combined Authority [bold]under
[normal] the
[normal] [bold]Local Democracy etc Act 2009. The 
[normal]membership would probably be
[normal] 
[normal]council leaders or directly elected mayors. It needs consent of the Secretary of State. Once policies and powers are pooled, all decisions must be taken by the combined authority and canno
[normal]t be taken again in any of the individual local authority member authorities i.e. principle of one vote per issue remains. It is the model preferred by the Coalition government so it is more likely to be supported through funding devolution. 
[normal]This
[normal] is 
[normal]howeve
[normal]r quite 
[normal]time consuming to set up.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Supervisory Board [bold]such as
[normal] [bold]proposed by Lord Heseltine for Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP
[normal].  It would comprise local authorities represented by their leaders. Again once powers pooled, they cannot be taken 
[normal]back 
[normal]again b
[normal]y the authorities. It is easy to set up and establishes a clear local authority relationship to the LEP. On the other hand there is no clear legal route so this would need to be discussed; it is unlikely to work on informal basis
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A City Deal [bold]under 
[normal]no spe
[normal]cific domestic legislation but with links to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty and the 2011 EU Directive on Cohesion Policy 2014-2020
[normal]. Requires bid to central government and appears to involve a fair amount of working behind the scenes, which can appear excluding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The question of 
[normal]business involvement[bold] is critical. We note that the CBI has 
[normal]expressed concern at the multiplicity of arrangements (eg LEPs running alongside City Deals) in the context of the capacity of business people to engage
[normal]. One benefit of a more devo
[normal]lved structure for economic growth and housing could be easier business involvement.
[normal] 
[normal]However[bold] however increased variety does add complexity for business and other 
[normal]stakeholders who need to engage across the country. Other European countries tend to adopt mor
[normal]e uniform models of devolution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]See our response to question 3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The RTPI has for some time been concerned that the current arrangements for securing development on the ground in our local areas are highly unsatisfactory. 
[normal]D
[normal]ue to the privatisation of utilities and transport operators and the
[normal] parallel creation of multiple
[normal] 
[normal]government agencies (HCA, Environment, Nature, Heritage) 
[normal]it has been getting harder to get
[normal] decision makers who have the power to control resources to 
[normal]work
[normal] together to get sites off the ground
[normal] and things to happen locally
[normal]. Decisions on releasing resources 
[normal]and also making vital compromises necessary to achieve development frequently have to be referred to head offices at national level (or 
[normal]even 
[normal]board rooms in other countries).  Decision makers have multiple other priorities 
[normal]and drivers: 
[normal] achieving development in given localities are not one of them
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of our own work with partners has provided recent demonstrations of the difficulties local areas face in making jobs and housing growth happen.  For example the RTPI is a member of a pri
[normal]vate-led partnership, the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots Programme, along with the Civil Engineering Contractors’ Association and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills
[normal],
[normal] which aims to progress stalled local projects with the potential
[normal] to release economic growth. This process has been strongly informative in relation to the difficulties faced by local areas in achieving their objectives. Some of the difficulties stem from the centralised nature of investment decisions in government
[normal], its
[normal] agencies and in privatised utility and transport companies (many of whose decisions are even made outside the country, let alone in London)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In Northamptonsh
[normal]ire, County Council staff have 
[normal]pointed out to us  that there are two key barriers: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northamptonshire is a county with clear and a
[normal]mbitious plans for growth
[normal]: there are over 35000 homes with planning permission, with potential for over 80000 homes. There is scope for 70000 additional jobs. But there are significant infrastructure gaps. Bridg
[normal]ing these is difficult in a climate of reduced public spending (especially on 
[normal]i
[normal]nvestment
[normal] as 
[normal]opposed to welfare) culture of bidding for and dependency on central funds,  and both local (local authority/LEP) silos and national silos (BIS, CLG, etc). The solution the County Council has come up with is a Revolving Infrastructure Fund which propos
[normal]es to  pool the various schemes which could be used for the overall infrastructure investment needed in the area ie Community Infrastructure Levy, New Homes Bonus, Business Rates, Get Britain Building Fund, Growing Places Fund, Local Infrastructure Fund, R
[normal]egional Growth and Local Major Transport Scheme funding).  The aim is to be able to use this large combination of funds to repay loans used to construct key road schemes such as on the A45 and A43 trunk roads. Over a 20-year period (in the case of the A45)
[normal] the year-end debt balance would be zero. However this solution was (July 2013) not yet authorised and required a complicated set of sign-offs from a series of different central authorities. It would also leave the County Council with potentially some cons
[normal]iderable risks, which increases the cost of borrowing and may cause problems with securing agreement from financial controllers. One may surmise that a single pot of funding would greatly assist here.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The issue of how to energise local growth has been the
[normal] concern of other initiatives. The Local Government Association and the British Property Federation ran a year-long project in 2011-12 to look at how local authorities’ aspirations for growth could be 
[normal]realised
[normal].  One conclusion was that “government should 
[normal]enable more decisions regarding the funding of local infrastructure to be taken locally”. For example in relation to 
[normal]Cornwall, there has been concern that the fragmentation
[normal] of and delay to spending decisions pertaining to investment for growth has slowed c
[normal]onsiderably the rate of development and also caused valuable opportunities in the pre 2008 period to be lost. For example it took 
[normal]over 10 years to obtain the necessary funding to deliver a major new road scheme that will provide access to 64 acres of devel
[normal]opment land and create more than 5,000 new jobs and 6,000 homes in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth area.
[normal] This development proposal
[normal] was originally initiated in an 
[normal]Urban Framework Plan in 2001. Cornwall County Council said “we firmly believe that if more deci
[normal]sions regarding the funding of local infrastructure were taken locally it would accelerate the delivery of major regeneration projects”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many commentators have referred to not only the multiplicity of bodies involved in development needed for homes and jo
[normal]bs, but also to the variety of unrelated funding streams.  This is not confined to the present Coalition government. For example in Hull  there were over 
[normal]20
[normal] 
[normal]strategic partnerships, policy statements and local delivery vehicles
[normal] set up in response to central
[normal]ly-determined policy initiatives, sometimes even arising in the same government department
[normal]. 
[normal]This produced a number of challenges:
[normal]• Varying timespans.
[normal]• Varying geographies eg neighbourhood, city, subregion 
[normal]• Scale of operation: long term large capital 
[normal]funding projects and short term regeneration
[normal]projects 
[normal]• Widely varying organisational structures which also change over time (eg an urban regeneration company to an economic development company
[normal]• Succession planning
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Due to the orchestration of these vari
[normal]ous national programmes at national level the experience on the ground 
[normal]in Hull was
[normal] disconnected and unsatisfactory. For example “housing conditions might have been improved through a housing market renewal pathfinder, but better health facilities and schoo
[normal]ls may not be programmed through LIFT and BSF programmes for delivery towards the end of the next decade”. 
[normal] This kind of sectoral allocation of funds misses the opportunities for different sectors to benefit each other mutually and to accrue positive feedb
[normal]ack. 
[normal]Our recent paper on 
[normal]Delivering Large Scale Housing 
[normal] 
[normal] and on transport infrastructure
[normal]  both testify to the complex nature of development and the requirement for a variety of sectors to pull together to achieve growth. 
[normal]Similar experiences are reporte
[normal]d from Birmingham City Council
[normal].
[normal] We would 
[normal]also 
[normal]recommend reconsideration of the findings from the Total Place exercise conducted by government and va
[normal]rious local authorities 2008-10
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some evidence of the restriction that strong centralisation and departmental fragmentation 
[normal]imposes on 
[normal]to local growth can be adduced from comparisons with countries where there is more local control of investment streams.
[normal] “
[normal]An interesting example is Amersfo
[normal]ort in the central part of the
[normal] 
[normal]Netherlands. There are three major town extension schemes being implemented. The
[normal] 
[normal]municipality, through the planning process, set out the vision and master planned the projects.
[normal] 
[normal]In the case of Vathorst, this is a 20-year proje
[normal]ct that when completed will comprise 11,000
[normal] 
[normal]homes (30% of which will be social housing), a new shopping centre, a railway station and an
[normal] 
[normal]office/business park. The municipality (which owned roughly half of the site) set up a
[normal] 
[normal]development company as a joint v
[normal]enture with five private landowners and developers. The
[normal] 
[normal]company was able to access low cost loans with the help of the council to ensure that the
[normal] 
[normal]infrastructure was put in at an early stage. The municipality planned, organised and project
[normal] 
[normal]managed this aspe
[normal]ct of the development.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Councils 
[normal][in other European countries] 
[normal]are able to undertake activities unless specifically prohibited by legislation. There are also relatively high degrees of financial autonomy as well as fiscal incentives such as retaining 
[normal]increased property taxation income from the effects of new housebuilding. Urban regeneration in British cities would be more effectively co-ordinated if local government was less constrained because of legislation and the inability to raise funds.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Resea
[normal]rch led by Professor Michael Parkinson as part of the ESPON Programme
[normal] suggests a positive correlation between decentralisation and innovation, with cities in Federal and Nordic systems performing better in terms of patent numbers. The research also reinforces the assertion that decentralisation has an impact on economic per
[normal]formance. Germany has the most decentralised policy-making system in Europe and also has one of the most balanced urban growth systems: “its key features are the levels of decentralisation, commitment to long term planning and action, the allocation of pow
[normal]ers to regional and urban authorities, the focus upon innovation, education, research and development.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]ESPON 
[normal]study also looks at Leeds and suggests that the city would have been “more successful if there had been more decentralisation of powers”. It 
[normal]asserts that economic growth would have been greater had there been devolution of power – the lack of a coherent strategic industrial and innovation policy and support for public transport infrastructure have been particular hindrances. The research conclu
[normal]des with the recommendation that Leeds “would be helped in its post-recession strategy for growth by a national policy framework that involves genuine devolution of powers as part of a broader programme for rebalancing the economy.”
[normal]According to the Heselt
[normal]ine Review 
[normal], the
[normal] United Kingdom (UK) has highly centralised government in comparison to other OECD countries. 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal government in the UK accounts for 30%
[normal] of public spending
[normal], whereas in the US and Sweden local government accounts for almost half. Denmark a
[normal]nd Canada’s local governments account for 70% of public expenditure. The negative consequences of disempowering local governments are not just confined to 
[normal]local areas
[normal]; 
[normal]the Heseltine review also provides information on international competitiveness 
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It w
[normal]ould appear that 
[normal]although the UK ranks quite highly in the majority of 
[normal]world
[normal] rankings 
[normal]of competitiveness
[normal], typically 
[normal]the
[normal] countries that are more competitive than the UK are those countries with comparably more government expenditure taking place at local le
[normal]vel. 
[normal]F
[normal]urther decentralisation would 
[normal]potentially enable 
[normal]UK competitiveness
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]to rise further up the rankings
[normal] given the benefits experienced in countries with more decentralised expenditure
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he OECD surveyed
[normal] 24 distinct global regions deciphering what successful and unsuccessful regions hold in common
[normal]. One characteristic of the more successful regions is “the deliberate adoption of a horizontal approach to regional development focused on better coordination 
[normal]of sectoral policies and 
[normal]mobilisation
[normal] of local assets and resources rather than reliance on external support”. Of the 24 regions surveyed, 12 regions displayed above average growth, and two thirds of that group 
[normal]adjusted policies 
[normal]to local assets rather than
[normal] using policies passed through a centralised government, and embraced cross-border co-operation beyond administrative boundaries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The system currently being promoted by the Coalition gov
[normal]ernment is based on competition between areas for both funds and powers at the same time. There are drawbacks to a system based on bidding, which are that the areas which may be most in need of support may also be those which have less capacity to mount go
[normal]od bids. In all areas the resources available for 
[normal] any 
[normal] function which is not front line service delivery are intensely squeezed. This may be of particular concern to 
[normal]rural[bold] areas with dispersed populations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Smith Institute has reported on current arr
[normal]angements to East Midlands Councils and concluded that “if funds are awarded to areas that happen to have the most developed capacity to bid successfully, rather than necessarily the strongest case in terms of need and opportunity, then that investment wil
[normal]l have a less than optimal impact, as well as reinforcing entrenched 
[normal]inequalities
[normal]”
[normal] Yet in the UK as a whole there is already a formula-based system of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so the principle of a non-bidding system has been ac
[normal]cepted. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the variable geometry arising from a bidding system,
[normal] 
[normal]Whitehall departments and their agencies 
[normal]will
[normal] need to become astute in undertaking negotiations with the devolved areas regarding cross border issues. Probably the most serious of these would be matters of housing, transport and economic growth across the boundary of Greater London.  As things curren
[normal]tly stand, the appetite for effective joint working to be rewarded by devolution is weakest in the parts of England adjoining London. Unless this changes, it poses serious challenges to planning the area which produces nearly 40% of UK GDP.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Going further with the current bidding system 
[normal](despite its disadvantages) 
[normal]would have the 
[normal]benefit
[normal] of providing opportunities for increased capacit
[normal]y building and also sharing of best practice from areas with more evolved levels of cooperation. However given the time required to instigate more fundamental reform it would be preferable for 
[normal]the two processes to take place in paralle
[normal]l
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The continued 
[normal]squeeze on local authority capacity and resources may result in some areas exploring fundamental change (such as Shropshire did recently, choosing voluntary unitary status). Likew
[normal]i
[normal]se the constraints on resour
[normal]c
[normal]es and capacity in 
[normal]Whitehall 
[normal] 
[normal]will necessitate 
[normal]new approaches, greater departmental alignment and hopefully more devolution and empowerment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]As the Local Government Association has indicated
[normal], t
[normal]he long term 
[normal]financial 
[normal]sustainability of local government in its current fo
[normal]rm is 
[normal]enormously challenging
[normal]. A recent past in which high levels of centralisation have been combined with (and to an extent justified by) high levels of central government spending looks likely to be gone for some time, if not for good. Alternatives could
[normal] include more ability to raise 
[normal]and allocate 
[normal]money locally, with taxing land in one form or other being a possibility.
