defaultThe Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) has over 23,000 members who work in the public, private, v
defaultoluntary and education sectors.
default It is a charity 
defaultwhose
default purpose
default is
default to develop the art and science of town planning for the benefit of the public. 
defaultT
defaulthe RTPI develops and shapes policy affecting the built environment, works to raise professional standards and supports members through continu
defaultous education, practice advice, training and development.
default&#xa0;
defaultUp and down the country planners are working on the creation of rou
defaultnded communities 
defaulttogether 
defaultwith the homes, 
defaultjobs 
defaultand facilities 
defaultthey need. The centralisation of most investment decisions by the public sector and regulated industries causes delay and 
defaultmakes it harder to deliver 
defaultplans to 
defaultshape and 
defaultimprove individual places.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is merit in choosing 
defaultfunctional economic areas
default, for example 
defaulttravel to work
default areas
default for devolution
default. In practice 
defaultmany of 
defaultthe areas of local enterprise partnerships have a lot to recommend them – voluntary formation, suitable size, and some institutional memory. However some solution to the issue of overlapping LEPs 
defaultis
default needed.
default 
defaultWe note that the areas of LEPs bear some resemblance to the areas proposed by the Royal (Redcliffe-Maud) 
defaultCommission on Local Government 
defaultin 1969. It is interesting that associations based on voluntary cooperation can resemble areas drawn up by technical exp
defaulterts
default.
defaultOur forthcoming policy paper on strategic planning (mid 2014) will address how planning over areas larger than a single local authority could best be undertaken.
default Some key issues such as housing and waste need solutions at subnational level. 
defaultT
defaulthe use o
defaultf larger areas makes the scope for initiatives for investment now to save later easier. 
defaultThis is because savings in one sectoral budget may only be realised by investments in another. Larger areas 
defaultcould be
default more able to absorb the peaks and troughs on spendi
defaultng involved.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe right public services 
default(and other functions, including 
defaultpolicy making
default) 
defaultshould be delivered at the right level.  There is substanti
defaultal sco
defaultpe for devolution of services c
defaulturrently administered by Whitehall; however a subregional level is not necessarily the only level to which they might be devolved.  Individual local authorities may also be suitable
default, as indeed may areas larger than subr
defaultegions, depending on the function
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are some advantages in allowing
default 
defaultfor a variety of forms of governance of devolved areas so 
defaultas to 
defaultenable them to choose.  
defaultProf
defaultessor
default Janice Morphet
default of University College London
default has identified several possible 
defaultcurrent 
defaultmodels
default:
defaultJoint Committee defaultset up by two or more local authorities using 1972 Local Government Act s101. It would have directly elected councillors (not necessarily lea
defaultders) as members and it can pool part or all of any powers or services for which the constituent local authorities are responsible including planning, transport, waste, environment, regeneration. Once policies and powers are pooled, all decisions must be t
defaultaken by the joint committee and cannot be taken again in any of the individual local authority member authorities i.e. principle of one vote per issue remains. A joint committee can be set up quickly; local authority experience of using this approach 
defaultis 
defaultco
defaultnsiderable; 
defaultit is 
defaulteasy to use once established; 
defaultand there is 
defaultclear accountability
default. On the other hand decisions taken by a group of l
defaultocal authorities
default may not suit an individual 
defaultone
default so 
defaultthere 
defaultneed
defaults to be
default good pre-decision processes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCombined Authority defaultunder
default the
default defaultLocal Democracy etc Act 2009. The 
defaultmembership would probably be
default 
defaultcouncil leaders or directly elected mayors. It needs consent of the Secretary of State. Once policies and powers are pooled, all decisions must be taken by the combined authority and canno
defaultt be taken again in any of the individual local authority member authorities i.e. principle of one vote per issue remains. It is the model preferred by the Coalition government so it is more likely to be supported through funding devolution. 
defaultThis
default is 
defaulthoweve
defaultr quite 
defaulttime consuming to set up.
default&#xa0;
defaultSupervisory Board defaultsuch as
default defaultproposed by Lord Heseltine for Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP
default.  It would comprise local authorities represented by their leaders. Again once powers pooled, they cannot be taken 
defaultback 
defaultagain b
defaulty the authorities. It is easy to set up and establishes a clear local authority relationship to the LEP. On the other hand there is no clear legal route so this would need to be discussed; it is unlikely to work on informal basis
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA City Deal defaultunder 
defaultno spe
defaultcific domestic legislation but with links to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty and the 2011 EU Directive on Cohesion Policy 2014-2020
default. Requires bid to central government and appears to involve a fair amount of working behind the scenes, which can appear excluding.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe question of 
defaultbusiness involvementdefault is critical. We note that the CBI has 
defaultexpressed concern at the multiplicity of arrangements (eg LEPs running alongside City Deals) in the context of the capacity of business people to engage
default. One benefit of a more devo
defaultlved structure for economic growth and housing could be easier business involvement.
default 
defaultHoweverdefault however increased variety does add complexity for business and other 
defaultstakeholders who need to engage across the country. Other European countries tend to adopt mor
defaulte uniform models of devolution.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSee our response to question 3.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe RTPI has for some time been concerned that the current arrangements for securing development on the ground in our local areas are highly unsatisfactory. 
defaultD
defaultue to the privatisation of utilities and transport operators and the
default parallel creation of multiple
default 
defaultgovernment agencies (HCA, Environment, Nature, Heritage) 
defaultit has been getting harder to get
default decision makers who have the power to control resources to 
defaultwork
default together to get sites off the ground
default and things to happen locally
default. Decisions on releasing resources 
defaultand also making vital compromises necessary to achieve development frequently have to be referred to head offices at national level (or 
defaulteven 
defaultboard rooms in other countries).  Decision makers have multiple other priorities 
defaultand drivers: 
default achieving development in given localities are not one of them
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of our own work with partners has provided recent demonstrations of the difficulties local areas face in making jobs and housing growth happen.  For example the RTPI is a member of a pri
defaultvate-led partnership, the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots Programme, along with the Civil Engineering Contractors’ Association and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills
default,
default which aims to progress stalled local projects with the potential
default to release economic growth. This process has been strongly informative in relation to the difficulties faced by local areas in achieving their objectives. Some of the difficulties stem from the centralised nature of investment decisions in government
default, its
default agencies and in privatised utility and transport companies (many of whose decisions are even made outside the country, let alone in London)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Northamptonsh
defaultire, County Council staff have 
defaultpointed out to us  that there are two key barriers: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNorthamptonshire is a county with clear and a
defaultmbitious plans for growth
default: there are over 35000 homes with planning permission, with potential for over 80000 homes. There is scope for 70000 additional jobs. But there are significant infrastructure gaps. Bridg
defaulting these is difficult in a climate of reduced public spending (especially on 
defaulti
defaultnvestment
default as 
defaultopposed to welfare) culture of bidding for and dependency on central funds,  and both local (local authority/LEP) silos and national silos (BIS, CLG, etc). The solution the County Council has come up with is a Revolving Infrastructure Fund which propos
defaultes to  pool the various schemes which could be used for the overall infrastructure investment needed in the area ie Community Infrastructure Levy, New Homes Bonus, Business Rates, Get Britain Building Fund, Growing Places Fund, Local Infrastructure Fund, R
defaultegional Growth and Local Major Transport Scheme funding).  The aim is to be able to use this large combination of funds to repay loans used to construct key road schemes such as on the A45 and A43 trunk roads. Over a 20-year period (in the case of the A45)
default the year-end debt balance would be zero. However this solution was (July 2013) not yet authorised and required a complicated set of sign-offs from a series of different central authorities. It would also leave the County Council with potentially some cons
defaultiderable risks, which increases the cost of borrowing and may cause problems with securing agreement from financial controllers. One may surmise that a single pot of funding would greatly assist here.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe issue of how to energise local growth has been the
default concern of other initiatives. The Local Government Association and the British Property Federation ran a year-long project in 2011-12 to look at how local authorities’ aspirations for growth could be 
defaultrealised
default.  One conclusion was that “government should 
defaultenable more decisions regarding the funding of local infrastructure to be taken locally”. For example in relation to 
defaultCornwall, there has been concern that the fragmentation
default of and delay to spending decisions pertaining to investment for growth has slowed c
defaultonsiderably the rate of development and also caused valuable opportunities in the pre 2008 period to be lost. For example it took 
defaultover 10 years to obtain the necessary funding to deliver a major new road scheme that will provide access to 64 acres of devel
defaultopment land and create more than 5,000 new jobs and 6,000 homes in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth area.
default This development proposal
default was originally initiated in an 
defaultUrban Framework Plan in 2001. Cornwall County Council said “we firmly believe that if more deci
defaultsions regarding the funding of local infrastructure were taken locally it would accelerate the delivery of major regeneration projects”.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany commentators have referred to not only the multiplicity of bodies involved in development needed for homes and jo
defaultbs, but also to the variety of unrelated funding streams.  This is not confined to the present Coalition government. For example in Hull  there were over 
default20
default 
defaultstrategic partnerships, policy statements and local delivery vehicles
default set up in response to central
defaultly-determined policy initiatives, sometimes even arising in the same government department
default. 
defaultThis produced a number of challenges:
default• Varying timespans.
default• Varying geographies eg neighbourhood, city, subregion 
default• Scale of operation: long term large capital 
defaultfunding projects and short term regeneration
defaultprojects 
default• Widely varying organisational structures which also change over time (eg an urban regeneration company to an economic development company
default• Succession planning
default&#xa0;
defaultDue to the orchestration of these vari
defaultous national programmes at national level the experience on the ground 
defaultin Hull was
default disconnected and unsatisfactory. For example “housing conditions might have been improved through a housing market renewal pathfinder, but better health facilities and schoo
defaultls may not be programmed through LIFT and BSF programmes for delivery towards the end of the next decade”. 
default This kind of sectoral allocation of funds misses the opportunities for different sectors to benefit each other mutually and to accrue positive feedb
defaultack. 
defaultOur recent paper on 
defaultDelivering Large Scale Housing 
default 
default and on transport infrastructure
default  both testify to the complex nature of development and the requirement for a variety of sectors to pull together to achieve growth. 
defaultSimilar experiences are reporte
defaultd from Birmingham City Council
default.
default We would 
defaultalso 
defaultrecommend reconsideration of the findings from the Total Place exercise conducted by government and va
defaultrious local authorities 2008-10
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome evidence of the restriction that strong centralisation and departmental fragmentation 
defaultimposes on 
defaultto local growth can be adduced from comparisons with countries where there is more local control of investment streams.
default “
defaultAn interesting example is Amersfo
defaultort in the central part of the
default 
defaultNetherlands. There are three major town extension schemes being implemented. The
default 
defaultmunicipality, through the planning process, set out the vision and master planned the projects.
default 
defaultIn the case of Vathorst, this is a 20-year proje
defaultct that when completed will comprise 11,000
default 
defaulthomes (30% of which will be social housing), a new shopping centre, a railway station and an
default 
defaultoffice/business park. The municipality (which owned roughly half of the site) set up a
default 
defaultdevelopment company as a joint v
defaultenture with five private landowners and developers. The
default 
defaultcompany was able to access low cost loans with the help of the council to ensure that the
default 
defaultinfrastructure was put in at an early stage. The municipality planned, organised and project
default 
defaultmanaged this aspe
defaultct of the development.
default”
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultCouncils 
default[in other European countries] 
defaultare able to undertake activities unless specifically prohibited by legislation. There are also relatively high degrees of financial autonomy as well as fiscal incentives such as retaining 
defaultincreased property taxation income from the effects of new housebuilding. Urban regeneration in British cities would be more effectively co-ordinated if local government was less constrained because of legislation and the inability to raise funds.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultResea
defaultrch led by Professor Michael Parkinson as part of the ESPON Programme
default suggests a positive correlation between decentralisation and innovation, with cities in Federal and Nordic systems performing better in terms of patent numbers. The research also reinforces the assertion that decentralisation has an impact on economic per
defaultformance. Germany has the most decentralised policy-making system in Europe and also has one of the most balanced urban growth systems: “its key features are the levels of decentralisation, commitment to long term planning and action, the allocation of pow
defaulters to regional and urban authorities, the focus upon innovation, education, research and development.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultESPON 
defaultstudy also looks at Leeds and suggests that the city would have been “more successful if there had been more decentralisation of powers”. It 
defaultasserts that economic growth would have been greater had there been devolution of power – the lack of a coherent strategic industrial and innovation policy and support for public transport infrastructure have been particular hindrances. The research conclu
defaultdes with the recommendation that Leeds “would be helped in its post-recession strategy for growth by a national policy framework that involves genuine devolution of powers as part of a broader programme for rebalancing the economy.”
defaultAccording to the Heselt
defaultine Review 
default, the
default United Kingdom (UK) has highly centralised government in comparison to other OECD countries. 
defaultL
defaultocal government in the UK accounts for 30%
default of public spending
default, whereas in the US and Sweden local government accounts for almost half. Denmark a
defaultnd Canada’s local governments account for 70% of public expenditure. The negative consequences of disempowering local governments are not just confined to 
defaultlocal areas
default; 
defaultthe Heseltine review also provides information on international competitiveness 
default.
default&#xa0;
default It w
defaultould appear that 
defaultalthough the UK ranks quite highly in the majority of 
defaultworld
default rankings 
defaultof competitiveness
default, typically 
defaultthe
default countries that are more competitive than the UK are those countries with comparably more government expenditure taking place at local le
defaultvel. 
defaultF
defaulturther decentralisation would 
defaultpotentially enable 
defaultUK competitiveness
default&#xa0;
defaultto rise further up the rankings
default given the benefits experienced in countries with more decentralised expenditure
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe OECD surveyed
default 24 distinct global regions deciphering what successful and unsuccessful regions hold in common
default. One characteristic of the more successful regions is “the deliberate adoption of a horizontal approach to regional development focused on better coordination 
defaultof sectoral policies and 
defaultmobilisation
default of local assets and resources rather than reliance on external support”. Of the 24 regions surveyed, 12 regions displayed above average growth, and two thirds of that group 
defaultadjusted policies 
defaultto local assets rather than
default using policies passed through a centralised government, and embraced cross-border co-operation beyond administrative boundaries.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe system currently being promoted by the Coalition gov
defaulternment is based on competition between areas for both funds and powers at the same time. There are drawbacks to a system based on bidding, which are that the areas which may be most in need of support may also be those which have less capacity to mount go
defaultod bids. In all areas the resources available for 
default any 
default function which is not front line service delivery are intensely squeezed. This may be of particular concern to 
defaultruraldefault areas with dispersed populations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Smith Institute has reported on current arr
defaultangements to East Midlands Councils and concluded that “if funds are awarded to areas that happen to have the most developed capacity to bid successfully, rather than necessarily the strongest case in terms of need and opportunity, then that investment wil
defaultl have a less than optimal impact, as well as reinforcing entrenched 
defaultinequalities
default”
default Yet in the UK as a whole there is already a formula-based system of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so the principle of a non-bidding system has been ac
defaultcepted. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the variable geometry arising from a bidding system,
default 
defaultWhitehall departments and their agencies 
defaultwill
default need to become astute in undertaking negotiations with the devolved areas regarding cross border issues. Probably the most serious of these would be matters of housing, transport and economic growth across the boundary of Greater London.  As things curren
defaulttly stand, the appetite for effective joint working to be rewarded by devolution is weakest in the parts of England adjoining London. Unless this changes, it poses serious challenges to planning the area which produces nearly 40% of UK GDP.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultGoing further with the current bidding system 
default(despite its disadvantages) 
defaultwould have the 
defaultbenefit
default of providing opportunities for increased capacit
defaulty building and also sharing of best practice from areas with more evolved levels of cooperation. However given the time required to instigate more fundamental reform it would be preferable for 
defaultthe two processes to take place in paralle
defaultl
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe continued 
defaultsqueeze on local authority capacity and resources may result in some areas exploring fundamental change (such as Shropshire did recently, choosing voluntary unitary status). Likew
defaulti
defaultse the constraints on resour
defaultc
defaultes and capacity in 
defaultWhitehall 
default 
defaultwill necessitate 
defaultnew approaches, greater departmental alignment and hopefully more devolution and empowerment.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultAs the Local Government Association has indicated
default, t
defaulthe long term 
defaultfinancial 
defaultsustainability of local government in its current fo
defaultrm is 
defaultenormously challenging
default. A recent past in which high levels of centralisation have been combined with (and to an extent justified by) high levels of central government spending looks likely to be gone for some time, if not for good. Alternatives could
default include more ability to raise 
defaultand allocate 
defaultmoney locally, with taxing land in one form or other being a possibility.
