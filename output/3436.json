"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence by the National LGB&amp;T Partnership (PHE 0007)&#xa0;Public Health England&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;This document provides feedback from the National LGB&amp;T (lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans) Partnership, a member of the\n \nDepartment of Health, NHS England, and Public Health England’s Health and Care Voluntary Sector Strategic Partner Programme. The National LGB&amp;T Partnership is an England-wide group of LGB&amp;T voluntary and community service delivery organisations (see below for members of the Partnership) that are committed to reducing health inequalities and challenging homophobia, \nbiphobia\n and \ntransphobia\n within public services\n&#xa0;\nThe National LGB&amp;T Partnership members intend to positively influence the policy, practice and actions of Government and statutory bodies, in particular the Department of Health, for the benefit of all LGB&amp;T people and communities across England. The member organisations of the National LGB&amp;T Partnership are: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe National LGB&amp;T Partnership will ensure that health inequalities experienced by LGB&amp;T people are kept high on the Government’s agenda and that best use is made of the experience and expertise found within the LGB&amp;T voluntary and community sector. The National LGB&amp;T Partnership is also establishing a National LGB&amp;T Stakeholder Group which is open to interested groups, organisations, service providers and individuals, giving a direct voice to the LGB&amp;T sector. See \nhttp://www.lgf.org.uk/Your-rights/The-National-LGB-T-Partnership\n for more information.\n&#xa0;\nSubmission of Evidence&#xa0;\nThis evidence has been taken from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans Public Health Outcomes Framework Companion Document, endorsed by the National LGB&amp;T Partnership and supported by the Department for Health and Public Health England. It is a resource for all those commissioning and delivering healthcare services in order to support the delivery of an equitable public health system, and the full document can be accessed at \nwww.lgf.org.uk/phof\n.  \n&#xa0;\nThere is a substantial body of evidence demonstrating that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGB&amp;T) people experience significant health inequalities, which impact both on their health outcomes and their experiences of the healthcare system. The relationship between sexual \norientation and gender identity and health has often been overlooked by the healthcare system, and a lack of sexual orientation and gender identity monitoring in service provision and population level research means that the Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) indicators alone will not generate data on LGB&amp;T people.\n&#xa0;\nThe LGB&amp;T Public Health Outcomes Framework Companion Document is intended for Health and Wellbeing Boards, Local Authorities, NHS England, Specialist Public Health Teams, Clinical Commissioning Groups, Commissioning Support Services, NHS and Social Care providers, and voluntary and community organisations working with LGB&amp;T people. It is a resource to improve the commissioning and provision of services to meet the needs of the diverse LGB&amp;T community.\n&#xa0;\nThe document follows the structure of the PHOF, the set of indicators to improve and protect the nation’s health, providing data and evidence on LGB&amp;T communities for each indicator and domain. It makes recommendations for actions to address inequalities in outcomes for LGB&amp;T people and communities, and highlights best practice case studies and resources to support organisations in implementing these recommendations. Following these recommendations will help organisations to ensure that they are paying due regard to LGB&amp;T people, as required by Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010, the Public Sector Equality Duty. It is important to note that the protected characteristic of gender reassignment covers only those who are proposing to undergo, are undergoing, or have undergone, the process of changing their gender. It is best practice to consider all trans people as though they are equally protected in the provision of appropriate healthcare services.\n&#xa0;\nThe LGB&amp;T Public Health Outcomes Framework Companion Document has been developed by a group of volunteer experts from across the LGB&amp;T community working with the Department of Health, to increase understanding of LGB&amp;T health and make sure that the public health system tackles inequality related to sexual orientation and gender identity and promotes equality for everybody.\n&#xa0;\nDomain One: Improving the wider determinants of Health\nLGB&amp;T individuals often experience discrimination and marginalisation that impacts on wider factors such as education, housing and perceptions and experiences of crime and violence, meaning that these groups experience specific health inequalities as a result.\n&#xa0;\nDomain Two: Health Improvement\nLocal and national research and needs assessments of LGB&amp;T communities have repeatedly demonstrated higher levels of health risk behaviours, such as smoking and drug and alcohol use, as well as higher levels of self-harm. LGB&amp;T people are less likely to engage with health interventions and screening programmes, and gender-specific screening can present particular challenges for trans and non-gendered individuals. LGB&amp;T communities therefore have higher levels of need for intervention and targeted support related to these indicators.\n&#xa0;\nDomain Three: Health Protection\nThese indicators focus on protecting the population’s health from major incidents, and other threats, while reducing health inequalities there are some areas which particularly affect LGB&amp;T people. There is a lack of evidence on LGB&amp;T communities in relation to many of the indicators in this domain, yet the available evidence indicates that LGB&amp;T people may be experiencing health inequalities in relation to health protection.\n&#xa0;\nDomain Four: Healthcare public health preventing premature mortality\nEvidence indicates that LGB&amp;T communities are more likely to be experiencing health inequalities in relation to public health areas and preventing premature mortality. The higher prevalence of \nsmoking, alcohol use and drug use, and lower uptake of screening programmes, are likely to contribute to increased risk of preventable ill health. There is also a significant body of evidence demonstrating high rates of suicide attempts.\n&#xa0;\nThe LGB&amp;T Public Health Outcomes Framework Companion Document makes a number of overarching recommendations for Public Health England, Health and Wellbeing Boards, public health teams, local authorities, the NHS and other partners to support the delivery of improved health and wellbeing outcomes for LGB&amp;T people.\n&#xa0;\nRecognition:\n&#xa0;\nEngagement:\n&#xa0;\nMonitoring:\n&#xa0;\nService Provision:\n&#xa0;\nThe National LGB&amp;T Partnership would ask PHE to support the implementation of these recommendations. We would particularly draw attention to the recommendations to monitor sexual orientation and gender identity, as without data on these characteristics, PHE will be unable to conduct comprehensive data analysis with regard to the nation’s health, which forms part of its core responsibilities. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n1\n"
