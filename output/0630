[normal]Written evidence submitted by Professor Anthony Trewavas FRS, FRSE (CLC016)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.This short paper is written by Professor Anthony Trewavas FRS, FRSE, Academia Europea
[normal]. It
[normal] is in response to a request from the Science and Technology committee for information on why the public seem disinclined to go along with its policy on climate change. That assumes its policy is correct, I see a need to be more circumspect. 
[normal]In summary, the following are outlined.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]Unless otherwise stated
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]climate 
[normal]evidence to which I refer is to be found on http://climatedata.info and its various subsections on proxies, ice cores, etc.
[normal] This site provides a scientifically
[normal]-
[normal]balanced introduction to climate data.
[normal]The Difference between Projection and Prediction
[normal]3. 
[normal]That there are problems with 
[normal]the 
[normal]public perception of climate change is not surprising and results from the common confusion between pr
[normal]edictions 
[normal]and pr
[normal]ojections.
[normal]  
[normal]A prediction is a defined future; 
[normal]instead, 
[normal]a projection 
[normal]is 
[normal]what might happen
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is the difference between 
[normal]certainty and 
[normal]possibility. 
[normal]U
[normal]npredictable events, large volcanic eruptions, asteroids can destroy all attempts at pr
[normal]ediction 
[normal]as can changes in technology.  
[normal]4. 
[normal]Hydraulic fracturing 
[normal]is just one 
[normal]instance; its introduction 
[normal]has 
[normal]made nonsense of many predictions
[normal] of fossil fuel 
[normal]limit
[normal]ations of natural 
[normal]gas resources and 
[normal]also 
[normal]inadvertently reduced USA emissions
[normal]*
[normal]. 
[normal]There will be other technologi
[normal]cal advances
[normal]; we are a highly creative species.

[normal]ny scrutiny of the US governments EIA (environmental information administration) would have indicated several centuries worth of technically recoverable reserves of coal, oil or gas].
[normal] 
[normal]5. 
[normal]Climate models can only provide projections, they are not predictions. Confusion between these different words has led to many 
[normal]climat
[normal]e 
[normal]models 
[normal]being presented 
[normal]by government
[normal], NGO’s 
[normal]and some scientists
[normal] 
[normal]as predictions
[normal].
[normal] No doubt those scientists
[normal],
[normal] who did so
[normal],
[normal] were well meaning
[normal]. They admitted sometimes to exaggerating effects to convince the public. But 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]role 
[normal]of science is to provide unbiased
[normal],
[normal] balanced assessments
[normal].
[normal] If the public are told that climate science predicts continual warming then several 
[normal]very 
[normal]cold winters, lead
[normal]s
[normal] to rejection of the 
[normal]claim
[normal].  
[normal]The complexity of climate 
[normal]render
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]predictions 
[normal]impractica
[normal]b
[normal]l
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]and there is 
[normal]need for honesty and transparency about the uncertainties of climate change.
[normal] What was omitted was that climate models 
[normal]at best 
[normal]only offer probabilities
[normal], something it was felt the public would not understand.  
[normal]The essence of science is scepticism.  
[normal]6. 
[normal]Sceptical assessments form the basis of scientific progress. 
[normal]Models are only as good as the information put into them. Questioning climate models is an essential part of progress on understanding.
[normal]7. 
[normal]Those who produced climate models should have been those most vigorous in attacking their own hypotheses and making others aware of their limitations. That is how scientific knowledge expands. Instead as the unfortunate case at the University of East Anglia showed, this group were acting as cheerleaders of their own modelling even to the extent of attempting to d
[normal]amage 
[normal]the credibility of those that questioned what they had published. 
[normal]8. 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he term Denier or Denialist 
[normal]to describe sceptics 
[normal]is indicative of the closed mind and a term of abuse for the scientific process.  It 
[normal]is 
[normal]reminiscent of Galileo’s problem with the inquisition in the 16
[normal]th
[normal] century and politicians of all kinds should have slapped the term down.  
[normal]9. 
[normal]The last IPCC in 2007
[normal] indicated 
[normal]that there were some 20 or so different models
[normal], projecting estimates anywhere from 1.5 to 6
[normal]◦
[normal] C for 
[normal]either 
[normal]2100
[normal] or a doubling of CO
[normal]2 
[normal]levels
[normal]. T
[normal]hat in itself should have
[normal] negated 
[normal]the notion of climate models as predictions
[normal]. It 
[normal]indicate
[normal]s
[normal] climatological uncertainty
[normal].  The
[normal] variety results from different 
[normal]basic 
[normal]assumptions 
[normal]but given there is only one future, 
[normal]only one
[normal] model 
[normal] or none can actually 
[normal]prove 
[normal]right.
[normal] 
[normal]Can climate models be tested or refuted.
[normal]10. 
[normal]Karl Popper laid down some simple criteria of a scientific enterprise. What is proposed must be capable of being tested or refuted.  
[normal]Whereas normal science is experimental and conforms readily with Popper’s description of easy refutation, climatology is reduced to modelling only and 
[normal]thus suffers inevitable uncertainties
[normal] 
[normal]because knowledge is incomplete
[normal]. 
[normal]The extent of ignorance is unknown.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he only way 
[normal]a climate model 
[normal]can be refuted is to compare the projections over suitably long periods of time (15-20 years)  with actual climate observations.  
[normal]If policy is based on models
[normal],
[normal] as is the case
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]there is a large inherent risk that after 20 years the policy will have been seen to be wrong because the model was inaccurate
[normal].
[normal] Is this not now 
[normal]beginning to be 
[normal]the case?
[normal]11. 
[normal]All the models proposed in the late 90’s and early noughties have so far proved poor predictors of climate temperature variation and I refer to the apparent stasis in temperature from 1998 onwards. 
[normal]A similar period 
[normal]of
[normal] stasis occurred in the 1940’s and in both cases atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] continued to climb. 
[normal]If this coming year continues
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as the previous 12-14
[normal] years
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]then the 95% 
[normal]confidence level 
[normal]around the current common mean 
[normal]projected 
[normal]climate temperature
[normal],
[normal] will have been breached
[normal] (
[normal]E. 
[normal]Hawkins. 
[normal]www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2013/updated-comparison-of-simulations-and-observations
[normal])
[normal].  
[normal][A breach of the 95% confidence level  indicates a probability of less than 1 in 20 and is usually used in all areas of statistics to indicate 
[normal]high significance
[normal]].
[normal]When politicians were urged to act by some scientists, none of the climate models generated at this time included a period of stasis. 
[normal]All 
[normal]should have been more circumspect.
[normal]12. 
[normal]The apparent stasis indicates that there are aspects to the climate which modellers have not taken into account
[normal] because they are not un
[normal]d
[normal]erstood
[normal]. N
[normal]atural variation 
[normal]is 
[normal]one 
[normal]ascribed reason 
[normal]and 
[normal]something
[normal] 
[normal]studiously ignored 
[normal]20 years ago 
[normal]when mankind was blamed for any change of climate.  I know of no unambiguous way in which natural variation, whatever it is, can ever be distinguished from mankind’s contribution.  Even if the climate temperature had 
[normal]varied as models indicated 
[normal]for 
[normal]a decade or more 
[normal]that does not indicate it is correct
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Correlations are not proof. 
[normal]13. 
[normal]The climate temperature can do one of three things; go up, down or stay the same. Given the error
[normal]s
[normal] in modelling it seems to me that modellers have a 1 in 3 chance of being approximately right. If the projected temperature is 
[normal]increasing 
[normal]slightly faster or slower but 
[normal]similar to 
[normal]the 
[normal]general 
[normal]direction
[normal],
[normal] I get the impression most modellers would consider they were justified in their claims. But even with these three categories
[normal],
[normal] the current set of models have failed because the temperature 
[normal]is
[normal],
[normal] at present
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]approximately 
[normal]constant so they have failed 
[normal]on a 1 in 3 chance. 
[normal]14. 
[normal]The reaction by some 
[normal]scientists 
[normal]to the apparent stasis 
[normal]has been to state that the temperature of the last 20 years is higher than the previous 20 years and therefore 
[normal]climate models and assumptions are correct. 
[normal]The 
[normal]climate 
[normal]temperature has been rising for the last 
[normal]150-
[normal]300 years 
[normal]depending on whose results you look at, 
[normal]so that is hardly a surprising observation
[normal]. 
[normal] Current models are poor predictors 
[normal]and 
[normal]that creates uncertainty for 
[normal]policy 
[normal]decisions.
[normal] 
[normal]15. 
[normal]If 
[normal]climate change is primarily natural
[normal],
[normal] nothing can be done 
[normal]except to adapt. 
[normal] To describe climate change as dangerous is to downgrade our ability to create solutions and is not based on real situation
[normal]s
[normal] given 
[normal]the 
[normal]enormous complexity 
[normal]and difficulty of predicting any future 
[normal]world 
[normal]situation.
[normal] 
[normal]Misleading ‘hockey sticks’.
[normal]16. 
[normal]The original 
[normal]‘
[normal]hoc
[normal]key 
[normal]stic
[normal]k’ graph of climate change 
[normal]was generated by Professor Michael 
[normal]M
[normal]ann at 
[normal]Pennsylvania State University. The graph figure
[normal]d
[normal] strongly in the IPCC 2000
[normal],
[normal] notably on the cover and 
[normal]five times 
[normal]elsewhere in the report but 
[normal]it 
[normal]is an artifice.  What was not made clear at the time is that the 
[normal]flat part of the graph is a temperature proxy (dendrochronology) whereas the increasing part that was grafted on 
[normal]to it 
[normal]is actual temperature measurements.  
[normal]Tree rings are formed by the activities of the dividing cells of the cambium
[normal],
[normal] a kind of inner sheath
[normal],
[normal]  that generates new phloem to the inside and new xylem to the outside of the cambium.  
[normal]Tree rings are part of the process of plant development in large woody dicotyledonous angiosperms. Because it is development
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the size of the tree ring is determined by everything that affects 
[normal]all aspects of 
[normal]plant development. Th
[normal]ese are : 
[normal]soil nutrients
[normal] and structure;
[normal] light
[normal] variations;
[normal] 
[normal]carbon dioxide
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]competition from other trees
[normal];
[normal] disease
[normal];
[normal] predators
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]age
[normal];
[normal] rainfall
[normal]; previous developmental activity 
[normal]as well as temperature. 
[normal] T
[normal]emperature
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for which it supposedly acts as a proxy
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is just one 
[normal]contributor 
[normal]amongst many
[normal] and of course reflects local conditions only
[normal]. Mann
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]‘H
[normal]ockey 
[normal]S
[normal]tick
[normal]’
[normal] failed to register the historical variation of warm medieval period when Greenland was actually green 
[normal]and 
[normal]the little ice age that dominated 
[normal]in the years 
[normal]1600-1700
[normal]s
[normal]. Greenland was abandoned in the late 1400’s
[normal] as temperatures declined
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Tree rings on their
[normal] 
[normal]own are 
[normal]not a
[normal] reliable 
[normal]proxy and examination of tree ring
[normal]s from trees from numerous sites
[normal] indicates inco
[normal]nsistencies. Stable isotope analysis of tree rings may be more useful. 
[normal]Policy 
[normal]was probably influenced by this uncertain information.
[normal]The conflict of carbon dioxide and temperature.
[normal]17. 
[normal]Paleoclimatic analysis has indicated that CO
[normal]2
[normal] concentrations in the atmosphere have varied enormously
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]in the past 
[normal]up to ten fold 
[normal]higher than current levels
[normal]. In the Milankovitch cycles, temperature 
[normal]rises 
[normal]precede those of CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]and CO
[normal]2
[normal] lags temperature during the falling phase.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. 
[normal]Atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]levels 
[normal]deduced from ice cores 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] been rising since 1750
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat 
[normal]observation is puzzling 
[normal]for the popular view
[normal],
[normal] that all CO
[normal]2
[normal] results from anthropogenic sources. The world population 
[normal]then 
[normal]was about a tenth of that today, 
[normal]fossil fuel use 
[normal]was largely limited to the UK and photosynthesis 
[normal]and the oceans 
[normal]should have sequestered any increase.  
[normal]The increase 
[normal]in CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]in the 1800s 
[normal]is ascribed to 
[normal]massive 
[normal]forest clearing
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]supposedly reducing photosynthetic area, 
[normal]and 
[normal]increased use of wood for fuel
[normal].  
[normal]Even so there is no simple relation 
[normal]with population 
[normal]here. 
[normal]Subsequent industrialisation and 
[normal]fossil fuel use 
[normal]has left its isotopic mark in the atmosphere

[normal]From 1880 onwards
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]direct 
[normal]measurements showed 
[normal]ocean surface temperatures declined 
[normal]for about 20 years 
[normal]and then have 
[normal]risen

[normal],
[normal] a century 
[normal]is 
[normal]a 
[normal]short 
[normal]time 
[normal]in climate terms
[normal].  But the solubility of carbon dioxide in water is temperature dependent
[normal],
[normal] so as global temperatures have risen
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it is likely that 
[normal]less 
[normal]atmospheric 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] will be absorbed and more dissolved CO
[normal]2
[normal] will be released.  This then gives rise to the question of whether it is CO
[normal]2
[normal] that causes temperature increases
[normal],
[normal] or temperature increases give rise to elevated atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]a mixture of 
[normal]both.

[normal]Their 
[normal]exacting analysis 
[normal]has 
[normal]turned 
[normal]climate models on their head.  These analyses 
[normal]indicate 
[normal]that temperature 
[normal]increases

[normal],
[normal] followed by atmospheric tempe
[normal]rature 
[normal]and 
[normal]then 
[normal]nearly a

[normal]. 
[normal] I quote
[normal] to indicate
[normal] their conclusions.
[normal] 
[normal]“As cause always must precede effect, this observation demonstrates
[normal] 
[normal]that modern changes in temperatures are generally not induced by changes in atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal]. Indeed, the sequence of events is seen to be the opposite: temperature changes are taking
[normal] 
[normal]place before the corresponding CO
[normal]2
[normal] changes occur”.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]O
[normal]ur 
[normal]figures 
[normal]2–8
[normal] 
[normal]reveal that the common notion of globally dominant temperature
[normal] 
[normal]controls exercised by atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] is in need of 
[normal]reassessment.
[normal] 
[normal]Empirical observations indicate that changes in temperature generally
[normal] 
[normal]are driving changes in atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal], and not the other way
[normal] around”. “O
[normal]ur analysis suggests that changes in atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] appear to occur largely independently of changes in anthropogene
[normal] 
[normal]emissions. However, by this we have not demonstrated that CO
[normal]2
[normal] released by burning fossil fuels is without influence on the amount of atmospheric CO2, but merely that the effect is small compared to the effect of other processes”.  
[normal]The conclusion of these authors is that the present high period of solar activity since 1920 may be responsible for the changes detected in atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]While their analysis will no doubt be further examined
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]particu
[normal]larly 
[normal]by those with a vested inter
[normal]e
[normal]st in the 
[normal]status quo
[normal], 
[normal]these observations indicate why no government should have legislated on anthropogene emissions because the situation does not have the certainty originally claimed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]There is no 
[normal]direct 
[normal]relationship between 
[normal]rising 
[normal]atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] and global temperature
[normal],
[normal] as the temperature stasis periods 
[normal]during the 40’s a
[normal]s well as from 
[normal]1998
[normal] 
[normal]onwards 
[normal]indicate
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]However all models seemed to have assumed that rising CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]must 
[normal]drive temperature
[normal] increases 
[normal],
[normal] ever since Arrhenius identified the potential for CO
[normal]2
[normal] as a greenhouse gas over 100 years ago.  The paper by 
[normal]Professor 
[normal]Humlum 
[normal] and others 
[normal]is salutary 
[normal]in 
[normal]that things are no
[normal]t
[normal] always what they seem.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]I feel very strongly that legislation on climate change should not have been 
[normal]enacted
[normal]. Climate science is young and there is a deal of uncertainty in its claims. Legislation has propelled us on a path which is difficult to retreat from but is going to inflict real damage on our economic activity and wealth because we are going to make 
[normal]our 
[normal]electricity
[normal],
[normal] the life blood of all economic activi
[normal]ty,
[normal] the most expensive world
[normal]-
[normal]wide.
[normal] No doubt the gesture of reducing emissions was consider
[normal]ed
[normal] nob
[normal]le
[normal] but it has now turned into the ultimate gest
[normal]ure 
[normal]politics beca
[normal]use 
[normal]no one else in the wor

[normal]This policy will merely accelerate the decline of the UK and Europe.

[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal]re is the 
[normal]claim by developing countries that western industry and society is guilty of the present state of atmospheric GHG.  
[normal]The 
[normal]W
[normal]est may have accounted for much atmospheric  GHG but good use has been made by inventing 
[normal]mobile phones, tarmacked roads, railways, aeroplanes, the internet, computers, trains, modern agriculture and food abundance, modern transport, electricity and use of gas, metallurgy, books, science, antibiotics

[normal],
[normal] despite the UK being at the forefront of nuclear technologies in the past. There’s enough uranium in the oceans to last for millions of years. The

[normal]Much is made of the supposed consensus on climate change but this was init
[normal]i
[normal]ated by Arrhenius
[normal] who identified CO
[normal]2
[normal] as a GHG and 
[normal]who calculated 
[normal]that 
[normal]a 
[normal]doubling of CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]would increase 
[normal]global temperature by 
[normal]2◦
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal], a value little different from most models
[normal]. But Arrhenius
[normal]’
[normal] kn
[normal]owledge of climate was limited and a major failing was not to include the negative feedback of clouds
[normal] although he recognised the effect of water vapour on temperature
[normal].

[normal]Since that time
[normal],
[normal] c
[normal]limate scientists of all 
[normal]kinds 
[normal]tend not 
[normal]to think outside this box and 
[normal]are constrained to

[normal] There is enough discrepancy to indicate that a reassessment

[normal]iscarding Arrhenius

[normal] For example, car speed is a simple interactive system and most would intuitively identify the accelerator as the speed control. But changing down, brakes, going up or down hill etc., all contribute to speed, indicating the accelerator is not the simple control implied.
