default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKent has 449 primary schools, of which 55 are academies (40 are new sponsored academies and 15 are stand-alone converter ac
defaultademies, not part of a chain)
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are currently 67 secondary academies (including 3 Free Schools), equivalent two thirds of secondary schools in Kent. 15 of these are traditional sponsored academies (sustained under-performance in areas of disadvantage).  Five are new sponsored acade
defaultmies (following an Ofsted judgement putting them in Category).  The remaining 47 are converter academies, whose performance was judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding at the time of conversion.   
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIrrespective of whether academies were sponsored or co
defaultnverter, Kent has not seen a narrowing of the achievement gap for FSM children, compared to maintained schools, either at primary or secondary level. The FSM gap for academies is equal to maintained primary schools.
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAcademies and Free Schools, through Ken
defaultt School Collaborative Partnerships are encouraged to work with neighbouring schools and

defaultcolleagues to get the most out of the pupil premium to narrow the achievement gap.  
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith the support of the LA, Kent schools and their Collabora
defaulttive Partnerships (of which there are 60 involving 500 schools) are now intensively focusing on narrowing the gap for vulnerable groups.  The LA expects academies to focus on (in the same way as LA maintained school colleagues), ensuring that vulnerable gr

default autumn term round of Headteacher Briefings (to which all category of schools are invited) by the Corporate

defaulteffectively to narrow the achievement gaps.  
default&#xa0;
default1.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCC’s weekly E-Bulletin for all schools on 28 November 2013, focused on closing the gap and provided information on effective strategies. KCC is developing a range of good practice case studies in partnership 
defaultwith a number of the schools that are having the biggest impact on this key issue, and with the help of some schools we are also developing a staff development programme to support the adoption of the most effective practices. We will launch this work in F
defaultebruary 2014. 
default&#xa0;
default1.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere seems to be limited evidence that academies per se are having a
default 
defaultgreater impact on narrowing gaps and improving outcomes for disadvantaged pupils. Individual schools make more or less of a difference depending on the quality 
defaultof
default teaching and other intervention strategies to improve outcomes. 
defaultResearch from Machin and Silva (
defaultSchool Structure, School Autonomy and the Tail, Centre for Economic Performance Special Paper No. 29, LSE, 2013
default), suggest that academies had not yet helped low
default attaining pupils.  
defaultThis paper shows that improved attainment centres on higher attainers. It also cites research 
default(Wilson, J (2011) Are England’s Academies more Inclusive or More ‘Exclusive’? The Impact of Institutional Change on the Pupil Profile of Schoo
defaultls. CEE Discussion Paper 125)
default which shows a 12.5% reduction in pupils on free school meals, attending (traditional sponsored) academies compared with the schools they replaced. 
default&#xa0;
default1.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore widely in terms of overall pupil achievement, recent research has found that there is no direct correlation between being an academy and improved attainment levels, reflected in Ofsted judgements.  The critical characteristic to raising attainment in 
defaulta school is the individual capacity of the school leadership. Many sponsored academies are improving the quality of education and pupil outcomes, as they have often replaced very poorly performing schools.  
default&#xa0;
default1.10.

defaultQdefaultuestion 2defaultThe process for approving, compelling and defaultestablishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsorsdefault&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKent LA has developed a good working relationship with the DfE in managing the conversion of schools that wish to become academies and in making arrangements for some schools 
defaultto be sponsored as academies as a result of poor performance or an inadequate inspection judgement. The LA is now helpfully at a point where 
defaultwe are
default identifying local sponsors for Kent schools that require an academy solution. At the same time the LA has a 
defaultgood working relationship with some, but not all, academy chains that sponsor academies in Kent. It is disappointing that some chains do not respond to our invitation to work more closely together or to offers to help academy chain schools that are still s
defaulttruggling to improve. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of what’s not always working well, we would cite the following issues. The proposed sponsor sometimes makes considerable extra demands upon 
defaultthe LA and its financial and capital resources towards the end of the process 
defaultof
default tr
defaultansfer of a school to an academy chain. 
defaultThis slows down, and can hinder
default the conversion process and can interfere with the urgent school improvement work required.  
defaultThe issuing of an Academy Order can therefore be significantly delayed. In one instance the 
defaultsponsor pulled out at the very end of the process, leaving the school and the local authority without a solution. Sponsors need to be better at due diligence and be committed from the outset.  Considerable public resource and LA Officer time is expended un
defaultnecessarily waiting for sponsors to decide to proceed with their initial interest. The LA is concerned about the lack of engagement at the earliest opportunity regarding new Free School proposals.  As the strategic commissioner of new school provision, the
default LA would welcome early involvement in free school proposals to create new pupil provision in areas of evidenced need.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt present we have five Free Schools open in Kent.  All are in areas of socio-economic advantage, rather than growing diversity and 
defaultchoice in disadvantaged areas of need.  There appears to be ‘middle class capture’ of the Free Schools process, in order to create new capacity in areas that do not necessarily need school places.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefaultuestion 3defaultThe role of the Secretary of State in intervenidefaultng in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expandsdefault&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is concern about the oversight by the DfE of under-performing and failing academies. The issuing of a warning notice is a limited form of interventio
defaultn and support. In Kent, failing academies do not appear to be being turned around as fast as they should be when they are continuing to perform poorly.  For example, in 2005 a failing secondary high school, in area of socio-economic disadvantage was conver
defaultted to a traditional sponsored academy.  Since that time, it has been the subject of an Ofsted Category twice and to date, the principal sponsor remains and the Academy Trust do not appear to have been transparently held to account by the Secretary of Stat
defaulte.  No Warning Notice has been served on this Academy Trust to date.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefaultuestion 4defaultThe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individudefaultal schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this leveldefault&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKent County Council plays a strong role in school improvement, continues to relate and work with all schools irrespective of their status and monitors the outcomes for children and young people being educated in the county. Where academy schools are under-
defaultperforming and need to improve at a faster rate we offer support. A good number of academies buy back the services of the local authority. We continue to relate to all schools in carrying out our responsibilities for admissions, SEN, exclusions and the com
defaultmissioning of new school places. We recognise the need for the LA as a strong ‘Middle Tier’ between all schools and the Secretary of State.  We would like more opportunity to hold under-performing academies to account for the outcomes they are achieving fo
defaultr Kent children and families. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt present KCC is unclear how the LA can be held to account for the performance of academies beyond outlining our concerns to the trusts and governing bodies concerned, and to the Secretary of State. This is unsatisfactory. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCC has no powers or funding to tackle underperformance in academies, nonetheless as an LA, we have been inviting academies and free schools to work with the family of Kent schools through the 60 School Collaborative Partnerships established since 2012 t
defaulto create a sustainable, self-improving school system. This is working well and many academy schools are supporting other schools to improve. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAround two thirds of all academies nationally now are converter academies (
defaulti.e.
default good or outstanding schools). KCC
default expects these high performing academies to commit to supporting under-performing neighbouring schools, and while most schools respond well, KCC would welcome support to persuade government to make this requirement a more robust obligatory component in the
default funding agreement when schools convert to academies. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to support academies and monitor their outcomes, Kent School Improvement Service offers all academies two consultation visits per year. Most schools take up this offer with some paying for ad
defaultditional commissioned school improvement support.  
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhere an academy is experiencing difficulties and improvement is not evident, the LA writes to the Principal and the Academy Trust outlining our concerns and support we are able to provide.  If there is no positive response, KCC alerts Ofsted and the Secre
defaulttary of State. 
default&#xa0;
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKent County Council has continued to play a strong role in education as the middle tier. There is a strong shared vision with schools and close partnership with schools. We see this as essential for improving educational outcomes and the q
defaultuality of schools, as well as for the integration of children’s services. We see the potential atomisation and fragmentation of the education system as a serious risk to delivering joined up early intervention and prevention services for vulnerable childre
defaultn and young people, and to making the best local strategic arrangements for pupils with special educational needs and those excluded from school.

defaultEducation Analysis for the OECD, in a report published on 13 September 2011, ‘Education at a Glance’)
default4.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the big
defaultgest challenges
default in 
defaultthe current
default school system is that 
defaultLAs
default are
default legally
default responsible for the education
default performance
default of all children, but have pow
defaulter
defaults
default to intervene locally in 
defaultmaintained schools only. There is no organisational regional structure to relate to about 
defaultfailing academies and free schools
default, apart from the D
defaultf
defaultE
default,
default and individual trusts that may themselves be lacking capacity to support the neces
defaultsary improvements. The DfE does not respond constructively when the LA expresses concern about the performance of some academies. 
default4.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCC supports the 
defaultL
defaultGA in its call for LAs to be empowered to intervene early in struggling schools regardless of whether they 
defaultare academies or local authority-maintained schools:
default 
default              
default"Councils are restlessly ambitious for all children in their local area whatever type of school they attend but have to jump through many hoops before they are allowed to intervene where there are sign
defaults of failure. As Ofsted increases its inspection of councils' role in improving education, councils need a free hand to intervene early in struggling schools and to reassure mums and dads that their child's one chance at education will give them the best s
defaulttart in life."
default              
default(Cllr. David Simmonds, Chairman of LGA's Children and Young People Board, 13 November 2013)
default&#xa0;
default4.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBut to do this LAs need to remain sustainable in their capacity to support school improvement.  Shifts in education policy, power, accountability 
defaultand funding are increasing
defaultly
default making it more difficult to maintain the capacity of some Councils to fulfil the statutory duty of ensuring the best possible education for all children in an area, irrespective of the type of school they attend.
default&#xa0;
default4.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCC believes 
defaultit is not timely to be designing unnecessary new regional bureaucracies to ensure proper oversight of the academy school system, about which there is little detail so far to provide the future proofing that is needed to secure high standards and continuous
default 
defaultimprovement in
default all academies and free schools. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefaultuestion 5defaultWhat role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangementsdefault&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAcademy chains are a 
defaultsignificant player but they are a small part of the education landscape and there are questions about their capacity and track record in bringing about the necessary improvements in poorly performing academies. Some are very successful, some not. It appear
defaults that some academy chains have been allowed to grow without sufficient regard to the quality of the provision they offer.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of accountability, chains are accountable to their Trust and then the Secretary of State.  There is no local democratic acc
defaultountability, and this lack of transparency and accountability should be addressed.
default There is a need for a proper strategic relationship between the LA as commissioner and the major academy providers (whether national chains or more local groupings
default). This is
default something the LA seeks to achieve on the ground, but the current policy framework is not especially supportive of it.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe recent announcement by Lord Nash, stating that academy chains will be inspected by Ofsted in the future is welcome, as long as judgements are made about their local impact and their level of accountability to the community they serve.   
default&#xa0;defaultQdefaultuestion 6defaultThdefaulte appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a wholedefault&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKent is experiencing slow progress in respect of primary academy conversions. Few primary schools are attracted to academy status. In November 2013, there were 55 Kent primary 
defaulta
defaultcademies out of 449 primary schools (12%).  Of the 55 primary 
defaulta
defaultcademies, 15 are
default stand-alone conversions but the other 40 are sponsored 
defaulta
defaultcademies, consequent upon low performance and inadequate Ofsted Inspection judgements.  
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a further 20 schools with an Academy Order pending, with conversion likely to take place between De
defaultcember 2013 and May 2014. Some of these are church schools and will join diocesan multi-academy trusts, and some are under-performing schools. 
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEast Kent has the highest number of primary 
defaulta
defaultcademies with 23 schools, compared to West Kent which has 8 primar
defaulty 
defaulta
defaultcademies. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe rush to convert to academy status may be over as the financial gains have diminished. Schools are pragmatic. A survey in 2012 conducted by the Schools Network found that 78% had converted in part because they believed they would be bette
defaultr off financially.  
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSchools are primarily focused on what can help them raise attainment. Some may judge that acquiring academy status supports this endeavour. Others schools may procure valuable services from the LA and use the LA’s collaborative struct
defaultures to secure support for teaching and learning and school improvement. In Kent, local soft and hard federations of schools have often been preferred by school governing bodies as 
defaulta more effective
default route to school improvement, rather than through securing 
defaultacademy status.  The Kent family of schools offers local flexibility, knowledge and expertise about what works, compared to a distant academy chain or central government support and control.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefaultuestion 7defaultWhat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools default&#xa0;default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn some cases, where radical improvement and re-organisation are needed to respond to a history of failure and under-performance an academy sponsor solution
default is appropriate, where it will bring significant additional capacity for improvement. KCC supports these solutions and values the opportunity to work with sponsors to bring these structural solutions to fruition, and have an on-going working relationship. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn other cases however, we have been able to broker a quicker solution for improvement by developing a hard federation with an outstanding local school or by brokering a soft federation, established through the Kent School Collaborative Partnerships who kn
defaultow each other’s capabilities and trust each other. In these cases we seek stronger and sometimes new school leadership and more effective governance, which often achieves a very quick turnaround and 
defaulta 
defaultsustainable upward trend in a school’s performance.  
default&#xa0;
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKCC prefers a more mixed approach with some flexibility. Often it seems the D
defaultf
defaultE is only inte
defaultrested in one kind of solution.
