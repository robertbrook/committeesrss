[normal]National Association of Local Councils [bold]– Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. I am writing in response with written evidence to the Parliamentary Joint Committee for the Draft De-regulation Bill’s Call for Written Evidence on the Draft De-regulation Bill on behalf of the National Association of Local Councils (NALC).
[normal]2. As you know, 
[normal]the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) is the nationally recognised membership and support organisation representing the interests of around 9,000 parish councils and many parish meetings in England.
[normal]3. The parish councils and parish meetings we support and represent serve electorates ranging from small rural communities to major cities, and raise a precept from the local community. Together, they can be identified as among the nation’s most influential grouping of grassroots opinion-formers. Over 15 million people live in communities served by our parish councils, around 
[normal]35%
[normal] of the population, whilst over 200 new parish councils have been created in the last 10 years.
[normal]4. Parish councils and parish meetings work towards improving community well-being and providing better services at a local level. Their work falls into three main categories:
[normal]5. Through a range of powers, parish councils provide and maintain a variety of important and visible local services including allotments, bridleways, burial grounds, bus shelters, car parks, commons, community transport schemes, crime reduction measures, footpaths, leisure facilities, local youth projects, open spaces, public lavatories, planning, street cleaning, street lighting, tourism activities, traffic calming measures, village greens and litter bins. 
[normal]6. NALC provides support and advice directly to our member councils through a network of county associations. Working with and for our member councils, we are actively involved in working with, and influencing, Government and other bodies at a national level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Chief Executive of the National Association would be happy to attend any Oral Evidence session of the Committee for this Inquiry, as and if appropriate.[bold]  Below (from Paragraph 8 on) – are the National Association’s answers to the 23 main consultation questions under the four identified Bill themes.  Appropriate responses received by the National Association from the local councils’ sector have been included at the Annex to this submission.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. [bold]General[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question One[bold] 
[normal]The draft Bill covers a broad range of specific activities and a large amount of legislative provision is amended by it. Could the same result have been achieved using existing secondary legislative procedures?  [bold]Not to the National Association’s knowledge. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.[bold] 
[normal]Question Two[bold]  
[normal]What are the advantages and disadvantages of including specific deregulatory provisions amending existing legislation and providing additional or amended order making powers within primary legislation rather than considering them through existing deregulatory mechanisms?[bold]  Advantage – it is possible to make deeper-cutting legislative changes this way.  Disadvantage – it obviously takes longer to get rid of out-
[normal]moded
[normal] legislation this way.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]10. [bold]Question [bold]Three[bold]  [bold]Are[bold] the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account?  [bold]Yes, the changes proposed in the draft Bill are evidence-based and all risks associated with the changes have been adequately taken into account.
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]11.[bold] 
[normal]Question Four[bold] [bold]Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, [bold]organisations[bold] and individuals effectively and fairly[bold]?[bold]  [bold]Yes, it does.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.[bold] 
[normal]Question Five[bold] 
[normal]Will the draft Bill generally benefit businesses by offsetting other regulatory burdens? Are there indirect impacts on other businesses from reducing regulation in specific sectors?  [bold]Yes, the Bill will generally benefit businesses by offsetting regulatory burdens.  No – there are 
[normal]no
[normal] indirect impacts on other businesses from reducing regulation in specific sectors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.[bold] 
[normal]Question Six[bold]  [bold] 
[normal]To[bold] what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses?  [bold]The Bill benefits consumers as well businesses – apparently equally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.[bold] 
[normal]Question [bold]Seven[bold]  
[normal]How[bold] does the provision in the draft Bill affect: [bold]&#xa0;[bold]i[bold]. protections afforded to individuals under human rights and equalities legislation? [bold]ii[bold]. employment law, skills and the labour market? [bold]iii[bold]. the environment, particularly in the management of waste? [bold]iv. [bold]the[bold] provision of education? [bold]v[bold]. the effective administration of justice? [bold]vi. [bold]social[bold], wellbeing or health inequalities? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The National Association believes that the provision in the draft Bill does not deleteriously affect any of the above mentioned criteria, to its knowledge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. [bold]Question Eight[bold] [bold]Have the measures set out in the draft Bill been subject to adequate cost-benefit analysis on the basis of consultation with those affected?  [bold]Yes – we believe so – but maximum consultation with those effected needs to be continued between now and the time the Bill goes through Parliament next year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. [bold]Question Nine[bold] [bold]Will[bold] any or all of the proposals have any significant economic or financial impact? Do you have any evidence of the impact that will aid the Committee in their scrutiny?  [bold]Yes,
[normal] and yes.  The National Association is particularly supportive of the below proposals contained in the Bill;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]17. [bold] [bold]Power to [bold]Dis[bold]-apply Legislation No Longer Of Practical Use[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question Ten[bold] 
[normal]Is a new “power to [bold]dis[bold]-apply legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?” [bold](Clause 51)?[bold]  [bold]Yes – a new power to 
[normal]dis
[normal]-apply legislation no longer of practical use is necessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. [bold]Question Eleven[bold] [bold]Is[bold] the meaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear? In this context, what is meant by “practical”? [bold]Should it be defined and, if so, how?[bold] Will removing any of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation?  [bold]Yes, it is.  In this sense, the term ‘practical’ simply means something which has no current relevance on-the-ground.  Yes, it 
[normal]should be defined – in the way just described.  No - removing some of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill will have 
[normal]no  implications
[normal] for any other areas of regulation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19. [bold]Question Twelve[bold] [bold]Are the safeguards regarding the use of the “no longer of practical use” power (set out in Clauses 54 to 56) adequate and appropriate?  [bold]Yes, they are.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. [bold]Question Thirteen [bold]Other deregulatory mechanisms such as Legislative Reform Orders or Public Bodies Orders have specific tests set out in the parent Act - should there be similar tests set out in the draft Bill? What should they be?  [bold]No – this is not necessary in our view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. [bold]Question Fourteen[bold] [bold]Are[bold] the mechanisms set out for parliamentary oversight (Clauses 55 and 56) of deregulation orders adequate and appropriate?  [bold]Yes, they are.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]22. [bold]Question [bold]Fifteen[bold]  Are[bold] there other changes to deregulatory powers, procedures and parliamentary oversight which you think should have been included in the Bill and, if so, why?[bold]  No – the current changes suggested in the Bill are adequate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23. [bold]Question Sixteen[bold] [bold]What[bold] are the risks associated with the proposed new power to [bold]dis[bold]-apply legislation that is “no longer of practical use”?  [bold]There does need to be a check in there to consult before Government determines what 
[normal]am outmoded piece of legislation
[normal] might be.  Henry VIII legislation abounds at present.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24. [bold]A Duty [bold]To[bold] Have Regard To The Desirability Of Promoting Economic Growth [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question Seventeen[bold] [bold]To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary?  [bold]Yes – this legislation is necessary.  The Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators do not 
[normal]sufficiently  provide
[normal] the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.[bold]  
[normal]Question Eighteen[bold]  [bold] 
[normal]Will the introduction of a duty to have regard to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator?  [bold]No.  No additional safeguards are needed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.[bold]  
[normal]Question Nineteen [bold]How[bold] is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied?[bold]  Negligibly – regulators will simply have to be flexible and apply the duty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27. [bold]Question Twenty [bold]Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences?  [bold]There can only be beneficial effects during an austerity crisis, with straitened public monies available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28. [bold]Question Twenty One[bold] [bold]How[bold] might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained?  [bold]This needs to be determined by the Committee, but the National Association would support the principle of measurement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29. [bold]Question Twenty Two[bold] 
[normal]How[bold] can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? [bold]Regulators themselves will need to be consulted on this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.  [bold]Devolution[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question Twenty Three[bold] What are the consequences of the draft Bill for the devolved administrations?  There are no consequences for the devolved administrations of the draft Bill of which the National Association is aware. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The National Association hopes this submission is of use and interest to the Committee.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Annex[bold] – Responses From The Local Councils’ Sector To The National Association Regarding The Joint Committee’s Call For Evidence On The Draft De-regulation Bill[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Respondent[bold]Comments[bold]Ashover[bold] Parish Council[bold]I list below the current situation relating to claims on rights of way within the parish:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A total of 12 applications have been submitted to Derbyshire County Council under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to add non-classified highways, bridleways and footpaths to the Definitive Map and Statement as a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT).  
[normal]Ashover
[normal] Parish Council has lodged strong objections to each application received for consultation.  Application locations (and decisions made to date by DCC) are shown below:-

[normal]2.  Non-classified highway at 
[normal]Nuttingfield
[normal] Farm, 
[normal]Littlemoor
[normal] - BOAT rejected and an Order made and advertised adding it to the definitive map as a bridleway – no objections were received and 
[normal]this route has now been confirmed as a bridleway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Footpath 146 
[normal]Holestone
[normal] Gate Rd to Overton Rd - BOAT rejected and footpath status to remain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Bridleway 140 Vernon Lane, 
[normal]Kelstedge
[normal] - BOAT rejected and Bridleway status to remain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Non-classified highway at Marsh Green – An Order adding it to the definitive map as a BOAT has been confirmed.[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Bedfordshire Association of Town and Parish Councils[bold]Although BATPC accepts that there is legislation which is no longer of practical use and acknowledges the benefit of some provisions within the draft De-Regulation Bill it does not believe that a Minister should have the power to repeal or revoke such legislation without consultation with local and/or other appropriate authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Experience has shown that decisions taken centrally can sometimes have unintended consequences at local level. For example - the Localism Act abolished the Standards Board regime, including the dispensation to discuss setting a precept embedded in the 2007 Model Code of Conduct. An unintended consequence of this was that some advised parish and town councillors they would need a dispensation to set a precept for their own area; others thought not. Brandon Lewis MP was obliged to write to all Local Authority Leaders explaining that the Government had intentionally sought to move to a lighter touch regime which focused on openness and transparency and that in his opinion such dispensations were unnecessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To prevent unintended consequences a Minister should not have the power to repeal or revoke any legislation unless the local or other appropriate authority has been consulted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BATPC acknowledges the importance of economic growth but believes that the duty on persons exercising certain regulatory functions to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth should also require them to have regard to local community interests. For example trading restrictions on out-of-town retail sites are still needed if Town Centres are to remain vibrant.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Stewkley[bold] Parish Council[bold]Stewkley
[normal] Parish Council discussed the circular at its meeting on September 2 and confirmed its support for paragraphs 12 (Recorded rights of way: additional protection); 13 (Unrecorded rights of way: protection from extinguishment); and 34 (Exhibition of films in community premises). Such clauses would benefit our community, as we enjoy extensive access to the countryside over farmland in particular, and have a vibrant village hall that occasionally shows films to packed audiences.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Warwickshire and West Midlands Association of Local Councils[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]With the Government's continuing ability to decide what is the most important line in terms of economic growth i.e. the one that suits them, any phrase that decides what "is no longer of any practical use”, is fraught with future problems and should not be supported until it is decided who will make the recommendation to the Minister. Once that is resolved we would tend to agree with NALC's view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With regard to economic growth:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] small town councils should always strive to promote local economies to ensure the economic well being of the town so would support the general premise. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would also support the ability to show films in Village Halls etc. with little restriction as people who live in rural areas cannot always get to a cinema to see the latest films.
