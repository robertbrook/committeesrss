[normal]Disabled people’s 
[normal]voice
[normal], participation
[normal] and 
[normal]empowerment 
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a growing recognition of the need for approaches to development which are 
[normal]more inclusive of disability issues and disabled
[normal] people
[normal] (DP)
[normal], as reflected 
[normal]by
[normal] the Post-2015 ‘Leave no one behind’ agenda, and
[normal] by
[normal] this Parliamentary Inquiry. 
[normal]This submission does not seek to repeat the arguments for disability inclusion, but instead
[normal] 
[normal]focuses on the importance of voice, participation and e
[normal]mpowerment in achieving development processes which are more inclusive of 
[normal]DP
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The right to participation is explicit in international law through several conventions, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). 
[normal]Partic
[normal]ipation/voice are
[normal] also a key strateg
[normal]ies
[normal] for making development efforts 
[normal]more effective in reaching the poorest and
[normal] most marginalised in societies, and they depend on and feed in to empowerment processes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID 
[normal]has actively supported the voice and participa
[normal]tion of 
[normal]DP
[normal] in the post-2015 process. This approach now needs to be scaled up and institutionalised within DFID at all levels, both to strengthen disability inclusion in DFID’s work, as well as to influence other development actors and 
[normal]processes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We therefore urge DFID to ensure that the voice, participation and empowerment of 
[normal]DP
[normal] is promoted systematically across all its programmes and partnerships through:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Accountability and funding mechanisms which include a requirement to engage with 
[normal]DP
[normal] in all c
[normal]onsultation, participation and accountability processes.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providing country programmes and implementation partners with the support and resources needed to become effecting in engaging with 
[normal]DP.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Funding and other support to initiatives/channels for the voice
[normal], participation and empowerment of 
[normal]DP
[normal], such as DPOs. 
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 1985 
[normal]ADD International 
[normal]has worked with 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s Organisations (DPOs) in Africa and Asia
[normal], from grassroots to national level, 
[normal]to strengthen their capacity to bring improvements to the 
[normal]lives of their members, and to advocate for the inclusion of 
[normal]DP
[normal] in all aspects of political, social and economic life. Drawing on this direct experience we work as an ally to the disability movement in influencing development policy and practice
[normal] at all lev
[normal]els t
[normal]o become more inclusive of 
[normal]DP
[normal] and disability issues.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DP[bold]’s p[bold]articipation [bold]in development [bold]is a [bold]right: [bold]The 
[normal]UN Convention on the Rights of 
[normal]Persons with Disabilities
[normal] 
[normal](UNCRPD)[bold] is clear on the 
[normal]right of 
[normal]DP
[normal] to full and effective participation and inclusion in society (Article 3 – General Principles), their right to participate 
[normal]in public affairs, including the work of 
[normal]NGO’s, and the obligation of s
[normal]tates to 
[normal]encourage 
[normal]DP
[normal] to participate and to promote an environment where they can do this ‘
[normal]without discrimination and on an equal basis with others’
[normal] (Article 29)
[normal]. 
[normal]The obligation of the UK government to adhere to these principles in all aspects of internati
[normal]onal cooperation is also clear (Articles 11 and 32).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Development processes are more effective when they are based on the lived experience of [bold]DP[bold]: [bold]The past 2 decades has seen a shift in understanding of disability from a ‘medical model’ to ‘rights based’ approaches which focus on the social and environmental barriers 
[normal]that
[normal] exclude 
[normal]DP
[normal]. 
[normal]B
[normal]y listening to the voices of 
[normal]DP
[normal] themselves (through their active e
[normal]ngagement at all stages of the development process; analysis, policy development, planning, implementation, evaluation), decision
[normal] 
[normal]makers can gain an understanding of the barriers and social dynamics which contribute to their exclusion and limit their oppor
[normal]tunities. Based on these insights it is possible to develop interventions which
[normal] 
[normal]target the cause
[normal]s – rather than just the symptoms -
[normal] of 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s exclusion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Empowerment is a [bold]precondition for[bold] effective participation[bold]… [bold]and greater participation leads to empowerme[bold]nt[bold]: [bold]The disempowerment which 
[normal]DP
[normal] 
[normal]experience 
[normal]as a result of social exclusion
[normal] and discrimination leads to isolation, low levels of education and skills, and low self-esteem. 
[normal]Through interventions which support their
[normal] individual and collective
[normal] engagement 
[normal]in economic, social and political life, 
[normal]DP
[normal] 
[normal]increase their confidence and their status within their communities. This creates the conditions where 
[normal]DP
[normal] can become agents of change 
[normal]in their own lives as well as in the lives of others
[normal] by 
[normal]coming together (throug
[normal]h DPOs and other CSOs) to 
[normal]advocat
[normal]e
[normal] for sustainable social and structural change
[normal], holding duty-bearers to account in
[normal] delivering 
[normal]on their commitments on the righ
[normal]ts of all 
[normal]DP
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increased e[bold]ngagement between disabled and non-[bold]DP[bold] [bold]challenge[bold]s[bold] the assumptions and n[bold]egative attitudes which lie behind discrimination and exclusion:[bold] [bold]When 
[normal]DP
[normal] 
[normal]become active 
[normal]participa
[normal]nts
[normal] in 
[normal]economic, social, cultural and political life, 
[normal]they become more visible 
[normal]in society 
[normal]and engage
[normal] more
[normal] with non-
[normal]DP
[normal]. 
[normal]ADD International
[normal]’s experience
[normal] (examples below) shows how th
[normal]is process of engagement is a critical element in tackling 
[normal]discrimination, changing attitudes, and removing barriers to inclusion
[normal] 
[normal]in all aspects of life. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DP[bold]’s Organisations (DPOs) [bold]- 
[normal]representative
[normal] [bold]organisations ‘of’ 
[normal]DP
[normal] – and
[normal] 
[normal]nat[bold]ional d[bold]i[bold]sability movements[bold] 
[normal]are
[normal] a
[normal] key channel for the individual and collective empowerment of 
[normal]DP
[normal] by 
[normal]promoting the
[normal]ir
[normal] voice and active participation in all areas of life -  social, economic, political and cultural. They do this
[normal] 
[normal]by
[normal]: Bringing individuals out of isolation through mutual support; Building a common identity and status 
[normal]for 
[normal]DP
[normal]; Providing opportunities for 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s personal and economic empowerment; Advocating for access to services and other development support; Raising aw
[normal]areness of 
[normal]and challenging 
[normal]disability discrimination
[normal], 
[normal]negative attitudes and stigma
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Acting through the d
[normal]isability movement
[normal], 
[normal]DP
[normal] were at the heart of the process which led to the adoption 
[normal]of the UNCRPD in 2006, 
[normal]and 
[normal]have 
[normal]also 
[normal]been 
[normal]key actors 
[normal]in getting 
[normal]states to ratify
[normal], and in influencing the development of the legislation needed for states to meet their commitments under the convention. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Strengthening organisational capacity [bold]is a critical element in ensuring that DPOs become effective in promoting the 
[normal]voice
[normal],
[normal] participation
[normal] and empowerment
[normal] of 
[normal]DP
[normal] in all aspects of life, and in development processes. 
[normal]Over 28 years’ working with DPOs, we have learnt that t
[normal]he high levels of exclusion and disadvantage experienced by 
[normal]DP
[normal], including exclusion from education, ofte
[normal]n means that the capacity building needs of DPOs are greater than those of other CSOs, and it can take longer to achieve sustainable progress. Practical challenges relating to mobility and communication are also factors which may mean that more time and re
[normal]sources need to be invested in capacity building processes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DP
[normal] do not represent a homogenous group, and the challenges faced by individuals are also linked to other 
[normal]intersecting factors of exclusion and inequality [bold]such as gender, age, ethnicity etc. In p
[normal]romoting the voice
[normal], 
[normal]participation 
[normal]and empowerment 
[normal]of 
[normal]DP
[normal] it is important to analyse and address these factors and to take active steps to remove the additional barriers. Through an 
[normal]accompaniment approach to capacity building, ADD has worked with partner DPO
[normal]s to build awareness and understanding of these issues within disability movement
[normal]s
[normal], and to develop strategies to address them
[normal]. With regard to gender, this has included the creation of women’s DPOs / women’s departments in DPOs, as well as quotas to improve
[normal] the representation of disabled women within DPO 
[normal]executive boards and to encourage the emergence of disabled women as leaders. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Active steps also need to be taken to reach impairment or identity groups which are
[normal] highly excluded[bold] as a result of social norms and beliefs, and to facilitate their inclusion
[normal] and engagement in development processes
[normal]. In Uganda
[normal], for example,
[normal] people living with/affected by a
[normal]lbinism 
[normal]are subject to extreme discrimination and vulnerable to violence and abuse 
[normal]relating to superstitious beliefs and practices. This results in extreme isolation, where women 
[normal]who have children
[normal] with albinism are often rejected by their husbands, and people living with albinism (PLWA) are often hidden away by their families from childh
[normal]ood through into adulthood. The Elgon Foundation for Persons with Albinism (EFPA)
[normal], established 
[normal]and run by PLWA
[normal],
[normal] engages with communities, local government and civil society actors to increase recognition, awareness and protection of PLWA.
[normal] An evaluation of 
[normal]this project (2013) found that as a result of this initiative, more children living with albinism are enrolling in and staying in school; police vigilance in protecting the rights of PLWA has increased;
[normal] 
[normal]more PLWA are becoming members of other civil society
[normal] 
[normal]organisations
[normal]; local authorities are explicit in stating that services should include PLWA; and PLWA report they feel they are more respected within their communities.  A key aspect of this process has also been to work with DPOs so that PLWA are recognis
[normal]ed as 
[normal]DP
[normal] and included within the wider disability movement: In the areas of EPFA’s work, PLWA now occupy leadership positions within district level DPOs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The need 
[normal]for systematic disaggregation of data by
[normal] disability as well as gender and other factors is crucial, and is covered in more detail in other submissions (DDG 
[normal]/ 
[normal]International Centre for 
[normal]Evidence in
[normal] Disability
[normal]). However, data alone is not enough to build the understanding needed 
[normal]for 
[normal]effective
[normal] interv
[normal]entions
[normal] –
[normal] 
[normal]also essential
[normal] are 
[normal]participatory[bold] initiatives which produce qualitative[bold] evidence [bold]by eliciting and capturing the
[normal] perspectives of [bold]DP[bold] themselves[bold]. 
[normal]The ‘Voices of the Marginalised’ participatory research project 
[normal](
[normal]ADD International/
[normal] HelpAge Internationa
[normal]l
[normal]/ Sightsavers/ 
[normal]Alzheimer’s Disease International) represented a channel through which 
[normal]DP
[normal], older people and people living with mental health issues could feed in to 
[normal]the post-2015 policymaking process
[normal] – and project 
[normal]participants also reported that they 
[normal]found
[normal] the process itself empowering.
[normal] The resulting report, ‘We can also make change’
[normal](2013)
[normal], provides evidence of the issues and dynamics which contribute to the exclusion of older and 
[normal]DP
[normal] and 
[normal]makes 
[normal]recommendations (relating to livelihoods security, access
[normal] to public services, and ending bullying and violence) which are grounded in their direct experience and analysis.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]E[bold]ngaging [bold]non-disabled stakeholders [bold]is an important element in participation and empowerment processes.
[normal] In Cambodia ADD worked with DPOs to
[normal] address the extreme marginalisation of people intellectual disabilities (PWID) in rural communities
[normal] by building their capacity to participate in social and economic activities
[normal]. 
[normal]A final evaluation found that the engagement of 
[normal]stakeholders at all levels of 
[normal]the community, 
[normal]with an initial emphasis on building understanding of intellectual disability, had been a key factor in achieving success. Furthermore, as PWID participated more in family and community activities, the community 
[normal]actively 
[normal]sought opportunities
[normal] to secure their access to services (e.g. inclusion in free healthcare services) and 
[normal] mainstream 
[normal]development opportunities (
[normal]e.g. income generation grants).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Positive discrimination approaches[bold], including quotas, can 
[normal]contribute to
[normal] increasing 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s participati
[normal]on in economic and political spheres.
[normal] In U
[normal]ganda, where the parliamentary system makes provision for 
[normal]5 directly elected MPs
[normal] representing DP (and who must be DP themselves), disability issues are prominent in policymaking and legislation (Uganda’s 2012 report to the UN Committee on UNCRPD). Drawing on Uganda’s experience, a similar approach is now being developed in Kenya.  
[normal]App
[normal]roaches involving 
[normal]setting and monitoring 
[normal]quotas
[normal] can also have a positive impact
[normal] in the private sector
[normal]: 
[normal]In Bangladesh,
[normal] as a result of influencing work carried out by ADD and DPOs, the 
[normal]Bangladesh 
[normal]G
[normal]arments 
[normal]M
[normal]anufacturing and 
[normal]E
[normal]xport 
[normal]A
[normal]ssociation BGMEA 
[normal]issued a l
[normal]etter to all its members asking them to recruit 
[normal]DP
[normal]. 
[normal]DP
[normal] who have received appropriate training (through their DPO) are now able to secure work in garments factories
[normal], while t
[normal]he recruitment of 
[normal]DP
[normal] is also 
[normal]leading to changes which will support disability inclus
[normal]ion in the long-term such as adjustments 
[normal]to improve access, and 
[normal]improved
[normal] attitudes towards 
[normal]DP
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite leading the way on thinking on disability inclusion with its paper on
[normal] 
[normal]Disability, Poverty and Development
[normal] in 2000, and despite the UK government’s 
[normal]obligations under the UNCRPD and the UK Disabil
[normal]i
[normal]ty Discrimination Act, 
[normal]DFID currently has 
[normal]no [bold]written[bold] policy commitments on disability inclusion[bold]. [bold]As a result
[normal] there 
[normal]is no reporting 
[normal]requirement 
[normal]or funding incentive 
[normal]fo
[normal]r DFID programmes to ensure or to demonstrate that the promotion of 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s voice and participation has been incorporated as a strategy to increase impact in all interventions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the existence of 
[normal]guidelines[bold] 
[normal]which emphasise
[normal] the importance of 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s voice and participation, 
[normal]knowledge and uptake of these across DFID’s programmes has been very limited[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]2007 
[normal]How to 
[normal]Note 
[normal]on Working on Disability in Country Programmes
[normal], for example,
[normal] 
[normal]recommends action on involving DPOs in all civil society 
[normal]consultations, and in 2010 all DFID country programmes were sent a Guidance Note 
[normal]on how to improve educational access and quality for children with disabilities
[normal], which included recommendations on participatory approaches
[normal]. A study conducted in 2012 by an NG
[normal]O Informal Working Group on DFID and education for children with disabilities found that only half of the country offices surveyed had read the Guidance Note. 
[normal]However, the research also found that, although the country offices surveyed had not involved DPO
[normal]s closely in the planning and monitoring of education programmes, they were open to doing this in the future, and would welcome support in putting this into practice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Promotion of the voice, participation and empowerment of 
[normal]DP
[normal] 
[normal]should
[normal] theoretically fall w
[normal]ithin the scope of 
[normal]a[bold]ction point 2.1. of DFID’s current Business Plan (Build open societies and institutions in our partner countries)[bold], and DFID’s 
[normal] 
[normal]pledge to ensure 40 million people have more control over their own development and hold their governments to account. However, 
[normal]without clear obligation to 
[normal]ensure that 
[normal]DP
[normal] are included in these initiatives, and support to achieve this, they are easily negle
[normal]cted: For example, a recent ICAI (Independent Commission for Aid Impact) evaluation of DFID’s empowerment 
[normal]and accountability programming in Ghana and Malawi ma
[normal]kes
[normal] no reference to 
[normal]DP
[normal] at all
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID is currently 
[normal]investing in strengthening the disability [bold]movement[bold] as a channel for the voice, participation and empowerment of 
[normal]DP
[normal] through 
[normal]funding
[normal] to ADD International
[normal] (PPA),
[normal] 
[normal]the Disability Rights Fund and a small portfolio of 
[normal]NGO projects. However, these initiatives represent a very small proportion of overall D
[normal]FID support to participation, empowerment and 
[normal]accountability initiatives. Furthermore, while strengthening DPOs represents an essential step in promoting 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s empowerment and participation, it is also important to build opportunities for the voice of 
[normal]DP
[normal] to
[normal] be heard within other movements and fora
[normal], such as the women’s movement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the absence of a strategy or policy on disability inclusion, DFID and the UK government have played a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]important[bold] role in ensuring that disability [bold]inclusion has been firmly [bold]on the agenda in the post-2015 process[bold], as reflected in both the HLP and Secretary General’s reports. In carrying out this influential role, DFID was able to draw on the qualitative evidence based on the voice and experience of 
[normal]DP
[normal] through participatory pro
[normal]jects such as the Voices Research Project (see above). 
[normal]DFID has also been very supportive of the principle of 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s representatives participating in key fora within the post-2015 process, such as the HLP panels in Liberia and Bali, and has actively engaged 
[normal]with the disability movement and with disability focused INGOs such as ADD International to make this happen. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We recognise 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]commitment and engagement of key individuals[bold] w
[normal]ithin DFID and the UK government has been
[normal] an essential element
[normal] in ensuring t
[normal]his focus on disability issues
[normal], and the inclusion of 
[normal]DP
[normal]’s perspectives,
[normal] in
[normal] the post-MDG discussions
[normal]. The same individuals are currently championing disability inclusion within DFID, through initiatives such as the commitment to ensure schools built with 
[normal]DFID funding are physically accessible, and the recent rejection of some business cases which ignore disability. However, without this commitment becoming institutionalised within a strategy and systems, these gains could be lost as individuals move on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We support the BOND DDG’s call for DFID to 
[normal]make a 
[normal]high level commitment to disability inclusion, supported by a TOC, strategy and systems[bold] for implementation and accountability which locate disability within the 
[normal]wider context of equity and i
[normal]nclusion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These structures must 
[normal]emphasise the importance of promoting the voice, participation and empowerment of [bold]DP[bold], making clear links with 
[normal]DFID’s 
[normal]commitments and 
[normal]initiatives on 
[normal]accountability, 
[normal]empowerment
[normal] and governance
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Funding
[normal] decisions
[normal] for direct DFID programmes, bilateral funding, and work through partner organisations should be linked to 
[normal]a r[bold]equirement to include [bold]DP[bold] in all [bold]consultation, [bold]participation[bold], [bold]empowerment[bold] and [bold]accountability processes[bold], with 
[normal]accountability mechanism
[normal]s in place to 
[normal]ensure this happens
[normal], including the requirement for 
[normal]data to [bold]be [bold]disaggregated [bold]in order to monitor the inclusion and participation of 
[normal]DP
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to 
[normal]create the conditions for [bold]DP[bold]’s [bold]individual and collective [bold]empowerment, and the channels through which their v[bold]oices can be heard[bold], DFID should fund – and
[normal] encourage others to support - 
[normal]initiatives which promote the emergence of the disability movement and other civil society structures through which 
[normal]DP
[normal] participate and gain empowerment. In doing this, DFID should ensure 
[normal]that specific measures are taken to ensure the equitable participation of those 
[normal]DP
[normal] who are furthest from power as a result of other factors such as gender, age and location. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should
