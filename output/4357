[normal]Written evidence from AXA Insurance (LTD0006)[bold]AXA Insurance welcomes the publication of the Ministry of Justice’s Command Paper on ‘Reducing the number 
[normal]and costs of whiplash claims.’
[normal] [bold]We also welcome the Transport Select Committee’s ongoing inquiry into the issue of whiplash claims and their constructive contribution to the debate. 
[normal]While we welcome the Government’s proposals as outlined in t
[normal]he Command Paper, we do have concerns that 
[normal]much of the 
[normal]detail has still to be determined and that a number of key points 
[normal]do not seem to have been taken forward. In this respect we would like to make the following comments in respect of the Ministry of Just
[normal]ice’s response to consultation and the Committee’s own report and recommendations:
[normal]2.1 Scope of scheme 
[normal]2
[normal].1.a 
[normal]It is acknowledged that the detail of any scheme of truly independent specialist medical panels has yet to be established.
[normal] However, we are concerned that the Ministry of Justice 
[normal]only 
[normal]refer
[normal]s
[normal] to road traffic accident soft tissue injuries. There is 
[normal]a disappointing
[normal] omission in respect of psychological reaction to a road traffic accident such as travel anxiety. 
[normal]R
[normal]estricting the sch
[normal]eme to soft tissue injuries runs the risk of moving the problem to other areas. 
[normal]Although 
[normal]psychological reaction to alleged physical injury is unusual 
[normal]and accounts for less than 1% of all motor claims registered with the Compensation Recovery Unit of the De
[normal]partment of Work and Pensions, allegations of travel anxiety or some form of psychological reaction is a common additional feature in many whiplash claims. I
[normal]n the context of low value road traffic accidents an 
[normal]undesirable 
[normal]situation could arise where
[normal], in fu
[normal]ture, there is 
[normal]a robust
[normal] medical 
[normal]assessment
[normal] process supported by an 
[normal]accreditation and monitoring process
[normal] in place for physical injury
[normal], but
[normal] a separate and potentially less rigorous approach in respect of reports addressing a
[normal]ny psychological reaction
[normal] to a roa
[normal]d traffic accident. 
[normal]2.
[normal]1.b 
[normal]The process in respect of better medical evidence 
[normal]must 
[normal]apply to all injuries of whatever nature that arise in low value road traffic accident claims. 
[normal]2.2 Accreditation 
[normal]2.2.a It is pragmatic to draw on existing accreditation sch
[normal]emes but stakeholders need to be satisfied as to the robustness of 
[normal]these 
[normal]schemes and the extent to which they
[normal] may 
[normal]feature in a new accreditation scheme . Existing forms of accreditation will have been put in place by medical reporting agencies
[normal],
[normal] some of who
[normal]m will have contributed to the whiplash problem that Government is seeking to address. 
[normal]2.2.b A random element of peer review is essential. Although 
[normal]we support
[normal] the Select Committee’s view that the GMC could have a role in auditing of reports, audits must be carried out by 
[normal]appropriate 
[normal]practitioners with experience of being an expert 
[normal]witness and of giving evidence in court. 
[normal]2.3 Standardised Reports
[normal]2
[normal].3.a 
[normal]The gene
[normal]ral and mandatory use of s
[normal]ta
[normal]ndardised reports 
[normal]should 
[normal]help improve the quality of reporting. However, we are concerned that the Command Paper speaks of ensuring ‘information requirements are comprehensive but simplified as much as possible,’ but 
[normal]does not co
[normal]mment
[normal] on the need to ensure that the examining medical practitioner has both claimant and defendant descriptions of the accident. This would enable 
[normal]the 
[normal]medical practitioner, as expert witness, to express a range of views that would assist the court in reac
[normal]hing a decision should there be an issue in respect of causation or severity of injury received. 
[normal]3
[normal].1 
[normal]We support the Committee’s recommendation that Government should consult on ways of 
[normal]requiring
[normal] 
[normal]claimants to provide more detailed information in support of their claim. This would avoid the situation as arose in 
[normal]H
[normal]ussain v Hussain 
[normal][2012] EWCA Civ 1367.
[normal] 
[normal]This case also
[normal] illustrates the challenges
[normal] of
[normal] seeking to combat suspected fraud. We support the Committee’s view that there should be a presumption against accepting claims where detailed independent evidence in support
[normal] of the claim
[normal] is not available. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 A reduced limitation period for low value mo
[normal]tor claims would help ensure that such independent corroborative evidence was still available. 
[normal]We are disappointed that the Committee’s recommendation in this respect is 
[normal]not 
[normal]being taken forward. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 We recommend that specific guidance is also given to th
[normal]e courts in respect of low value of RTA claims. In respect of neck injuries, 
[normal]at page 22 
[normal]the ‘Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal 
[normal]I
[normal]njury Claims in Northern Ireland’ says the following: 
[normal]“The assessment of damages for whiplash injuri
[normal]es requires particular care. Allegations of such injuries are easily made and 
[normal]not 
[normal]easily disproved. The medical experts are reliant on the honesty of plaintiffs. The evidence relating to such a claim requires careful scrutiny. It is for the plaintiff to pr
[normal]ove the existence and the nature of and the extent of the injuries. Exaggerated claims may call into question the very existence of whiplash injury. They may also result in the court being unable to be satisfied on the evidence as to the nature and extent 
[normal]of the alleged whiplash injury. Where the court is not satisfied on a balance of probabilities of the existence of a whiplash injury there will be no award. Where the court is not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the injury is of the nature and
[normal] extent alleged the court may be left without any credible evidence on which to base an award. The court should make its findings of the fact on the issues of:
[normal](i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whether a whiplash injury was sustained; and
[normal](ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If so, the nature and extent of the injury. The
[normal] 
[normal]court should avoid simply making a small award to avoid the necessity of making findings on (i) and (ii)
[normal]”
[normal]We
[normal] advocate 
[normal]that the courts in England and Wales adopt similar guidance. Such guidance might have helped avoid the situations that arose in 
[normal]Charnock
[normal] v Rowan, Dar v Vonsak 
[normal]and 
[normal]Hussain v Hussain
[normal] where, in all cases issues of credibility and difficulties 
[normal]in disproving
[normal] 
[normal]alleged injury arose
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 We welcome the Committee’s recommendation that limiting the right to compensation where a claim is grossly exa
[normal]ggerated should be explored further. A contract of insurance is one of utmost good faith. It is a well established legal principle that if any part of a claim under a contract of insurance is exaggerated or fraudulent, the insurer is entitled to avoid the 
[normal]whole claim. At common law the same principle, notwithstanding the use of statements of truth, does not apply. We would refer the Committee to 
[normal]Nield v Loveday, Zurich v Haywood 
[normal]and 
[normal]Summers v Fairclough Homes 
[normal]to illustrate the approach adopted at common law
[normal] and where damages have been recovered where there has been significant exaggeration. 
[normal]We would refer the Committee to the Law Commission’s 12
[normal]th
[normal] programme of civil justice reform in respect of which the insurance industry is recommending that the law should
[normal] be changed so that damages are not recovered at all in circumstances where there is fraud or fraudulent exaggeration.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].5
[normal] We are encouraged that the Ministry of Justice intends to work with stakeholders to develop baseline data in respect of neck and b
[normal]ack whiplash and other soft tissue injuries and will work to identify and classify fraudulent or exaggerated claims. However, we reiterate the point that evidentially proving fraud is challenging and that many claims, where there is a suspicion of fraud or
[normal] exaggeration
[normal], are
[normal] discontinued following robust challenge by defendant 
[normal]insurer or solicitor. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].1 We are disappointed that the opportunity is not being taken to increase the small claims track limit for personal injury claims. We note that the Committee is concerned about the possibility of inequality of arms in personal injury claims; 
[normal]while we unde
[normal]rstand this concern, 
[normal]we 
[normal]would 
[normal]emphasise that out of many thousand low value road traffic accident claims, only a very small proportion end in a court hearing. The risk of inequality of arms is minimal. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 The perception of inequality of arms could be ea
[normal]sily addressed by developing the Portal so as to enable access by direct claimants. In our opinion, extending the Portal to unrepresented claimants would enhance access to justice in a way that would be easy for the majority of potential claimants
[normal] to pursu
[normal]e claims for genuine personal injuries.
[normal] Separate provision could be made for those who do
[normal] not
[normal] have access to a computer or who are not computer literate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 The Portal Stage 3 option of a paper based determination of a case would also overcome concerns 
[normal]that the access to justice can be complex and intimidating.
