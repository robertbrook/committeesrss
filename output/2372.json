"&#xa0;\nThe Friends of the Ridgeway – Written evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;Deregulation Draft Bill ('the Bill')&#xa0;\nWe write to support the proposals of the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) to add provisions to the Bill.\n&#xa0;\nThere is overwhelming evidence across the nation of the damage done and the nuisance caused by the recreational use of motor vehicles on unsealed ways in the countryside. The problem is most acute in National Parks and in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), landscapes that are singled out for special protection to provide our people with special places for them to enjoy in peace. The vehicles make walking, cycling and horse riding difficult and even dangerous.  For these reasons we have campaigned to exclude vehicles from using The Ridgeway National Trail, which runs through two AONBs. The introduction of Restricted Byways as part of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERCA) was most helpful in this regard and the surface of the sections concerned have recovered in a most encouraging way.  Should the PDGLA provisions be enacted, this would mean the remaining 15 miles of the Trail would get the protection it so clearly needs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs a further suggestion, we believe that World Heritage Sites, such as Stonehenge and Avebury, should receive similar protection.\n&#xa0;\nlan Ritchie\nChairman\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n2\n of \n1\n&#xa0;\n"
