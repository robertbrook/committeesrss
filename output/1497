[normal]The
[normal] Oil Firing T
[normal]echnical Association
[normal] (OFTEC) represents companies involved in the oil fired heating sector. Also it operates a Competent Persons scheme for
[normal] oil heating technicians licens
[normal]ed by the Department of Communities and Local Government and currently has some 8,700 persons on its regis
[normal]ter. For this function OFTEC is accredited by UKAS (No. 4371).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]Since 2008 OFTEC has been in discussions with DECC and its predecessor Departments about ways of reducing GHG emission from domestic oil boilers. It has promoted a new fuel kn
[normal]own as B30K which is a blend of kerosene (70%) with FAME 
[normal]biofuel
[normal] (30%). 
[normal]This fuel can be used in existing oil boilers after minor modifications to the boiler, and 
[normal]offers 
[normal]a
[normal] comparable 
[normal]heat output
[normal] and boiler efficiency
[normal] to that of kerosene.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However B30K 
[normal]has 
[normal]been excluded from the forthcoming domestic Renewable Heat Incentive
[normal] (RHI) 
[normal]in England and Wales, although it has been recognized for the Northern Ireland 
[normal]version of 
[normal]RHI. OFTEC believes that a bio-liquid such as B30K would make a significant contribution to
[normal] GHG reductions for rural homes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DECC Heat Strategy (2013): 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]This strategy seeks to eliminate all fossil fuel usage for heat generation by 2050
[normal]. It envisages extensive 
[normal]use of de-carbonised electricity supplied through an enhanced 
[normal]electricity 
[normal]grid to
[normal] homes and buildings as the way to achieve this. OFTEC suggests that this 
[normal]policy 
[normal]is impractical 
[normal]in that it would require massive capital investment and therefore would impose 
[normal]high costs on energy consumers
[normal] which would be unacceptable politically. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]

[normal]policy

[normal]ated by the

[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Hotwater
[normal] Industry 
[normal]Council (HHIC) 
[normal](
[normal]and others
[normal]) 
[normal]promotes a more “balanced transition” to low carbon heat. This should involve use of hybrid gas and oil condensing boilers working 
[normal]in tandem with h
[normal]eat pumps.
[normal] OFTEC supports t
[normal]he arguments made within the HHIC report entitled “Pathways for Domestic Heat”.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Hybrid Heat technologies 
[normal]using oil: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]              
[normal]This
[normal] HHIC report sees a continuing role for oil and gas fire
[normal]d condensing boilers into the 
[normal]period 2025 -2030 because these technologies can work well with heat pumps in an 
[normal]auxiliary
[normal] role. 
[normal]The domestic RHI recogni
[normal]s
[normal]es this and allows payments for hybrid technologies providing that the renewable element of the heat is metered. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]OFTEC 
[normal]modelling
[normal] 
[normal]suggests that for an oil/Air 
[normal]Source
[normal] Heat
[normal] Pump (ASHP) hybrid boiler, (
[normal]assuming the ASHP has 
[normal]a Sea
[normal]sonal Performance Factor
[normal] - SPF -
[normal] of 2.5) 
[normal]the CO2 emissions for a 4 bed
[normal]room house would be 5.138 tonnes of 
[normal]C
[normal]O2 p.a. This compares with 6.302 
[normal]tonnes 
[normal]using an 
[normal]oil 
[normal]condensing boiler, and 4.756 tonnes using only 
[normal]the ASHP.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst the CO2 emission
[normal]s
[normal] for the ASHP are slightly lower than 
[normal]for 
[normal]the hybrid, 
[normal]independent studies have shown that 
[normal]an 
[normal]ASHP 
[normal]working on its own 
[normal]cannot achieve high SPF in a sustained period of 
[normal]cold weather
[normal]. T
[normal]herefore 
[normal]it is 
[normal]un
[normal]likely that 
[normal]this leve
[normal]l of carbon output could 
[normal]be exceeded 
[normal]in a particularly cold year. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Has the Government
[normal] made
[normal] the right ap
[normal]proach to reducing heat demand? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]              
[normal]The Government’s flagship policy to reduce fossil fuel cons
[normal]umption in the domestic sector 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Renewable Heat Incentive - is unlikely to achieve its stated objectives. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]              
[normal]The domestic RHI is 
[normal]an 
[normal]innovative 
[normal]policy 
[normal]and does provide significant tax-payers funds to incentivi
[normal]s
[normal]e the switch to renewable heat. 
[normal]With an
[normal] estimated cost of £5.09 billion
[normal] and a net present value estimated at MINUS £1.836 billion 
[normal]over the policy Lifetime, 
[normal]this is an expensive policy
[normal]. 
[normal]The DECC Impact assessment (IA) forecasts (Table 8) that 579,000 homes will switch to renewable heat technolog
[normal]ies between 2014 and 2020 due to the RHI. However 
[normal]The Committee should
[normal] be aware that the 
[normal]same IA paper 
[normal]acknowledges that the uptake of the 
[normal]i
[normal]ncentive is unknown 
[normal](due to possible consumer indifference?) 
[normal]and says (
[normal]para
[normal] 77):
[normal] 
[normal]“however there is extreme uncertainty about how householders will make these investment decisions 
[normal]for renewable heating products.  …” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]              
[normal]OFTEC suggests that the likelihood of many existin
[normal]g oil ho
[normal]useholds deciding to switch to 
[normal]renewable tech
[normal]nologies 
[normal]such
[normal] as ASHP, Ground Source Heat Pumps and B
[normal]io-mass (wood pellet) boilers is low. 
[normal]The principle reason for this is that nearly all decisions relating to a new heating system are made in emergency situations when a boiler breaks down and cannot be replaced. The
[normal] householder is desperate to have heating and hot water restored to their home and so makes a “distress purchase”. They do not have the time nor 
[normal]the 
[normal]money to consider a new technology which may require home adaptations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]This fact
[normal] may explain some of t
[normal]he findings 
[normal]of a 
[normal]report c
[normal]ommissioned by DECC from 
[normal]Ipsos
[normal]/ 
[normal]MORI and the Energy Savings Trust en
[normal]titled 
[normal]“Homeowners’ Willingness 
[normal]To Take Up More Efficient Heating Systems
[normal]” (March 
[normal]2013)
[normal]. 
[normal]This surveyed 2,900 home owners and conducted a number of 
[normal]in-depth worksho
[normal]ps in the autumn of 2012. 
[normal]l
[normal]t
[normal] concluded: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We suggest that the Committee requests DECC for sight of this Report - if they have not done so already. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C
[normal]ost of conversion to renewable heat:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]              
[normal]An earlier 
[normal]Impact Assessment (
[normal]IA
[normal])
[normal] for the RHI 
[normal](September 2012) 
[normal]stated
[normal] that 
[normal]38% (or 
[normal]145,000
[normal]) of the homes converting to renewable heat pre 2020 due to the RHI would be in 
[normal]rural 
[normal]areas. The latest IA puts the number converting to these new technologies at 579,000 which indicates that DECC
[normal] now forecast that 220,000 rural homes now will convert due to the RHI. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]              
[normal]OFTEC estim
[normal]ates that 80% 
[normal](176,000) 
[normal]of these will be homes using oil heating at present. 
[normal] 
[normal]The estimated capital costs of these conversions are shown in the table below, and the Co
[normal]mmittee will note that substantial up-front capital costs are involved installing Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP), Ground Source Heat pumps (GSHP) and Wood Pellet Boilers (Pellet)
[normal]. Th
[normal]ese costs compare with approx
[normal].
[normal] £3,

[normal]to replace an existing oil boiler with
[normal] a condensing oil boiler.

[normal]Note 1‐ Energy Saving Trust ‐

[normal]Assumptions:
[normal]1. RHI 
[normal] 
[normal]IA (July 2013) predicts that 579
[normal],000 rural households will move to 
[normal]renewable installations
[normal] (Table 8) due to the RHI. Taking the assumption in the earlier IA (September 2012) that 38% of the homes switching will be in rural areas, this means that 220,000 are predicted to convert by 2020. 
[normal]2. The OFTEC model estimates
[normal] that 
[normal]80% of these will currently
[normal] be on oil, which equates to 176
[normal],000 homes
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]              
[normal]The cost of replacing all these boilers with a modern condensing boiler is approximately £
[normal]616m: the cost of converting a
[normal]ll the existing boilers 
[normal]in these homes to use B30K fuel is 
[normal]estimated at £528m. Both these figures are less than half the capital cost of installing the proposed the renewable technologies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consumer r
[normal]esistance to Heat Pumps
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]              
[normal]Any heat strategy designed to reduce CO2 / GHG emissions from private homes must be
[normal] capable of being “sold” to home-owners. For the reasons stated above we 
[normal]believe that the currently 
[normal]favoured
[normal] technologies will be a hard sell. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]favoured
[normal] technology – Air Source Heat Pumps –
[normal] should 
[normal]work well in new homes built to “zero carbon” stan
[normal]dards and with larger radiators and / or under
[normal]-
[normal]floor heating. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]              
[normal]However heat pumps 
[normal]will not function effectively if they are fitted onto existing radiator systems and this has been acknowledged in the recent EST trials.
[normal] 
[normal]The full cost 
[normal]of installing an e
[normal]ffective heat pump 
[normal]in an exi
[normal]s
[normal]ting property s
[normal]hould include the cost of a new radiator 
[normal]or under-floor heating 
[normal]system. 
[normal]In addition good functionality 
[normal]of heat pumps 
[normal]requires 
[normal]properties 
[normal]to be 
[normal]fully insulated
[normal]. Many rural homes are older (pre-1914) and have solid
[normal] walls. The option of cavity wall insulation is not open to these homes and the alternative - solid wall insulation- is expensive, unproven and can be unsightly. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]              
[normal]A further factor which should b
[normal]e noted regarding
[normal] heat pumps 
[normal]is that they 
[normal]do not provide 
[normal]“hot radiators” which can be used to 
[normal]warm yourself on when cold or to 
[normal]“dry the clothes”. Consumers are used to 
[normal]radiators doing this and 
[normal]there could be negative reaction to these perceived
[normal] shortcomings of renewable heat from some people.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ru
[normal]nning costs of preferred Renewable Technologies (pre-RHI)
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]              
[normal]The RHI is designed to compensate home owners for the capital costs of installing renewable heat and to contribute to their running costs for seven years. 
[normal]We note that 
[normal]within 
[normal]the 
[normal]RHI document 
[normal]issued on 12
[normal]th
[normal] July 20
[normal]13, the examples of what paymen
[normal]t
[normal]s
[normal] might be expected are based upon a building heat requirement of 15,000 kWh p.a. Due to the design of many rural homes, we submit that the average building heat
[normal] l
[normal]oss would be higher at aro
[normal]und 24,000 to
[normal] 28,000kWh p.a. Domestic 
[normal]RHI payments are based upon a deemed heat calculated from an energy performance 
[normal]assessment
[normal] and not from metering actual renewable heat emitted. We suggest that customers could 
[normal]be exposed to the risk of 
[normal]having 
[normal]high
[normal]er than anticipate
[normal]d
[normal] electricity bills due to heat pumps cycling on and off to meet 
[normal]high 
[normal]heating demand. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]future 
[normal]costs of electricity and wood pellets 
[normal]for the favoured RHI technologies are un
[normal]known
[normal]. Electricity prices are likely to rise to reflect 
[normal]the 
[normal]increased gene
[normal]rating costs for nuclear and wind-power. 
[normal]The Committee should note that the current average fuel costs 
[normal]p.a. 
[normal]in GB for a three bedroom house in the period July 2012 – July 2013 are set out below:

[normal]              
[normal]For a home wi
[normal]th an ASHP it is only £8 less expensive 
[normal]per annum 
[normal](or 0.66%
[normal]) to run on 
[normal]carbonized electricity than it is to use kerosene fu

[normal]s currently are approximately 3
[normal]% less 
[normal]expensive run than 
[normal]oil. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]              
[normal]The RHI will only provide subsidy to homeowners for seven years so there is a danger tha

[normal] peo

[normal] running costs are greatly in excess of fossil fuel heating. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rural homes - CO2 Abatement and role of Bio-Liquids
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]              
[normal]Given that DECC policy is set against Bio-liquids
[normal], 
[normal] it is interesting to note t
[normal]hat our estimates show that 
[normal]the CO2 abatement in the 176,000 
[normal] homes that might convert from oil is LESS using the preferred technologies than it would be if these same homes converted to bio-liquid. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]              
[normal]This is demonstrated in the table below.
[normal]  
[normal]Also it s
[normal]hould be noted 
[normal]that if
[normal] these homes convert to B30K they will save 223,155 tonnes of CO2 p.a. more than if they “do nothing”. It is OFTEC’s contention that most of these homes target
[normal]ed by the RHI will “do nothing” because either the incentive is insufficien
[normal]t or the installation of 
[normal]the “
[normal]renewable technology” is too disruptive / impractical.
