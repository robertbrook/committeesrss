[normal]It i
[normal]s 
[normal]Santander
[normal]’s ambition to be the bank of choice for 
[normal]UK
[normal] companies. In 2012, 
[normal]Santander
[normal] increased its net lending to SMEs in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] by
[normal] 27% (compared to 
[normal]Santander
[normal]’s national average of 18%). 
[normal]Santander
[normal] is a challenger to the Big Four banks in SME lend
[normal]ing
[normal] across the country
[normal], where we have 5.5% market share.

[normal]Santander
[normal] is committed to 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] where we are proud to be a key private sector empl

[normal]We note that some of the questions in this call for evidence 
[normal]are 
[normal]very specific in 
[normal]nature
[normal] or related to 
[normal]individual 
[normal]financial services compan
[normal]ies. Consequently, we have only responded to those questions where 
[normal]Santander
[normal] can offer a particular insight to the Committee.
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Is there a difference in the structure of banks in [bold]Northern [bold]Ireland[bold], compared to their structure in [bold]Great Britain[bold]? Is there any disadvantage for customers, both private and business, in NI as a result?[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] does not differentiate its business in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] compared to 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We offer the same 
[normal]range of products to our customers and make lending decisions for both our individual customers 
[normal]and business customers 
[normal]in the same way. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a consequence of this, we do not believe that our customers are in any way disadvantaged by banking with 
[normal]Santander
[normal] in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] as opposed to those banking with us in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Do banks [bold]that[bold] operate in both GB and NI, [bold]eg[bold], Barclays and Santander, operate differently in NI than in the rest of the [bold]UK[bold]? Does this result in customers in NI being at a [bold]disadvantage compared to customers in GB?[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]See 
[normal]above
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Historically, finance for start-ups and expansions had been largely provided through Government agencies – [bold]ie[bold], Invest NI &amp;[bold] its various predecessors – with the result that bank finance traditionally played a lesser [bold]role in NI than in GB.[bold] [bold]Have NI[bold] banks continued to play a lesser role in commercial finance than elsewhere – in particular, have economic and financial conditions s[bold]ince 2008 exacerbated that position? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is 
[normal]Santander
[normal]’s
[normal] ambition to be the bank of choice for companies across the country
[normal], including
[normal] in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While some of the banks
[normal] operating
[normal] in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] have seen a declining appetite for lending si
[normal]nce 2008, 
[normal]Santander
[normal] 
[normal]is committed to
[normal] grow
[normal]ing this part of its business in the years ahead. O
[normal]ur experience over the last 18 months
[normal] suggests that
[normal] there is no shortage of SMEs seeking funding in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2012, 
[normal]Santander
[normal] grew its net lending to SMEs in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] by 27%.
[normal] This compares to a national lending increase by 
[normal]Santander
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] of 18%. 
[normal]Our commitment to grow our lending to SMEs in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] has continued into 2013. As of 30 June 2013, 
[normal]Santander
[normal] grew its ne
[normal]t lending to SMEs 
[normal]in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]by 32% from a year earlier. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Funding for expansion for companies in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], as in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal], is often provided by banks in the form of invoice finance or factoring. These provide a 
[normal]high 
[normal]level of control and transparency, especially for younger businesses. These products are likely to remain popular for banks and businesses in the years ahead.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providing banking products for start up businesses is a challenge that banks face in both 
[normal]Gre
[normal]at Britain
[normal] and 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. Banks find it difficult to provide lending to new businesses due to a lack of track record and, usually, a lack of trading data on which to base risk assessments. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]Government has sought to overcome this problem thro
[normal]ugh the Start-Up Loans programme. 
[normal]Santander
[normal] supports this initiative and considers it an excellent
[normal] example of how g
[normal]overnment can help more start up businesses grow and create jobs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Start-
[normal]Up Loans are available to business in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Is the population of NI at a disadvantage to the rest of the [bold]UK[bold] as a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recovery initiatives by banks in NI?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] participates in a number
[normal] of g
[normal]overnment schemes
[normal] available in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] designed to help 
[normal]boost
[normal] the economic
[normal] recovery. Thes
[normal]e include: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our customers
[normal] in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] benefit from these schemes in the same way as our 
[normal]customers
[normal] in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The lack of available data means that it is difficult to properly assess the impact of the reduced availability of cred[bold]it in NI, and also means that there is not sufficient visibility about whether banks are reaching their agreed lending targets. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As noted above, 
[normal]Santander
[normal] has increased its net lending to SMEs in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] by 32% in the last year. 
[normal]Santander
[normal] is currently lending £147m to SMEs in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] also notes that the British Bankers Association 
[normal](BBA) 
[normal]has agreed to 
[normal]lead an industry initiative to increase the amount of publicly available data on bank lending in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. 
[normal]Sant
[normal]ander
[normal] refers the Committee to the BBA’s response for more detail on this matter.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How is new lending recorded; how much ‘new’ lending recorded is actually made up of extensions or additions to existing loans; and what [bold]are banks actually doing compared t[bold]o what they are advertising? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] has only been operating as a corporate bank in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] for the last 3 years. As most of our loan facilities last for a 5 year period, we have not yet had any 
[normal]customer facilities expire which need
[normal] renewing. 
[normal]Consequently, the vast majority of 
[normal]our 
[normal]lending recorded in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] is new lending. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Following the closure of [bold]Danske[bold] Bank of some branches in rural areas, are the interests of those living in more rural areas, particularly the elderly, sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure as it currently stands? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] will have 31 branc
[normal]hes in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] by the end of this year. This includes 22 branches which we would consider to be in rural areas
[normal].
[normal] We have no plans to reduce 
[normal]the number of branches in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] below
[normal] this number. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] understands the importance of the branch network to our customers. While 
[normal]Santander
[normal] has closed 6 branches in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] over the last 18 months, it is important to note that every one of the branches has been in a financial centre where we have at le
[normal]ast one other branch remaining.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Santander
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] is an amalgamation of the ex Abbey, Bradford and Bingley and 
[normal]Alliance
[normal] and Leicester Building Societies and as such we have a number of high streets where we have multiple branches
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where we have closed branc
[normal]hes, the customer facing 
[normal]staff have
[normal] all transferred to the remaining branches in the area which we have, in turn, improved to accommodate all of our customers in the town.
[normal] 
[normal]This exercise has shown us that we are able to provide a better service to our cust
[normal]omers when we consol
[normal]idate all of our staff into one, larger 
[normal]branch.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Alongside our branch network, 
[normal]Santander
[normal] has an active “
[normal]omni
[normal]-channel” strategy to ensure that our customers can access our services in a variety of ways as suits their needs. This includes large domestic call 
[normal]centres
[normal] for phone inquiries, a comprehensive online banking platform and a mobile banki
[normal]ng app which was recently named best personal banking app in its category by mobile developer 
[normal]Xtreme
[normal] Labs.
