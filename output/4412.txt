&#xa0;Written evidence from Zurich Insurance plc (CMI0010)

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Zurich welcomed the Committee’s Fourth Report on “Cost of Motor Insurance: Whiplash” released on 31st July 2013. Whilst there were some points upon which we disagreed, we saw the overall response as both balanced and pragmatic. We have also seen Mrs Ellman’s letter of 29th October to the Secretary of State for Justice. We concur that, whilst the Government’s own response to the whiplash issue should be broadly welcomed, the response did not confirm detailed proposals and timeframes and certain key points raised were not mentioned. We will deal with what we consider to be the key outstanding points in turn:&#xa0;We believe that this could again serve as a deterrent against speculative claims and Fraud&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We welcome the TSC’s continued engagement and scrutiny in this important policy area.&#xa0;We have articulated our concerns and would welcome the chance to discuss these further with members of the TSC. We would also express an over-arching concern in terms of timeframes. The MoJ has stated that they intend to work ‘at pace’ - a comment which we welcome, but would like to see more structure and detail in the proposed changes.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
