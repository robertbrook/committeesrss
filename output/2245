default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Football Association is the national governing body responsible for football in England. The FA’s remit is to support, govern and develop the game from the grassroots through to the professional game. The FA runs 24 national teams (which 
defaultinclude,
default men’s
default, women’s, youth and disability teams) and its own competitions such as the Women’s Super League and The FA Cup
default as well as owning and operating Wembley Stadium and St. George’s Park.
default As a not-for-profit organisation, The FA uses revenue created by the Engl
defaultand teams
default, The FA Cup
default and Wembley Stadium to reinvest into the game and run grassroots football.

defaultThe FA launched its Game Changer 5-year strategy for women’s football in October 2012. This will deliver a new Elite Performance Unit, a new commercial strategy, a second tier to supp
defaultort The FA Women’s Super 
defaultLeague
default, growth in participation and growth of the fan-base. The FA has committed 
defaultthrough this plan 
defaultto a further £3.5m investment into women’s football in the ne
defaultxt 5
default years. This adds to the total investment from The FA and its funding partners which this se
defaultason exceeded £11m.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite th
defaultis
default 
defaultsuccessful 
defaultgrowth and development of the women’s game, The FA is working hard to continue to progress the game at all levels. Likewise Government can also help in the game’s evolution and a number of suggestions are includ
defaulted in this paper. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAvailability of facilities for training and playing sport, for both girls and women, at both elite and grassroots levelsdefault5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFootball faces a challenge to provide facilities for both men and women. With over 35,000 football pitches across the country, the quality 
defaultof,
default upkeep of and access to facilities is vital for future participation. Football is particular
defaultly
default sensitive to exter
defaultnal pressures on facilities with 83% of football played on publically owned and managed facilities, 52% of 
defaultthe total
default being in education facilities (and a further 31% in local authority facilities). 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese pitches are shared by some 113,000 teams across
default En
defaultgland
default, with 
default5
default,000 of these being girls’ and women’s teams. While the number of men’s and boys’ teams dwarf the number of women’s teams, given that 20 years ago there were just 80 women’s teams it is clear how quickly the game is expanding. The numbers also
default go some way to indicate the potential for growth in the women’s game too. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, with 35,000 grass pitches, it is clear that pitches and facilities 
defaultare 
defaultnearly always shared between teams. It is important that facilities cater for boys and girls, men a
defaultnd women alike. This should also be the case for disabled football and, indeed, all aspects of 
defaultthe 
defaultcommunity
default’s needs
default. Few women’s clubs own their own ground or are primary tenants so it is important that clubs and facility owners alike provide 
defaultfair
default access 
defaultto facilities. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Women’s Super League now plays a summer league; partly to ensure that ground clashes are no longer an issue and partly to provide a summer alternative which has less competition from other forms of football for fans, sponsors and broad
defaultcasters alike. This has proved successful for the league and the quality of the product and the coverage it 
defaultreceives continue
default to grow. Over recent year, many 
defaultprominent
default men’s clubs have committed extra resource to the League with the likes of Chelsea, Liver
defaultpool, Everton and Arsenal 
defaultsupport
defaulting outstanding women’s teams. Manchester City, who will join the Super League next year, have gone a step further and are to build a first-team stadium for the women’s team. 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, i
defaultf the growth of the women’s game is to continue, the 
defaultpressure on the country’s facility stock will increase further and this represents a major challenge to football in England. 
defaultSince 2001 a total of £7
default80m of investment in football facilities has been secu
defaultred, supported by Football Foundation grants- the Football Foundation is 
defaulta football facility charity jointly funded by The FA, Premier League and Government/Sport England.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll facilities which receive Football Foundation funding are designed to be accessible to all regardless of gender. Team changing rooms are designed to be 'dual-gender', for use by both male and female 
defaultteam
defaults, rather than hav
defaulting
default separate dedicated facilitie
defaults. Features include providing WCs instead of urinals and privacy screens in showers. Facilities must also have two officials' changing rooms to allow concurrent use by male and female match officials' wherever possible. If it is not possible to create dual
default changing rooms- for example when a grant is for a refurbishment and not a rebuild- the club is expected to put a suitable management plan in place to overcome the situation.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the 
default£780m 
defaultinvestment
default sound
defaults
default huge
default, this investment has 
defaultbarely 
defaultscratched th
defaulte surface of the renovations and builds required
default. The Foundation has estimated that the investment in the last 10 years has regenerated only around 6% of facilities in 
defaultEngland. 
defaultThe FA is committed to continuing this in
defaultvestment 
defaultwith 
defaultThe FA’s new National Fo
defaultotball Strategy 
defaultlaying out plans t

default£150m 
defaultof investment 
defaulton facilities between 2013 and 2015
default secured against and supported by Football Foundation grants
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProtection of current facilities is therefore very important. The FA would welcome improved protection of playing fields and school facilities and for any future policy to ensure that Sport England’s role as statutory consultee is protected. Likewise stren
defaultgthening any community programmes 
defaultthat
default protect playing fields, such as Community Right to Bid, would be hugely beneficial for sport. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith so many of our football fields owned and run by Local Authorities, any change in provision at this level is 
defaultof conce
defaultrn
default for future participation too. 
defaultCounty FAs who administer the game locally 
defaultinvest into communities by providing 
defaultfunding
default, facilities, 
defaultvolunteering 
defaultopportunities and the local league structur
defaultes so important to the community. But local football does
default rely on 
defaultLocal Authorit
defaulties
default to provide 
defaultfacilities
default in their region
default and t
defaulthere is a danger that 
defaultreductions in
default facility 
defaultmaintenance and increases in hire costs
default 
defaultimplemented 
defaultby Local Authorities will actually create a vicious circle as it will prevent football from invest
defaulting locally too. On top of football’s direct investment, figures from the Football Foundation also showed that for every £1 invested in p
defaultlaying facilities, a total of £2.53
default was spent in the supply chain
default meaning that 
defaultinvesting in facilities 
defaultis a 
defaultworthwhile
default community investment
default that 
defaultprovides a monetary return on investment
default. 
defaultCentral 
defaultGovernment could also help leverage this investment at a local level too by promoting capital investment in facilities. 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith regards to 
defaultfacilities for 
defaultthe England teams, 
defaultlike the men’s teams, 
defaultthe girls’ and women’s teams are based at St. George’s Park, The FA’s coaching centre of excellence. It is also of course important to ensure the structures to feed the elite teams are in place and to this end The FA 
defaultis
default creat
defaulting
default an El
defaultite Performance Unit
default (EPU) 
defaultfor the women’s game 
defaultwhich 
defaultwill oversee the
default develop
defaultment
default 
defaultof 
defaultthe best young players
default. 
defaultThis consists of 29 new Player Development Centres, 31 FA Girls’ Centres of Excellence and
default 
default3
default Elite Performance Camps to provide an effective link 
defaultbetween emerging talent and international football. To support this structure, The FA has also created a new Head of 
defaultWomen’s 
defaultElite 
defaultPerformance
default role
default. These changes 
defaultwill drive the strategic development of the player and coach pathways to help build winning teams. 
default&#xa0;defaultFinance, including sponsorship and prize moneydefault15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe FA’s financial model, as a not-for-profit organisation, is to raise revenue from the England teams, FA C
defaultup
default (and other competitions)
default and Wembley Stadium to then reinvest back into the game. It is naturally therefore important that The FA can accrue the highest possible value from its media rights and sponsorship deals. This model funds what is known as the Na
defaulttional Game Strategy; 
defaultour
default four year delivery plan for grassroots football. The current £200m investment plan which runs until 2015 focuses on 
defaultproviding flexible formats of football; increasing football opportunities and the profile of women and minority gr
defaultoups; raising the standard of player
default and 
defaultspectator behaviour across the grassroots game; retaining and develop
defaulting
default the existing number of grassroots teams; bring
defaulting
default in changes to youth football; and maximis
defaulting
default investment in facilities. 
defaultWhile 
defaultall 
defaultof 
defaultthe
defaultse pr
defaultiorities are important
default and 
defaultwomen’s and girls’ football is an integral part of each strand, it was felt important that 
defaultopportunities for women and minority groups was
default explicitly covered as a key element of the strategy.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis National Game Strategy works in
default parallel with the Whole Sport Plan
default- 
defaultthe delivery plan 
defaultagreed with Sport England 
defaultagainst which a
default 
defaultnational governing 
defaultbodies
default (NGB)
default is accountable when in receipt of 
defaultGovernment funding
default. The Plan
default is agreed with Sport England and, for football, provides around £
default30
defaultm of funding over four years for specific interventions aimed at increasing participation. For all
default NGBs
default, women and girl’s participation is part of the governing bodies’ Whole Sport Plan. O
defaultver a number of years now, Whole Sport Plans have provided NGBs with both stability and guidance in long term planning and delivery. They are proving an effective mechanism to deliver sport across the country and The FA would encourage the 
defaultC
defaultommittee to ens
defaulture continuity of delivery by supporting the ongoing use of Whole Sport Plans. While further intervention in women
default’s
default and girl’s sport may well be appropriate, any recommendations should provide additionality to the 
defaultcurrent 
defaultplans Sport England and National 
defaultGoverning Bodies already have in place. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen’s football is not a professional sport in England and, after previously failed attempts in both England and USA to professionalise the game or individual teams, The FA’s approach is to build the structures of the game carefully rather than rushing in
defaultto professionalising the sport. 
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis building process has seen significant progress in
default 
defaultelite 
defaultwomen’s football
default. A
defaults the product 
defaultand coverage 
defaulthas improved, 
defaultso
default has interest in the game
default from supporters
default and, correspondingly
default,
default 
defaultfrom potential sponsors
default. When workin
defaultg with sponsors, The FA is particularly keen to work with partners who look to activate their sponsorship and become closely involved in our grassroots work. 
defaultThe FA now has a full women’s partner programme with Nike, Vauxhall, Continental and BT Sport. One
default of the examples of our partners activating their sponsorship is
default 
defaultthe
default girl’s 
defaultFanzones 
defaultwhich are held 
defaultahead of televised WSL 
defaultmatches and 
defaultthe 
defaultwomen’s and girl’s festivals across the country
default. These are held with Continental Tyres and are aimed at 
defaultintroduc
defaulting
default t
defaulthe chance to play 
defaultfootball 
defaultto new audiences
default. 
defaultIn 2013 we have so far held 10 FA Girl’s Football Festivals and 11 Fanzones reaching nearly 6,000 participants aged 5-17. There are another 13 events remaining this year and we therefore expect to beat last year
default’s 7,000 participants. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMedia coveragedefault19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs outlined in the previous section, t
defaulthe Government has done a good job in recent years in raising the profile of women’s sport with broadcasters and in particular 
defaultfree to air
default Broadcasters. There is no doubt that there is more coverage of women’s 
defaultsport
default on TV
default, radio and on-line
default now although 
defaultwe would welcome 
defaultmore coverage 
defaultin all 
defaultof these 
defaultareas and 
defaultalso 
defaultparticularly
default in the 
defaultprinted 
defaultpress where 
defaultthe volume
default of women’s sport 
defaultcoverage 
defaulta
defaultppears to lag behind the other media.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Olympics certainly played its part increasing interest in women’s sport and increased media coverage could be considered as a hugely positive Olympic Legacy. In football some 80,203 spectators watched USA beat Jap
defaultan in the Olympic final
default, with 70,584 watching Team GB beat Brazil earlier in the competition- a
default peak of 3.9m viewers watched 
defaultTeam GB’s victory. 
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNow with The FA Cup Final, Euro 2013, World Cup Qualifiers and a weekly round-up programme on the BBC along wi
defaultth live WSL and Conti-Cup matches on BT 
defaultSport
default, the coverage of women’s football is 
defaultgrowing stronger
default and both the BBC and BT Sport should be praised for their recent commitment to the women’s game. 
default&#xa0;
defaultReasons why participation in sport by women decreasesdefault22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of The FA’s three key strategic priorities is “Football for 
defaultEveryone
default”. This means ensuring that everyone who wants to play the game can and that barriers- whether real or perceived- are removed. This goes for all groups across the country, but of cours
defaulte is particularly important for girls and women. 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR
defaulteasons for drop out in sport are well documented
default in academic papers
default. These can cover 
defaultbiological factors (
defaulthereditary, age, obesity, 
defaultfitness
default level)
default, 
defaultpsychological factors (motivation, perceived barriers, pe
defaultrceived competence, attitudes)
default, 
defaultenvironmental factors (access, activity type, school, mobility)
default and 
defaultsocial factors (peer group, family, culture, role models)
default.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe FA work closely with the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation to try to 
defaultlook at practical p
defaultroblems particular to football to 
defaultprevent drop out in girls. WSFF highlighted a number of reasons for drop out in their 2010 report sighting a 
defaultl
defaultack of opportunity to play matches, that girls thought it was ‘time for something new’, conflicting with other c
defaultommitments, lack of players, the big jump from junior to senior leagues, competing social pressures, 
defaultthe level of
default coaching and lack of support from schools. 
defaultIn 
defaultits 
defaultreport t
defaulthe WSFF highlighted coaching and lack of support in schools as the two issues most p
defaultertinent to football. 
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA third issue for players who have played to a good standard at youth level is that they don't see 
defaultthat
default remaining 
defaultin
default football 
defaultas a potential career path for a sporting future. To combat these beliefs, The FA recently embarked on an initiative called “Kick-Off Your 
defaultCareer” with WSFF in order to provide direction and help for girls and women looking for a future in football. This i
defaultnitiative provides guidance for a whole range of careers from coaching to sports administration and sports medicine to sports law. 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe coaching needs for boys and girls appear to be different. Boys tell us they want an experienced and qualified coach, wh
defaultile girls have told us the qualities they need are an understanding and empathetic coach. To this end we have 
defaultjust completed working with Us Girls (through Streetgames) to deliver sessions to all our County FA staff on the importance of tailoring sessions 
defaultto the needs and motivations of 
defaultyoung female players
default. 
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLikewise our 
defaultFA 
defaultTesco Skills
default coaches are fully trained to deliver to boys and girls. Our FA Tesco Skills primary school programme (5-11 year olds) sees our coaches deliver football physical literacy sessions in schools to pupils and provide tailored support for teachers to train them
default to deliver such programmes in the future. This age group is so important 
defaultbecause,
default if youngsters can be taught well and master basic physical literacy skills
default,
default they are more likely to approach physical education with enthusiasm in secondary school and devel
defaultop a sporting habit for life. The FA Tesco Skills programme has, since its creation in 2007, supported over 21,500 teachers in 7,500 schools and provided 4.5m places to children- 57% boys and 43% girls. The 
defaultin-curriculum 
defaultprogramme is free for schools. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCe
defaultntral to meeting the physical literacy challenge is addressing the deficiency in sport and physical education experience amongst teaching staff in the primary sector and the access to high quality PE provision for boys and girls under the age of 11.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven
default that the WSFF has identified that 
defaultthe level of coaching 
defaultand lack of support from schools are key factors in the drop out from girls football, increasing the number of teachers with a sporting interest and training and up-skilling those to deliver quality 
defaultPE is essential. The FA welcome’s the Government’s current pilot projects which aim to up-skill PE teachers, but would nevertheless hope for further increases in physical education training during Initial Teacher Training. 
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSchool sport policy has, of cou
defaultrse, recently been altered and The FA supports the Government’s focus on making changes to the resourcing and provision of sport in the primary sector. We believe that this is the right area of focus and that specifically the physical literacy of school ch
defaultildren at an early age needs to be improved. 
defaultThe FA
default strongly believe in the principle “that whatever gets measured gets done”
default, so 
defaultwe welcome the Government’s further announcement that there will be a formal Ofsted measurement of sporting provision by Prima
defaultry Schools and that schools will be required to publicly report on how they invest their school sport funding. Ensuring this assessment continues in future years would be an important policy priority and
default, while The FA appreciates that schools are empowered
default to spend funds to best suit their needs,
default considering the split of resource in schools
default to ensure 
defaultthat 
defaultboth boys and girls receive this investment would be welcome
default. 
defaultIn America investment in school sport must be equitable. While this requirement (known as Ti
defaulttle 9) was largely introduced to curb high spending on American Football teams and is perhaps not directly transferable to the UK, the principle of equitable investment for schools is one worth considering here too. 
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile providing good sport provision in
default schools is important to ensure children have the physical literacy to enjoy sport, it also important to ensure that programmes exist outside school in order to combat both boys and girls dropping out of football as they leave school
default. The Government could 
defaulthelp encourage 
defaultfurther
default support for girls’ and women’s sport by providing additional rate relief or favourable VAT rates 
default(which could be allowed under the EU VAT Directive)
default 
defaultfor community clubs that
default 
defaulttarget
default 
defaultdrop off. 
defaultThe FA 
defaultalready 
defaulthas a number of programmes 
defaultwhich aim to 
defaulttarget drop off
default for both boys and girls
default, for example
default: 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClub Links Transition Programmedefault default– 
default‘Join Our Club,’ our club links player transition programme to Charter Standard clubs, has contributed to the growth and retention of over 2,000 Charter S
defaulttandard Teams. 
defaultCharter Standard is The FA’s accreditation for clubs which are well run, sustainable, safe clubs- in order to achieve this status you must run both male and female teams. 
defaultA range of recreational programmes have also been developed as part of
default the process to cater for those young people not ready to make the transition to affiliated football, with over 5,000 boys and girls now playing regularly in recreational programmes. 
defaultIn the first half of 2013
default,
default 2,257 girls
default&#xa0;
defaultjoined a Charter Standard Team and 
defaultaround 
default28,000 girls 
defaulttook
default part in various programmes including coaching and festivals
default as part of this programme. In total, around 9,000 girls have joined teams since the programme started in 2009.

defaultThedefault defaultFA Womedefaultn &amp; Girls programmedefault with Premier League 4 Sportdefault default–
default The Premier League 4 Sport (PL4S) is a very successful community programme which uses the power of football club brands to engage with youngsters in the community in football and a variety of sports. The FA
default has designed a 
defaultWomen &amp; Girls programme to be used by PL clubs and is providing funding for the Clubs to create specific interventions to increase access to football for young women using the successful PL4S satellite model. Each club will form a network o
defaultf 12 satellites through which they will provide opportunities for women aged 14 to 25 to try football and create a supportive environment for them to develop their skills. The satellites will be linked to a variety of exit routes including local teams. A s
defaultimilar project will also run with Football League clubs.

defaultFootball Futures (Leadership and Volunteering Programme)default default–
default 
defaultThe FA Football Futures Leadership and Volunteering programme has supported over 
default12
default,000 new young volunteers working in Charter Standard Clu
defaultbs or educational programmes through affiliated and recreational football programmes. 
defaultOver 4,000 of these were young women volunteers. 
defaultDuring the first two quarters of 2011-12 season over 30,000 voluntary hours were logged.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCollegedefault and Community Football Coordinators (CCFC)default default– CCFCs
default defaultwork directly with the 16-19 year olds in Further Education and Sixth Form colleges. As part of the CCFC programme TEAM 19 was successfully launched in partnership with British Colleges Sport in December 
default2011, engaging over 60 colleges in the programme and resulting in 4,000 new players 
defaultparticipating
default a minimum of once a week. 
defaultThe project has so far seen 456 women’s teams generated. 
defaultTo make the programme sustainable, Student Management Teams have been devel
defaultoped, supervised by college staff in over 50% of the TEAM 19 leagues. Just Play centres have also been a key intervention in Further Education with 1,000 new participants attending Centres during 2011-12.

defaultJust Play on Further Education and Higher Educatiodefaultn sitesdefault default–
default defaultThrough The FA’s partnership with British University and College Sport 
defaultthousands of
default new participants have taken part in Just Play festivals based on university sites. Between 35-50% of participants, many of whom were international students, did not currently take part in football previously and are now regular participants in the centres
default. Some of the Just Play centres are linked to local football clubs in the community, which enables effective transition pathways to affiliated football. Just Play has also supported the development of new teams and the retention of existing intra-mural tea
defaultms in Higher Education with over 2,600 11-a-side and small sided teams playing regular football. In total there are 51 ‘kickabouts’ established in FE and HE centres.

default&#xa0;defaultConclusiondefault37.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen’s and girl’s football has grown tremendously in the last 20 years and continues to grow. 
defaultThe FA launched its 5 year “Game 
defaultChanger” plan in 2012 to ensure that both the elite and the grassroots game can prosper in the coming years. 
default&#xa0;
default38.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe whole of the female pathway needs to be considered when examining sports policy. 
defaultIncreasing the physical literacy at an early age and ensurin
defaultg girls receive quality coaching focused to their needs at schools will hugely help to ensure that girls enjoy sport and have the opportunity to play if they want to. 
defaultThe current school clubs links programmes are vital to prevent drop off after school and 
defaultsupport should continue for these programmes, perhaps with additional funding for girls’ initiatives. 
default&#xa0;
default39.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor grassroots football, ensuring that facilities are available and of suitable standard will be a challenge in the years to come as the ability to inve
defaultst in and maintain current facilities will come under further pressure. Meanwhile, while elite football is growing stronger, government can play a key role in encouraging media coverage which is so vital for attracting sponsorship to reinvest into the game
default.

defaultBefore 1993 the Women’s Football Association (WFA) was responsible for the women’s game. The WFA was as an independent body in 1969 and was not part of The FA. 
defaultIt focussed on the then fledgling international competitions and even took an England side to th
defaulte finals of the European Championship in 1984. However, they were unable to develop the game at grassroots level due to limited funding.
