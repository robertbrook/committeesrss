[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]T[bold]he Football Association[bold] (The FA)[bold] [WAS0030][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Football Association is the national governing body responsible for football in England. The FA’s remit is to support, govern and develop the game from the grassroots through to the professional game. The FA runs 24 national teams (which 
[normal]include,
[normal] men’s
[normal], women’s, youth and disability teams) and its own competitions such as the Women’s Super League and The FA Cup
[normal] as well as owning and operating Wembley Stadium and St. George’s Park.
[normal] As a not-for-profit organisation, The FA uses revenue created by the Engl
[normal]and teams
[normal], The FA Cup
[normal] and Wembley Stadium to reinvest into the game and run grassroots football. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FA took over Women’s 
[normal]football
[normal] in 1993
[normal] and we 
[normal]are
[normal] celebrat
[normal]ing
[normal] our 20
[normal]th
[normal] anniversary in 2013. 
[normal]Women’s football is now England’s 
[normal]third biggest team sport
[normal] in its own right (after men's football and men's cricket) according to Sport England’s Active People Survey. T
[normal]here 
[normal]are now 
[normal]over 1
[normal],
[normal]400 adult women's club teams, over 3,500 girls’ club teams, 138 female disability teams
[normal], 28,000 qualified female coaches
[normal] and 
[normal]944 registered and active 
[normal]female 
[normal]referees
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FA launched its Game Changer 5-year strategy for women’s football in October 2012. This will deliver a new Elite Performance Unit, a new commercial strategy, a second tier to supp
[normal]ort The FA Women’s Super 
[normal]League
[normal], growth in participation and growth of the fan-base. The FA has committed 
[normal]through this plan 
[normal]to a further £3.5m investment into women’s football in the ne
[normal]xt 5
[normal] years. This adds to the total investment from The FA and its funding partners which this se
[normal]ason exceeded £11m.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]successful 
[normal]growth and development of the women’s game, The FA is working hard to continue to progress the game at all levels. Likewise Government can also help in the game’s evolution and a number of suggestions are includ
[normal]ed in this paper. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Availability of facilities for training and playing sport, for both girls and women, at both elite and grassroots levels[bold]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Football faces a challenge to provide facilities for both men and women. With over 35,000 football pitches across the country, the quality 
[normal]of,
[normal] upkeep of and access to facilities is vital for future participation. Football is particular
[normal]ly
[normal] sensitive to exter
[normal]nal pressures on facilities with 83% of football played on publically owned and managed facilities, 52% of 
[normal]the total
[normal] being in education facilities (and a further 31% in local authority facilities). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These pitches are shared by some 113,000 teams across
[normal] En
[normal]gland
[normal], with 
[normal]5
[normal],000 of these being girls’ and women’s teams. While the number of men’s and boys’ teams dwarf the number of women’s teams, given that 20 years ago there were just 80 women’s teams it is clear how quickly the game is expanding. The numbers also
[normal] go some way to indicate the potential for growth in the women’s game too. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, with 35,000 grass pitches, it is clear that pitches and facilities 
[normal]are 
[normal]nearly always shared between teams. It is important that facilities cater for boys and girls, men a
[normal]nd women alike. This should also be the case for disabled football and, indeed, all aspects of 
[normal]the 
[normal]community
[normal]’s needs
[normal]. Few women’s clubs own their own ground or are primary tenants so it is important that clubs and facility owners alike provide 
[normal]fair
[normal] access 
[normal]to facilities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Women’s Super League now plays a summer league; partly to ensure that ground clashes are no longer an issue and partly to provide a summer alternative which has less competition from other forms of football for fans, sponsors and broad
[normal]casters alike. This has proved successful for the league and the quality of the product and the coverage it 
[normal]receives continue
[normal] to grow. Over recent year, many 
[normal]prominent
[normal] men’s clubs have committed extra resource to the League with the likes of Chelsea, Liver
[normal]pool, Everton and Arsenal 
[normal]support
[normal]ing outstanding women’s teams. Manchester City, who will join the Super League next year, have gone a step further and are to build a first-team stadium for the women’s team. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, i
[normal]f the growth of the women’s game is to continue, the 
[normal]pressure on the country’s facility stock will increase further and this represents a major challenge to football in England. 
[normal]Since 2001 a total of £7
[normal]80m of investment in football facilities has been secu
[normal]red, supported by Football Foundation grants- the Football Foundation is 
[normal]a football facility charity jointly funded by The FA, Premier League and Government/Sport England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All facilities which receive Football Foundation funding are designed to be accessible to all regardless of gender. Team changing rooms are designed to be 'dual-gender', for use by both male and female 
[normal]team
[normal]s, rather than hav
[normal]ing
[normal] separate dedicated facilitie
[normal]s. Features include providing WCs instead of urinals and privacy screens in showers. Facilities must also have two officials' changing rooms to allow concurrent use by male and female match officials' wherever possible. If it is not possible to create dual
[normal] changing rooms- for example when a grant is for a refurbishment and not a rebuild- the club is expected to put a suitable management plan in place to overcome the situation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While the 
[normal]£780m 
[normal]investment
[normal] sound
[normal]s
[normal] huge
[normal], this investment has 
[normal]barely 
[normal]scratched th
[normal]e surface of the renovations and builds required
[normal]. The Foundation has estimated that the investment in the last 10 years has regenerated only around 6% of facilities in 
[normal]England. 
[normal]The FA is committed to continuing this in
[normal]vestment 
[normal]with 
[normal]The FA’s new National Fo
[normal]otball Strategy 
[normal]laying out plans t
[normal]o 
[normal]leverage
[normal] 
[normal]£150m 
[normal]of investment 
[normal]on facilities between 2013 and 2015
[normal] secured against and supported by Football Foundation grants
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Protection of current facilities is therefore very important. The FA would welcome improved protection of playing fields and school facilities and for any future policy to ensure that Sport England’s role as statutory consultee is protected. Likewise stren
[normal]gthening any community programmes 
[normal]that
[normal] protect playing fields, such as Community Right to Bid, would be hugely beneficial for sport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With so many of our football fields owned and run by Local Authorities, any change in provision at this level is 
[normal]of conce
[normal]rn
[normal] for future participation too. 
[normal]County FAs who administer the game locally 
[normal]invest into communities by providing 
[normal]funding
[normal], facilities, 
[normal]volunteering 
[normal]opportunities and the local league structur
[normal]es so important to the community. But local football does
[normal] rely on 
[normal]Local Authorit
[normal]ies
[normal] to provide 
[normal]facilities
[normal] in their region
[normal] and t
[normal]here is a danger that 
[normal]reductions in
[normal] facility 
[normal]maintenance and increases in hire costs
[normal] 
[normal]implemented 
[normal]by Local Authorities will actually create a vicious circle as it will prevent football from invest
[normal]ing locally too. On top of football’s direct investment, figures from the Football Foundation also showed that for every £1 invested in p
[normal]laying facilities, a total of £2.53
[normal] was spent in the supply chain
[normal] meaning that 
[normal]investing in facilities 
[normal]is a 
[normal]worthwhile
[normal] community investment
[normal] that 
[normal]provides a monetary return on investment
[normal]. 
[normal]Central 
[normal]Government could also help leverage this investment at a local level too by promoting capital investment in facilities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With regards to 
[normal]facilities for 
[normal]the England teams, 
[normal]like the men’s teams, 
[normal]the girls’ and women’s teams are based at St. George’s Park, The FA’s coaching centre of excellence. It is also of course important to ensure the structures to feed the elite teams are in place and to this end The FA 
[normal]is
[normal] creat
[normal]ing
[normal] an El
[normal]ite Performance Unit
[normal] (EPU) 
[normal]for the women’s game 
[normal]which 
[normal]will oversee the
[normal] develop
[normal]ment
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]the best young players
[normal]. 
[normal]This consists of 29 new Player Development Centres, 31 FA Girls’ Centres of Excellence and
[normal] 
[normal]3
[normal] Elite Performance Camps to provide an effective link 
[normal]between emerging talent and international football. To support this structure, The FA has also created a new Head of 
[normal]Women’s 
[normal]Elite 
[normal]Performance
[normal] role
[normal]. These changes 
[normal]will drive the strategic development of the player and coach pathways to help build winning teams. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Finance, including sponsorship and prize money[bold]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he FA’s financial model, as a not-for-profit organisation, is to raise revenue from the England teams, FA C
[normal]up
[normal] (and other competitions)
[normal] and Wembley Stadium to then reinvest back into the game. It is naturally therefore important that The FA can accrue the highest possible value from its media rights and sponsorship deals. This model funds what is known as the Na
[normal]tional Game Strategy; 
[normal]our
[normal] four year delivery plan for grassroots football. The current £200m investment plan which runs until 2015 focuses on 
[normal]providing flexible formats of football; increasing football opportunities and the profile of women and minority gr
[normal]oups; raising the standard of player
[normal] and 
[normal]spectator behaviour across the grassroots game; retaining and develop
[normal]ing
[normal] the existing number of grassroots teams; bring
[normal]ing
[normal] in changes to youth football; and maximis
[normal]ing
[normal] investment in facilities. 
[normal]While 
[normal]all 
[normal]of 
[normal]the
[normal]se pr
[normal]iorities are important
[normal] and 
[normal]women’s and girls’ football is an integral part of each strand, it was felt important that 
[normal]opportunities for women and minority groups was
[normal] explicitly covered as a key element of the strategy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This National Game Strategy works in
[normal] parallel with the Whole Sport Plan
[normal]- 
[normal]the delivery plan 
[normal]agreed with Sport England 
[normal]against which a
[normal] 
[normal]national governing 
[normal]bodies
[normal] (NGB)
[normal] is accountable when in receipt of 
[normal]Government funding
[normal]. The Plan
[normal] is agreed with Sport England and, for football, provides around £
[normal]30
[normal]m of funding over four years for specific interventions aimed at increasing participation. For all
[normal] NGBs
[normal], women and girl’s participation is part of the governing bodies’ Whole Sport Plan. O
[normal]ver a number of years now, Whole Sport Plans have provided NGBs with both stability and guidance in long term planning and delivery. They are proving an effective mechanism to deliver sport across the country and The FA would encourage the 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee to ens
[normal]ure continuity of delivery by supporting the ongoing use of Whole Sport Plans. While further intervention in women
[normal]’s
[normal] and girl’s sport may well be appropriate, any recommendations should provide additionality to the 
[normal]current 
[normal]plans Sport England and National 
[normal]Governing Bodies already have in place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women’s football is not a professional sport in England and, after previously failed attempts in both England and USA to professionalise the game or individual teams, The FA’s approach is to build the structures of the game carefully rather than rushing in
[normal]to professionalising the sport. 
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This building process has seen significant progress in
[normal] 
[normal]elite 
[normal]women’s football
[normal]. A
[normal]s the product 
[normal]and coverage 
[normal]has improved, 
[normal]so
[normal] has interest in the game
[normal] from supporters
[normal] and, correspondingly
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]from potential sponsors
[normal]. When workin
[normal]g with sponsors, The FA is particularly keen to work with partners who look to activate their sponsorship and become closely involved in our grassroots work. 
[normal]The FA now has a full women’s partner programme with Nike, Vauxhall, Continental and BT Sport. One
[normal] of the examples of our partners activating their sponsorship is
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] girl’s 
[normal]Fanzones 
[normal]which are held 
[normal]ahead of televised WSL 
[normal]matches and 
[normal]the 
[normal]women’s and girl’s festivals across the country
[normal]. These are held with Continental Tyres and are aimed at 
[normal]introduc
[normal]ing
[normal] t
[normal]he chance to play 
[normal]football 
[normal]to new audiences
[normal]. 
[normal]In 2013 we have so far held 10 FA Girl’s Football Festivals and 11 Fanzones reaching nearly 6,000 participants aged 5-17. There are another 13 events remaining this year and we therefore expect to beat last year
[normal]’s 7,000 participants. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Media coverage[bold]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As outlined in the previous section, t
[normal]he Government has done a good job in recent years in raising the profile of women’s sport with broadcasters and in particular 
[normal]free to air
[normal] Broadcasters. There is no doubt that there is more coverage of women’s 
[normal]sport
[normal] on TV
[normal], radio and on-line
[normal] now although 
[normal]we would welcome 
[normal]more coverage 
[normal]in all 
[normal]of these 
[normal]areas and 
[normal]also 
[normal]particularly
[normal] in the 
[normal]printed 
[normal]press where 
[normal]the volume
[normal] of women’s sport 
[normal]coverage 
[normal]a
[normal]ppears to lag behind the other media.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Olympics certainly played its part increasing interest in women’s sport and increased media coverage could be considered as a hugely positive Olympic Legacy. In football some 80,203 spectators watched USA beat Jap
[normal]an in the Olympic final
[normal], with 70,584 watching Team GB beat Brazil earlier in the competition- a
[normal] peak of 3.9m viewers watched 
[normal]Team GB’s victory. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Now with The FA Cup Final, Euro 2013, World Cup Qualifiers and a weekly round-up programme on the BBC along wi
[normal]th live WSL and Conti-Cup matches on BT 
[normal]Sport
[normal], the coverage of women’s football is 
[normal]growing stronger
[normal] and both the BBC and BT Sport should be praised for their recent commitment to the women’s game. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reasons why participation in sport by women decreases[bold]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of The FA’s three key strategic priorities is “Football for 
[normal]Everyone
[normal]”. This means ensuring that everyone who wants to play the game can and that barriers- whether real or perceived- are removed. This goes for all groups across the country, but of cours
[normal]e is particularly important for girls and women. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R
[normal]easons for drop out in sport are well documented
[normal] in academic papers
[normal]. These can cover 
[normal]biological factors (
[normal]hereditary, age, obesity, 
[normal]fitness
[normal] level)
[normal], 
[normal]psychological factors (motivation, perceived barriers, pe
[normal]rceived competence, attitudes)
[normal], 
[normal]environmental factors (access, activity type, school, mobility)
[normal] and 
[normal]social factors (peer group, family, culture, role models)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FA work closely with the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation to try to 
[normal]look at practical p
[normal]roblems particular to football to 
[normal]prevent drop out in girls. WSFF highlighted a number of reasons for drop out in their 2010 report sighting a 
[normal]l
[normal]ack of opportunity to play matches, that girls thought it was ‘time for something new’, conflicting with other c
[normal]ommitments, lack of players, the big jump from junior to senior leagues, competing social pressures, 
[normal]the level of
[normal] coaching and lack of support from schools. 
[normal]In 
[normal]its 
[normal]report t
[normal]he WSFF highlighted coaching and lack of support in schools as the two issues most p
[normal]ertinent to football. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A third issue for players who have played to a good standard at youth level is that they don't see 
[normal]that
[normal] remaining 
[normal]in
[normal] football 
[normal]as a potential career path for a sporting future. To combat these beliefs, The FA recently embarked on an initiative called “Kick-Off Your 
[normal]Career” with WSFF in order to provide direction and help for girls and women looking for a future in football. This i
[normal]nitiative provides guidance for a whole range of careers from coaching to sports administration and sports medicine to sports law. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The coaching needs for boys and girls appear to be different. Boys tell us they want an experienced and qualified coach, wh
[normal]ile girls have told us the qualities they need are an understanding and empathetic coach. To this end we have 
[normal]just completed working with Us Girls (through Streetgames) to deliver sessions to all our County FA staff on the importance of tailoring sessions 
[normal]to the needs and motivations of 
[normal]young female players
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Likewise our 
[normal]FA 
[normal]Tesco Skills
[normal] coaches are fully trained to deliver to boys and girls. Our FA Tesco Skills primary school programme (5-11 year olds) sees our coaches deliver football physical literacy sessions in schools to pupils and provide tailored support for teachers to train them
[normal] to deliver such programmes in the future. This age group is so important 
[normal]because,
[normal] if youngsters can be taught well and master basic physical literacy skills
[normal],
[normal] they are more likely to approach physical education with enthusiasm in secondary school and devel
[normal]op a sporting habit for life. The FA Tesco Skills programme has, since its creation in 2007, supported over 21,500 teachers in 7,500 schools and provided 4.5m places to children- 57% boys and 43% girls. The 
[normal]in-curriculum 
[normal]programme is free for schools. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ce
[normal]ntral to meeting the physical literacy challenge is addressing the deficiency in sport and physical education experience amongst teaching staff in the primary sector and the access to high quality PE provision for boys and girls under the age of 11.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given
[normal] that the WSFF has identified that 
[normal]the level of coaching 
[normal]and lack of support from schools are key factors in the drop out from girls football, increasing the number of teachers with a sporting interest and training and up-skilling those to deliver quality 
[normal]PE is essential. The FA welcome’s the Government’s current pilot projects which aim to up-skill PE teachers, but would nevertheless hope for further increases in physical education training during Initial Teacher Training. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]School sport policy has, of cou
[normal]rse, recently been altered and The FA supports the Government’s focus on making changes to the resourcing and provision of sport in the primary sector. We believe that this is the right area of focus and that specifically the physical literacy of school ch
[normal]ildren at an early age needs to be improved. 
[normal]The FA
[normal] strongly believe in the principle “that whatever gets measured gets done”
[normal], so 
[normal]we welcome the Government’s further announcement that there will be a formal Ofsted measurement of sporting provision by Prima
[normal]ry Schools and that schools will be required to publicly report on how they invest their school sport funding. Ensuring this assessment continues in future years would be an important policy priority and
[normal], while The FA appreciates that schools are empowered
[normal] to spend funds to best suit their needs,
[normal] considering the split of resource in schools
[normal] to ensure 
[normal]that 
[normal]both boys and girls receive this investment would be welcome
[normal]. 
[normal]In America investment in school sport must be equitable. While this requirement (known as Ti
[normal]tle 9) was largely introduced to curb high spending on American Football teams and is perhaps not directly transferable to the UK, the principle of equitable investment for schools is one worth considering here too. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While providing good sport provision in
[normal] schools is important to ensure children have the physical literacy to enjoy sport, it also important to ensure that programmes exist outside school in order to combat both boys and girls dropping out of football as they leave school
[normal]. The Government could 
[normal]help encourage 
[normal]further
[normal] support for girls’ and women’s sport by providing additional rate relief or favourable VAT rates 
[normal](which could be allowed under the EU VAT Directive)
[normal] 
[normal]for community clubs that
[normal] 
[normal]target
[normal] 
[normal]drop off. 
[normal]The FA 
[normal]already 
[normal]has a number of programmes 
[normal]which aim to 
[normal]target drop off
[normal] for both boys and girls
[normal], for example
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Club Links Transition Programme[bold] [bold]– 
[normal]‘Join Our Club,’ our club links player transition programme to Charter Standard clubs, has contributed to the growth and retention of over 2,000 Charter S
[normal]tandard Teams. 
[normal]Charter Standard is The FA’s accreditation for clubs which are well run, sustainable, safe clubs- in order to achieve this status you must run both male and female teams. 
[normal]A range of recreational programmes have also been developed as part of
[normal] the process to cater for those young people not ready to make the transition to affiliated football, with over 5,000 boys and girls now playing regularly in recreational programmes. 
[normal]In the first half of 2013
[normal],
[normal] 2,257 girls
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]joined a Charter Standard Team and 
[normal]around 
[normal]28,000 girls 
[normal]took
[normal] part in various programmes including coaching and festivals
[normal] as part of this programme. In total, around 9,000 girls have joined teams since the programme started in 2009.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The[bold] [bold]FA Wome[bold]n &amp; Girls programme[bold] with Premier League 4 Sport[bold] [bold]–
[normal] The Premier League 4 Sport (PL4S) is a very successful community programme which uses the power of football club brands to engage with youngsters in the community in football and a variety of sports. The FA
[normal] has designed a 
[normal]Women &amp; Girls programme to be used by PL clubs and is providing funding for the Clubs to create specific interventions to increase access to football for young women using the successful PL4S satellite model. Each club will form a network o
[normal]f 12 satellites through which they will provide opportunities for women aged 14 to 25 to try football and create a supportive environment for them to develop their skills. The satellites will be linked to a variety of exit routes including local teams. A s
[normal]imilar project will also run with Football League clubs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Football Futures (Leadership and Volunteering Programme)[bold] [bold]–
[normal] 
[normal]The FA Football Futures Leadership and Volunteering programme has supported over 
[normal]12
[normal],000 new young volunteers working in Charter Standard Clu
[normal]bs or educational programmes through affiliated and recreational football programmes. 
[normal]Over 4,000 of these were young women volunteers. 
[normal]During the first two quarters of 2011-12 season over 30,000 voluntary hours were logged.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]35.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]College[bold] and Community Football Coordinators (CCFC)[bold] [bold]– CCFCs
[normal] [bold]work directly with the 16-19 year olds in Further Education and Sixth Form colleges. As part of the CCFC programme TEAM 19 was successfully launched in partnership with British Colleges Sport in December 
[normal]2011, engaging over 60 colleges in the programme and resulting in 4,000 new players 
[normal]participating
[normal] a minimum of once a week. 
[normal]The project has so far seen 456 women’s teams generated. 
[normal]To make the programme sustainable, Student Management Teams have been devel
[normal]oped, supervised by college staff in over 50% of the TEAM 19 leagues. Just Play centres have also been a key intervention in Further Education with 1,000 new participants attending Centres during 2011-12.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]36.

[normal]Just Play on Further Education and Higher Educatio[bold]n sites[bold] [bold]–
[normal] [bold]Through The FA’s partnership with British University and College Sport 
[normal]thousands of
[normal] new participants have taken part in Just Play festivals based on university sites. Between 35-50% of participants, many of whom were international students, did not currently take part in football previously and are now regular participants in the centres
[normal]. Some of the Just Play centres are linked to local football clubs in the community, which enables effective transition pathways to affiliated football. Just Play has also supported the development of new teams and the retention of existing intra-mural tea
[normal]ms in Higher Education with over 2,600 11-a-side and small sided teams playing regular football. In total there are 51 ‘kickabouts’ established in FE and HE centres.
[normal] 
[normal]Over the two years of the project, 
[normal]over 6,000 players have taken part in Just Play Recreat
[normal]ional centres, with 821

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Conclusion[bold]37.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women’s and girl’s football has grown tremendously in the last 20 years and continues to grow. 
[normal]The FA launched its 5 year “Game 
[normal]Changer” plan in 2012 to ensure that both the elite and the grassroots game can prosper in the coming years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]38.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The whole of the female pathway needs to be considered when examining sports policy. 
[normal]Increasing the physical literacy at an early age and ensurin
[normal]g girls receive quality coaching focused to their needs at schools will hugely help to ensure that girls enjoy sport and have the opportunity to play if they want to. 
[normal]The current school clubs links programmes are vital to prevent drop off after school and 
[normal]support should continue for these programmes, perhaps with additional funding for girls’ initiatives. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For grassroots football, ensuring that facilities are available and of suitable standard will be a challenge in the years to come as the ability to inve
[normal]st in and maintain current facilities will come under further pressure. Meanwhile, while elite football is growing stronger, government can play a key role in encouraging media coverage which is so vital for attracting sponsorship to reinvest into the game

[normal] 
[normal]Before 1993 the Women’s Football Association (WFA) was responsible for the women’s game. The WFA was as an independent body in 1969 and was not part of The FA. 
[normal]It focussed on the then fledgling international competitions and even took an England side to th
[normal]e finals of the European Championship in 1984. However, they were unable to develop the game at grassroots level due to limited funding.
