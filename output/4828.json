"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Intu Properties plc (FD03)IntroductionWe are pleased to make a submission to the Committee’s inquiry into the many and interrelated issues relevant to any proposals to increase fiscal devolution to English cities and city regions. We note the Chair of the Committee acknowledges (commenting on \nthe launch of the inquiry) that fiscal devolution will \ncreate impacts which are not necessarily easy to predict ahead of any roll out of fiscal change and, we imagine, such knock on effects for good or otherwise will not become apparent until time has pass\ned.\n In summary:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAbout intu&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntu Properties plc – key facts   *As at December 2012 – exclud\ning \nintu Midsummer Place\n&#xa0;Intu portfolio size (as at March 2013)\n16 regional shopping centres\n17\n million square feet\nover 2,500\n stores\n&#xa0;\nEmployment supported by intu centres*\n&#xa0;\n74,550 direct jobs\n21,320 indirect jobs\n&#xa0;\nPercentage of UK\n retail jobs provided by intu*\n2%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEconomic contribution*\n&#xa0;\n£1.4bn annually\n&#xa0;\nInvestment in major new development in our centres since 2008*\n&#xa0;£126m\n&#xa0;\nBusiness rates paid by intu and our tenants in 2012*\n&#xa0;\n£249.8m\n&#xa0;\nIntu’s response to CLG Committee call for evidence on the conceptIn terms of our business we seek to develop our activity and associated economic contribution in many parts of the UK (see map on p.2) and many of the locatio\nns where we operate face economic and social problems above the national average. \nWe are concerned at the continuing trend for English regions, not uniformly of course, to underperform London and there is a need for better understanding of why this is happ\nening and how the regions can be made to perform better. Cities where the bulk of the population live and city regions\n deserve focussed support to stimulate \ntheir ability to drive \nrecovery and we look to any new devolutio\nn of fiscal powers to \ntake account \nof\n the existing efforts of the private sector in such areas.\nAn area well worth exploring and of interest to us as a business investing in so many city centres and regions of \nEngland.  Enhancing local responsibility and\n fiscal freedoms must be accompanied by genuine accountability and transparency so that others investing locally and regionally can continue to plan with \nthe best \nknowledge and certainty. If fiscal devolution empowers better local leadership and longer-ter\nm finan\ncial strategies\n and investment then private sector investors li\nke intu will broadly welcome that outcome\n. \nAlong\nside ‘leadership’ and closely related we see t\nhis \nas a\n key\n issue\n. How would existing structures \nchange\n/come together? \n And other bodies beyond the current tiers of local government;\n LEPs, Parish Council's and Neighbourhood Forums, how would they be made/encouraged to act in concert as requir\ned/dictate\nd by new arrangements?\n In terms of this question and some others the success or otherwise of the LEP model may be instructive\n.\n \nAny new models of fiscal devolution\n seeking to act\n as much needed spurs to local action should also encourage closer engagement a\nnd partnership with the private sector in consideration of the best and most sustainable economic outcomes.\n  The law of unintended consequences should be assessed especially in respect of any new structures which might be brought to life by fiscal devoluti\non.\nA key point and likely to be the caus\ne of \nuncertainty/lack of action\n in \nterms of \nprivate sector inv\ne\nstment \nunless \nsuch impacts are investigated in detail\n ahead of \nthe roll out of \nany changes \ndesigned to promote\n fiscal devolution.\n&#xa0;\nThese are substantial, compl\nicated and inter-related issues and s\nhould be considered ahead of any large-scale constitutional change. \n The operation of Business Rates, a subject referenced in the recent Autumn Statement, should, in particular, be subject to review and, in our view, reform before extending fiscal devoluti\non in any way.\nB) Intu’s response to CLG Committee call for evidence on the detailsConsideration of fiscal devolution should\n not preclude early and\n detailed consideration of the nature and operation of any taxes, grants and formulas in current operation. In the case of Business Rates we and many others have called upon the government to review the operation of the tax and consider reform.\n  We submitt\ned our views on Business \nRates \nto\n a recent Inquiry by the BIS Committee and our key concerns are given below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOf indirect relevance to pr\nivate se\nctor investors like intu. We do,\n however\n,\n seek to engage with local authorities about stra\ntegic and infrastructure issues\n in\ncluding \npublic realm, transport\n \nand highways. C\nhanges to\n the\n borrowing powers \nof public bodies \ncould affect\n consideration o\nf\n these matters and\n influence our investment and planning decisions. \nA return\n, if that was the outcome,\n to more proactive \nand strategic \nconsideration of infrastructure improvements by local authorities would be welcomed by businesses like ours which invest \nin the creation of local and regional destinations and \ngenerate \neconomic activity and employment as a result.\n6 January 2014\n6\n&#xa0;\n Figures from British Retail Consortium\n Figures from Association of Convenience Stores\n"
