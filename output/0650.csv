default1. Carbon Brief
default is an organisation which analyses and reports on media coverage of climate change and climate science, and its effect on climate politics and public perceptions of climate issues. Our funding comes from the European Climate Foundation
default.
default&#xa0;
default2. We report on new scientific research and areas of scient
defaultific discussion in the media, and
default have analysed many examples of how the media reports climate change.
default At the start of this year we conducted polling examining public attitudes to climate change and energy policy.
"default&#xa0;default3. The committee asks: ""What is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent years?""default&#xa0;"
default4. One common measure of public opinion on climate change is 'belief' - to what extent people agree with scientists that the climate is changing and human activity is largely responsible. This might be taken as a basic measure of public understanding of the issue. 
default&#xa0;
default5. The leak and subsequent media coverage of emails from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit
default, dubbed ‘Climategate’ in the media,
default is often presented as a watershed in public acceptance of climate science. At roughly the same time the Copenhagen climate summit was widely presented as a failure in the media
default, and this may have had an impact on public opinion on climate change
default. 
defaultPolling
default in 2010, shortly after both events, indicated the number of people who said they believed climate change was ‘definitely’ happening dropped from 40 per cent to 33 per cent.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6. But despite concerns that ‘C
defaultlimategate
default’
default, Copenhagen or other factors
default have reduced climate science’s credibility in the eyes of the public, it appears that ‘belief’ in climate change has stayed fairly steady over the years
default since
default. A 2009 ICM poll showed 89 per cent of respondents accepted some degree of climate change is happening.
default When ICM repeated the poll in 2012, 87 per cent said the climate is changing. Similarly, polling we conducted this year indicates 89 per cent of respondents believe climate change is happening.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7. A comparison between the ICM polls and 
defaultCarbon Brief’s
default survey also indicates public understanding of what is causing climate change has not changed significantly. 56 per cent of people asked in 2009 said climate change is real
default and human caused according to polling by
default ICM
default for the Guardian. ICM asked the question
default again
default in 2012, and the figure was 57 per cent. 33 per cent in 2009 and 30 per cent in 2012 said climate change is due mostly to natural causes, according to ICM’s data. Carbon Brief’s 2013 polling shows 52 per cent of respondents to our poll said climate change is mostly caused by humans. 31 per cent sa
defaultid climate change 
defaultis mostly caused by natural processes.

defaultappear to have 
defaultreduced somewhat in 2010, but to have now returned to around the same level as before the ‘Climategate’ leak
default and Copenhagen conference
default. Belief in climate change appears to have stayed fairly steady 
defaultin
default recent years, as has people’s view of whether humans are causing climate change or not. 
default&#xa0;
"default9. The committee asks: ""Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments"," scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?""default&#xa0;"
default10. 
defaultTo focus on the trust issue: 
defaultOur polling shows the public trusts scientists most highly to give them information about climate change. 69 per cent of respondents said they tru
defaultsted scientists in this context
default 
default- 
defaultsignificantly higher than any other group. In contrast, politicians poll joint last with blogs and social media - at seven per cent. This finding tallies with Ipsos Mori’s veracity index,
default which indicates scientists are one of the most trusted groups in society. Here again, politicians come last.
default&#xa0;
default11. Polling by Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) suggests differently - that the public does not trust climate scientists to give information about climate science.
default LWEC’s polling found only 38 per cent of respondents said scientists could be trusted to “tell the truth” about climate change. ('Tend to agree' or 'strongly agree'.) 
default&#xa0;
default12. 
defaultBut analysis by polling expert Leo Barasi, published on Carbon Brief,
default suggests aspects of the way the poll was constructed may have influenced this low result. Barasi says:
default&#xa0;
default13. “The phrasing of the LWEC question - ‘we can trust climate scientists to tell us the truth’ - is a very high bar. At a time when trust is low, expecting people to say they trust anyone to tell them the truth, without more reassurance, is asking a lot. I'm also not a fan of the way the trust question came after questions about exaggeration of climate change and agreement among scientists.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default “Add to this Mori's trust index, which finds scientists are among the most trusted groups, and that trust in them has gone up over the last decade. So I don't think we should be particularly surprised that the new poll showed scientists are the most trusted to deliver information about climate change by a massive margin. The mistake was ever to doubt that they were.”
default&#xa0;
default15. Polling suggests scientists are the group the public trusts most to give information about climate change. In terms of increasing public understanding of the issue and engagement with it, this suggests there is an opportunity for scientists to contribute to informing discussion about the issue. In our view scientists should establish themselves as voices in the debates around climate change that take place in the media and politics. There are a range of views on how they should do so, reflected in the active academic debate around how scientists should inform policymaking and the public.
default&#xa0;
"default16. The committee asks: ""How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?""default&#xa0;"
default17. To focus on media coverage of climate change: In our view it is very likely that how the media covers climate change informs public views and understanding about climate change. The media help shape 
defaulthow climate change is discussed
default by the public and politicians, and 
defaultmedia coverage also
default reflect
defaults
default how the issue is discussed - particularly in the political sphere.
default&#xa0;
default18. There are many examples of media coverage of climate change that does a good job of reflecting and explaining scientific debates around the issue. At its best, such coverage can info
defaultrm the public and policymakers 
defaultand equip them to engage with questions about climate and energy policy. To take one recent example
default,
default ITV addressed the UK’s cold winter in a series of 
defaultsegments that
default presented a range of scientific views on the degree to which climate change is affecting UK weather. The report
defaults
default gave a picture of the issue, presented the views of different scientists, and reflected scientific uncertainty about the question.
default&#xa0;
default19. On a larger scale, the BBC’s Frozen Planet series provided a good example of entertaining and informative science programming. Climate change is leading to significant changes at the poles, and the series illustrated the long-term effects of warming rather than engaging in complex scientific questions. Extra and more detailed information was also made available through resource packs and via scientific institutions the British Antarctic Survey and the Open University. The programme may have increased interest in and understanding of this issue.
default&#xa0;
default20. However, our experience suggests that some media coverage of climate change and climate science in particular is confused or misleading, and does not do a good job of representing scientific understanding or scientific debates accurately. In particular, scientific uncertainty can be over-stressed to cast doubt on areas of climate science where there is broad scientific agreement. This may lead to confusion and disengagement in the public.
default&#xa0;
default21. To some degree coverage of climate change in the media has become politicised. The Reuters Institute at Oxford University recently produced a report, 'Poles Apart',
"default which suggests 'right-leaning' media outlets are more likely to print uncontested climate sceptic views - reflecting a small minority of scientific opinion. The report suggests this aspect of climate change coverage is most prominent in the ""Anglophone countries"" - the UK"," Australia and the US. It found ""a strong correspondence between the perspective of a newspaper and the prevalence of sceptical voices within it"," particularly on the opinion pages."" Politicisation of the issue in the media may reflect the politicisation of climate politics in these countries."
default&#xa0;
default22. The BBC is probably the most influential media outlet in the UK. The organisation’s editorial convention of promoting balance - favouring neither one view or another - has been 
defaultsuggested
default 
defaultproving challenging when
default 
defaultcovering scientific areas where there is broad agreement
default. The BBC Trust’s 2011 review of science coverage by Professor Steven Jones
default highlighted that in scientific areas such as climate
default change,
default genetic modification
default or MMR which become controversial for whatever reason
default, this convention can have the effect of suggesting there is an even-sided debate between proponents and dissenters, when in fact there is significant agreement between scientists.
default&#xa0;
default23. The BBC issued a report last November
default expressing satisfaction that the corporation has made progress in portraying where the weight of opinion on scientific topics lies. But we have seen 
defaultprominent
default examples of programmes in which the BBC
default has framed climate change as a
default debate between ‘sceptics’ and 'believers'. These include an episode of the Daily Politics in June 2012
default in which climate sceptic blogger James Delingpole debated with Friends of the Earth’s Andrew Pendleton about whether an apparent slowdown in global surface temperature rise meant global warming had 'stopped'. It is a subject that, arguably, neither party is qualified to discuss. Instead of investigating the scientific arguments about the subject, the report reinforced the idea that climate change is a political argument, not a subject on which scientists agree. Similar discussions were also found on Radio 5’s Your Call, the Today programme and Newsnight.
default&#xa0;
default24. We focus on the BBC due to its influence on public opinion - it is also more trusted by the public than other media. But there are many other examples of coverage that creates a confusing picture of climate science and also conflates relatively detailed issues of uncertainty in climate science with broad arguments about climate policy. The Daily Mail has recently published a series of articles under headlines claiming that global warming had 'stopped', which went on to attack government policies to reduce emissions
default. Most recently Channel 4 news ran a segment that nominally aimed to address whether climate change caused the UK’s recent cold weather, but the discussion soon turned to whether scientists can account for the apparent slowing in global temperatures and then to whether climate policies are justified. Rapid jumps between detailed scientific specifics, broad scientific conclusions and pundits or politicians arguing about climate policy are unlikely to increase understanding in audiences.
default&#xa0;
"default25. The committee asks: ""What evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?default&#xa0;"
default26. Although useful to indicate broad trends, polling about belief in climate change is unlikely to give a full picture of public understanding of climate change, and the complex question of 
defaulthow people’s understanding of the issue interacts with support for
default climate policies. Our polling, for example, found a significant proportion of those who say they don’t believe in human-caused climate change still say they want the government to invest in ‘green’ policies. Unpacking exactly why this might be is beyond the scope of broad polls.
default&#xa0;
default27. 11 per cent of those Carbon Brief polled said they do not believe in climate change, and 33 per cent believe it is mostly due to natural causes. But a large proportion of this group still appears to support measures aimed at reducing emissions. 
default&#xa0;
default28. 67 per cent of those we polled said that they want to see the government tackle climate change through policies such as promoting renewable energy or energy efficiency. 
defaultOf those who think climate change or global warming is mostly caused by natural processes (about a third of the total), 45 per cent think that tackling climate change should still be part of the government's economic programme. 
defaultThis may indicate indicate that belief or understanding of human-caused
default climate change is not an accurate 
defaultindicator of whether or not people support policy measures to address and limit climate change.
default&#xa0;
default29. This result mirrors the outcome 
defaultof
default 
defaultan Angus Reid poll
default conducted in the UK, which was released just after the Copenhagen climate summit and the ‘Climategate’ leak - events that are widely reported in the media as being the cause of scepticism in the public. The poll shows that even among those who said they did not believe climate change was happening, a majority said they wanted global action to tackle climate change. 
default&#xa0;
default30. Another recent poll i
defaultn the US 
defaultis also interesting
default – it 
defaultindicates that while just 52 per cent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they thought climate change was happening, 62 per cent said the US should take steps to address the issue and 77 per cent thought the US should use more renewable energy.
default&#xa0;
default31. Although the results are 
defaultlimited
default, they suggest that the factors influencing how people answer questions about the causes of climate change are more complex than merely being about belief or understanding. 
default&#xa0;
default32. Writing for Carbon Brief, Barasi says a possible explanation for the discrepancy between statements of belief in climate change and desire for action is that some people react to the question of whether they believe in human caused climate change as though they are being asked whether they buy into a vision of environmentalism
default.
default Barasi says: “[They] say no to that question but still want the government to do something about climate change’.
default&#xa0;
default33. Attempts to measure public belief i
defaultn climate change appear to be at best an imprecise 
defaultindication of whether the public will accept climate policy. Increasing public understanding of climate science is important, as it can enable people to hold informed opinions and make good choices about climate policy. However, there is evidence to suggest that the public already wa
defaultnts to see the issue addressed.
default Focusing on the level of understanding as an analogue for acceptance or de
defaultsire for policy may not give a full 
defaultpicture of whether the public supports energy and climate change policies.
