"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Scope1.1.\n&#xa0; \nScope remains \nconcerned that the payment of the housing element of Universal Credit (UC) direct to \ntenants within their monthly payment will lead to increased arrears, and that changes to support for mortgage interest will equate to further cuts for disabled people.\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nImpact assessments have shown that changes to the uprating of Housing Benefit \n(HB) \nwill \nentail huge losses for disabled people\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nPenalties for under-occupancy in the social rented sector will have a grave impact on disabled people who either require extra space for needs relating to their disability, or are unable to move\n house. \n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe cap on Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) will lead to inappropriate trade-offs between HB and disability benefits – meaning inevitable losses for disabled \npeople.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0; \nScope recommends that\n the Government\n:\n1.4.1.\n Put in place proper provisions to ensure disabled people do not risk falling into arrears because of changes through UC\n1.4.2.\n \nR\neconsider the zero-earning\ns rule, and make provisions in light of \nthe barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employ\nment.\n1.4.3. Make \nexemption\ns\n in regulations for disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for being unable to move, or needing the extra space\n.\n1.4.4\n \nPut in place \nclear safeguards for disability benefits within the\n AME\n cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nWe all want to live in a world of opportunity – to be able to live our own life, play our part and be valued for the person we are. At \nScope we’re passionate about possibility.\n&#xa0;\n It inspires us every day and means we never set limits on people’s potential. We work with disabled people and their families at every stage of their lives.\n&#xa0;\n From offering day to day support and information, to ch\nallenging assumptions about disability and influencing decision makers – everything we do is about creating real and lasting change. We believe that a world where all disabled people have the same opportunities as everyone else would be a pretty incredible\n place for all of us. Together we can make it happen.\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nFor further information, please contact \nEllie Brawn \n(Public Policy Advisor), on \nellie.brawn@scope.org.uk\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0; \nFor m\nost households, UC \nwill be paid a single monthly payment, with the housing element being directly paid to tenants as part of it. We remain concerned that this will have huge implications for disabled people\n -\n partly because they have\n been in the dark \nabout the changes affecting them\n \n(In 2012 almost half (45%) of all disabled people had never even heard of UC) \n– but largely because the change will affect the \nway those on extremely tight budgets will be required to manage their money\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0; \nThe DWP has itself accepted that – even with the exceptions outlined in the Lo\ncal Support Services framework\n \n \n– the change from weekly to monthly welfare payments will increase the overall demand for advice.\n  \n4.3\n&#xa0; \nHousing associations \nhave expressed concerns that \ntenants will\n use the \nhousing element \nof their U\nC payment \nto meet more pressing financial needs, \nmeaning they fall into arrears.\n \nD\nisabled people are experiencing \nconsiderable \nfinancial diff\niculties; Scope commissioned research \nshowed that nearly half (49%) disabled people are relying on credit to pay for the basics in life such as clothing and food, and are three times as likely to turn to doorstep loans (10% compared to 3% non-disabled people).\n Disabled people are also more vu\nlnerable to financial shocks- \nover a third (37%) say they could not afford an unexpected – but necessary – expense of £500, compared to a quarter \nof non-disabled people (26%).\n \nThis problem is therefore likely to be \nmore acute for disabled people. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nNational Housing Federation believes that the removal of direct payment alone could see arrears rise by £320million across the sector – a 100% rise based on our estimates of total rent arrears (together with a further £100million of additional transaction \ncosts).\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0; \nRecommendation: \nScope echoes the committee’s \nrecommendation that the Government moves quickly to publish a clear\n&#xa0;\ndefinition of \"vulnerable\" groups within Universal Credit for whom it will not be appropriate to include housing costs in their \nbenefit payment. It also needs to establish a robust process for proactively identifying claimants who are struggling to manage their housing costs so that they can be properly assisted before they fall into arrears and face eviction.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0; \nScope is concerned that the introduction of the zero-earnings rule for support for mortgage interest will disproportionately affect disabled people. The rule means that recipients will not receive any hel\np with mortgage costs if they are doing any paid work, no matter how few hours. \nIn their response, the\n G\novernment writes that “having a mortgage to pay provides a strong incentive for moving into full-time employment”\n and that the rule will move people to “\nre-consider their position with regard to the amount of work they do or the level of their housing costs\n”.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nDisabled people are more likely to be working in low-paid, short-term and part-time jobs\n: \nThe \nwage gap \nbetw\neen disabled and non-disabled people \nremains higher than £1 an hour\n. Many disabled people want to work - 1 in 6 would like to work more hours compared with 1 in 10 non-disabled people\n- but face numerous barriers to the labour market\n. \nThese barriers include \nhousing; social care; other employment support; workplace culture such as employer perceptions; low confidence; difficulties accessing flexible working arrangements; fewer demonstrable skills, qualifications and experience than the w\nider population.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nB\nut for those who \nface barriers to working more hours, or entering \nfull time employment, the incen\ntives \nfor disabled people with a mortgage \nare redundant, and will simp\nly \nmean \nmore cuts to the support \nthey \nreceive.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0; \nRecommendation: \nScope\n urges the Government to reconsider the zero-earnings rule, and make provisions for the barriers disabled people face in finding full-time employment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0; \nScope remains deeply concerned that the size \ncriteria in the \nsocial rented sector are\n \ndisproportionately affect\ning\n disabled people. \nSince 1 April 2013, working age renters in the social sector have had their Housing Benefit (HB) reduced if judged to have a spare room.\n \nIf they have 1 ‘spare’ room their HB is reduced \nby 14%, if they have two or more ‘spare’ rooms\n their HB is reduced by 25%. Tenants are faced with two choices – move to a smaller property or find a way to make up the shortfall. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0; \nThe majority of those affected are \ndisabled people\n. \n660 000 people in total\n will be affected by the \nsize criteria \nby 2015, losing between £624 and £1144 per year. 420 000 (63%) of those af\nfected will be disabled people.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0; \nMany disabled people need an additional room for specialist equipment; or so that \nthey can sleep separately \nfrom their partner\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0; \nOn top of this, moving house is not an option for many disabled people. \nSome \nwith mental health conditions find the thou\nght of moving very distressing; those with certain physical impairments \nwill find packing and moving house \nimpossible, and hiring someone to help, too expensive\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0; \nMany \ndisabled social housing tenants have been allocated their home on the basis of their needs, or have had adaptations made to improve accessibility\n.\n With a lack of alternative accessible housing av\nailable, these disabled people will be forced to pay more rent\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n&#xa0; \nOn 30th July 2013, \nin \njudicial reviews brought by ten hou\nseholds against the bedroom tax, the high courts \nacknowledged that the Government is discriminating against disabled people\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.7\n&#xa0; \nThe DWP\n argues\n that the £25 million in \nDiscretionary Housing Payment (DHP)\n would cover the loss in HB experienced by those in ‘exceptional circum\nstances’. \nT\nhere is a \ndanger that this cash-limited pot simply will not go far enough to \nsupport all those that need it. Local Authorities will only be given a limited amount of money from which to make \nthese payments\n, and so will have to make difficult decisions a\nbout who to provide with a DHP, and for how long.\n&#xa0;6.8\n&#xa0; \nRecommendation: \nThere should be an exemption in regulations \non the size criteria \nfor disabled people living in specially adapted homes and those with legitimate reasons for \nbeing unable to move\n. There should also be exemptions for\n \nd\nisabled couples who cannot share a bedro\nom \nand s\ntor\na\nge for bulky medical equipment.\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0; \nS\ncope is extremely worried about the Chancellor’s\n announcement at the Spending Round that there will be a cap on the social security part of Annually Managed Expenditure - spending that the government has previously said could not be limited in advance, but now will be.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0; \nState Pensions and JSA will be excluded from the cap, but disability benefits won’t be protected. Nor will \nHB \nwhich – like JSA - respond to changes in the economy.\n \nThe impact of this is that disabled people are left exposed to trade-offs within the cap. So\n if one year the need for \nHB \nrises sharply, there is a real risk that disability benefits will be a lower spending priority.\n T\nhere is a substantial risk disabled people will lose out on vital financial lifelines.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0; \nRecommendation: \nWe therefore want to see c\nlear safeguards for disability benefits within the cap, so that disabled people’s incomes will have some protection against wider trends in the economy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n February 2013, Universal Credit Local Support Services Framework, https://www.gov.uk/government/\nuploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181395/uc-local-service-support-framework.pdf\n February 2013, Universal Credit Local Support Services Framework, https://www.gov.uk/government/\nuploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181395/uc-local-service-support-framework.pdf\n \nScope i\nnterview with \nrepresentative\n from Affinity Sutton group Ltd\n, June 2013\n \nScope (2013) Disabled People and Financial Well-being: Credit and Debt, \nhttp://scopesblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/credit-and-debt1.pdf\n \nScope (2013) \nDisabled People and Financial Well-being:\n Financial Situation, \nhttp://scopesblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/financial-situation1.pdf\n \n National Housing Federation (2011) Briefing on welfare reform bill\n Berthoud R (2011) \nTrends in the Employment of Disabled People in Britain,\n Institute for Social and Economic Research Working Paper Series, 2011–03\n Berthoud R (2011) \nTrends in the \nEmployment of Disabled People in Britain,\n Institute for Social and Economic Research Working Paper Series, 2011–03\n L\nabour Force \nS\nurvey\n, 2012\n Life Opportunities Survey, Wave One (2009/2011)\n Berthoud, R.
