[[[ (CYS0013)]]]Thank you for this opportunity to make a submission; it is appreciated.I want to make a single, and forceful point: I would like to see that the wearing of cycle helmets becomes 

[[[compulsory]]].Having experienced a near-death experience, when a motorist crashed in to me from behind – causing me to be thrown in to a ditch – my cycle helmet split in 3 places (but fortunately I walked away with just a broken nose &amp; shock). I am certain that I would be dead, were it not for the fact that my helmet absorbed most of the impact.Thank you for considering this.November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
