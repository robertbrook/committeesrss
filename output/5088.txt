[[[WRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO THE EFRA COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE GLOBAL FEDERATION OF ANIMAL SANCTUARIES]]]

[[[ (GFAS)]]]

[[[January 2014]]]The EFRA Committee is seeking written submissions of evidence in regard to the following:The following is submitted on behalf of the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS).

[[[SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;

[[[1, ]]]

[[[About GFAS]]]The Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS) is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to helping sanctuaries to help animals. GFAS promotes and validates excellence in sanctuary management and humane and responsible care of animals through a global system of accreditation, collaboration and mentoring.  GFAS promotes the development of greater recognition and resources for sanctuaries, and works to eliminate the causes of displaced animals.GFAS is proud to provide comprehensive standards on sanctuary excellence, and operates a rigorous accreditation system by which sanctuaries are assessed against these standards through a written application, review of documents and site visit, in order to achieve accreditation and verification. The GFAS Standards of Excellence were developed and reviewed with the input of animal welfare experts, non-profit professionals, sanctuary managers, and veterinarians, utilising existing standards from outstanding sanctuaries as a starting framework and refined/expanded upon based on knowledge and expertise of contributors.GFAS considers a sanctuary to be an establishment that provides lifetime care for animals that have been abused, injured, abandoned, or are otherwise in need. The animals may come from sources including, but not limited to, private owners, research laboratories, government authorities, the entertainment industry, and zoos.All GFAS sanctuaries must adhere to certain policies as set out in our standards, including but not limited to:Facilities that are not genuine sanctuaries, on the other hand, may buy and sell primates, exhibit the animals on and off site, allow the public to have direct contact with primates, breed primates, and allow the public to visit on a regular basis without escort. In addition, their facilities may be substandard.

[[[Situation in the UK]]]GFAS has accredited and verified several primate sanctuaries in North America, where the issue of primates as pets is a particular problem in terms of numbers. To date, GFAS has accredited one primate sanctuary in the UK. We are aware of a handful of other primate-keeping facilities across Europe that might also meet the standards for verification or accreditation by GFAS.It is apparent that there is a dearth of suitable facilities for rehoming and rescuing primates. Allowing the ownership and trade of pet primates to continue without this safety net would be irresponsible. We note that there is currently no definition of an animal sanctuary in UK legislation. We do not consider that this should be an obstacle to a ban on the keeping of primates as pets. Genuine sanctuaries do not keep primates as pets, nor do they keep them specifically for exhibition. Furthermore they do not trade in primates. A ban on the keeping of pet primates or on the trade in primates would be unlikely to affect the activities of responsible animal sanctuaries, particularly if legislation is tailored towards banning the keeping of primates by individuals in a domestic environment.

[[[Conclusions]]]We are convinced that the keeping of primates in the UK should be restricted to licensed zoos and to genuine animal sanctuaries. We consider facilities to be genuine sanctuaries if they are already accredited or verified by GFAS, or are likely to comply with GFAS standards.At this time, we do not offer comment on whether a ban on the keeping and/or a ban on the trade in primates as pets is the most suitable mechanism for achieving this restriction.In the event of a ban, GFAS remains willing to assist Defra and other stakeholders in advising on the best options for primates currently kept as pets.GFAS looks forward to working with and alongside other stakeholders in verifying and/or accrediting suitable facilities across Europe, where appropriate.&#xa0;
