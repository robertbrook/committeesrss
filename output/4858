defaultFollow up actiondefault&#xa0;
defaultI believe there were two undertakings for follow-up action from Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick. These were in relation to the Counter-Terrorist Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) and the Certificate in Knowledge of Policing (CKP). I attach a brief note on both, which I hope will address the Committee’s interest. Please 
defaultlet me know if you require anything further.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU)default&#xa0;
defaultThe Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) is part of the Counter Terrorism Command 
defaultand 
defaultholds the national remit for assessing terrorist and violent extremist mat
defaulterial on the internet. The unit
default 
defaultis
default pro
defaultactive in its approach to terrorist content but also receives referrals through a public online reporting tool that allows members of the public to report their concerns anonymously. 
defaultIt is also be responsible for alerting forces, Counter Terrorism Units and Counter Terrorism Intelligence Units to online terrorist offences that may fall within their jurisdiction. 
defaultIts
default aim is to make the internet a more hostile environment for terrorists and violent extremists by making operating conditions more difficult for them. As the vast majority of terrorist content is hosted overseas this includes working with industry and foreign law enforcement agencies to prevent the internet being misused to promote violence. 
defaultSince the unit was formed in February 2010 over 5,700 individual pieces of online terrorist content have been removed from the internet and almost 1,000 other links have been filtered from the UK public estate which prevents them from being accessed on computers in locations such as libraries, universities and other publicly funded institutions.

defaultThe eligibility requirements to become a new police constable in the 
defaultp
defaultolice 
defaults
defaultervice ha
defaultve
default changed. As of April 2013 c
defaultandidates
default applying to the MPS are
default required to have completed a Certificate in Knowledge of Policing (CKP) before starting as a constable. The CKP is a self-funded qualification developed by the 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultPolicing
default, in partnership with Skills for Justice and all Home Office funded Police Forces, and is broadly equivalent to an A-Level. It covers the wide range of policing and legislative knowledge that constables need to perform their role effectively. It will provide an ideal foundation for a career in policing, ensuring that new police constables have the knowledge, and understanding as well as the dedication to keep Londoners safe, prior to their in service training. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA CKP 
defaultwill cost approximately 
defaultbetween 
default£800
default-£1,000 to fund and 6 weeks (full-time) to complete. The course is also accessible at weekends and evenings. Further and Higher Education providers as well as independent providers will obtain a licence from the 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultPolicing
default to deliver the CKP course. 
defaultThe MPS is currently looking at various 
defaultfinancial support packages for candidates
default, including for example, Bursaries. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe MPS has agreed a range of positive action options as permitted under the Equality Act to help support candi
defaultdate’
defaults individual needs when applying to join as a police constable, enabling us to attract and recruit a more representative workforce of the communities we serve. These include access to coaching by established officers, additional training prior to candidates attending assessment centres and changes to the recruitment processes whereby external BME candidates will be able to take their Day 1 assessment prior to obtaining CKP. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen a candidate’
defaults application passes initial checks, they will be invited to attend a formal, day-long assessment referred to as 
default‘
defaultDay 1
default’
default. The day comprises of: 
default&#xa0;
defaultA competency-based structured interview
defaultA numerical ability test
defaultA verbal ability test
defaultTwo written exercises
defaultFour interactive exercises
default&#xa0;
defaultThese activities allow the MPS to observe and assess whether the candidate has the right skills and qualities required to be a police constable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe know from the 2011 census that 
defaultLondon
default is more diverse than ever and that our workforce does not reflect that diversity as we would like it to. We believe that to police a diverse city like 
defaultLondon
default successfully and with the consent, support and engagement of the communities we serve, we need a workforce that more closely reflects 
defaultLondon
default at all levels. 
default&#xa0;
defaultImprovements have been made to the diversity of our workforce with nearly 10.4% (3
default,
default170) of our police officers now from a BME background. However, in order to increase that number, we need to adapt our approach so we see a change in the makeup of our workforce now, not in the distant future. To achieve this we want to use options permitted under the Equalities Act to help target and attract candidates from BME backgrounds into a successful career in the MPS. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe MPS has rigorous selection standards to ensure we recruit officers who are the best fit for the demands of policing our capital now and in the future. These high standards the MPS prides itself on will remain, with the additional requirement of the CKP, as we move into our latest recruitment drive.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultwill work closely with both course providers and the College to monitor both uptake and access to funding streams. If certain communities are adversely affected, this intelligence will help shape future recruitment campaigns.
