"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from South Somerset Together (the strategic partnership for South Somerset) (TIC 059)&#xa0;\nSummary of main points&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1              How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nSomerset County Council\n \n(\nSCC\n)\n is the Transport Authority for the South Somerset area\n. However\n \nSouth Somerset Together (SST), the \nstrategic partnership for South Somerset\n, which includes both SCC and \nSouth Somerset District Council (\nSSDC\n)\n along with other key stakeholders, \nhas identified the declining access to services in rural areas as a real barrier for a large variety of resident\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe SST organised w\norkshops in February and April this year\n, \nwhich involved local user groups including Parish C\nouncils, service providers (including Citizens Advice, health, housing, education &amp; training and Sport &amp; Leisure), community and public \ntransport providers. \nThese workshops \nestablished a \nneed (and an ability to provide) for some services to be offered in a more central hub\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nAdditionally \nthe South\n Somerset Citizens Advice Bureau undertook a survey in January\n 2013, which indicated that \n1 in 3 respondents felt that access to employment and healthcare was poor or very poor.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nD\netermining actual demand\n is difficult given the wide\n \ndispersal\n \nof \nrural settlements and the varied reasons for travel. What we do know though is that i\nn contrast\n to the overall\n national trend, passenger journeys by bus in Somerset have decreased in the past two years. The county has one of the lowest number of bus trips per population in England.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nThe Department for Transport Publ\nic Service Vehicle (PSV) Surv\ney \nestimates that in 2011-12, there were 8.6\n million bus passenger journeys \nin Somerset.\n \nT\nhis \nrepresents a 12% fall\n from the\n \n2009-10\n figure of 9.8 million.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n              \nT\nhe number of bus journeys per head of population \ni\nn \nSomerset has\n decreased from 18.7 \nbus \njourneys\n per \nhead \nof population in\n 2009/10 \nto 17.9\n in 2010/11\n and 16.2 in 2011/12\n. \nThis contrast\ns with\n the upward trend in numbers experienced in most local authorities across the South West and in England as a whole.\n \nSomerset has the \nlowest figure in the \nSouth West and \none of the\n lowest \nin England.\n However the \nneighbouring\n authorities of Devon and Dorset have \nalso \nshown a slight downturn since 2010/11. \n&#xa0;\n1.7\n              \nWhilst it is difficult to ascertain an exact correlation it is likely that this decrease in patron\nage has arisen due to the reductions in local bus subsidy during the same time frame. Additionally the drop in\n the\n \nreimburs\nement rate to the operators for \nconcessionary fares from 70% to 55% is likely to have had a greater impact on rural bus routes where,\n unlike urban areas, there is considerably  less opportunity to generate any additional patronage through the free-fare scheme. It is also likely that the Government’s 20% reduction in Bus Service Operator’s grant may well have had a more adverse \nimpact \non\n rural routes\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.8\n              \nThe net result is that many marginal rural routes have either been withdrawn or curtailed. Across the\n whole\n District there are now no evening bus routes\n after around 6/7pm, \nand only two infrequent routes remain in operation on a Sunday.\n&#xa0;\n1.9\n              \nThe\n Focus\n Group\n recognises \nthat it is n\no longer\n possible to continue to subsidise\n bus\n routes where there is little potential of \nachieving a\n realistic degree of viability and \nhence the need for a different approach.\n&#xa0;\n2              To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;2.1\n              \nLack of access to transport is a huge issue for many people living \nin rural areas. For those families where there is only one\n, or no\n, vehicle\n and/or limited public transport, it can restrict access to key services such as healthcare\n, education, social activities,\n etc. \nThis particularly impacts on women especially with you\nng children.  \n2.2\n              \nAccess to support groups for those facing discrimination or other challenges is much more difficult as the groups tend to operate within the larger towns. This particularly impacts on the LGBT community and those with disabilities includ\ning people with mental health challenges and those experiencing domestic violence or other forms of harassment.\n2.3\n              \nLiving in rural areas poses particular challenges for people with disabilities in accessing education, training, and employment opportunitie\ns and playing an active role in their communities. Access to transport is crucial and voluntary sector provision or adapted taxis are often very expensive.\n2.4\n              \nEvidence shows considerable variability in the provision and availability of services between di\nfferent rural \nareas but\n overall, the picture is of under-provision and they are less likely to receive services comparable with their urban counterparts.\n For example, older people in rural areas are likely to receive lower levels of supportive services su\nch as domiciliary care and meals on wheels than those living in urban areas, and the general take-up rates for welfare benefits seem lower.\n2.5\n              \nYoung people are also significantly \ndisadvantaged\n: whilst they are taken into account where there is a statutory\n requirement e\n.\ng\n.\n getting people to school, there is no provision to allow young people to take part in \nextracurricular\n activities and other social networking as they can’t get home afterwards or \ntravel at weekends.  This also impacts on their ability to take part in further training and job search and limits employment opportunities to those accessible by public transport which significantly reduces their opportunities. \n&#xa0;\n3              What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nT\nhe cost of \nrail \ninfrastructure\n means t\nhat it is not\n cost effective \nwhere \nthe settlements are \nnot \nwithin th\ne catchment area for existing routes. In South Somerset there is some potential on the Bristol – Weymouth line if appropriate arrival and departure times were provided at \nstations in the district and a business case establishing the viability of improved t\nimetabling has been undertaken on behalf of the Community Rail Partnership.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe b\nus \noffers\n more flexible\n options\n,\n but with major reductions in recent years to the subsidised bus network and the unlikelihood that commercial services will be viable to take their place, the overall bus network of routes has significantly reduced especially in rural areas.\n \nH\nistorically t\nhe temptation when passenger numbers have dwindled has often been to merge \nroutes\n, however long end to end journey times are often a significant deterrent to travel except for those that have no other alternative\n. Whilst this may achieve a short term savin\ng in subsidy costs the net result is often a long and circuitous route and consequently further dwindling numbers.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nA more proactive approach would be \nto develop more community based transport groups such as small parish car schemes or DRT type servi\nces that feed into the main arterial commercial bus routes\n. Lincolnshire CC has adopted this type of approach\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nSee also, our answer to the following question.\n&#xa0;\n4              How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;4.1\n              \nCommunity Transport \ncan be very effective\n in delivering transport to isolated communities.\n \nThey\n have local knowledge,\n both of the area and their\n customer\ns. They can offer a bespoke servi\nce often door-to-door for those in most need.\n \nH\nowever costs \nto\n the passenger\n,\n funding and resource availability for the operator can be major issues. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nFurther issues arise with the lack of communication and coordination between all transport groups with operators working in isolation of each \nother. At\n best this can result in unintentional duplication and at worse a complete failure for \nsomeone to make a \njourney\n at their convenience, and thus\n \nthere is potential to improve service delivery through closer partnership working \nbetween\n the transport operators\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nA lack of good transport information can also be a problem for local residents, who often don’t k\nnow what services are available to them even where they exist.  Therefore a comprehensive access point where accurate information can be sourced would improve access to community transport.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nThe SST workshops held earlier this year established that\n \nt\nransport in itself \nmay \nnot\n be\n the whole solution \nand that \na mixture of \nstrategies to include providing\n services\n more locally needed to be considered.\n The partnership proposes to set up a pilot to deliver the solutions\n as set out\n below:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nThe ma\nin purpose is to trial an innovative project to mitigate rural isolation and improve access to essential services through the creation of a community hub. \nThis hub is likely to be the accepted market town for the area with a number of locations within it p\nroviding a set of accessible services. These may or may not be co-located depending on natural affinities\n.\n \nSST has identified a number of services that could be delivered more locally, such as Health Clinics, Further Education and Training, Citizens Advice Bureau and Community/Social Housing services.  \n4.6\n              \nThe SST will work with the District and County Council\ns, health and education partners, community facilitators and housing associations to develop a local community package of services that could be provided through this community hub.  \n4.7\n              \nA Community Transport scheme\n will act as the catalyst providing affo\nrdable transport links to the hub.  Alongside this partners will work with bus operators and community transport groups (including potential community car schemes) to develop an integrated transport infrastructure and a transport hub. Besides increasing ac\ncessibility it also offers an opportunity to gain additional patronage on the\n existing\n core \nbus\n and coach\n services serving \nthe hub\n.\n4.8\n              \nThe hub will become a one-stop shop for transport solutions\n in that area\n, providing information, booking services and de\nlivery through public bus, car schemes, car sharing and community transport.\n Beneficiaries from such a scheme:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.8.1              Residents would benefit from: 4.8.2              Transport operators would benefit from:4.8.3              Community Service Providers would benefit from:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5              To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;5.1\n              \nThere is, at least initially, a resistance to advance booking the service for any demand responsive or taxi-bus type service, although this can generally be overcome by better education and raising awareness\n.\n \nCost of travel for the passenger can be a major issue, especially for those on low incomes and fixed pensions. Very often (as has been highlighted in the\n 2012\n OFT \nconsultation)\n those in rural communities pay a higher proportion of their income on transpor\nt. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThere\n is \nalso \nthe disparity that often arises \nin respect of\n the ability to \nuse a bus pass. Whilst\n the County Councils have discretionary powers to extend the bus pass scheme to include CT schemes, often budgetary constraints means that this doesn’\nt happen or as in Somerset it is offered at reduced rate (50%) with a cap fares for longer journeys (currently £10 in Somerset).  I\nn theory it is possible for taxi operators to register a ‘ta\nxi bus service’ under the 1985 T\nransport\n Act\n and similarly the l\narger Community Transport operators can register a local bus route either under\n section 22\n or a Public Service Vehicle Operator’s licence\n. I\nn more remote areas the small community transport \nand\n small taxi operators have been very reluctant to do this. Oft\nen they do not have the resources, skills or funds to undertake what they see as a very bureaucratic process\n. \nSimilarly many\n remote\n areas are served by community car schemes, which\n rely on direct payment to the driver to cover costs (usually 45ppm recognised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs). \nThe net result, where such small \nschemes do evolve\n,\n is passengers have to pay often quite high fares where their urban counterparts can travel for free\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6              What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;6.1\n              \nThe main challenge is to overcome the “we’ve always done it this way approach”\n to the provision of\n rural transport. \nWhilst the economic downturn has resulted in a relatively rapid withdrawal of financial support for bus services that had previously seen escalating costs, with little potential for passenger growth; little has been done\n to date\n either in\n South Somerset or nationally to look at options that can mitigate the impact\n of local bus service provision\n often for those groups with the most need. \n The concept that we have outlined above \noffers a potential solution to this issue. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nThe low \npopulation density in most of these areas means\n that the cost per passenger is likely to be high when compared with \nmost\n urban routes. As \nindicated\n above \ntypically all types of Community Transport schemes have evolved on an ad hoc basis to meet \nthe needs o\nf their community,\n often in response to the decline or withdrawal of local bus services. Laudable as this is their very nature means they often operate in isolation from each other and \npublic transport operators. Closer liaison\n means that savings could\n oft\nen\n be\n made by the\n CT\n operators and\n with the added potential of increasing patronage on core routes.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThere is a need to address the disparity between urban and rural areas in respect of the bus pass\n. One option (that’s currently not permitted under th\ne \nConcessionary Fare Scheme)\n that we often encounter in feedback from the community is that \na small flat fare could be levied for bus pass use. The monies raised \ncould then be used to extend the scheme.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nAdditionally the government has made specific pu\nblic transport funding available through grant schemes. These\n have\n primarily\n \nbeen \ntargeted at\n \nurban\n areas (\ne.g.\n Better Bus \nArea\n &amp; \nthe Green Bus Fund\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nThere is also a \nneed to\n develop services that people will use – ie they go where they need to go when people want them to.\n&#xa0;\n We need to get more flexibility from agencies and services that people go \nto make\n it easier.\n&#xa0;\n For example, more ability to pick appointments in hospitals; \ngrouping services so that in one trip to town, someone can achieve lots of tasks.\n&#xa0;\n We also need agencies like DWP to be more flexible and innovative – for example, using on line tools to verify claimants’ work search; using housing providers or district co\nuncil offices to hold Job Centre services rather than expecting those on benefit to travel to the larger towns.\n \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Transport and the Accessibility of Public Services Report - \nSouth \nSomerset Citizens Advi\nce Bureau\n January 2013\n SCC’s \nTransport Statistics for Somerset – \nAugust \n2013 update\n DfT Table BUS0110a Passenger journeys on local bus services per head by local authority1,2: England, from 2009/10\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n \nObstacles to Using and\n Providing Rural Social Care\n - \nSocial Care Institute for Excellence\n – September 2007\n The Heart of Wessex Line – Case for Service Improvement – Image rail November 2011\n Lincs \nInterconnect \nhttp://www.lincsin\nterconnect.com/\n \n \nhttp://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consultations/remote-communities/ - June 2012\n \nSection 12 1985 Transport Act\n permits\n a licensed taxi or Private Hire Vehicle \noperator to\n apply to the Traffic Commissioner for a special restricted PSV (Public Service Vehicle) operator’s licence enabling them to register and operate a local bus service.\n 1985 Transport Act \n"
