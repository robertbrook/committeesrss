"FBA0002/13-14\n&#xa0;\nDear Mr Sinton,\n&#xa0;\nAs Chairman of the New City Initiative, I feel compelled to write to you on behalf of our members, many of whom are limited liability \npartnerships, about the proposed changes to the taxation of partnerships contained in the draft Finance Bill 2014.  The New City Initiative believes the proposed legislation on partnership tax throws up a number of concerns which could sound the death knel\nl for investment management partnerships.\n&#xa0;\n It may even produce an own goal for the UK tax authorities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYours sincerely\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMagnus Spence\nChairman\nNew City Initiative\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe NCI is a think tank that offers an independent, expert voice in the debate over the future of financial \nregulation.\nFounded in 2010, NCI counts amongst its members some of the leading independent asset management firms in the City and the continent. The NCI gives a voice to independent, owner-managed firms that are entirely focused on and aligned with the in\nterests of their clients and investors.\nOver the last decade, an old fashioned “client-centric” approach has enabled entrepreneurial firms in the Square Mile and beyond to emerge as a growing force in a financial industry dominated by global financial gian\nts. Now, more so than ever, these firms play a key role in preserving the stability and long-term focus of the financial sector, \nwhich is of benefit to society at large.\nToday The New City Initiative is comprised of 43\n&#xa0;\nleading independent asset management \nfirms from the UK and the Continent, managing approximately £350 billion and employing several thousand people.\n&#xa0;\nNCI Core aims:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
