defaultThe family of 
defaultBegg
default moved into 
defaultBadenyon
default, 
defaultGlenbuchat
default in 1775 and were in continuous occupation of the property until 1956 when the last occupier of the property, John 
defaultBegg
default, died.
default 
defaultIn his will among other things, he left to George 
defaultBegg
default, farme
defaultr Milton Bank, Aberdeenshire “
defaultAll my interest as land holder at 
defaultBadenyon
default”
default 
defaultIt is not known what this means.

defaultI am Ian 
defaultMcKerron
default 
defaultBegg
default a descendant of the 
defaultBegg
default family from 
defaultBadenyon
default and am in process of trying to find information on the land and buildings at 
defaultBadenyon
default.
default 
defaultI have several items from 
defaultBadenyon
default which have come to me via my father who was a beneficiary in John 
defaultBegg’s
default will.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have no details but it is known that there was a court case in the earlier part of the 20
defaultth
default century when we believe that John 
defaultBegg
default fought a case against the estate of 
defaultGlenbuchat
default that had claimed ownership of 
defaultBadenyon
default.
default 
defaultDuring that case, John 
defaultBegg’s
default file on the property at 
defaultBadenyon
default, which had been deposited with a legal firm in Aberdeen, was lost when in the hands of that legal firm.
default 
defaultThe ruling of the court is not known but the phrase used by John 
defaultBegg
default in his will suggests that he lost his case.
default 
defaultI am interested in trying to find out what happened.
default 
defaultThere is a feeling that the estate
default 
defaultpossibly grabbed the land and buildings because ownership by the 
defaultBegg
default family could not be formally established although they had “owned” 
defaultBadenyon
default since 1775.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo this end I intend in the very near future to start my inquiry by getting in touch with the Registers of Scotland, hoping that decisions of the court, mentioned above, are lodged there.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy niece Norma 
defaultBegg
default has uncovered an interesting but inconclusive letter written on precisely the subject of my submission. There is a snippet of information about 
defaultBadenyon
default ownership.

defaultSomeone in Canada has taken time to transcribe letters between Harry 
defaultBegg
default and the family in Scotland and post these online.
default 
defaultIn one particular letter from Charles 
defaultBegg
default to Harry, dated "Milltown of 
defaultTowie
default 13th July 1835" it states: "John 
defaultBegg
default at 
defaultBadenyon
default has renewed his lease for nine years and James at 
defaultBlackhilder
default has taken his for nineteen. They are still divided on the score of immigration one bad season would send them all scampering over to your land of promise. "

defaultI wonder if the lease is for the land or both land and buildings?
default 
defaultwhich leads to the question who built the house and 
defaultsteading
default at 
defaultBadenyon
default and when? and what was the legal position about building on the land at 
defaultBadenyon
default?
default 
defaultI wonder if the Court case, referred to earlier and held in the earlier part of the 20th Century could refer to this question?
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen the last owner of 
defaultBadenyon
default died, I was in touch with the beneficiary Charles 
defaultBegg
default asking if I could help to keep the house in good condition; but he would have none of it, I could put a caravan on the site, he said.
default 
defaultAn interesting statement in itself.
default 
defaultI had no wish to do so at the time for various reasons viz. Aesthetic, no need, and not enough money.
