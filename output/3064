[normal]Written evidence submitted by Ian [bold]Mckerron[bold] [bold]Begg[bold], [bold]Badenyon[bold],[bold] [bold]Glenbuchat[bold], Aberdeenshire[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The family of 
[normal]Begg
[normal] moved into 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal], 
[normal]Glenbuchat
[normal] in 1775 and were in continuous occupation of the property until 1956 when the last occupier of the property, John 
[normal]Begg
[normal], died.
[normal] 
[normal]In his will among other things, he left to George 
[normal]Begg
[normal], farme
[normal]r Milton Bank, Aberdeenshire “
[normal]All my interest as land holder at 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]It is not known what this means. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am Ian 
[normal]McKerron
[normal] 
[normal]Begg
[normal] a descendant of the 
[normal]Begg
[normal] family from 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] and am in process of trying to find information on the land and buildings at 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I have several items from 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] which have come to me via my father who was a beneficiary in John 
[normal]Begg’s
[normal] will.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have no details but it is known that there was a court case in the earlier part of the 20
[normal]th
[normal] century when we believe that John 
[normal]Begg
[normal] fought a case against the estate of 
[normal]Glenbuchat
[normal] that had claimed ownership of 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]During that case, John 
[normal]Begg’s
[normal] file on the property at 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal], which had been deposited with a legal firm in Aberdeen, was lost when in the hands of that legal firm.
[normal] 
[normal]The ruling of the court is not known but the phrase used by John 
[normal]Begg
[normal] in his will suggests that he lost his case.
[normal] 
[normal]I am interested in trying to find out what happened.
[normal] 
[normal]There is a feeling that the estate
[normal] 
[normal]possibly grabbed the land and buildings because ownership by the 
[normal]Begg
[normal] family could not be formally established although they had “owned” 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] since 1775.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To this end I intend in the very near future to start my inquiry by getting in touch with the Registers of Scotland, hoping that decisions of the court, mentioned above, are lodged there.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My niece Norma 
[normal]Begg
[normal] has uncovered an interesting but inconclusive letter written on precisely the subject of my submission. There is a snippet of information about 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] ownership.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Someone in Canada has taken time to transcribe letters between Harry 
[normal]Begg
[normal] and the family in Scotland and post these online.
[normal] 
[normal]In one particular letter from Charles 
[normal]Begg
[normal] to Harry, dated "Milltown of 
[normal]Towie
[normal] 13th July 1835" it states: "John 
[normal]Begg
[normal] at 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] has renewed his lease for nine years and James at 
[normal]Blackhilder
[normal] has taken his for nineteen. They are still divided on the score of immigration one bad season would send them all scampering over to your land of promise. "

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I wonder if the lease is for the land or both land and buildings?
[normal] 
[normal]which leads to the question who built the house and 
[normal]steading
[normal] at 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] and when? and what was the legal position about building on the land at 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]I wonder if the Court case, referred to earlier and held in the earlier part of the 20th Century could refer to this question?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When the last owner of 
[normal]Badenyon
[normal] died, I was in touch with the beneficiary Charles 
[normal]Begg
[normal] asking if I could help to keep the house in good condition; but he would have none of it, I could put a caravan on the site, he said.
[normal] 
[normal]An interesting statement in itself.
[normal] 
[normal]I had no wish to do so at the time for various reasons viz. Aesthetic, no need, and not enough money.
