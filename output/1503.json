"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Leslie Bowman a councillor within Seaton Valley, Northumberland (TIC 035)\n&#xa0;\nThank you for the privilege to write this report on public transport and other related services.\n&#xa0;\nI am Leslie Bowman a councillor within Seaton Valley, Northumberland. I do not officially represent the residents or the Seaton Valley Council in this \nreport, but as someone who lives and works within this part of Northumberland and has an ear for the people of this area.\n&#xa0;\nOutlineThis area of South East Northumberland is poorly served by public transport and all pervious national and local government an\nd has not provided a good sound framework for good, safe, relevant public transport service to this community of 5 villages. Example: Although we are not far from national rails services we have no links with bus services. Most of the bus routes have not c\nhanged much since the 1930s even though people lives and work place have.\n&#xa0;\nPublic transport is provided by bus services operated mainly by Arr\niva and on one route by Go North \nEast\n. We have no rail service in the valley.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Action Required.\n&#xa0;\nBus Services&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\n get many complaints about the Arriva\n bus services as they are cut\nting\n back o\nn routes and isolating villages in the process.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe need more bus companies in the\n area to shake Arriva who has 95\n% of the bus services and yes they must make a profit but must \nalso service the community.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Cost of fares is extremely expensive and for families it must be back breaking.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe need a system of ONE ticket for all bus journeys\n ( Transfare )\n to get to your destinations.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe need bus services to National Rail connecti\nons like \nMorpeth Station which provides mainline services to London and places south. Edinburgh and Scotland.\n We have none.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also need connections with \na\n rail service at \nCramlington Station and Tyne and Wear Metro System.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also need a connection with our local \nInternational \nairport \nNewcastle Airport (NCL.\n)\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe connections above sho\nuld be for ALL of Seaton Valley not just the parts the bus companies \nlike to have to make profits.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe residents of \none village\n would love a service to and from \nCramlington and Station\n as they do no\nt have any service there at all. \nThey never \nhave done and will never see it happen under this present system.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe quality of the buses must improve. They are to be quiet, comfortable, \ncooled in the summer with air con and cosy in the winter when bitter cold outside with air quality improvements.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe need bus actual running times at bus stops, just like many cities. More so because routes are longer than cities and traffic problem can wr\neck havoc on bus time tables. \nMobile\n phone apps with real time.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe should be thinking Green Buses. Electric etc.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll buses should be disable friendly\n ie. \nMobi\nlity, Blind, Deaf, and other\n less able persons\n. \nAt the moment 99% of bus services are NOT\n.\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe n\need bus shelters\n and more of them, which\n are clean, dry, good repair, with seating, lighting for nights and the winter months. Fitted with real time transport times. And a bin.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe need a rail service in Seaton Valley.\n We have a famous line\n going through 3 of our 5 villages\n \nthat was \nclosed to\n passengers\n in the 1960s\n (50 years ago)\n. It is a mineral line at the moment and could be put back into passenger use with little cost, providing confections to Newcastle, Blyth, Bedlington, Ashington, an\nd the county town of Northumberland and Mainline Station\n,\n \nMorpeth\n.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
