[[[Clause 1 - ]]]

[[[Health and safety at work: general duty of self-employed persons]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“EU legislation does not generally apply to the self-employed, and the approach by other member states varies, with some countries choosing not to apply health and safety law to the self-employed, whilst several apply the law to the self-employed only where activities are considered particularly hazardous or if they present risks to others. For example, in Sweden the self-employed are only covered in relation to chemicals and machinery to protect their safety and that of those who may be affected by their work, whilst in Germany the law does not apply to the self-employed except where their work may affect the safety of employees.”&#xa0;He goes on to argue:&#xa0;“There is a case for following a similar approach to other countries and exempting from health and safety law those self-employed people (i.e. those who do not have any employees) whose workplace activities pose no potential risk of harm to others. &#xa0;This would benefit approximately 1 million people. The actual burden that the regulations currently place upon these self-employed may not be particularly significant due to existing exceptions in some regulations and the limited prospect of these being enforced but it will help reduce the perception that health and safety law is inappropriately applied. This will complement HSE’s recently revised guidance for employers on homeworkers”&#xa0;&#xa0;
