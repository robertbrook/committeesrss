[[[Capital Traffic concludes that the primary pre-requisite to enable walking and cycling in Britain to flourish is to change the law to give strong legal protections to the most vulnerable of our road-users.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.4              We regret to note that the otherwise very good report from the APPCG did not recommend any changes in the law.&#xa0;              We have been given to understand that were any legislation brought forward, there would be moves by some Members of Parliament to make cycle helmets compulsory, as some sort of otherwise ill-advised quid pro quo.  While we would have no objection were such a restriction applied to cyclists under 16 (though the impact of the requirement is likely to be cosmetic and negligible in terms of injury prevention, and a recommendation would be preferable), we consider that that would be a highly retrograde step to apply to all cyclists, and likely to restrict future cycling growth.&#xa0;              This should not have been a reason for avoiding sensible legislation however, particularly in respect of rights of way and legal liability.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.5              We appreciate that much public concern has arisen after the recent tragic deaths of cyclists in London, which gives urgency to the present Inquiry.&#xa0;              Below, we have attempted a response to the question 

[[[what can be done?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1              The understandable public demand is for action now, a quick-fix, an immediate reduction in cycling casualties.&#xa0;              With due respect to the Committee, Capital Traffic contends that proposals for…&#xa0;-               better training and advice for drivers and cyclists&#xa0;-               better enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists&#xa0;-              better vehicle and road infrastructure&#xa0;              …are unlikely to have more than limited and/or long-term effects.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2              Notwithstanding the above, we recommend that more innovative use is made of the many electronic displays now commonplace in cities and larger towns to offer safety advice and other guidance.&#xa0;              At present, the displays are either blank, or the same hackneyed messages appear constantly, and tend to be ignored.  A communication opportunity is being missed.&#xa0;              When operational, the displays do not generally appear to be sufficiently reactive to real-time changes.  It is rare that traffic disruption is indicated in cities (as distinct from on motorways).  Usually, they show road closures next week, or some such.              &#xa0;&#xa0;2.3              In pursuit of a rapid response to public concern, Capital Traffic reiterates its view that dramatic legislative action is required.  &#xa0;If we wish to encourage walking and cycling, the fear and insecurity that many have must be eliminated.  To achieve that change in mindset requires the backup of the law for optimal effectiveness.&#xa0;

[[[We need to change the law to give ]]]

[[[better protection to both pedestrians and cyclists.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.4              Without the legal protections that pedestrians and cyclists have across most of mainland Europe, the Active Travel movement will be stymied in the UK.  &#xa0;While large amounts of public funds may be spent on infrastructure, it will always be insufficient to give people the confidence and courage to walk and cycle on their own streets.  &#xa0;We need to change the law and create a climate wherein pedestrians and cyclists feel safe on all streets, not just where dedicated infrastructure is in place.&#xa0;This means a change from vulnerable users being provided with space at the discretion of vehicle users, as now, to where the latter is mandated to provide it.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5              We propose a short Bill to amend the Transport Act which focuses on the rights of way and legal liability, and nothing else.  Anything more would unnecessarily delay or halt any legislation.  &#xa0;We urge the Transport Committee to ensure a fast passage through the House, while at the same time facilitating a debate on the issues in the Bill only.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.6              It should be recognised that if one takes the number of KSIs for pedestrians and cyclists in any one year (assuming all of them made a claim for damages, injury or loss) divided by the number of licensed drivers, a very small percentage would result.  Few car drivers would be impacted by the proposed changes. &#xa0;              Nonetheless, the changes would be salutary.&#xa0;Sharing the Road in New Zealand&#xa0;3.1              Our preferred Bill would contain the following provisions…&#xa0;3.1.1              that all users of highways, cycleways, walkways and off-routes be required to recognise the rights of all other users, and to share that facility in a safe and courteous manner&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.2              that when a powered vehicle passes a cyclist, a minimum passing distance of 1m between the vehicle and the bicycle is observed&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.3              that when a cyclist passes a pedestrian or horse and rider, a minimum passing distance of 1m between the bicycle and the other road-user is observed&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.4              that, in the event of a collision with a pedestrian, legal liability rests with the vehicle user, cyclist or horse-rider in all cases where there is no overwhelming evidence to the contrary&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.4              that the law be clarified (in the Bill) and strengthened in favour of pedestrians, and standardised for all types of road crossings&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.5              that the rights of way of pedestrians and people in wheelchairs take precedence…&#xa0;- on all footways&#xa0;- on cycleways&#xa0;- in shared space&#xa0;- on driveway crossings &#xa0;- once they have stepped off the footway on to the carriageway at junctions&#xa0;- on all formalised pedestrian crossings&#xa0;- at light-controlled intersections&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.6              that Local Traffic Authorities reduce the waiting time for pedestrians and people in wheelchairs at light-controlled intersections&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.7              that, in the event of a collision with a cyclist, legal liability for collisions rests with the vehicle user or horse-rider, in all cases where there is no overwhelming evidence to the contrary&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.8              that all left-turning vehicles be required to give way to any cyclists within 50m back from the intersection&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.9              that the rights of way of cyclists on designated cycleways be circumscribed by those of pedestrians and equestrians  &#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.10              that the default maximum speed limit in town centres and on all non-arterial highways in residential areas becomes either 30 or 35km/h (18.7 or 21.8mi/h) &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.2              Clearly, a new range of offences would be created by the above changes.&#xa0;We note the apparent lack of effectiveness of the current penalties in achieving behavioural change, despite often being draconian where maxima are applied.  The exception seems to be the requirement for re-training.&#xa0;We consider that there should be new emphasis on penalties that affect vehicle use, including for those who use their vehicle for their employment.  It is often the latter, the archetypal white van men and other commercial drivers, who appear the most immune to the law.  They are often observed using their cellphones while driving, for example.&#xa0;Limits on distance travelled, higher insurance premiums, restricting licences to times of the day and/or weekdays etc should all be considered.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.3              The distances and speeds mentioned above are deliberately in metric to recognise&#xa0;                            - the unnecessary use of both Imperial and metric systems in the UK&#xa0;- the familiarity that younger people have with metric rather than Imperial measurements&#xa0;                            - the number of European and other foreign drivers on UK roads.&#xa0;The Department for Transport should be encouraged to metricate the transportation system without further delay, as most other sectors have.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1              Capital Traffic notes the experience of The Netherlands in the 1970s that shows that cycling was not widely taken up until similar legal protections were in place.  &#xa0;In France, since the passage of a stricter liability regime in 1985, bicycle safety has improved markedly.   According to OECD statistics (2012), the fatality rate for cyclists has decreased by 66 per cent since 1990.&#xa0;Where The Netherlands and France were then, Britain is now.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.2              The understanding one’s responsibilities while in charge of a potentially lethal weapon when sharing the road with other more vulnerable road users would be greatly enhanced by the changes we propose.  We are confident these would then start to change behaviour and eventually culture.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.3              Capital Traffic sincerely regrets the tragic and continuing loss of life on our highways.  We consider that the balance has long been too much in favour of powered traffic to the detriment of our people, towns and cities.  It is time this imbalance was corrected in favour of pedestrians and cyclists.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.4              We urge the Committee to recommend a prompt and meaningful response as well as a long-term strategy to the Government, not excluding legislation as proposed in this submission, to better protect pedestrians and cyclists.&#xa0;&#xa0;_____________________________&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Acknowledgement              Our thanks to Rod Mitchell of Cycle Law Scotland for contributions to this submission.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
