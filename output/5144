[normal]Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) is the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]leading international tobacco company.  
[normal]Its
[normal] products
[normal] which include the 
[normal]world’s number one cigarette brand Marlboro
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] sold in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]more 
[normal]than 180 countries.  PMI operates in the UK and Ireland through its subsidiary Philip Morris Lim
[normal]ited (“PML”)
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]ighting the illicit trade in tobacco is a top priority for PML.  
[normal]We invest significant resources in combating the illicit trade, and cooperate with government and law enforcement at every level, both in the UK and internationally.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although the UK’s legal framework provides adequate penalties for tobacco smuggling, deterrence is weakened by the difficulty of detection, and relatively 
[normal]low tariffs linked to current sentencing guidelines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Smuggling
[normal] and the illicit
[normal] 
[normal]trade 
[normal]takes different forms
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cigarettes bearing trademarks that 
[normal]are
[normal] manufactured without the 
[normal]trademark owner
[normal]’s
[normal] permission.
[normal]Cigarettes that enter or are sold in a market in violation of fiscal/custom
[normal]s
[normal] laws.
[normal]Cigarettes that are produced in one market and primarily smuggled into and sold in another where they have no legal distribution.
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It 
[normal]range
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]from small scale smuggling (often involving criminals gangs), colloquially known as ‘ant smuggling’, to large container shipments involving organised crime.  Both the UK and Ireland face similar problems shaped by common drivers of supply and demand.  Irish ports are seen as a ‘back door’ to the UK and the illicit trade is frequently linked to paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he UK and Irish illicit markets are
[normal] 
[normal]intricately linked
[normal].  
[normal]As
[normal] plain packaging
[normal] 
[normal]inevitably increases the ease of supply of illicit tobacco, the prospect of Ireland introducing this policy will inevitably impact the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK should continue to invest in combating the illicit trade, with dedicated funding to[bold] help[bold] facilitate [bold]co-ordination across law enforcement agencies. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Law enforcement needs a co-ordinated [bold]multi-agency [bold]approach to deterring [bold]small scale[bold] smuggling[bold].  This includes greater focus on preventing illicit tobacco entering the UK, more effort to disrupt inland distribution networks, and heavier penalties
[normal], including aggressive pursuit of asset forfeiture opportunities,
[normal] when offenders are identified.
[normal]  More generally the Government should consider whether current penalties provide significant deterrence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government should [bold]prioritise[bold] tackling the problem [bold]of[bold] factories in overseas free trade zones where local oversight is lax.[bold]  
[normal]These are frequently located in
[normal] jurisdictions with which the UK and EU enjoy
[normal] close ties, but provide a key source for 
[normal]organised crime
[normal] groups
[normal] 
[normal]including
[normal] paramilitaries. 
[normal] Political engagement by senior levels of government and efforts to leverage EU influence 
[normal]would complement the successes of HMRC’s overseas network of Fiscal Crime Liaison Officers. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK must [bold]prepare[bold] a strategy to adapt to changes in the illicit trade arising from the Irish Government’s proposed introduction of plain packaging.[bold]  
[normal]This would include even closer cooperation between UK and Irish law enforcement agencies.  
[normal]The illicit markets of both countries are closely related, and since plain packaging is highly likely to increase the supply of illicit tobacco into Ireland, the policy will inevitably impact the UK (in the same way that its introduction in Scotland would impact England and Wales).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, the UK should limit further tax increases to inflation, and avoid any sudden or excessive rises.[bold]  The UK (with Ireland) has the highest tobacco taxes in the EU.  Consumers’ resistance to ever higher taxes and their willingness to switch to easily available alternatives that are unlicensed, unregulated and untaxed lie at the heart of this problem.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PMI 
[normal]has a global 
[normal]Illicit Trade Strategies &amp; Prevention team dedicated to fighting illicit trade with several initiatives:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scale of the illicit tobacco problem
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Illegal cigarettes are a global problem that requires global action.  
[normal]While much of the UK’s contraband originates from within the EU, counterfeit and illicit whites are often sourced from a 
[normal]range of countries, including some within the EU, China, the Russian Federation, Belarus, the UAE and Ukraine.  Free trade zones in e.g., Singapore and Dubai also pose particular issues.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]2012 KPMG 
[normal]Star Report estimated that 
[normal]the 
[normal]illicit market 
[normal]represented
[normal] 16.4% in the UK 
[normal](
[normal]and 
[normal]the
[normal] UK also experienced the largest annual
[normal] increase 
[normal]in
[normal] the EU)
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]OLAF estimates that illicit tobacco costs the EU €10 billion a year in lost revenue,
[normal] while HMRC estimates the UK loss at nearly £2
[normal] 
[normal]billion.
[normal]  
[normal]The full cost is likely to be even higher than this due to broader consequences, notably:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The illicit trade has changed rapidly in recent years, as acknowledged by a recent National Audit Office report
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal]ross-border smuggling of UK tobacco brands and to a lesser extent counterfeit have 
[normal]decreased
[normal] relative to
[normal] 
[normal]illicit whites
[normal] which
[normal] have risen rapidly
[normal]. In 2012 the UK consumed an estimated 1 billion illicit white cigarettes, a 49% increase on 2011.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Co-operation with governments
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PMI assists law enforcement at every level, from 
[normal]the 
[normal]local to international.  Globally, INTERPOL
[normal], with its presence across
[normal] 
[normal]190 countries is ideally placed to lead this effort.  In 2012 
[normal]PMI pledged €15m to INTERPOL’s global initiative against illicit goods trafficking, ‘
[normal]Fund for a Safer World’
[normal].
[normal]  This programme seeks to
[normal] dismantle the organi
[normal]s
[normal]ed crime networks 
[normal]that 
[normal]traffic a range
[normal] of illicit goods 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]identify the routes 
[normal]they use (which are often 
[normal]also 
[normal]used by 
[normal]human traffickers and drug smugglers
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PMI works closely with European authorities.  PMI signed a
[normal] Cooperation agreement with the European Commission in 2004, to which the UK, Ireland and 
[normal]all other Member States are also party.
[normal]  
[normal]The agreement established regular exchanges of
[normal] information between PMI, OLAF
[normal] and the Member States regarding seizures of counterfeit and genuine cigarettes.  
[normal]This information 
[normal]underpins
[normal] Project Star, an annual EU wide study of tobacco consumption that PMI commissions from KPMG
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The results
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] presented to both OLAF and representatives of all 
[normal]EU
[normal] Member States
[normal] and 
[normal]allows PMI and law enforcement to identify 
[normal]EU
[normal] wide trends more quickly. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Cooperation
[normal] agreement also established
[normal] a range of supply chain control measures 
[normal]including enhanced ‘Know Your Customer’ checks, sales volume monitoring, and tracking and tracing obligations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK PM
[normal]L
[normal] participates with the rest of the industry and HMRC in an anti-illicit trade working group,
[normal] 
[normal]and also invests significant resources in commissioning research and gathering intelligence on the nature and extent of the illicit trade
[normal].  PMI, along with other industry players, is party to an Intelligence Sharing Protocol with HMRC (with extensive intelligence sharing with HMRC’s FCLO network) and further work is continuing on finalising a broader MOU between HMRC and industry participants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Current sanctions and p[bold]enalties[bold] [bold]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scale of tobacco smuggling,
[normal] the difficulty of detecting it, the involvement of organised crime
[normal], and the wider costs to society make it 
[normal]essential that there is adequate
[normal] deterrence.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Detecting tobacco smuggling is
[normal] often 
[normal]difficult as a significant proportion is imported 
[normal]into the UK 
[normal]by 
[normal]small scale
[normal] smugglers
[normal], a
[normal] 
[normal]method
[normal] 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]used
[normal] 
[normal]by 
[normal]organised criminals 
[normal]with
[normal] networks of ‘mules’
[normal].  
[normal]This is especially true of the 
[normal]East European variants (both counterfeit and contraband)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The penalty for smuggling tobacco into the UK carries a maximum sentence of seven years
[normal].
[normal] Additionally, counterfeiters face sentences of up to ten years for improper use of trademarks,
[normal] and 
[normal]any criminal proceeds
[normal] can be recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 
[normal]2002.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, tobacco smugglers rarely face the maximum penalty, and Trading Standards have recommended that the Sentencing Guidelines issued to the courts be reviewed.
[normal]  Since 2010/11 approximately 43.5% of sentences in 
[normal]England and Wales 
[normal]were non-custodial or suspended sentences, and in Northern Ireland 
[normal]this figure
[normal] was much higher.
[normal]  
[normal]Indeed
[normal], a 
[normal]recent Court of Appeal 
[normal]judgment handed 
[normal]down
[normal] in relation to excise evasion on tobacco backed the need for stronger sentencing.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further inhibiting effective deterrence is the different approach to enforcement across the country.  One success story has been in Liverpool, where t
[normal]he city’s Trading Standards’ Alcohol and Tobacco Unit was set up in 2008.  Funded 
[normal]until
[normal] 2015 by a further injection of £400,000, it has five full time staff and 
[normal]always prosecutes for illicit tobacco seizures, even for 
[normal]cases involving as few as
[normal] 200 cigarettes.  This stance has seen a significant drop in seizures and positive test purchase operations from a peak in 2008-2009 when first formed.  However, this level of commitment is 
[normal]exceptional
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Similarities and differences in tobacco[bold] smuggling [bold]in[bold] the UK and Ireland [bold]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The illicit trades in the UK and Ireland share many characteristics and are closely connected.  
[normal]The 
[normal]2012 KPMG 
[normal]Star Report estimated that 
[normal]the 
[normal]illicit market 
[normal]represented
[normal] 16.4% in the UK 
[normal](the highest annual increase throughout the EU) 
[normal]and 19.1% in Ireland.
[normal]  
[normal]It
[normal] is 
[normal]caused by several factors including high profits for relatively low risk, well organised criminal networks, t
[normal]he relatively high 
[normal]price
[normal] of tobacco (the UK and Ireland have the highest tobacco taxes in the EU), and increasing price sensitivity 
[normal]among consumers hit by
[normal] economic 
[normal]hardship
[normal] (which has led to a wider pattern of down trading to 
[normal]legal 
[normal]cheaper tobacco products).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In both countries test purchasing indicates that illicit tobacco is readily available through a variety of channels, including
[normal] market stalls, pubs, retail outlets
[normal] 
[normal]as well as door–to–door sales, private houses, and via online ads.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Small scale 
[normal]smuggling
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK and Ireland are both vulnerable to 
[normal]small scale
[normal] smuggling, facilitated by 
[normal]cheap and direct transport connections
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]eastern EU Member States
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]low
[normal]er prices
[normal], large 
[normal]diaspora 
[normal]communities
[normal], and 
[normal]associated
[normal] retail outlets that 
[normal]often 
[normal]act as distribution network
[normal]s
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the most popular means of 
[normal]small scale
[normal] smuggling into the UK is 
[normal]via large van and minibus operators that make daily trips from the main Baltic cities to the UK. 
[normal] 
[normal]Smugglers are able to 
[normal]load 
[normal]unaccompanied suitcases filled with contraband 
[normal]for a small fee.  These are
[normal] dropped off at pre-arranged meeting points in the UK.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Larger scale smuggling
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the other end of the spectrum 
[normal]criminals
[normal] with sophisticated clandestine networks for importing and distributing illicit goods are attracted to smuggling tobacco by the relatively low penalties and chances of detection.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Organised criminals are heavily implicated in the UK
[normal] and Irish
[normal] trade
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]  A recent annual survey of Trading Standards’ experience of IP crime has shown the strong link between illicit tobacco and organised crime.
[normal] 
[normal]  Similarly during 
[normal]recent
[normal] test purchasing fieldwork
[normal] commissioned by PML
[normal], Trading Standards regularly pointed to the relationship between drugs trafficking and illicit tobacco
[normal].
[normal] Indeed, 
[normal]Deputy 
[normal]Government Chief Whip
[normal] Lord 
[normal]Newby recently stated in the House of Lords:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]T
[normal]he people who smuggle cigarettes do, indeed, tend to smuggle other things, typically drugs, and sometimes even more dangerous things than that. 
[normal] 
[normal]I do not have an exact breakdown, but a lot of this smuggling is carried out on a large scale by criminal
[normal] 
[normal]gangs who are looking to smuggle anything they can with a high value, of which cigarettes typically are only one component.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity[bold]30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Northern Ireland is responsible for 
[normal]a disproportionate share of the UK gangs involved in tobacco fraud,
[normal] partly due to t
[normal]he activities of paramilitary groups.  
[normal]One hallmark of their involvement is the prevalence of illicit whites, which tend to be imported in bulk and afford larger profits.  These accounted for 78% of the illicit tobacco acquired during recent test purchases, an exceptionally high figure.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of paramilitary groups has been well documented.  
[normal]In 2012 the PSNI and Garda warned that tobacco smuggling was generating significant sums of money for the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.
[normal] 
[normal] It
[normal] helps fund 
[normal]criminal activity spanning drugs, firearms, human trafficking and bomb attacks.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tobacco products from the Far East are often smuggled into Northern Ireland and the UK 
[normal]after being landed at ports in Ireland.  These have been described as a ‘back door’ to the UK
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]making 
[normal]Ireland a 
[normal]“
[normal]huge target
[normal]” according to t
[normal]he head of Irish Customs’ criminal investigations branch.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In recognition of this dynamic, l
[normal]aw enforcement from both countries work closely together.   The 
[normal]Cross Border Tobacco Fraud Enforcement Group (CBTFEG)
[normal] [bold]was 
[normal]established in May 2010 to combat cigarette smuggling within the island of Ireland.  It aims to identify 
[normal]and disrupt
[normal] key 
[normal]criminal gangs
[normal] involved in cigarettes smuggling on both
[normal] sides of 
[normal]the Irish land border.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The possible impact of standardised[bold] (or plain)[bold] packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK[bold]34.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Plain packaging risks fuelling the illicit tobacco trade, as 24 former senior police officers in the UK have warned.
[normal]  Given that large scale smugglers view the UK and Ireland as a single market,
[normal] any increase in the supply of illicit tobacco to Ireland will inevitably flow through to the British mainland. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Plain packaging 
[normal]fuels
[normal] the illicit trade in three ways.
[normal]  First, demand for 
[normal]branded 
[normal]contraband will increase. 
[normal] 
[normal]Introducing plain packaging will not erase branded tobacco, it will just hand a monopoly to criminals who already provide a cheaper product.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]36.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Second, it will facilitate counterfeiting, as 
[normal]multiple 
[normal]experts have warned.
[normal]  Economies of scale make it cheaper for counterfeiters to imitate a single plain packet design than multiple different brands.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Third, by removing branding, 
[normal]the policy will weaken brand loyalty and hasten
[normal] the current trend towards down-trading
[normal].   Ma
[normal]king tobacco a commoditi
[normal]s
[normal]ed product with compet
[normal]ition based purely around price 
[normal]will play into the hands of 
[normal]organised criminals.
[normal] 
[normal] L
[normal]egitimate brands will not
[normal] be able to compete on price
[normal] 
[normal]against
[normal] untaxed and unregulated i
[normal]llicit whites
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]38.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Illicit whites are already a major and fast-growing problem, attracting
[normal] the most
[normal] price-sensitive smokers.  
[normal]An empty pack survey in Q4 2011 found 68 different illicit white brands in the UK, but over 450 have been identified worldwide.
[normal]  Popular demand is proven: p
[normal]lain packaging will
[normal] make Ireland (and the UK) a target for increased supply
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Already ‘baggies’
[normal] (illicit unbranded cigarettes sold cheaply in sealed transparent plastic bags) 
[normal]and unbranded loose tobacco are 
[normal]common in many countries. 
[normal] The situation
[normal] in the UK and Ireland could easily deteriorate further.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]f, as anticipated, plain packaging leads to price reductions and therefore increases in tobacco excise to compensate, the price difference between the legal and illicit products will increase. This will increase the profit for tobacco smugglers and further incentivize them to target the Irish market.  For the reasons discussed above, any increase in supply to Ireland will flow through to the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]40.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]New data on the illicit tobacco trade in Australia
[normal], 
[normal]the only country to have introduced plain packaging
[normal], 
[normal]will be available by the end of September. 
[normal] PML intends 
[normal]to share this information with the Committee before the Inquiry closes.
