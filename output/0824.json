"Written evidence from Janssen (LTC 74)Introduction1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen is the Pharmaceutical Operating Company of the Johnson &amp; Jo\nhnson family of companies. \nJohnson &amp; Johnson is the largest healthcare company in the world and has a tradition of commitment to the UK, being established in the UK since 1927. Today, Johnson &amp; Johnson employs circa 5,000 people across the UK. We have manufacturing sites in Inverness, Blackpool, Livingston, Cardiff and research and development facilities in Inverness, Leeds, and High Wycombe.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are committed to delivering innovative medicines which make an important difference to the lives of patients with serious health conditions such as hepatitis C, HIV, schizophrenia and cancer.\n \nJanssen is committed to providing medicines that have a real impact on the lives of patients and reduce health inequalities. We welcome the opportunity to respond to this inquiry.\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are pleased that diabetes and severe mental health conditions are recognised as areas that need to be reviewed as part of this inquiry. \n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen also believes that there are further conditions that should be considered within this enquiry, including psoriasis\n and \nHIV\n.\n \n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs recognised by the inquiry, all long-term conditions \n(LTCs) \npresent a huge burden to the NHS and social care system accounting f\nor 70% of health and care spend, affecting over 20 million people in England,\n however equal recognition \nshould be given \nto the impact \nof \ncaring for someone with a LTC. Provisions for carers should be examined by the Health Committee as they play an integral role in delivering care and treatment to those affected. \n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntegral to the management of all LTCs is the need for excellent patient information and support. In the advent of the \nrecent \nNHS reforms\n,\n it is crucial that attention is given to the provision of accurate, reputable advice on how to manage a LTC. This information can be used to empower a patient (or their carer) to take responsibility for their own condition and optimise their personal management.\n \n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is critical that patients have access to cost-effective innovation as part of an integrated pathway of care and that CCGs are measured, incentivised and rewarded for delivering excellence in the care of patients with LTCs. Uptake of new technologies that improve outcomes must be central to this in the new NHS.\nDiabetes8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scale of the challenge that diabetes presents in the UK should not be underestimated, with high, recorded prevalence of diabetes and associated co-morbidities across the country, as well as high estimations of undiagnosed populations. Early diagnosis, preventative treatment and multi-disciplinary team support of the patients will undoubtedly mean increased financ\nial pressure in the short-term; h\nowever, leaving these patients undiagnosed until further\n complications ensue\n will result in a heavier\n total\n cost burden to \nthe \nNHS\n.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is fundamentally important to have clear\n consistent\n processes \nacross all CCGs \nin place for early diagn\nosis and management of diabetes, with plans which are\n specific\n and measurable\n. Short-term investment in early detection, diagnosis and good management will lead not only \nto good practice, but also long-\nterm savings result\ning\n from \navoiding complications\n and late identification of the disease.\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nplanning\n of future \nservices\n in diabetes \nshould include\n \nperformance \nreports \nmeasured \nagainst outcomes, \nwith \nindicators and performance measures published regularly \nand made \navailable\n in \nthe public domain. \nS\nignificant \nresource investment and supp\nort will be required to have an impact on the problems that occur due to diabetes\n. \nAdditionally, \nthrough working in innovative ways with partners\n,\n both within NHS \nEngland\n and outside, huge improvements can be achieved. \nJanssen \nis committed to providing solutions in diabetes and would be supportive \nof initiatives that address the \nchallenge\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n10.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen endorses the conclusions and recommendations outlined in the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts report by the Department of Health, entitled \nThe management of adult diabetes services in the NHS\n (Seventeenth Report of Session 2012–13)\n http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/289/289.pdf\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary, Janssen believe that d\niabetes care is too\n often \nvaried and inconsistent with unnecessary failings \ncontinuing to occur\n. \nTo prevent these instances from happening, better tr\naining and education for all healthcare professionals throughout the NHS should be introduced\n. D\nue to the epidemic \nproportions of people affected by diabetes, it\n is imperative that education\n addresses how\n diabetes should be observed and monitored in patients with multiple morbidities\n.\nSchizophrenia12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor over 50 years, \nJanssen has continually invested in medicines to improve the lives of people with devastating and disabling mental health conditions. Although medicines have improved during this time, people with conditions such as schizophrenia and ADHD still face challenges in staying well and living long active lives. Compared with physical health conditions, mental illness is still seen as the ‘Cinderella’ of the health service. Janssen is committed \nto working with mental health and neurological services to continually challenge the current status quo to improve the lives of everyone involved.\n \n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen is broadly aligned to the findings of the recent Schizophrenia Commission report entitled ‘The Abandoned Illness’ (\nwww.schizophreniacommission.org.uk\n) and the 42 recommendations highlighted within it. While ensuring access to medicines\n is\n optimised for patients affected by schizophrenia, other aspects of care are integral to improving the treatment pathways and support for this patient group. \nIn summary, Janssen supports the notion that people with schizophrenia need: \n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs an organisation we are aligned to all the themes covered by the \nreport from the Schizophrenia Commission\n and believe that this should provide the foundation for the Inquiry to refer to and act upon. Key asks include: \n14.1\n              \nImproved provision for the genuine involvement of the patient and his/her carer in decisions relating to their treatment and care, wherever possible\n&#xa0;\n14.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\neduc\ned\n stigma – for the people affected by schizophrenia, the illness itself and its treatment\n&#xa0;\n14.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReduced \ninequality – both geographical inequity in the quality of care patients receive, but also versus investment for physical health conditions, not affected by the same taboos and stigma of schizophrenia and other serious mental illness\n&#xa0;\n14.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nmprov\ned\n regularity and robustness of evaluation and accountability for achieving outcomes\n&#xa0;\n14.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nncourag\ned \nearly intervention to i\nmprove long-\nterm outcomes in people with schizophrenia\n&#xa0;\n14.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEstablished and\n well integrated services to facilitate increased and better quality care in the community\n&#xa0;\n14.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApart \nfrom holistic treatment, \nan established\n \nand \ntangible means to help people with schizophrenia to restore a meaningful life, such as initiatives to help them return to work\n14.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncentivised \norganisations \nwho \ninvest and work together to research new treatments for schizophrenia\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\nollowing the publication of ‘The Abandoned Illness’ report\n, Janssen is particularly supportive of the following recommendations that would improve the treatment and care for this patient group: \n15.1 \nWe recommend that the Work Capability Assessment process is amended for people with schizophrenia and psychosis to require the Department for Work and Pensions to seek information from health professionals to guide decisions rather than requiring potentially vulnerable people to navigate complex systems in order to provide it themselves. The same principle should be built into plans relating to any qualifying assessment for the new Personal Independence Payment \n(recommendation 8)\n&#xa0;\n15.2 \nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Department of Health should regularly repeat the National Audit of Schizophrenia on prescribing and make public its results so that not only Mental Health Trusts and providers but also service users and carers can see the performance of local services. Clinical Commissioning Groups should only commission mental health providers who are signed up to the audit and who provide plans for improving practice in response to any outlier results \n(recommendation 11)\n&#xa0;\n15.3 \nAll Clinical Commissioning Groups commission Early Intervention in Psychosis services\n with sufficient resources to provide fidelity to the service model.\n \nIt is crucial that the NHS Commissioning Board holds local commissioners to account for this and we recommend that early intervention services are included in the NHS Commissioning Outcomes Framework \n(recommendation 22)\n&#xa0;\n15.4 \nClinical Commissioning Groups explore the scope to commission integrated community\n teams bringing together primary care and specialist staff to support people with mental illness in the community\n (recommendation 30)\n&#xa0;\n15.5 \nAll mental health providers should ensure that people with schizophrenia and psychosis (in hospital and the community) are aware of their\n right to request a review of their medication\n including, where appropriate, access to a specialist pharmacist, and are encouraged to exercise it in practice \n(recommendation 33)\nHIV16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChronic long-term condition management is becoming increasingly relevant to HIV care. \nWith the continual advances in HIV medicine, the long-term care of patients is now a pertinent and urgent issue for the NHS. \nClinicians are now experiencing an increasingly older population of HIV patients\n who \nneed to be able to manage their condition on a long-term basis. \nCare pathways and the management of HIV services need to adapt to cater for this patient cohort, \ndespite the financial pressures of the NHS.\n \nTreatment and support must be sustained and enhanced as new structures emerge within an evolving NHS. \n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJan\nssen broadly supports the recently published \nBHIVA Standards of Care for People Living with HIV\n \n(\nwww.bhiva.org/documents/Standards-of-care/BHIVAStandardsA4.pdf\n). \nSpecifically for the purposes of this response in relation to LTCs, Janssen endorses BHIVA’s recognition that as people with HIV live lo\nnger, their health needs change\n and both the numbers of co-morbidities and the complexity of prescribing for multiple health conditions increases. BHIVA’s standards (3 and 5) should be referred to by the Health Select \nCommittee\n to ensure that there is focus on the delivery of high-quality\n \noutpatient and inpatient care for HIV services, ensuring that all people have equitable\n \naccess to high standards of care wherever they live.\n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitoring and treatment for people with HIV infection needs to be in accordance with current national guidelines to maximise health and life expectancy and minimise morbidity and mortality. The combination of an ageing HIV cohort, longer duration of HIV infection and long-term antiretroviral therapy for HIV has resulted in a shift in HIV-associated pathology from ill-health associated with severe immunosuppression to non-AIDS co-morbidities such as neurological, heart, liver and renal disease and cancers.\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrimary care has an important role in the long-term management of HIV. Indeed, due to the increase in non-AIDS comorbidity and the complexity of HIV drug–drug interactions, lack of communication with GPs has been shown to be an important patient safety concern. Establishment of clear protocols and pathways for care between both primary and secondary care is essential for safe delivery of care, and regular communication is strongly recommended unless the patie\nnt specifically refuses consent.\nPsoriasis 20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor some patients, p\nsoriasis \ncan result \nin profound\n functional, psychological, and social morbidity, with consequent reduced levels of employment and income. Factors that contribute to this include symptoms related to the skin (for example, chronic itch, bleeding, scaling and nail involvement), problems related to treatments, psoriatic arthritis, and the effect of living with a highly visible, stigmatising skin disease. Even people with minimal involvement state that psoriasis has a major effect on their life. Several studies have also reported that people with psoriasis, particularly those with severe disease, may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. \n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSelf care is an essential part of \na psoriasis patient’s\n daily life\n as well as receiving appropriate support from \npeople involved in \ntheir\n care. \nWhile psoriasis can be effectively managed with appropriate treatments, it is essential that patients sustain regular contact with their GP/specialist. \n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen \nbroadly \nsupports the recent Clinical Guideline from NICE on the Management of P\nsoriasis (\nhttp://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13938/61190/61190.pdf\n) particularly the recognition given to the need \nfor psoriasis severity and impact on psychological and social wellbeing to be regularly assessed\n by the healthcare professional, often in primary care\n. The need for regular assessments for psoriatic arthritis (\nPsA\n) is also a key priority for implementation, with the guidance recommending that people with psoriasis be assessed for \nPsA\n annually, and referred to a Rheumatologist as soon as it is suspected.\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen also supports the Psoriasis Association’s view that, ‘\nPsoriasis is a life-long condition and so patients should be managed effectively and holistically so as to lessen the negative impacts on quality of life and psychological well-being that can be associated with it\n’\n. \n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJanssen is committed to ensuring patients with psoriasis lead a life that is as normal as possible. We regularly seek feedback from healthcare professionals and patient organisations to determine what th\ney need\n. As a result of this two-way dialogue, Janssen believes that k\ney priorities for \nthe \nmanag\nement of \npsoriasis as a long-term condition include:\n24.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\nractical support and advice regardi\nng the use of topical therapies\n: \nM\nany patients currently are expected to just know how to apply their treatments effectively and to get the most satisfactory results from them. \n&#xa0;\n24.2\n              \nA\n review four weeks after starting a new topical treatment in adults\n: \nThis\n is standard practice for many long-term conditions to have a follow-up appointment when starting on new treatments and psoriasis should be no different. \n&#xa0;\n24.3\n              \nA\n regular a\nssessment of the impact of psoriasis\n on the patient\n: \nPatients should be assessed on the \nimpact \nthat \npsoriasis\n has on their \nphysical, psy\nchological and social wellbeing\n and for this impact to be recorded and treated as effecti\nvely as the skin manifestation.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n"
