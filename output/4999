default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultSir Alan Haselhurst MP, defaultChair of the Administration Committeedefault&#xa0;defaultThank you for your letter dated 16 December regarding your Committee's 
defaultinquiry into the impact of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 and how it 
defaultmay affect the work of select committees in the year before the general 
defaultelection.
defaultAs you will be aware, the Administration Committee does not scrutinise 
defaultlegislation or Government policy. Our remit is to examine the services 
defaultprovided by and for Members and visitors to Parliament by the House of 
defaultCommons. The Committee's programme of work is therefore less affected by 
defaultthe clear timetabling of the next general election than other departmental 
defaultselect committees who may undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.
defaultHowever, certainty about the date of the next general election is very 
defaultwelcome in terms of timetabling the Committee's business and helping the 
defaultHouse prepare effectively for dissolution and ensure suitable new induction 
defaultarrangements for new Members in 2015. The Committee examined this 
defaultmatter in some detail in its recent report, 
defaultFirst Weeks at Westminster: 
defaultinduction arrangements for new Members in 2015, 
defaultwhich you may be 
defaultinterested to consult.
