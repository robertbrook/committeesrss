[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Sir Alan Haselhurst MP, [bold]Chair of the Administration Committee[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Thank you for your letter dated 16 December regarding your Committee's 
[normal]inquiry into the impact of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 and how it 
[normal]may affect the work of select committees in the year before the general 
[normal]election.
[normal]As you will be aware, the Administration Committee does not scrutinise 
[normal]legislation or Government policy. Our remit is to examine the services 
[normal]provided by and for Members and visitors to Parliament by the House of 
[normal]Commons. The Committee's programme of work is therefore less affected by 
[normal]the clear timetabling of the next general election than other departmental 
[normal]select committees who may undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.
[normal]However, certainty about the date of the next general election is very 
[normal]welcome in terms of timetabling the Committee's business and helping the 
[normal]House prepare effectively for dissolution and ensure suitable new induction 
[normal]arrangements for new Members in 2015. The Committee examined this 
[normal]matter in some detail in its recent report, 
[normal]First Weeks at Westminster: 
[normal]induction arrangements for new Members in 2015, 
[normal]which you may be 
[normal]interested to consult.
