&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Chris Bazlinton (SLC 012)&#xa0;1. SUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I would be happy to expand on any of the points made.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Was there a cover up?]]]

[[[ Withholding of evidence]]]&#xa0;1.1 Throughout, Network Rail and others have gone out of their way to deny there was any cover up.  But there has never been any investigation or internal inquiry to determine one way or another.  In some ways, the events suggest more of a conspiracy of silence.  This revolves round two main documents – Part B (which suggested in 2002 that locking the gates at Elsenham should be considered) and the Hudd memo written in 2001 (which drew attention to the dangers of the crossing “…the risk of disaster is real” …. “irresistible... temptation” to cross exactly as the girls had done, thereby predicting the accident that killed the girls).  Neither of these documents appeared until 2011.  If it was not a cover-up or conspiracy of silence, the facts suggest massive incompetence and failure by officials to discover the background to what happened.&#xa0;1.2 Clearly given the culpability of Network Rail, the successful prosecution by ORR and subsequent sentence, some officials failed in their responsibilities but none have been held accountable or suffered any consequences of that failure.  None have been publicly questioned about their role or knowledge, except as it related to the ORR investigation which led to the prosecution of Network Rail as an entity, but not any individuals.&#xa0;1.3 The existence of Part B and the Hudd memo was revealed by Mo Rosse in 2010 who said it had been her responsibility to send all relevant documents to Network Rail’s Legal Department, shortly after the accident.  She has been adamant that Part B and the Hudd memo, were included.  However, her computer was later wiped and no evidence exists.  What makes her evidence so important is that without it, the families would not have known or followed up their inquiries, and the information would have never become public.&#xa0;1.4 Other officials who were involved include Jo Green, then Route Production Manager when she received the Hudd memo.  She told ORR that she could not remember receiving the memo.&#xa0;1.5 Another was Philip Heath, at the time of the accident General Manager for West Anglia.  He prepared a witness statement for the civil case brought by the parents against Network Rail.  This statement was never used as Network Rail conceded the case.  However, it was placed on the Network Rail website in February as a press statement just as The Times revealed the existence of Part B.  It disappeared days later.  In it Philip Heath stated that he was not aware of any other serious incidents or problems at Elsenham until the accident on 3 December 2005.  In July 2010 at the time of the civil case he asked Mo Rosse, who was suspended at the time, whether she had any documents relating to Elsenham: she didn’t.&#xa0;1.6 Among other officials who have never been questioned publicly about their role in the matter are Robin Gisby, Managing Director Network Operations, and Richard Smith, Solicitor for Network Rail though whom all documents would have passed, and Jon Wiseman, then Route Director for East Anglia  (who later reported directly to Robin Gisby), and since retired (he was questioned at the Inquest but did not reveal the existence of part B and the Hudd memo).  It is clear that Richard Smith knew about the documents before they appeared in The Times: we know this as a result of evidence provided through a Freedom of Information disclosure by ORR.  Yet the Hudd document was still withheld until ORR announced it was going to visit Network Rail to look through files in May 2011.  It was handed to them the same afternoon and issued to the families by Chief Executive David Higgins that day.  No action has been taken about this withholding of information.  &#xa0;1.7  The first inquiry was carried out by the industry’s Rail Safety Standards Board (RSSB) which in 2011 admitted it had seen Part B (though not the Hudd memo).  However, the RSSB’s report never mentioned Part B.&#xa0;1.8  Neither Part B nor the Hudd memo were among the evidence presented among the documents issued in connection with the Inquest.&#xa0;

[[[The Inquest]]]&#xa0;2.1 At a pre Inquest hearing and subsequently, Network Rail and the train companies made representations that risk assessment evidence should not be given.  During the Inquest one of their barristers raised the issue and persuaded the Coroner to ensure that this evidence was not considered.&#xa0;2.2 Among the documents which were excluded was one by Iain Ferguson of the Health and Safety Executive.  He concluded that a risk assessment held in 2005 was inadequate in that it did not adequately address the consequences of someone stepping in front of a train, and that the crossing was not compliant with a section of the Requirements for Level Crossings.  He concluded:  “I would not consider Network Rail’s assessment methodologies… to be suitable and sufficient”.&#xa0;2.3 Inquests are not supposed to be confrontational, but the way in which Network Rail in particular used legal devices to exclude such evidence left us as families deeply unhappy that we had been cheated and treated unfairly.  That feeling rankles even more now that we know that vital and relevant documents were withheld by Network Rail.&#xa0;

[[[Failures in risk assessment]]]&#xa0;3.1  I have made a few comments about the failures of Network Rail’s risk assessment but this issue has been covered at length  by the RAIB, HSE and others.  Suffice it to say, it was revealed that the assessments carried out at Elsenham were seriously flawed but it took until 2011 before any real action was taken. &#xa0;3.2  Safety assessments have improved but there has been too much reliance on rigid statistical methods, as witnessed by faulty assessments at Elsensham on a number of occasions.  I believe greater reliance on commonsense and human judgment would improve matters – in both cases where the true dangers were revealed (by Hudd and Hill) it was down to basic observation, not mathematical formulae. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Johnson’s Crossing]]]&#xa0;4.1 The lack of proper investigation and  accountability has also been the case following the death of Katie Littlewood at Johnsons Crossing which ironically happened days before Network Rail pleaded guilty over the Elsenham deaths.&#xa0;4.2 The RAIB investigation into this case revealed important failings by Network Rail.  It revealed: “Between 1996 and 2007, there had been a series of suggestions and proposals to divert pedestrians away from Johnson’s footpath crossing or to replace the crossing with a bridge. The RAIB has been unable to establish fully why none of these proposals from were progressed” and “Network Rail did not follow-up a proposal in 2007 to install a footbridge to replace Johnson’s footpath crossing, after analysis had shown that the benefits of so doing would exceed the costs”.&#xa0;4.3  The report also revealed: “A tracking sheet used by the Anglia operational risk team recorded that a submission had been made for funding by November 2008. A key witness has reported that this submission  [for funding] was rejected, although the RAIB has not seen any documentary evidence of this. Neither the former Route Operations Manager nor the former Route Enhancements Manager (who would normally have applied for funding,..) could recall a proposal for a bridge or find any record that a funding submission had in fact been made”.&#xa0;4.4 It is clear that had Network Rail acted as it should have done, Katie Littlewood would not have died at the crossing.&#xa0;4.5  Again no internal investigation has taken place to determine what went wrong and who was responsible.  The ORR has, unfortunately, taken no action to prosecute Network Rail in this case.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Improving safety at level crossings]]]

[[[: reducing risk]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1 Evidence shows that for a variety of reasons, pedestrians and drivers take risks at level crossings.  Ways need to be found to make it near impossible to encroach on rail lines, and there should be greater use of modern technology for distance control of crossing at more remote locations.  The default position should be that all gates at all crossings are locked when trains are passing through.  All crossings should be gated with half barriers replaced by full barriers in all cases to deter drivers and pedestrians from circumventing gates.&#xa0;5.2 There appears to be a long held policy within Network Rail that pedestrian gates cannot be locked on some crossings. While there are other problems that can arise unless gates are locked there will continue to be fatal accidents.  The point has often been made that locking gates can result in pedestrian being trapped.  One solution to that is to incorporate ‘safe’ areas between locked gates and the track itself.  At Elsenham before the accident such ‘safe’ areas – more than one metre square, sufficient to take two pedestrians and a pram or buggy – existed.  Yet officials at the time refused to accept that this was the purpose of these areas, arguing instead for unlocked gates so that pedestrians pass through if caught in the track area between the gates.&#xa0;5.3  Another argument is that gates can only be locked if there are gate keepers in attendance.  (At Elsenham, the gatekeepers had only limited responsibility for observing the crossing).  However, advances in modern technology (both in what it can achieve and price) are such that it should be possible to lock pedestrian gates from central locations, and use CCTV and interactive audio and video to allow officials, train drivers and pedestrians to communicate.  Use of such devices could mean gates at little used crossings could be locked until opening is requested by pedestrians.&#xa0;5.4  It would also be beneficial to include LDC/LED displays to inform pedestrians of when the next train is due, where the approaching train is and how long it will be before the gates are released.  Such displays are now ubiquitous at stations to inform passengers of train arrivals – this is partly a result of the huge reduction in cost of such systems.  These displays could also be included could also be a service to vehicle drivers at crossings and thus help reduce frustration: informed drivers and pedestrians are less likely to take any precipitate or potentially risky actions such as attempting to cross the line.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
