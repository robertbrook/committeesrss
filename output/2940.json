"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRenewableUK welcomes the \nopportunity to provide comment to the Environmental Audit Committee on the Government’s biodiversity offsetting\n \nconsultation. \n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSummaryIn summary, RenewableUK’s view on Government’s proposals in their \nbiodiversity offsetting\n \nconsultation is as follows:\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nComments on the biodiversity offsetting proposals&#xa0;\nChoice on use of offsetting\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRenewableUK is not against the principle of introducing biodiversity offsetting in England on a voluntary basis. Subject to following the mitigation strategy in Box 2 of the consultation document (i.e. avoidance-mitigation-compensation), we would in principle be supportive of the introduction of a fully permissive approach to offsetting, where developers choose whether to use the proposed offsetting metric to assess the impact of their projects and the means for compensation.\n&#xa0;\nThe pilot biodiversity metric\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDifferent types of development will affect\n a given habitat in different ways. For wind energy development, it is important to consider its benefits in terms of climate change mitigation and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which are resulting from displacing other, more polluting forms of energy generation. This has long-term positive implications for biodiversity protection. At \nthe same time, the footprint of wind energy projects on the land is much smaller than other development which involves buildings, hence the effects on a given habitat or species will be quite different. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn some cases, wind energy projects are able to provide a number of biodiversity enhancements on site, as part of site management plans. Additionally, in the vast majority of cases agricultural landuses are able to continue on sites where turbines have been installed, again due to the light footprint of wind energy development. \nOn this basis, the metric needs to be adjusted for different types of development and infrastructure and this \nlevel of \ndetail needs to be included in any proposals for the introduction of biodiversity offsetting. \n&#xa0;\nThresholds on offsetting\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor wind energy projects, the threshold needs to be different than those for housing, for example. Wind energy does not have a large footprint on the land and the way it may affect habitats and species will therefore be different to having more ‘solid’ development like buildings. As commented above, i\nt is also important to consider its benefits in terms of climate change mitigation and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which are resulting from displacing other, more polluting forms of energy generation. This has long-term positive implications for biodiversity protection\n. \nOn this basis, the metric as well as the thresholds need to be adjusted for different types of development. \n&#xa0;\nCovenants\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRenewableUK recently submitted comments to the Law commission’s conservation covenants consultation\n, which are relevant to the suggestion in Defra’s consultation (see Section 5.8) that covenants may be used to secure biodiversity offsetting\n. \nIn summary, under the current system \nwind energy schemes are often affected by restrictive covenants. \nIn some cases t\nhey\n \nend up restricting wind energy development, which may otherwise be acceptable in planning\n \nterms.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder current legislation, restrictive covenants are in favour of one nearby piece of land, so developers can\n \nsometimes negotiate a release with the landowner who holds the benefit, or obtain title insurance to allow a\n \nscheme to continue. In some cases therefore, commercial factors can persuade landowners that a covenant is\n \nno longer necessary or relevant, thus freeing up land for development. This is particularly the case where\n \ncovenants were entered a long time ago by previous landowners and the surrounding area has become more\n \nbuilt up.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder the new conservation covenants, the body enforcing them will not stand to gain financially from\n \nreleasing covenants, so large areas of land could more easily be sterilised. Unless “public interest” protections\n \nare built into the new system, this runs contrary to planning policy, at a time \nwhen there is pressure to build\n \nnew homes, and when the majority of the public support renewable energy.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the moment, restrictive covenants are completely separate from the planning regime. So a site could\n \nreceive planning consent for a turbine for example, but the scheme be prevented by a historical covenant in\n \nfavour of a private landowner. If there is to be a new statutory scheme (and particularly because it will make\n \nit easier to sterilise large areas of land and harder to negotiate a release), it is our view that public interest in\n \nland being available for renewable energy schemes should be considered and included\n in any new provisions for the establishment of covenants in relation to biodiversity offsetting\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAny new proposals to introduce covenants for the purposes of biodiversity offsetting should ensure that wind energy is not unduly restricted by covenants which are out of date. \nIt is our view that there are two possible ways of building a “public interest” element into the new system\n, which could solve this issue\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEffects on planning applications\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is our view that, should it be introduced, biodiversity offsetting should not be backdated. Introducing such a requirement and backdating it would have a negative impact on the financial viability of projects which are already in the system. Not backdating any biodiversity offsetting requirements would ensure that wind energy projects which are already in the planning system are not affected. At the same time, new projects which are entering the system will have a chance to consider their options pre-application and choose the best route forward in selecting the suitable sites for proposing development. \n&#xa0;\nDeciding whether harm is significant\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn deciding whether harm to an ecosystem is significant, it is important for local authorities to bear in mind the following two principles of defining significant harm, which are established under the Environmental Protection Act:\n&#xa0;\n15 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
