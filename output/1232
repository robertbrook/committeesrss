default&#xa0;
defaultI represent a township in Nottinghamshire called 
defaultHucknall
default (former MP Paddy Tipping) and back in 2008, a grandmother and her grand
defaultson were killed (hit by a train) on a pedestrian crossing known as either
default 
defaultBayles
default and 
defaultWyhles
default or 
defaultMoorbridge
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year, another tragic death occurred, this time involving a 13 year girl who was hit by a tram (NET).
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have been a total of 5 deaths at this crossing, along with 2 horse related incidents, and numerous "near mis
defaultses" The 2 human deaths are believed to be suicide.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have held several public meetings, and met with different Network Rail chiefs to try my best to get things resolved, and only now - after the third death have Network Rail decided to build and fund a f
defaultootbridge over this crossing.
default&#xa0;
defaultMembers of our community, have found this difficult to accept, if it was known that this busy pedestrian crossing was a potential source of yet another accident, why then, after the 2 deaths in 2008 was a footbridge not erect
defaulted then?
default&#xa0;
defaultNobody knows the criteria which Network Rail are 
defaultworking
default to, and it appears that everything is funding orientated, yet Network Rail are quite prepared to pay the fines imposed by the courts for errors of their judgement. 
defaultLeeds
default £450,000 and £1 mil
defaultlion at 
defaultElsenham
default.
default Would it not have made more common sense to have executed the safety works - and saved lives, rather than pay the fines and they still have to do the safety works after.
default&#xa0;
defaultI welcome, and would be honoured with the opportunity to address yo
defaultur Select Committee to explain the tragic events which have occurred in 
defaultHucknall
default over the past 5 years, as unfortunately I've been involved in them all, and perhaps I will be able to give your committee the community concerns and facts.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany believe that 
defaultthe recommendations from the Transport Select Committee need to reflect 
defaulta clear criteria
default, which Network Rail must keep to, with the emphasis on protecting lives.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould you need any further information, please do not hesitate in contacting me.
