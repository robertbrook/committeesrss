[normal]Written evidence from Ashfield District Council
[normal]/ Nottinghamshire County 
[normal]Council
[normal](
[normal]SLC 0001)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I represent a township in Nottinghamshire called 
[normal]Hucknall
[normal] (former MP Paddy Tipping) and back in 2008, a grandmother and her grand
[normal]son were killed (hit by a train) on a pedestrian crossing known as either
[normal] 
[normal]Bayles
[normal] and 
[normal]Wyhles
[normal] or 
[normal]Moorbridge
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Last year, another tragic death occurred, this time involving a 13 year girl who was hit by a tram (NET).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There have been a total of 5 deaths at this crossing, along with 2 horse related incidents, and numerous "near mis
[normal]ses" The 2 human deaths are believed to be suicide.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have held several public meetings, and met with different Network Rail chiefs to try my best to get things resolved, and only now - after the third death have Network Rail decided to build and fund a f
[normal]ootbridge over this crossing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Members of our community, have found this difficult to accept, if it was known that this busy pedestrian crossing was a potential source of yet another accident, why then, after the 2 deaths in 2008 was a footbridge not erect
[normal]ed then?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nobody knows the criteria which Network Rail are 
[normal]working
[normal] to, and it appears that everything is funding orientated, yet Network Rail are quite prepared to pay the fines imposed by the courts for errors of their judgement. 
[normal]Leeds
[normal] £450,000 and £1 mil
[normal]lion at 
[normal]Elsenham
[normal].
[normal] Would it not have made more common sense to have executed the safety works - and saved lives, rather than pay the fines and they still have to do the safety works after.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I welcome, and would be honoured with the opportunity to address yo
[normal]ur Select Committee to explain the tragic events which have occurred in 
[normal]Hucknall
[normal] over the past 5 years, as unfortunately I've been involved in them all, and perhaps I will be able to give your committee the community concerns and facts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many believe that 
[normal]the recommendations from the Transport Select Committee need to reflect 
[normal]a clear criteria
[normal], which Network Rail must keep to, with the emphasis on protecting lives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate in contacting me.
