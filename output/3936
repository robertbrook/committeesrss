defaultSubmission from Harold Roger Lovegrovedefault&#xa0;defaultSupport for Single register of Electrical Contractorsdefault&#xa0;defaultSubmission Summary :default&#xa0;defaultPersonal DetailsdefaultMy name is 
defaultHarold 
defaultRoger Lovegrove.  I am an
default Inc
defaultorporated Electrical Engineer, 
defaultFellow of the Institution of Engineering Technology.  I have 
defaultbeen 
defaultin the electrical installation industry all of my working life: apprentice, electrician, contracts engineer, manager, managing director.   Consultant for 
default25 years  specialis
defaulting
default in Inspection and 
defaultT
defaultesting

defaultnstallations
default, 
defaultinvestigating electrical installation problems 
defaultand p
defaultroviding electrical installation condition reports
default.  Also I provide 
defaultexpert witness 
defaultservices and 
defaultreports.   
default&#xa0;
defaultReasons for supportdefaultI strongly support the need of a single electrical safety register as launched by the ECA and the ESC for electrical contractors operating in the domestic and commercial / industrial electrical installation market place for the following reasons:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe regi
defaultster will be of great 
defaultbenefit to consumers, clients and specifiers as a single 
defaultreference 
defaultpoint to  source a competent electrical contractor.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have found many installations that are sub-standard and many with dangerous conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultInvariably the cause ha
defaults been incompetence of the installer: poor workmanship; a lack of technical knowledge; non-compliance with Wiring Regulations, BS 7671.
default&#xa0;
defaultBuilding Regulations Part PdefaultPrevious governments set up Part P of the Building regulations with the intention of improv
defaulting the saf
defaultety of electrical installations in dwellings.
default  
defaultPart P made it a legal requirement for electrical installation work in dwellings to comply with the BS7671
default:
default Requirements for Electrical Installations
default -
default The IE
defaultT
default Wiring Regulations.  Most competent el
defaultectrical contractors understand these regulations and 
defaultthe 
defaultPart P 
defaultrequirement to
default be registered with a 
default‘
defaultcompetence 
defaultpersons
default scheme provider
default’
default.
default 
defaultHence in the main Part P 
defaultwas welcomed by electrical contractors.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe requirements of Part P were originally fairly 
defaultr
defaultestrictive for non-electrical persons and DIY installers to undertake electrical installation work.  In my view Part P has been very effective. It has improved competence in the industry and made DIYer’s more aware of the dangers electricity can create in 
defaulttheir homes.  The downside that Building 
defaultControl 
defaultDepartments have been unable to adequately police the system.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default 2011 revision to Part P
default has watered down the technical requirements of Part P, also 
defaultit 
defaultnow permits electrical installation work to be carrie
defaultd out by unqualified persons providing the work is checked and certified by a competent third party.  This part of the revision is not yet in operation as there are no third party competent person schemes yet in operation. Until 
defaultthere is, 
defaulthome safety standards 
defaultare likely  
default to drop back to pre-2005 standards
default and the door is open again for Rogue traders and DYEers
default&#xa0;
default defaultCompetent Persons Scheme Operators.defaultAt the onset of Part P there wer
defaulte
default 
defaultsix or seven s
defaultcheme operators. Some of which have been in 
defaultplace for many years enabling contractors to register voluntarily.  Some schemes typically NICEIC
default are
default well known in the construction 
defaultindustry
default also to Local Authorities and Housing Associations etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultBecause there are so many different 
defaultscheme 
defaultoperators each
default having their own rules and criteria, standards and qualifying requirements are wide and varied.  Some of the operators provide training courses to their own standards and specifications
default. T
defaulthere is no common denominator.
default 
defaultAlso t
defaulthere needs to be a common appr
defaultoach to training 
defaultnot only to 
defaultcontractors 
defaultbut the 
defaulttrainers
default who train them.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMost scheme operators are monitored by UKAS but this does not necessarily mean that there is a common standard or common procedures in place.
default&#xa0;
defaultCompetition between 
defaultscheme 
defaultoperators means that standards vary.  
defaultI understand that s
defaultome operators 
defaultmay
default only carry out a ‘desk top’ assessment of an applicant whereas others will insist on 
defaultalways 
defaultvisiting the contracto

defaultprior to inspecting some of the contractor’s on-site installation work.
default&#xa0;
defaultDiscipline is another issue.  It is not uncommon for a contractor who has been removed from a register for bad work or other serious non-conformity to become registered 
defaultwith another scheme operator almost immediately without any reference being made to the original operator’s reasons for removal.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have seen a contractor advertising registration 
defaultwith two scheme operators. When questioned I was informed that he was given 
defaultregistration by the second operator in order to promote their scheme. 
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom the foregoingdefault it can be seen that the present situation with a number of scheme operators having various standards is most unsatisfactory from not only a safety perspective but defaultalso for public perception of the effectiveness of the Part P legislation.  I therefore defaultsubmit that it is of paramount importance defaultfor there to be a single default‘defaultnot for profitdefault’default scheme provider monitored by UKAS rather than a number of operators working to their own agenda and possible profitability.default&#xa0;
