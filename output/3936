[normal]Submission from Harold Roger Lovegrove[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Support for Single register of Electrical Contractors[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Submission Summary :[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Personal Details[bold]My name is 
[normal]Harold 
[normal]Roger Lovegrove.  I am an
[normal] Inc
[normal]orporated Electrical Engineer, 
[normal]Fellow of the Institution of Engineering Technology.  I have 
[normal]been 
[normal]in the electrical installation industry all of my working life: apprentice, electrician, contracts engineer, manager, managing director.   Consultant for 
[normal]25 years  specialis
[normal]ing
[normal] in Inspection and 
[normal]T
[normal]esting 
[normal]E
[normal]lectrical 
[normal]I
[normal]nstallations
[normal], 
[normal]investigating electrical installation problems 
[normal]and p
[normal]roviding electrical installation condition reports
[normal].  Also I provide 
[normal]expert witness 
[normal]services and 
[normal]reports.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reasons for support[bold]I strongly support the need of a single electrical safety register as launched by the ECA and the ESC for electrical contractors operating in the domestic and commercial / industrial electrical installation market place for the following reasons:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The regi
[normal]ster will be of great 
[normal]benefit to consumers, clients and specifiers as a single 
[normal]reference 
[normal]point to  source a competent electrical contractor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have found many installations that are sub-standard and many with dangerous conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Invariably the cause ha
[normal]s been incompetence of the installer: poor workmanship; a lack of technical knowledge; non-compliance with Wiring Regulations, BS 7671.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Building Regulations Part P[bold]Previous governments set up Part P of the Building regulations with the intention of improv
[normal]ing the saf
[normal]ety of electrical installations in dwellings.
[normal]  
[normal]Part P made it a legal requirement for electrical installation work in dwellings to comply with the BS7671
[normal]:
[normal] Requirements for Electrical Installations
[normal] -
[normal] The IE
[normal]T
[normal] Wiring Regulations.  Most competent el
[normal]ectrical contractors understand these regulations and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Part P 
[normal]requirement to
[normal] be registered with a 
[normal]‘
[normal]competence 
[normal]persons
[normal] scheme provider
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Hence in the main Part P 
[normal]was welcomed by electrical contractors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The requirements of Part P were originally fairly 
[normal]r
[normal]estrictive for non-electrical persons and DIY installers to undertake electrical installation work.  In my view Part P has been very effective. It has improved competence in the industry and made DIYer’s more aware of the dangers electricity can create in 
[normal]their homes.  The downside that Building 
[normal]Control 
[normal]Departments have been unable to adequately police the system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] 2011 revision to Part P
[normal] has watered down the technical requirements of Part P, also 
[normal]it 
[normal]now permits electrical installation work to be carrie
[normal]d out by unqualified persons providing the work is checked and certified by a competent third party.  This part of the revision is not yet in operation as there are no third party competent person schemes yet in operation. Until 
[normal]there is, 
[normal]home safety standards 
[normal]are likely  
[normal] to drop back to pre-2005 standards
[normal] and the door is open again for Rogue traders and DYEers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] [bold]Competent Persons Scheme Operators.[bold]At the onset of Part P there wer
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]six or seven s
[normal]cheme operators. Some of which have been in 
[normal]place for many years enabling contractors to register voluntarily.  Some schemes typically NICEIC
[normal] are
[normal] well known in the construction 
[normal]industry
[normal] also to Local Authorities and Housing Associations etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Because there are so many different 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]operators each
[normal] having their own rules and criteria, standards and qualifying requirements are wide and varied.  Some of the operators provide training courses to their own standards and specifications
[normal]. T
[normal]here is no common denominator.
[normal] 
[normal]Also t
[normal]here needs to be a common appr
[normal]oach to training 
[normal]not only to 
[normal]contractors 
[normal]but the 
[normal]trainers
[normal] who train them.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Most scheme operators are monitored by UKAS but this does not necessarily mean that there is a common standard or common procedures in place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Competition between 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]operators means that standards vary.  
[normal]I understand that s
[normal]ome operators 
[normal]may
[normal] only carry out a ‘desk top’ assessment of an applicant whereas others will insist on 
[normal]always 
[normal]visiting the contracto
[normal]r’
[normal]s premises, 
[normal]to 
[normal]examin
[normal]e
[normal] the business
[normal]es
[normal] procedures
[normal], documentation a
[normal]nd equipment,
[normal] 
[normal]prior to inspecting some of the contractor’s on-site installation work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Discipline is another issue.  It is not uncommon for a contractor who has been removed from a register for bad work or other serious non-conformity to become registered 
[normal]with another scheme operator almost immediately without any reference being made to the original operator’s reasons for removal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have seen a contractor advertising registration 
[normal]with two scheme operators. When questioned I was informed that he was given 
[normal]registration by the second operator in order to promote their scheme. 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From the foregoing[bold] it can be seen that the present situation with a number of scheme operators having various standards is most unsatisfactory from not only a safety perspective but [bold]also for public perception of the effectiveness of the Part P legislation.  I therefore [bold]submit that it is of paramount importance [bold]for there to be a single [bold]‘[bold]not for profit[bold]’[bold] scheme provider monitored by UKAS rather than a number of operators working to their own agenda and possible profitability.[bold]&#xa0;
