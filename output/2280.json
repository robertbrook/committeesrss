"RCH0003&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Revolution consulting&#xa0;i. Who we are and where our perspective comes from.&#xa0;\nRevolution Consulting Limited \n(\n“Revolution”\n)\n has operated exclusively in the arena of local government commissioning and procurement since 2006. \n&#xa0;\nOur lead consultant has been \ninvolved in the Children’s Homes sector since 2000, h\naving gained experience as \nManaging Director of the largest provider of Children’s Homes in England at the time. He also created a completely new specialist Children’s Homes business between 2007-2012.\n&#xa0;\nIn parallel with that experience of providing \nChildren’s Homes \nservices, Revolution Consulting has worked on a variety of projects, each involved in\n the commissioning of services for looked after children.\n&#xa0;\nSince 2006 Revolution has \ntherefore gained\n experience through delivery of consultancy and support projects in the sector including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur lead consultant in this area is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants with a substantial range of commercia\nl experience in several sectors. It is the commercial and fi\nnancial aspects of procurement for looked after children that are the core of our work, with a particular focus on the interaction of the commercial aspects with the professional childcare and education.\n&#xa0;\nRev\nolution produces \npublications on \nthe \nfinancial p\nerformance of provider\n \ns\nectors, initially under the auspices of the Commissioning Support Programme and more recently on an independent basis. \n&#xa0;\nThese analyses add weight to our view that commissioning and procurement in the looked after children services \nsector is sub-optimal both for the young people and for efficiency and further development. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nii. A summary of our perspective&#xa0;&#xa0;“A wider perspective.”&#xa0;\nThe abuse of \neven one \nChildren’\ns Home\n resident is shocking.\n&#xa0;\nWe need to set aside whether we are \nfrom government, private sector or charity and work together to stringently understand how we can bring about improvements in the way we care for looked after children so as to do everything we can to avoid such instances.\n&#xa0;\nThose with insight into the way \nthat the systems work within local authority and children’s homes, but who have not seen details of investigations into the cases in Rochdale and elsewhere can only think about how we ourselves have operated and how we might have prevented the abuse. We ca\nn only therefore begin to offer the inquiry the questions it may need to ask of the Department for Education to ensure that the most experienced minds have been applied to analyzing the fine detail of \nhow the cases came about.\n&#xa0;\nThere would appear to be som\ne worthwhile regulation and systems enhancements being proposed that specifically target some areas where weaknesses may be present. \n&#xa0;\nIt is our view however that a wider perspective is needed. \n&#xa0;\nThe current marketplace of children’s homes services has evo\nlved without strategic vision related to need at a national, regional, or even sometimes at a local level. \n&#xa0;\nThe relationships of purchasers and providers do not \ncurrently \ncreate an environment that attracts investment or innovation, and instead has co\nnsid\nerable financial pressures that add to tensions between parties who should be working together. \nThe risk is therefore that such pressures (or just the perception that there may be such pressures) may impinge upon the paramount need to act promptly in the b\nest interests of the children placed.\n This is the case on both the part of the provider and of the purchaser.\n&#xa0;\nWe need a children’s homes system where the very staff in daily contact with the young person are empowered to keep that young person safe, come what may. \n&#xa0;\nWe need a system where the adults involved are skilled and professional enough to remove the pressu\nres of financial constraints and private vs. public sector tensions, so that the child receives a focused, responsive and excellent service at all times.\n&#xa0;\nIt’s about people not \njust about \nprocess.\n  \n&#xa0;iii. Our responses to the specific questions raised&#xa0;&#xa0;a. Are the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes appropriate and sufficient?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Department for Education’s work in the area of Children’s Homes is, as stated in the consultation documents themselves, a response to the \nterrible cases of abuse in Rochdale.\n&#xa0;\nSince the investigations that followed those investigations there have been similar cases reported elsewhere in the country. Reports are shocking and demands for action are understandable.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, in such times of he\nightened focus it is important to maintain a measured and informed approach, as to react in wide ranging ways may cause unforeseen problems elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\nThere are difficulties from the outset because some of the information about the instances of abuse is n\not in the public domain. Rightly, some information is undoubtedly confidential to protect victims. However, the questions that come to mind based on \nonly \nwhat has been published in the public domain are:\n&#xa0;\nHow many of the abuse cases in Rochdale\n, and elsewhere, involved children placed in Children’s Homes? \nIt would appear that there were some, but they were a small minority of cases? Let us be clinically factual wherever we can.\n&#xa0;\nIs sufficient attention being given to address the protection of t\nhe other cohorts involved? (e.g. Children not in care, children in foster care, children in residential special schools?).\n i.e. Is this not a wider set of issues than Children’s Homes? \nWhere in the wider policies and practices of local authorities and pol\nice forces will the Children’s Homes specific proposals fit?\n&#xa0;\nIn the cases involving Children’s Homes, have serious case reviews or other investigations been performed to identify the issues that contributed to the abusers gaining continuing access to the \nabused?\n&#xa0;\nIt is our experience that there are many safeguards that can prevent this type of abuse, including:\n&#xa0;\nAppropriateness of placement – matching needs to \nthose of \nother residents, \nto the strengths of the \nstaff group\n \nat the specific home \nand organizati\nonal strengths\n.\n Has a dispassionate review been carried out as to whether the children abused in Rochdale and elsewhere appropriately placed in those homes in the first place?\n&#xa0;\nThere are then factors that a good provider would have had in place:\n&#xa0;\nAppropria\nteness of location –\n \nour experience as providers of services for the most vulnerable young people is to do some of the \nmost \ncommon sense things. Obvious amongst these is to open homes in more rural, out of town places. This reduces the risks associated wit\nh more urbanized areas, can act as a disincentive to absconding behavior, and allows close management of the most vulnerable. \n&#xa0;\nAppropriateness of staff skills and procedures to distract and divert from absconding\n – good providers have skilled and experienced staff who use a range of interpersonal skills to try distract young people from attempting to abscond. Whilst Children’s Homes cannot lock young people into the home, a really good staff group, aware of the yo\nung person’s likely behavior, will have developed a number of strategies to try to keep the young person otherwise engaged and occupied. \n&#xa0;\nEven where a young person does manage to leave the home, a good provider, aware of the risks, should have procedures \nin place respond immediately themselves. Whilst these are likely to include prompt notification to the local police\n (under protocols agreed locally well before the home becomes operational)\n, it can also include practical and immediate response from the sta\nff themselves. We have had experience of homes where \nthe staff \nha\ns\n access to a “grab bag” containing mobile phone, waterproof clothing, snacks and drinks, which allows them to grab the bag and follow the absconding person immediately. The presence of a sta\nff member following an absconding young person can be a huge disincentive to those looking to harm a young person. \n&#xa0;\nGood homes assiduously and promptly report and follow up absconding incidents\n. Social workers within the home and from the authority need t\no urgently address the causes of the behavior and \nto \nagree interim action plans to try to manage future risk.\n&#xa0;\nIn cases where the assessment is of continuing risk of the behavior, and risk management is not sufficiently possible, then commercial drivers mu\nst be set aside in favour of a removal of the child to another, safer location and placement. Good providers must always put the young person’s interests ahead of commercial implications. We have experience of the placing authority not being responsive eno\nugh in such a situation and as a provider having to proactively serve notice to end placements where we felt unable to keep the young person safe.\n&#xa0;\nThere are similarly practice issues on the placing authority side to be examined:\n&#xa0;\nDid the homes involved in\n Rochdale et al, proactively call on social worker and IRO for reviews if absconding was an issue?\nHow responsive and proactive were the professionals from the local authority in dealing with the cases?\n&#xa0;\nHow well were the authority monitoring the placement\n?\n&#xa0;\nHow well were the placing authorities monitoring the home and organisation under their placement contract?\n&#xa0;\nHow well were Ofsted monitoring the home?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat we don’t know about these cases is where any of these protections failed. \n&#xa0;\nCan the DfE\n assure us of a clear linkage in their suggestions and proposals to the specific areas of weaknesses? \n&#xa0;\nAre any of the proposals in danger of being the momentum of the focus and getting too far ahead of the actual problems?\n&#xa0;\nIs there a danger of “Sledgeham\nmer to crack a nut”?\n&#xa0;\nAre the problems in fact rooted in with wider practices of \nthe social care system, in operational failings of social work and procurement practices in some authorities?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is assumption in the consultation that the fact that some of the young people involved were placed away from their “home” authority is a substantial issue. \n&#xa0;\nThe out of authority issue has been a theme for over a decade, and whilst it \nmay\n be related \nto the cases in Rochdale was it the major causal factor?\n&#xa0;\nHow many out of authority placements are inappropriate?\n&#xa0;\nThese questions need testing with an expert panel of social work professionals who have accumulated experience of the cohorts and of children\n’s homes placements. Let’s apply our best knowledge to properly analyse the situation at a detailed case by case level.\n&#xa0;\nThis leads\n us to \nwhat we believe are possibly some of the most important\n underlying issues – failures in commissioning and procurement \nand monitoring practice\n. We have recently responded to another inquiry into Local Government Procurement in some detail, focusing specifically of the failings of commissioning in the children’s services arena (copies of our response are \navailable\n upon requ\nest).\n&#xa0;\nThese \nfailures \nare harder to address as they involve performance of the whole care and education systems, but avoiding issues in the future may be better served by efforts here as well.\n&#xa0;\nA key theme of that response is that the solutions have to be \npeople, not process focused. It is of course more difficult to prescribe what is meant by that, but a healthier partnership between purchasers and providers of children’s homes is required to properly protect the very young people both are supposed to be s\nerving.\n&#xa0;\nWith so much Children’s Homes provision now in the private sector there are issues needing to be addressed about the interface of public and private sectors in areas such as services for vulnerable people. A higher standard of cross-sector underst\nanding and working is required to set clear boundaries between commercial pressures and delivery of services to meet needs.\n&#xa0;\nThis area requires more \ndebate and development than this response has the capacity for, but we remain committed to contributing our\n expertise to that work.\nAre the reforms are likely to prove effective or further measures are needed?&#xa0;\nSome of the proposals and efforts may be worthwhile, and certainly many should be implemented if there is a chance they will improve things.\n&#xa0;\nBut ultimately it’s a real time issue. The manager and staff at a children’s home need to be empowered to identify arising absconding and abuse issues, to deal with them in real time, to divert, to distract, to follow \nthe young person where possible, \nand t\no involve police where there are suspicions, and ultimately if all of those fail then to insist on the local authority acting immediately to remove a child \nto a safer place \nelsewhere.\n&#xa0;\nReal life and circumstances are more volatile and changeable than risk \nassessments and monthly inspections and historical reporting can deal with.\nIt’s not therefore always about changes in \nregulation\n and guidance, it’s about making sure the people dealing with the children day in day out are empowered and motivated to look a\nfter those children to the best of their abilities at all times, and that they are challenged to do so by outstanding homes and organisation\ns\n working in close partnership with \nplacing\n authorities and with police. \n&#xa0;\nExcellence in commissioning, procurement \nand monitoring allied to clear, informed national,\n r\negional and local strategies are the bedrock of creating long term sustainable and excellent children’s homes of the type most likely to be needed as close to where they are needed as possible given the o\nverall population volatility.\n This is the environment which would be most likely to minimize the risks of Rochdale style abuse of a Children’s Homes resident in future. \n&#xa0;\nAs mentioned earlier, we believe that developments are needed to significantly refine\n the interface between public sector purchasers and private sector providers where the services are for vulnerable children and young adults. Detailed work is needed in areas such as:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n"
