[[[The Residency Test]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                                                                                                                “It can be persuasively argued that a prohibition of legal aid is within the ambit of article 6, for the purposes of engaging article 14 and so precluding unjustifiable discrimination… Ultimately, the exclusion would itself fail a justification test because it denies practical and effective justice.”&#xa0;The legal advice further notes that this aspect of the proposals:&#xa0;“does not focus on legitimacy of resort to the Court, the nature of the issue [or] the viability of the argument. Being a foreigner does not indicate a lesser need, or a lesser justification, for effective access to the Court.” &#xa0;

[[[Judicial Review funding]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“we had 11,359 applications for judicial review. In the end 144 were successful and all of the rest of them tied up government lawyers, local authority lawyers in time, in expense for a huge number of cases of which virtually none were successful.” &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
