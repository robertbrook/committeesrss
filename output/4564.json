"&#xa0;\nAF0036&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by London Councils &#xa0;This response is submitted by London Councils. London Councils is a cross-party organisation lobbying the government and \nothers on behalf of our member councils to protect and enhance council powers so they can do the best possible job for their residents and local businesses.\n&#xa0;\nExecutive summary1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment education reforms, aimed at improving school standards, have led to a\nn increasingly autonomous schools system, through conversion of existing schools to Academy status and opening of new schools as Free Schools. These schools have greater freedoms in a variety of areas including whether to expand school places to meet deman\nd, decide self-improvement needs and are their own admissions authority.   \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese reforms have directly led to a decline of the traditional council role in educ\nation. Yet, government is clear; local authorities\n as champions of children and parents, with a \ndemocratic mandate, have a responsibility that every school do their best for the local population. Local authorities continue to hold legal duties covering education including to ensure sufficient school places, overall responsibility for school performan\nce in the local area and fair access for all children.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2010, schools that have converted to Academy status have risen from 38 to 185 at secondary level and from 0 to 125 at primary level in the capital. At the same time, more Free Schools have been s\net up in London than in any other part of England. Of the 174 Free Schools opened in England, a total of 58 (34 per cent) are in London. \n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a greater proportion of London’s schools convert to Academy status and further Free Schools are set up, the D\nepartm\nent \nf\nor \nE\nducation\n will be unable to work with or provide the necessary support needed by each school. \nRecommendations2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBased on evidence from across London, London Councils has identified gaps \nwithin system that put at risk the aspirations behind government reforms. \nLocal government has a vital role to play in ensuring continued improvement to the schools system\n. The\n following \nfive \nchanges are needed to support \nautonomous schools flourish whilst\n at the same time providing parents with the reassurance needed within the education system:\n2.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo\n support schools address signs of failure at the earliest opportunity\n - Local authority issued early warning notices for Academies and Free Schools should be sup\nported by a statutory backstop, in the same way they are for maintained schools.\n2.1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo ensure new schools are setup in areas/wards where there is projected demand - A change in government policy to put new school applicants in touch with London boroughs at th\ne earliest chance.\n2.1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo support vulnerable children – Government should provide \nFair Access Panels with the power to issue a direction to an Academy to admit a hard-to-place pupil, as they currently do with maintained schools \n&#xa0;\n2.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaking the education system more accessible to parents and local communities - Ensuring Academies share the same statistical returns with local authorities at the same time they make them available \nto the Department for Education. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, \ng\niving local authorities the powers to order a financial audit or investigation for Academies, as they can currently with maintained schools. \nGENERAL3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors?3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities are legally responsible for providing school places for every child resident in their area. To do this, boroughs closely monitor the supply and demand for places and ensure there is sufficient school capacity to meet the needs o\nf their community.\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll regions are experiencing a rise in demand for school places but this a pressure not spread evenly across the country. Over the 10\n years\n since Census 2001, London’s population grew by 900,000 (11.6 per cent). \n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLondon Councils latest \nanalysis has shown that between 2012/13 and 2016, the shortage of school places is set to reach 118\n,000. \nFor many local authorities, it is becoming increasingly challenging to create additional classrooms in existing schools. \n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nL\nocal authorities \nn\no longer h\nave the sole responsibility for commissioning new school places in a local area. Existing a\ncademies, of which there are 368\n in London, are responsible for their own expansion and should they opt to do so, bid directly to the Department for Education for fu\nnding. The Government also approves applications for new Free Schools without consultation with local authorities. \n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithin boroughs and across London, like all reg\nions, engagement with\n academies to expand and\n liaison with Free School applicants\n before they\n submit a\n \nbid \nto government vary significantly. There is no systematic approach in place and many local authorities only find out about plans to expand or create new Free Schools once they have been approved by Government. This makes it difficult for local\n authorities to be able to include these new places in medium to long term place planning. \n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn particular, a\ns recently highlight\ned by the National Audit Office\n report\n Establishing Free Schools,\n \na number of Free Schools approved by the government \nare set up\n in temporary premises, \nfailed to open\n or are not in wards/areas of projected demand\n.\n This ha\ns\n made it \nextremely difficult to coordinate admissions as parents may select\n a school that does not open, cannot accommodate their child or is no in an area of pro\njected demand.  \n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level?4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities have 198 statutory duties relating to education and children and young people's services to discharge. Irrespective of school provider type, local \nauthorities have three core \nresponsibilities in relation to education - ensuring a sufficient supply of school places, tackling underperformance in schools and ensuring high standards as well as supporting vulnerable children. \n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs \na more\n autonomous education system has evolved, it has become increasingly challenging for local authorities to discharge these duties. At the same time, central government’s ability to support academies and free schools will become progressively strained as the\n \nnumber of Academies and Free Schools increases\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities, as champions of children and parents, with a democratic mandate, have a responsibility that every school\n should\n do their best for the local population and therefore, ensure the aspiratio\nns behind government reforms are fulfilled. Based on evidence from across London, London Councils has identified five key changes that are needed to address risks in the system\n.\n \n&#xa0;4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnabling continued school improvement Academies and Free Schools are respons\nible for their own school improvement as outlined in the Education Act 2011. However, some schools will not be able to thrive on their own and DfE and Ofsted do not have the capacity to work with each school in the country to prevent standards declining. I\nt is critical that support and challenge is offered to schools at the earliest possible moment to minimise the impact that any signs of failure may have on the quality of education a child receives.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLondon boroughs are well placed to do this and have succ\nessfully demonstrated how they use early warning notices, when serious issues emerge, to turn around performance in maintained schools.\n \nLondon Councils is calling on government to enable local authorities to issue early warning notices to all state funded \nschools, supported by a statutory backstop, to ensure that they \nare \nact\ned\n upon by schools, irrespective of type to prevent failure.\n&#xa0;4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMeeting the growing demand for school places Many Academies and Free Schools work closely with local authorities and consult them on the potential to expand or set up new schools. However, there is no systematic approach in place and many local authorities only find out about plans to expand or crea\nte new schools once they have been approved by the government. In some instances in London, Academies and Free Schools have opened in areas where there is limited demand for schools and therefore, take up of places is extremely low by local families. \n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo \naddress these inconsistencies within the system, London Councils believes there is a strong role for local authorities, with their expert local knowledge\n and intelligence\n, to offer a package of support to Academies and Free Schools. This could include effe\nctive advice on viable sites and development costs; and ensuring schools sufficiently meet community needs. This would enable local authorities to broker effective relationships with Free School candidates and support those that demonstrate quality, cost-e\nffectiveness and meet the growing need for places.\n&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order for this to be effective and deliver parental choice in state education, London Councils is calling on government to share information on Free School candidates \nat the earliest opportunity\n.\n&#xa0;4.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupporting vulnerable children to achieve positive outcomes Supporting vulnerable children to achieve positive outcomes is an integral part of a local authority’s duties. It is important that the education reforms do not hinder a borough’s ability to fulfil th\nese duties, particularly in relation to schools. \n&#xa0;\n4.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlacing excluded pupils in appropriate schooling is a particularly difficult duty to deliver and every part of the school system needs to share equally in this responsibility. To ensure the system is viabl\ne in a world with a majority of Academies, government needs to act to empower Fair Access Panels to issue a direction to an Academy to admit a hard-to-place pupil, as they currently do with maintained schools.\n&#xa0;4.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaking the education system more accessible to parents and local communities In an autonomous schools sector driven by choice parents will play an increasingly important role in shaping local education provision. However, many parents will need support in order to make informed decisions as they navi\ngate their way through the market. It will be increasingly difficult for parents to locate, understand and compare data for all schools as the market diversifies. \n&#xa0;\n4.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLondon Councils is calling on all schools, including academies, to share the same data and \nstatistical returns with local authorities at the same time that they make them available to the DfE. Local authorities can then make this data available to local parents and also use it to support the local family of schools, challenging those where issue\ns are emerging, and enabling the more effective delivery of their statutory duties.\n&#xa0;\n4.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, \nlocal authorities should be able to conduct a financial audit or investigation into any school, including Academies, if they feel that there are issues deserv\ning further scrutiny. This information would be important for the wider community to be able to assess the value for money provided by a school.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n4\n&#xa0;\n"
