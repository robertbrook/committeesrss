[normal]Written E[bold]vidence[bold] from[bold] Dr[bold] Ben Worthy[bold] [OD 27][bold]The UK government’s recent National Action plan
[normal] reassert
[normal]s
[normal] the aim of making the UK government the ‘most open and transparent government in the world’.
[normal] 
[normal]It is ‘leading the world on Open D
[normal]ata’
[normal] to bring about ‘
[normal]economic, social and political progress
[normal]’. However, the broad aims of the transparency a
[normal]genda raise a number of uncertainties
[normal] that could undermine the goals of the reforms
[normal].
[normal]The Uncertainties of Open Data[bold]The first 
[normal]uncertainty
[normal] 
[normal]concerns 
[normal]which
[normal] of the ‘economic, social and political’ aims the government supports. Observers have noted a shift in emphasis from 
[normal]the 
[normal]democratic
[normal] aims of government transparency and accountability
[normal] to 
[normal]the 
[normal]economic
[normal] aims of encouraging growth
[normal].
[normal] Although originally inspired
[normal] by 
[normal]the 
[normal]MPs’ expenses
[normal] scandal
[normal],
[normal] there is an increasing
[normal] emphasis on the
[normal]se
[normal] ‘
[normal]economic’ 
[normal]objectives
[normal], 
[normal]demonstrated by 
[normal]David Cameron’s 
[normal]commitments 
[normal]at the 2013 G8
[normal] meeting
[normal] on tax transparency. 
[normal]Jonathan Gray made the point after the OGP that 
[normal]‘
[normal]The Prime M
[normal]inister's 
[normal]speech typified a broader trend in open government discourse, away from political accountability and social justice and towards economic growth, digital innovation and supporting startups’.
[normal]This
[normal] shift
[normal] could lead to an obscuring of the other benefits of Op
[normal]en Data. 
[normal]Among the many possible effects of the reforms, 
[normal]Open Data or Big Data could revolutionise
[normal] how policy is delivered
[normal].
[normal] This aim
[normal] is
[normal] 
[normal]likely to attract support 
[normal]from public bodies
[normal] that
[normal] could
[normal] quickly
[normal] se
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]the ben
[normal]e
[normal]fits
[normal] of having detailed street-level data on
[normal] resources, problems and policy
[normal] impact
[normal].
[normal] Its neglect in 
[normal]the government
[normal]’s new
[normal] narrative would weaken a powerful lever for encouraging public bodies to co-operate. 
[normal]The s
[normal]e
[normal]cond 
[normal]uncertainty
[normal] concern
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]exactly
[normal] what results the 
[normal]government
[normal] 
[normal]expects
[normal] to see. Measuring
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]general 
[normal]‘
[normal]cultural ch
[normal]a
[normal]n
[normal]ge’
[normal] towards openness or ‘communi
[normal]ty empowerment’ is difficult. The data
[normal] is unlikely to
[normal] produce many 
[normal]high profile 
[normal]examples of
[normal] citizen
[normal]s
[normal] using the data, so called 
[normal]Armchair 
[normal]A
[normal]uditors
[normal] given the lack of comparable data or mechanism
[normal]s
[normal] of accountability
[normal]. 
[normal]Th
[normal]is leads to the
[normal] third 
[normal]uncertainty:
[normal] how 
[normal]are 
[normal]the benefits 
[normal]supposed to happen?
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]emphasis 
[normal]on 
[normal]Open
[normal] 
[normal]Data
[normal] as an 
[normal]‘
[normal]enabler
[normal]’ of involvement or participation
[normal] is slightly misleading. 
[normal]There remains confusion about how exactly Open Data can be 
[normal]used-who, for example, should an unhappy citizen send their unearthed misspending to? How could it 
[normal]then 
[normal]be used to rectify 
[normal]a situation 
[normal]or hold 
[normal]a body 
[normal]to account? 
[normal]For 
[normal]Open Data
[normal] to work it needs to fit alongside 
[normal]new 
[normal]accountability 
[normal]mechanisms
[normal], feedback system
[normal]s or means of participating
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he promised new ‘
[normal]localism
[normal]’ mechanism
[normal]s
[normal] that could help the data to work
[normal] at local level
[normal], such as community budgeting, 
[normal]are yet to appear
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Consequences[bold]The
[normal]se
[normal] uncertainties bring 
[normal]possible knock on effects for all the key groups 
[normal]involved
[normal],
[normal] from politicians to
[normal] 
[normal]public bodies and the public. 
[normal]For politicians the danger is that, like 
[normal]occurred with 
[normal]FOI, 
[normal]ambitious 
[normal]but vague
[normal] aims may lead to disappointment and lack of interest.
[normal] Although the Action Plan speaks of the government becoming mo
[normal]re en
[normal]thusiastic about
[normal] Open Data, politicians 
[normal]generally lose their zeal 
[normal]towards openness
[normal] 
[normal]and only support it on their own terms. Some interviewees were concerned that the ‘economic’ emphasis involved strengthening the hand of private bidders
[normal] and led to media portrayal
[normal]s
[normal] of public bodies as ‘wasters’ of public money
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Increased accountability 
[normal]could
[normal] be a mixed blessing for a Minister, especially if directed at them or their government
[normal] and may encourage distortion or ‘spin’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]espite its presenta
[normal]tion as a ‘neutral’ 
[normal]outcome
[normal] of technology, Open Data is very political. 
[normal]For public bodies the lack of clarity on aims or outcomes is likely to lead to a range of i
[normal]mplementation difficulties. 
[normal]S
[normal]o
[normal]m
[normal]e local authorities are 
[normal]‘
[normal]experimenters
[normal]’, willing to adapt and
[normal] innovate with data. However, without clear aims or goals
[normal] many 
[normal]bodies 
[normal]are likely, at a time of cuts, to pursue a policy of minimal compliance
[normal] and simply put out
[normal] 
[normal]raw
[normal] data
[normal] on
[normal] their
[normal] websites. In extreme cases, as seen with some US departments, bodies may simp
[normal]ly release ‘old’ or non-valuable information
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This
[normal] also
[normal] means that the 
[normal]experiments
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] innovations 
[normal]that could attract the public won’t take place. Given such 
[normal]mixed signals and lack of enthusiasm, 
[normal]the public themselves may 
[normal]lose interest
[normal]. 
[normal]In the US a simil
[normal]ar story of lack of clarity and
[normal] low 
[normal]compliance
[normal] lead to low public uptake or interest. 
[normal]The scenario is not inevitable. A greater clarity about the aims and expectations of Open Data would assist those whose co-operation and enthusiasm is needed. 
[normal]The lesson
[normal] from other transparency reforms is that leadership, clarity and innovation makes for 
[normal]more 
[normal]successful systems.
