[[[16 December 2013]]]

[[[ oral evidence session]]]

[[[ follow-up]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 6 January asking the following further questions following my appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 16 December.&#xa0;Foreign Fighters&#xa0;

[[[Given the concerns about foreign fighters, what sort of work is the Government doing to identify and monitor UK nationals who travel in order to engage in jihad?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Are social media such as twitter and Facebook being monitored for people who are claiming to engage or have engaged in fighting abroad?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[There have been claims that there is significant "coming and going" from the battlefield with people going to fight for a month or two in Syria and then returning to Britain to rest and recuperate. What legislative means does the Government have at its disposal to stop people returning to Syria? And is the legislation sufficient?]]]&#xa0;The police and the security and intelligence agencies undertake a number of activities to identify, monitor and disrupt UK-Iinked individuals of concern who travel abroad to engage in conflict. You will understand why I am unable to provide specific details of all of the actions that are being taken for these purposes.&#xa0;You ask about the legislative means we have at our disposal to stop people from returning to Syria. A wide range of offences already exists on the statute books that can be used to disrupt travel by such individuals and to manage the risk they may pose on return, including in the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006 which provide extraterritorial jurisdiction in relation to certain activities. In particular, where there is evidence that individuals are planning, promoting, funding, facilitating or participating in terrorist activities overseas - including terrorist fighting - the police and Crown Prosecution Service will seek to prosecute them, before they go or on their return.&#xa0;Where appropriate, consideration will also be given to the use of disruptive powers such as asset freezes and Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMS) to disrupt travel and manage the risk posed by returnees who cannot be successfully prosecuted , or in the case of foreign nationals, deported. If the individual is a dual national, I will consider whether deprivation of their British citizenship is appropriate. Similarly, I may seek to exclude non-nationals from the UK on public interest grounds.&#xa0;I also have the power to refuse or withdraw passports (under the Royal Prerogative) where I believe that a person's activities - past, present or proposed - are so undesirable that the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities is contrary to the public interest. New powers to search for, and seize, cancelled passports, as well as other invalid travel documents, have been introduced into the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.&#xa0;Overseas Capacity Building&#xa0;

[[[Is the Government confident that overseas capacity building programmes have a positive effect on both the host country and in the UK and how is the effectiveness of the individual programmes measured?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Please could you provide a breakdown of the Â£30 million budget for overseas capacity building detailing what sort of programmes are being run where.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Where are the Government's priority countries in terms of overseas capacity building for the next year?]]]&#xa0;As Charles Farr's letter to the Committee of 6 January 2014 sets out, we do not publicly disclose the location, number or purpose of all our capacity building projects overseas because they very often have a counter terrorist operational purpose. However, as might be expected, and as described in the Foreign Secretary's speech on Countering Terrorism Overseas (14 February 2013), our work focuses in those areas where there is a serious and potentially long-running threat to the UK and our interests abroad.&#xa0;Projects primarily focus on working with police, prosecutors, judges and prison authorities to build their capacity to detain, prosecute and convict terrorists based on respect for human rights and the rule of law. Every aspect of this work is closely monitored and requires Ministerial oversight and approval.&#xa0;For operational and security reasons that you will understand I cannot provide more in-depth detail of the projects or detailed costing breakdown in this letter.&#xa0;I understand that the Committee has written separately to the Foreign Secretary about the cross-Government effort to build capacity overseas in his role as lead Minister for that work. In light of that, these additional questions from the Committee may be better dealt with in more detail in the response to that letter.&#xa0;TPIMs&#xa0;

[[[Are individuals on TPIMs also provided with the necessary support to deradicalise them? Are any of the individuals part of the Channel Programme?]]]&#xa0;Prevent interventions play a part in operational planning to manage the risk from TPIM subjects after the expiry of TPIM measures. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the detail of these plans. None of the TPIM subjects are currently suitable for Channel, which is specifically designed for individuals at risk of being drawn into terrorism.&#xa0;

[[[We note that in response to our request that Mr Farr provide us with the deportation request from the Somaliland Government in relation to Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, Mr Farr wrote to us saying:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[["As this matter is currently the subject of ongoing civil litigation I cannot]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[provide any details further to what I told the Committee. However, I can]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[confirm that documents relating to Mohamed's deportation from Somaliland]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[were disclosed during open session in the TPIMs proceedings by both the]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Government and Mohamed's lawyers. These documents are not in the public]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[domain."]]]

[[[Can we ask you to confirm that a) a deportation request was made by the]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Somaliland Government and that b) the Somalian Government refused to]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[accept the return of Mr Mohamed to their territory?]]]&#xa0;You have asked for sight of official correspondence from the Somaliland government in respect of the deportation of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed. I can confirm that documents relating to Mohamed's deportation from Somaliland were disclosed during open session in the TPIMs proceedings by both HMG and Mohamed's lawyers. However, as has previously been set out, these documents are not in the public domain, given the ongoing litigation and as such it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the details.&#xa0;As I also indicated at committee, the Government would not normally disclose government to government communications. By routinely doing so we may harm future relations with a third state on the basis that all future correspondence will be made publically available.&#xa0;In respect of Mohamed's return to the UK and as has been set out previously, the law is quite clear on this. Section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 exempts from immigration control persons who have the right of abode. This means that there is no legal basis for preventing British citizens, like Mohamed, from returning to the UK, whatever the circumstances of their return and whatever their activities abroad. It is also important to note that where someone is a British citizen, it is not necessary for a foreign government to seek permission for their return.&#xa0;Communications data&#xa0;

[[[What is the difference between the current data monitoring capabilities of]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[GCHQ and those that would have been introduced under the Communications]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Data Bill?]]]&#xa0;The Draft Communications Data Bill proposed the retention of additional communications data by Communications Service Providers so that with appropriate approvals and where necessary and proportionate it could be acquired by law enforcement agencies as part of a specific investigation. GCHQ's core mission relates to the gathering of foreign intelligence and they may collect data in relation to this function. They are not able to provide the communications data required by domestic law enforcement agencies. Further detail on GCHQ's capabilities has been shared with the Intelligence and Security Committee, as this is expressly within their remit.&#xa0;The Rt Hon Theresa May MPHome Secretary&#xa0;
