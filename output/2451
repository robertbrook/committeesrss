defaultExecutive summarydefault1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultcurrent 
defaultproposals to change legal aid will have a devastating impact on prisoners’ access to justice. The justifications for the changes include grossly misleading characterisations as to why prisoners seek legal assistance (to get an ‘easier ride’). In reality th
defaulte proposals will mean that prisoners will not be able to seek legally aided advic
defaulte on issues such as segregation, 
defaultaccess to mother and baby units
default and other areas which might involve serious allegations of breaches of human rights 
default. 
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Justice Secretary a
defaultccepts that the changes are ideologically driven rather than to save money.
default 
defaultIn any event p
defaultrison law is a small part of the legal aid budget and the increases in spending have 
defaultmainly 
defaultbeen caused by a bigger prison population
default,
default including a larger proportion o
defaultf those serving indeterminate sentences.
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is suggested that prisoners do not need access to legal aid for 
defaultthe
default matters
default to be excluded
default because of the availability of complaints procedures. However the Justice Secretary has ignored a large body of evidence,
default including from the Chief Inspector of Prisons, that
default shows that
default the current complaints system is inadequate. 
defaultIt is also suggested that criminal legal aid for prison law can be removed because judicial review remains available.  The reality is that judicial
default review is unlikely to be a desirable or viable option for many prisoners. 
defaultThe ability of prisoners to seek legal advice has been crucial to ensuring that in the closed world of prisons there is accountability for abuse of power.
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven on their own terms, t
defaulthe proposals make little sense
default and it is even now unclear as to the full extent of the proposed cuts
default to the scope of provision for prisoners
default.
default Whilst it appears that the intention is to retain legal aid for parole and disciplinary matters where liberty is a
defaultt stake, other areas which have a direct impact on liberty are excluded.
default 
defaultAs to costs, it is likely that the proposals result in more rather than less expenditure.
default The proposed reduction in payment rates will in any event make the work unviable for most fir
defaultms.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe APL was formed by a group of specialist prison lawyers in 2008 to represent the interests and views of practitioners in prison law.  It currently represents the interests of around 36
default0 members who specialize in representing prisoners.  The membership is made up of around 300 firms of solicitors and around 60 individual members (who include specialist counsel).

default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAPL members have extensive experience of representing prisoners in the Admi
defaultnistrative Court, County Court, Parole Board, adjudication hearings, and making representations to prisons and other agencies working with prisoners where required.  APL members have played a central part in the development of public law in the prison cont
defaultext over the past three decades. Some of our members have been representing prisoners for well over twenty years.

defaultWhy the justifications for cuts to scope of legal aid for prison law do not stand updefault3.1.1
default              
defaultThe original consultation justified proposals to cut prison law on grounds of cost and public confidence and credibility in the scheme (TLA, para 3.15, Response para 11, page 66).  The response appears to justify the decision to proceed with the scope cuts
default on the basis that (a) the complaints system is adequate (Response, paras 11, 19, 21, 27 and 28) and (b) judicial review will remain available to prisoners, subject to means and merits (Response, para 14, 21, 24, 28, 36). These grounds are not justified.

defaultCostdefault default3.2.1
default              
defaultAlthough in his recent evidence to the Justice Select Committee, the Justice Secretary candidly admitted that his proposals for reform in legal aid funding for prisoners was ideologically driven, the consultation documents have focussed on the
default need to save costs. 
defaultThe projected savings from prison law cuts will be £4m.  The Ministry of Justice impact assessments provide no figures as to the cost of the decision.  Alternative projected costs consequences are extensive, ranging from £10m on a cons
defaultervative estimate
default to £480m
default.  Current prison law spend is comparatively modest and has been declining year on year, despite parallel increases in the prison population – a factor noted by the 
defaultLegal Aid Agency (
defaultLAA
default)
default in its analysis of prison law cost
default. 
defaultThe
default largest increase in the prison law budget in recent years coincided with the implementation of the sentence for Indeterminate Public Protection (IPP) and the consequent increase in numbers of indeterminate sentenced prisoners. 
defaultAll prison law cases are pai
defaultd for under a fixed fee scheme.  Fixed fees that can be claimed without routine scrutiny range from £220 to 
default£
default1,593.91
default. The cases
default that will be cut from scope, classed as ‘sentence’ and ‘treatment’ cases, cover a broad range of work and are remunerated at t
defaulthe lower
default fixed fee of £220 other than in exceptional cases, where each item of work is scrutinized on assessment.  There has been no assessment as to whether it will be viable for prison law experts to function with the combination of scope cuts and a cut 
defaultof 17.5 per cent of the remaining work.  There is a 
defaultvery high
default 
defaultrisk that as fixed fees penalize high quality and specialist providers
default:
default such specialists will no longer be able to 
defaultprovide this service.

defaultPublic confidence/credibilitydefault3.3.1
default              
defaultDespite the Ministry 
defaultof Justice view
default that prison law legal aid is used to assist prisoners to 
default‘simply’ 
defaultget an ‘easier ride’ in another prison
default, the grant of prison law legal aid is subject to rigorous tests.
default  There is no provision in the current scheme to assist prisoners to s
defaultimply change cells or get to a more comfortable prison. We have not seen any evidence to support the assertion that the provision of criminal legal aid for prison law cases suffers from a lack of public confidence or credibility. 
default3.3.2
default              
defaultAll prison law case
defaults, other than treatmen
defaultt cases, are at present authoris
defaulted by the provider.  All providers of legal aid prison law must meet rigorous supervisor standards requiring a certain volume 
defaultand spread of prison law work each year.  When
default authoris
defaulting a case for legal 
defaultaid the lawyer must be satisfied and provide evidence on file that:
default(i)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe prisoner meets the financial eligibility criteria and seek evidence of means (a very time consuming task);
default(ii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe matter raises a significant legal or human rights issue;
default(iii)

defaultthere
default is sufficient benefit to the Client, having regard to t
defaulthe circumstances of the m
defaultatter, including the personal circumstances of the Client, to justify work or further work being carried out.  In addition, there should be a realistic prospect of a positive 
defaultoutcome that would be of real benefit to the Client; and 
default(iv)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe cost benefit test – namely, whether a notional reasonable private paying client of moderate means would pay for the legal assistance – is met.

defaultComplaintsdefault3.4.1 
default              
defaultThe Response provides a detailed consideration of the adequacy of the complaints system and concludes that the complaints system is adequate and will in any event be strengthened.  The adeq
defaultuacy of the current complaints system is disputed by 
defaultHer Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP)
default, the Children’s Commissioner
default, APIL
default and others.  APL research with over 200 prisoners shows that 55 per cent consider the internal prison complaints process to
default be ‘very poor’ with 45 per cent considering the PPO to be ‘very poor’.  Even if the complaints system were to be more effective, it is not an adequate substitute for legal representation.  This is because:
default(i)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe complaints system 
defaultlooks 
defaultbackward, not forward
default, looking whereas legal work that meets the rigorous legal aid sufficient benefit test must be of a practical benefit to the client;
default(ii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe complaints system is limited in ambit – not all the matters currently covered by legal aid will come within the scope o
defaultf the internal complaints system.  For instance, representations to the Justice Secretary about the period between reviews are not a matter 
defaultfor 
defaulta complaint to the prison; nor are concerns about local authority duties to house children on release from priso
defaultn; and
default(iii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Justice Secretary’s plans to improve the complaints system to justify the removal of legal aid implies the system is not adequate; any such changes should take place before 
defaultremoving legal aid is contemplated, and those changes should be subject 
defaultto monitoring and assessment to determine whether they meet the widespread concerns about the efficacy of the system. 
default3.4.2
default              
defaultAs 
defaultLord Justice 
defaultSedley highlights
default in his recent article
default, the 
defaultMinistry
default of Justice appears "seemingly unaware of the way prisoners’ c
defaultlaims are already handled, [and] proposes to take away access to justice for prisoners (including, for instance, children and expectant and new mothers in the prison system), in the belief, which three decades of judicial review have shown to be mistaken, 
defaultthat the prison complaints system and the prisons ombudsman are sufficient for the redress of illegality and unfairness."

defaultContinuing availability of judicial reviewdefault default3.5.1 
default              
defaultThe cuts to prison law are, in part, justified by reference to the continuing ava
defaultilability of judicial review. This justification is 
defaultfundamentally 
defaultflawed for 
defaulttwo
default reasons: (i
default) it does not take into account the restrictions that apply to the number of public law cases that can be initiated or the firms able to bring such cases and (ii) it does not take into account the proposed further changes to the funding arrangements for ju
defaultdicial review. 
default 
default3.5.2
default              
defaultIt is wholly undesirable to force prisoners to attempt to turn to judicial review to deal with problems that are currently dealt with for fixed fees of £220.

defaultLack of claritydefault3.6.1
default              
defaultAt present the precise detail of the proposed cuts in
default scope is unclear, and in parole board cases, goes further than the original proposal.  There is no doubt that the vast majority of prison law cases
default will no longer be funded.  
default3.6.2
default              
defaultThe Response is also silent on how the work that remains in scope will b
defaulte quality assured in light of the extent to which the current quality assurance through supervisor standards is based on the spread of work that practitioners undertake.
default3.6.3
default              
defaultA close reading of both the consultation and the response would suggest that the
default following areas of prison law that may currently attract legal aid will no longer be funded:
default(i)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

defaultMost sentence cases.
defaultThese submissions deal with each category in turn, highlighting the implications for prisoners and aspects of the proposals that remain unclear.

defaultTreatment Casesdefault3.8.1
default              
defaultThese are cases where a prisoner alleges that he or she has been treated unfairly and meets the rigorous criteria to obtain legal assistance from a lawyer to make representations.  At present, these cases whic
defaulth result in a fixed fee of £220 are subject to approval by the Legal Aid Agency which must be satisfied that the matter cannot be dealt with by an alternative mechanism and that the applicant cannot progress this matter himself.  Since July 2010, 11 such c
defaultases have been approved.
default 
default Although the small number of cases might suggest that this will not make a big practical difference, this is not the case because there will be no flexibility at all to allow assistance in the most serious cases of abuse, including in cases where the pris
defaultoner will be unable to obtain legal aid to bring a judicial review (see below).
defaultCase Study 2default 
defaultB, a foreign national with no previous convictions was sentenced to a year in prison when her son was 9 months old. B was his sole carer, had never left him and w
defaultas still breastfeeding. On admission to prison, she was immediately separated from him.  B could not speak or write English very well, was isolated and had no experience of how the prison system works.  B was traumatised by being separated from her baby an
defaultd on her first few nights in custody she screamed for him. B was placed on report for threatening behaviour and placed in segregation for the night. 
defaultB was not aware that she could make an application to be transferred to a mother and baby unit (she was un
defaultaware of mother and baby units), so that she could be reunited with her baby.  Her son was being looked after by an elderly aunt who was finding it difficult to cope with such a young child.
defaultB’s lawyers advised that she was entitled to apply for transfer t
defaulto a mother and baby unit and assisted her with the application, liaising with the prison, the local Council and expert social workers. Despite unequivocal medical evidence warning of the detrimental impact on their well-being that continued separation woul
defaultd have on both her and her baby, her application for a mother and baby unit was rejected on the basis of her record of "poor behaviour in custody". B's lawyers successfully appealed and she was transferred to a mother and baby unit, where she was reunited 
defaultwith her baby. B was reported as being a calming and positive presence within the unit. 
defaultUnder the new scope criteria…defaultB would be expected to have achieved this by herself.
defaultWhy not complain or judicially review? defaultIt is unlikely that B would have been able to
default navigate the complaints system alone.  It is likely that her lawyers would have struggled to obtain affirmative proof of 12 months of lawful residence.  Even if this could be achieved, the inevitable delay in this process and the expectation that the comp
defaultlaints/appeals processes would have been exhausted already could mean that by the time the matter was determined mother and child would have encountered too long a period of separation to support the claim. With her limited knowledge of both the prison sys
defaulttem and the English language, a complaint or judicial review were both unfeasible for B.

defaultCase Study 3defaultC was a life sentence prisoner in a closed prison awaiting the Parole Board’s review of his suitability to progress to Category D open conditions.  C was charged with 
defaulta number of adjudication offences arising from one incident.  They were the only misconduct allegations on his record for several years. C denied the charges.  They raised a number of complex legal and evidential issues.  Under the legal aid scheme C’s law
defaultyers investigated the facts and drafted representations to the governor.  The governor ignored the representations.  His lawyers appealed the decision to the Briefing and Casework Unit. All convictions were quashed. Subsequently the Parole Board made a pos
defaultitive recommendation for open conditions which the Secretary of State accepted.  C was moved to an open prison and he was released on licence at his next parole review.
defaultUnder the new scope criteria…defaultAssistance with the adjudication would no longer be 
defaultpossible. It is highly unlikely C would have been able to conduct this work himself.  Had the findings of guilt remained the Parole Board would be unlikely to have progressed him to open conditions and his release would be delayed by several years with the
default consequent cost to the public purse of additional years in prison at around £40,000 each year.
defaultWhy not complain or judicially review?defaultThis was an appeal based on legal principles and not suitable for a complaints system navigable by a lay person.  Nor wou
defaultld it have been desirable to have had to issue judicial review proceedings to deal with this injustice.  It is unlikely that the legal aid agency would have granted funding or the Court permission unless all the work that was in fact undertaken was underta
defaultken for free as both the financial and legal tests for judicial review require all other avenues to be exhausted.  Even if these hurdles could be crossed, a judicial review would have caused considerable delay.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAssisting a prisoner to move through the security categories can be essential to his or her event
defaultual safe release; in some cases, prisoners may be entitled to a pre-tariff review by the parole board to recommend open conditions.  These cases affect lifers who generally have two to three years left before their tariff expires.  Pre-tariff reviews are s
defaultubject to a ‘sift’ by the prison service.  A prisoner who does not get 
defaultthrough the sift process is entitled to challenge that decision through the complaints system. These are complex cases.

default&#xa0;
default It was clear to his lawyers that the prison had not realised he could be considered for a pre-tariff review by the Parole Board or a transfer to open conditions under the Guittard arrangements.
defaultUnder the new scope criteriadefault it is likely that D 
defaultwould not be considered for a progressive move, leaving him languishing in closed conditions, at unnecessary public expense.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWhy not complain or judicially reviewdefaultIt is unlikely that without access to a lawyer D would even be aware of the cause for 
defaultcomplaint or challenge.  Even if he were aware of this, the complaints system, administered by ordinary prison staff, is not geared up to challenges to serious decisions about the progression of life sentenced prisoners concerning public protection.  Judic

defaultF was offered a place at college to continue his A levels starting at the beginning of the next school year, if he was able to attend part time from prison.  F had been an excellent pupil and in their view, his offence was isol
defaultated and entirely out of character and would not be repeated.
defaultF's lawyers calculated that a combination of ROTL followed by release on Home Detention Curfew (‘HDC’) would enable him to attend college and keep the option of going to university alive.   It w
defaultas necessary for F’s lawyers to do considerable work to achieve this, including investigating the facts and making representations as to why this course should be followed. This enabled him to leave prison at the earliest opportunity and get his life and e
defaultducation back on track, saving money for the tax payer and securing his rehabilitation on licence.
defaultUnder the new scope criteria…defaultNone of this work would be possible, F would have to have prepared his own representations
defaultWhy not complain or judicially defaultreviewdefault?defaultThe complaints system would not have been equipped to deal with this issue which involved the application of prison service policy to children and rights under Article 8 ECHR. The complaints system would be more focused on whether the failure to pr
defaultogress ROTL was wrong rather than the legal reasons for rectifying it.  Prior to issuing a judicial review, all the work undertaken by the lawyers in this case would need to be undertaken in any event.  A judicial review would have delayed matters and coul
defaultd have meant F missing the beginning of term.

defaultThere is burgeoning jurisprudence on HDC, especially as it affects foreign nationals. On the face of it this is a release mechanism which is fairly straightforward.
default&#xa0;
default But the case law demonstrates other
defaultwise.
default&#xa0;
default Rushing straight to judicial review is a wholly inadequate as a means of redress.  Decisions are usually made close to the potential release date so any challenge needs to be dealt with urgently to be meaningful.  Emergency funding is difficult to j
defaultustify given (a) the margin of appreciation afforded to prisons, and (b) the fact that release will be inevitable at the halfway point.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditional representations from solicitors appealing initial decisions is a much more efficient and constructive way to 
defaultproceed than the two extremes of allowing prisons to remain in prison unnecessarily at public expense or rushing to judicially review decisions.
default3.10.6
defaultAt present limited funding is available to challenge findings that prisoners should be placed in 
defaultDangerous and Severe Personality Disorder projects (DSPD).  These projects involve very long periods (often up
default 
defaultto 7 years) of intensive treatment.  It is critical that the initial decision for prisoners to be placed on such projects is correct.
default3.10.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFunding is 
defaultalso currently available to make representations for prisoners in relation to segregation and selection for the Close Supervision Centres 
default(CSCs) 
defaultbut this will be removed completely. The use of segregation is the most severe punishment available to prisoner
defaults, involving the loss of their residual liberty.  
defaultIn a report transmitted to the UN General Assembly on 5 August 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan Mendez, 
defaultdefined ‘solitary confin
defaultement’ as the; “
defaultPhysical and social isolation of individuals who are confined to their cells for 22-24 hours a day
default”.  The UN Rapporteur’s report reinforced the opinion of his predecessors that:
default“prolonged solitary confinement [defined as longer than 15 day
defaults] may itself amount to prohibited ill treatment or torture” and this is “
defaultbecause at that point, according to the literature surveyed, some of the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible”
default.  
default3.10.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a consequence the UN Rapporteur rec
defaultommended that:
default 
defaulti
defaultndefinite solitary 
defaultconfinement should be abolished and that 
defaultprolonged solitary confinement, in excess of 15 days, should be subject to an absolute prohibition.
default  
defaultThe 2006 report by HM Inspector of Prisons entitled 
defaultExtreme Custody
default, 
defaultcontained 
defaultsimilar warnings about the operation of the CSC system
default:  
default“We considered that there were dangers associated with the use of designated cells as a control mechanism for open ended periods, without any apparent consultation with clinical staff, little local 
defaultownership of the their management, and limited independent oversight.  In practice this aspect of their use replicated the merry-go-round system which was now otherwise discontinued in the segregation system, and did not fit well into a system of 
defaultholistic 
defaultmanagement and care.”

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough the Response states that the ‘Government has decided to proceed with the proposal to limit the scope of criminal legal aid for prison law cases as proposed in the consultation document’ (para 48, page 73), it is unclear whet
defaulther the final decision has gone further than the original proposal.  For instance, TLA 3.18 stated that ‘some’ of the cases currently included under the ‘sentence’ category ‘would continue to be within the proposed scope of criminal legal aid advice and as
defaultsistance’ noting that ‘matters related to sentence planning and minimum term review applications would continue to be funded, subject to merits and means, as they relate to a review of ongoing detention’.  However, the Response at Para 46, page 73 states t
defaulthat ‘the amendment to the scope criteria outlined above would have the effect of removing both sentence planning…from scope as it is not a matter ‘for the Parole Board’.  This is despite that fact that disciplinary matters are not for the Parole Board and 
defaultnot all parole board matters appear to remain in scope in any event.  The Response adds ‘The consultation paper stated that sentence planning matters would continue to be funded but the modified scope criteria
default will mean they are not in future.’  It is the
defaultrefore unclear whether minimum term reviews which deal with whether a person convicted of murder as a child should have the minimum term reduced by a High Court judge on account of exceptional progress and sentence planning matters including the provision 
defaultof offending behaviour courses deemed critical to progress and safe release remain in scope.

defaultJudicial review
default 
default3.11.1
default              
defaultAPL is concerned that proposed changes to judicial review arrangements will mean that it will become virtually impossible for prisoners to 
defaultaccess the Courts when they are the victims of serious abuse by the State and all other attempts to deal with the problem have failed.
default3.11.2
default              
defaultAs has been said by many before, Sir Winston Churchill included, the way a nation treats its prisoners is a mark a
defaultnd measure of its stored up strength and “the sign and proof of the living virtue in it”.  Access to the courts and the protection of the rule of law should be available to all in equal measure.

default              
defaultOn a practical level, judicial review is simply not an adequate safety net to justify the removal of 80 per cent of prison law work.

default.5
default              
defaultAt present judicial review work arising from prison law issues may be undertaken by firms with either a prison law contract under the ‘associated Community Legal Service’
default (ACLS)
default scheme or a public law contract.  
defaultACLS work enables firms with a prison law co
defaultntract to commence judicial review work on any issue arising from the criminal contract.  The number of cases that can be commenced is not limited.  Firms with public law contracts on the other hand are allocated a 
defaultlimited number of public law matter start
defaults
default (usually around 15)
default. 
defaultOnce the majority of prison law work is removed from scope, it will only be possible for most public law challenges to be commenced by firms with a public law contract, and even then, the number of cases will be limited to the number
default of matter starts. 
defaultThis means
default that access to judicial review for prison law issues other than challenges concerning the legality of parole and adjudication cases 
defaultis finite: once a provider has used up its matter starts, it is not possible to open a legal h
defaultelp file for a new judicial review, regardless of the strength of the case. The Ministry of Justice is not proposing to increase the number of matter starts allocated to public law providers. There is therefore no scope for providers to absorb the prison l
defaultaw cases that will now be forced down the judicial review route as a result of the scope cuts. The effect of this will be that meritorious cases will go unheard and prisoners will be prevented from accessing judicial review. 
default We are not aware of any impact
default assessment on the increased need for public law matter starts based on the removal of criminal legal aid for prison law.

default              
defaultIn addition, the future of judicial review is uncertain. In September 2013 the Lord Chancellor published further proposals for 
defaultthe reform of judicial review
default. If enacted, those proposals will reduce the availability of judicial review for individual prisoners and their representative groups by imposing more restrictive rules on standing, forcing providers to work at risk, increasi
defaultng the use of wasted costs orders and limiting the availability of costs protection. In light of this it is impossible to rely on judicial review as protecting the right of access to the courts for prisoners going forward.

defaultCase Study default7defaultH was serving a de
defaultterminate sentence.  H's 5 year old son was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given a very short life expectancy.  The client contacted us seeking advice in relation to his position.  H and the child’s mother wanted to him have as much contact with his son
default as possible.  
defaultH's lawyers made an application to the prison for some form of release / temporary release to facilitate contact.  The prison granted an escorted visit, however, indicated no further visits would be granted.
defaultH's lawyers were ultimately succ
defaultessful after a number of contested hearings and H was granted a schedule of further visits with his son prior to his release from prison. The client was released on licence with similar restrictions on contact with his son.  This was despite his deteriorat
defaulting health and very short life expectancy.  The whole family was anxious for our client to spend as much time as possible with his son.
defaultUnder the new scope criteria....defaultthis issue will be out of scope.
defaultAs the issue arose from a prison law matter, H's lawyer
defaults were able to open an associated Legal Help file in order to challenge the decision not to grant any further home leave.  H's lawyers sent a Letter Before Claim and subsequently issued Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court for further escorted vis
defaultits.
defaultH's lawyers would have only been able to deal with this case if H's lawyers had enough Public Law Matter Starts left, of which H's lawyers are awarded 15 per year.
defaultWhy not use the complaints system?defaultThe complaints system is currently a very time
default consu
defaultming
default process, H's son was given a very short time to live and this case had to therefore be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. The complaints system would not have dealt with the case quickly enough.
defaultDue to the urgent nature of the case the initial h
defaultearing was granted the day after the application was lodged.  This was before permission was granted and under the proposals the substantial costs of this hearing would be at risk.
defaultNumerous urgent judicial review hearings were necessary, where the barriste
defaultr pushed for them to be granted proper contact. At each hearing the authorities tried to restrict contact. Ultimately the father and son were granted the contact they wanted by the High Court: they were granted more visits and then allowed to see each othe
defaultr every day – they were together on the day the son passed away.
defaultUnder the proposed funding cuts this family would not have had such access to a prison law solicitor. In addition, cuts to family law funding mean they would not have had access to a family law solicitor either.  They would have been powerless in the face 
defaultof the unlawful interference by the authorities in their lives. The mother told everyone that she wanted her son to be able to see his father as much as possible; that she needed the father to be there to support her and the family. Nobody listened to her,
default and nobody would have listened to her if the family had not had access to a solicitor. The government’s proposals threaten all of this.

defaultResidencedefault default3.12.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther, 
defaultlegal aid to obtain redress in any civil matter will require prisoners to meet the lawful residence condition.  This will exclude many prisoners from accessing civil law.  The 
defaultresidence requirements are likely to have a disproportionate effect on prisoners
default. In the week commencing 23 September 2013, there were 10,786 foreign nationals in detention in England and Wales.  Prisoners who are unfairly treated and unable to prove residence will be completely insulated from access to justice unless they can pay for
default it once the scope cuts come into place.  Further, parole reviews are only challengeable by way of judicial review (a civil cause) thus leaving any prisoner without proof of lawful residence without any remedy to address an unlawful or unfair parole decisi
defaulton.
default3.12.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven where prisoners do meet the test, they may not be able to prove it.  O
defaultbtaining proof o
defaultf
default anything on behalf of prisoners can be complex and time consuming.  Most prisoners do not have time to prepare for detention and their possessions and document
defaults are not easily accessible.  Many prisoners have lived hand to mouth prior to detention and may not be able to easily provide their lawyers with documentary evidence of lawful residence.

default Subject to clarity as to what will remain in scope, according to LAA statistics published in June 2013, only 20 per cent of prison law cases involve the parole board and adjudications (page 11).  Some of these cases will now be excluded and it is still po
defaultssible that a small number of the remaining 80 per cent of cases will remain in scope.  However, it appears that the cuts will exclude approximately 80 per cent of cases. 
defaulthttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/lsc/legal-aid-stats-12-13.pdf
default This was not evident from the original consultation paper which stated that parole board cases would remain in scope as these cas
defaultes were ‘about on-going detention’ (para 3.20, TLA).  The APL took this to indicate that it would include cases about the nature of the detention rather than just whether detention should continue.  For that reason, our response did not deal with the prosp
defaultect of the withdrawal of legal aid for non-release cases.  We also note that the Parole B
defaultoard response did not deal with this either.
default 
defaultIn addition TLA para 3.4 said legal aid should remain for any case
default 
default“which affects the individual’s ongoing detention and w
defaulthere liberty is at stake”…?
default The Board’s own policy states that: “
defaultIn the majority of cases, the Board cannot ultimately be satisfied about risk until and unless a successful period of testing has been completed. Regardless of the length of tariff, where o
