"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Welsh Language Commissioner [FBB0042]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to \nprovide evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into the Future of the BBC.\n&#xa0;\nThe principal aim of the Commissioner is to promote and facilitate the use of Welsh. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organisations. This, in turn, will lead to the establishment of rights for Welsh speakers. \n&#xa0;\nTwo principles underpin the Commissioner's work: \nIn due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory Welsh language schemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh Language Act 1993.\n&#xa0;\nThe role of the Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the freedom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints regarding the failure of organizations to meet standards. \n&#xa0;\nOne of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinise Welsh language policy developments, acting as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh speakers in Wales. This evidence is provided to the \nCulture, Media and Sport Committee\n in that capacity.\n&#xa0;\nThe Commissioner’s comments, and the issues which the Committee may wish to address, may be summarised as follows:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThank you once again for the opportunity to contribute to this inquiry. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
