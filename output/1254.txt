[[[(WSC006)]]]SummaryThis submission outlines evidence from the Targeted Initiative on Science and Mathematics Education (TISME), a major current research programme that is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council in partnership with the Institute of Physics, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the Association for Science Education. Drawing on analysis of extensive, large-scale surveys, in-depth qualitative data and systematic literature reviews, our evidence shows that:Our recommendations call for the following:Introduction1.1&#xa0; This submission is provided by Professor Louise Archer, on behalf of the Targeted Initiative on Science and Mathematics Education (TISME), with assistance from Prof. Jeremy Hodgen, Prof. Justin Dillon and Prof. M. Reiss.1.2&#xa0; TISME is a major national research programme focusing on Science and Mathematics Education. It is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council in partnership with the Institute of Physics, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the Association for Science Education. It comprises five large research projects (based at the University of Cambridge, the London Institute of Education, King’s College London (two projects) and the University of Leeds). TISME is coordinated by a team based at King’s College London, with Prof. Archer as the lead coordinator. This submission of evidence draws in particular on evidence from two of the five TISME projects: ASPIRES and UPMAP. It also draws on a recent TISME publication outlining our evidence for what influences participation in science and mathematics.1.3&#xa0; The ASPIRES (Children’s science aspirations and career choice: age 10-14) project is a five-year study. The study uses national survey data (from c. 20,000 students age 10-14) and extensive in-depth interviews with 170 students and parents to provide an authoritative picture of young people’s and families’ views of science and science careers. ASPIRES is based at King’s College London and is directed by Professor Louise Archer.1.4&#xa0; The UPMAP (Understanding Participation rates in post-16 Mathematics And Physics) project is a three year longitudinal study of the factors that cause school students to continue with mathematics or physics after the age of 16. It uses a UK-wide survey of year 8, year 10 and year 12 students with interviews of year 10, 11, 12 and first year undergraduate students. c. 23,000 students completed one or more of the questionnaires, c. 100 students were interviewed in each of years 10, 11 and 12 and c. 50 undergraduates were interviewed. UPMAP is based at Institute of Education, University of London and is directed by Professor Michael Reiss. 1.5&#xa0; A programme of four research studies funded by the Nuffield Foundation and the Sutton trust on participation in post-16 mathematics, mathematically high-attaining countries and workplace mathematics. These studies collated and analysed evidence about different systems and reviewed the relevant literature. The studies were based at King’s College London and were directed by Professor Jeremy Hodgen. 1.6&#xa0; One of the foci of both the ASPIRES and UPMAP research projects was to understand the factors which dissuade girls and young women from continuing with STEM post-16 and/or considering careers in STEM.1.7&#xa0; Our reason for submitting evidence to the Inquiry relates to our remit and responsibility to share relevant recent research evidence to help inform public and policy debate.Evidence

[[[2.1]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Women’s under-representation in STEM careers is not due to a lack of interest in these subject areas at school]]]. The ASPIRES surveys of over 9,000 10/11 year olds, 5,600+ 12/13 year olds and 4,600 13/14 year-olds show that the majority of young people like school science. E.g. over 70% report finding science lessons interesting and this interest continues from primary into early secondary school. ASPIRES surveys also show that a higher percentage of girls than boys rate science as their favourite subject – yet this interest is not translating into girls seeing science careers as potentially ‘for me’ . Many current and previous interventions aimed at encouraging greater participation in STEM have been based on the premise that increasing students’ interest will lead to an increase in post-16 participation. ASPIRES evidence suggests that this is not the case and that there is a disconnect between liking a subject and seeing a career in that field as conceivable and/or achievable.

[[[2.2]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Girls’ perceptions of STEM careers as ‘not for me’ are formed early]]]: Evidence from ASPIRES surveys and interviews shows that despite liking science, few girls aged 10-14 aspire to STEM careers and that the proportion who do declines over the 10-14 age period. That is, by age 14, most girls have already come to see science careers as ‘interesting but not for me’.  Despite being more likely than boys to identify science as their favourite subject, only 18% of boys and 12% of girls aged 12-14 aspire to a career in STEM. Girls are much more likely to aspire to the arts (e.g. ASPIRES surveys found that 64% of 12/13 year olds aspire to careers in the arts). This disparity between liking a subject and aspiring to a career in that field is not because students have particularly negative views of STEM careers: ASPIRES found that the majority of children rule out STEM career choices even though they like science, feel they are good at it, and think what scientists do is valuable and well-paid.  

[[[2.3]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Narrow views of where science at school may lead hinders STEM participation]]]: The majority of young people and parents who took part in the ASPIRES study reported narrow views on where they think science qualifications can lead. Most saw science qualifications as leading only to careers as a ‘scientist, science teacher or doctor’. There is little general awareness among parents and children of the potential wider value and transferability of STEM qualifications in the labour market. The importance of this lack of awareness is reinforced by findings from the UPMAP study’s survey of 2,000 Year 10 students who were followed into Year 12. The survey found that perceived material gain (‘I think Physics will help me in the job I want to do in the future’) is one of most important factors predicting whether students will choose to study the subject post-16. In other words, if more young people, but particularly girls, were aware of how STEM subjects can be valuable/ beneficial for a wide range of careers both in and beyond STEM, we might expect to see higher post-16 participation rates in these subjects.

[[[2.4]]]&#xa0; 

[[[(Unwitting) sexism/]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[differential expectations for girls]]]: The ASPIRES evidence shows that families constitute the greatest source of influence on 10-14 year olds’ aspirations.  Children from families that are familiar with the world of science and technology are much more likely than their peers to want to study science post-16 and/or work in science careers. Yet the UPMAP evidence shows that compared to boys, girls tend to receive substantially less encouragement from their families and significant others to consider and pursue STEM careers. This differential encouragement is particularly important given UPMAP’s finding that one of the most significant factors influencing post-16 participation in physics and mathematics is whether the individual had, over time, been specifically encouraged to continue with the subject by a significant adult. Wider research evidence also indicates that some teachers unwittingly hold and express differential expectations for male and female students. For example, Carlone’s (2004) US study shows how teachers in advanced physics classes interpreted girls’ (higher) attainment in the subject as due to their ‘plodding diligence’ but saw boys (lesser) attainment as simply laziness hiding their ‘natural brilliance’ for the subject. The lack of time and emphasis given to equality issues within contemporary UK initial teacher education also raise unwitting stereotyping as an issue for concern and attention.

[[[2.5]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Girls report lower self-confidence in their abilities – a factor which is exacerbated by the ‘brainy’ image of STEM:]]] TISME research shows that those who are traditionally under-represented in post-16 physical sciences and mathematics (notably girls, working-class and certain minority ethnic pupils) tend to be less confident in their abilities and are less likely to identify themselves as being ‘good’ at science and/or mathematics, irrespective of their actual abilities and attainment . The UPMAP survey of 23,000 12-15 year olds found that girls who want to study physics post-16 report lower confidence in their abilities than boys, despite tests revealing no difference in their actual conceptual abilities. Issues of self-confidence are further exacerbated by the ‘brainy’ image of science. For instance, the ASPIRES surveys found that over 80% of Y6 and Y8 students see scientists as ‘brainy’ and those girls who did express science aspirations defined themselves (and were defined by their parent/s) as being ‘academic’ and ‘bright’/‘clever’. Many middle attaining students enjoy mathematics and/or science but do not see post-16 participation as being possible for them. They see science careers as only for the ‘brainy’ few – a perception that needs to be challenged. Wider research underlines how notions of cleverness are gendered (classed and racialised), making it harder for girls, working class and some minority ethnic young people to see themselves as authentically ‘clever’ (e.g. see Archer 2008; Archer &amp; Francis 2007).

[[[2.6]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The perception of STEM careers as ‘masculine’ deters many young women]]]: The ASPIRES project found that 10-14 year-old girls find it harder than boys to reconcile aspirations for a career in science with their gender identity (seeing oneself as a ‘normal’ girl or boy). This is because most parents and young people associate science careers with masculinity (“its men – geeky men” as one mother we interviewed put it). The ‘masculine’ image of STEM deters many young women and their families for several reasons, including the perception that it will be harder for women to progress within a male-dominated area and the feeling that STEM careers do not fit easily with ‘normal’ femininity (“its not girly, its not sexy, not glamorous” as another parent explained). ASPIRES found that feminine, ‘girly’ girls are less likely to express science aspirations than ‘non-girly’ girls and that the proportion of ‘feminine’ girls aspiring to science-related careers declines with age. In other words, the ‘masculine’ image of science makes it much harder for girls to maintain their science aspirations over time – they have to do much more identity ‘work’ than boys to reconcile and balance science aspirations and femininity and to sustain a view of STEM careers as possible and desirable.

[[[2.7]]]&#xa0; 

[[[School and family context influences girls’ subject choices]]]: While powerful, the effects of social inequalities are not immutable. The context, values and practices of families and schools can greatly encourage more girls to study STEM subjects, or not. For instance, it has long been established that single-sex schools are more successful in getting more girls to study A level physics – a recent report by the Institute of Physics shows that girls are two and a half times more likely to take A level Physics if they come from a girls’ school rather than a co-educational school. The ASPIRES study also found that girls from families who possess considerable ‘science capital’ (science-related qualifications, jobs, understanding and social contacts) were much more likely to aspire to science-related careers than girls from families with little science capital.

[[[2.8]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Gender is not an isolated variable]]]: The ASPIRES research underlines how gender does not operate in isolation but interacts closely with other axes of inequality, such as social class and ethnicity. Middle-class girls and girls from White or South Asian backgrounds are much more likely to aspire to STEM careers. 

[[[2.9]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Participation is influenced by a number of factors]]]: High levels of participation are not simply driven by compulsion, or a mandatory requirement, to study STEM - particularly for advanced options. Other factors, such as providing appropriate options for all students, the breadth of the post-16 curriculum in general, and the specification of mathematics (or STEM more general) as an entry requirement for HE, are also associated with high levels of participation.Recommendations

[[[3.1]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Promote the message that STEM qualifications ‘keep options open’]]]: All students need to be better informed about the transferable value of STEM qualifications for a wide range of careers. Promoting the message (through education and enrichment activities) that STEM qualifications can ‘keep options open’ and can lead to a range of well-paid and interesting careers, at graduate and technical levels, both within and beyond STEM, would be highly beneficial. 

[[[3.2]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Earlier, better, targeted careers education]]]: Most young people form their attitudes and their perceptions of STEM careers as ‘not for me’ between the ages of 10-14, a time when most receive little or no careers education to support or inform their ideas. Most families lack understanding about the potential value of STEM qualifications and STEM careers. 

[[[3.3]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Embed STEM careers awareness in the curriculum]]]: A potentially useful approach that is used in other countries (and which a US randomised control trial has shown to raise student attainment and motivation, particularly among under-represented groups) is to embed information about how STEM is used in the world, and about the people who use it, throughout the curriculum.  This approach has the advantage of reaching a wide range of students – whereas current extra-curricula and optional approaches tend to only reach small numbers, and sometimes an uneven social or geographical spread, of students. However, teachers will need support and training if this approach is to be adopted – and appropriate policy levers will need to influence the national curriculum and assessment to enable and encourage uptake of this approach. 

[[[3.4]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Broaden post-16 routes (including STEM routes)]]]: The small range of options available to students after the age of 16 is an important limiting factor.  More options would mean more students would be likely to continue post-16, especially in mathematics where rates of participation are exceptionally low by international standards. The evidence from other systems, particularly Singapore, New Zealand and Scotland, is that encouraging breadth of study (e.g. in a baccalaureate style system) raises participation rates. Current moves in England to require students to study mathematics to 18 might be usefully applied to science. There is a strong case to be made for changing England’s current culture of early specialisation, which is anomalous by international comparison. The lack of choices for continuing with mathematics and science post-16 (beyond traditional A levels in the separate sciences) for those achieving a grade B or C in GCSE is a missed opportunity. A mathematics AS-level equivalent, focused on statistics, modelling and the application of mathematics, could encourage the participation of students, particularly girls, who may not be interested in the traditional calculus-focused A-level.  A really useful alternative Science A level that is suitable for a wide range of post-18 routes might increase scientific literacy for all and further encourage women’s participation in STEM. 

[[[3.5]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Challenge the masculine image of STEM]]] 

[[[and STEM careers]]]: Improving the gender and social profile of STEM graduates and STEM professionals is important for both the STEM pipeline and social equity. There is likely to be a ‘trickle-down’ effect from changes in the profile of STEM professionals to student and family perceptions of the sector – but this result will, in likelihood, be slow to achieve.

[[[3.6]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Challenge the ‘brainy’ image of STEM]]]: Giving more emphasis to non-degree and technical STEM pathways and careers would seem to be one practical route for educators, careers professionals and STEM enrichment providers to take. An alternative post-16 STEM A level would also be beneficial by enabling those who have not achieved A/A* to still continue to study science and mathematics post-16.

[[[3.7]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Recognise that gender does not operate in isolation]]]: Initiatives aimed at reducing gender participation disparities need to be sensitive to the ways in which social class and ethnicity interact with gender.

[[[3.8]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Provide targeted support and encouragement for girls and teachers: ]]]Providing sustained, targeted support and encouragement for girls, but particularly those from working-class and minority ethnic backgrounds, to see STEM careers as possible and desirable would be beneficial. This support needs to be coupled with meaningful professional development for science educators and teachers to challenge unequal expectations among education professionals.

[[[3.9]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Provide professional development to help teachers, students and families to deconstruct gender (and other) stereotypes]]]. Existing wider research indicates that teaching students and teachers to deconstruct (discuss, take apart, understand and challenge) stereotyping is more effective and long-lasting than simply providing positive images of scientists or STEM.

[[[Work with families]]]

[[[ to increase their ‘science capita]]]

[[[l’]]]: Evidence suggests that promoting and encouraging organisations to work with families, not just individual students, with the aim of building science capital and to promote key STEM careers messages would help increase the likelihood of girls (and boys) coming to see STEM qualifications and careers as possible and desirable.August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Further information can be found at: www.tisme-scienceandmaths.org Archer, L. &amp; Tomei, A.
