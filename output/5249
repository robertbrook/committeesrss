default              
defaultChair:default May I welcome members of the public to this sitting of the Foreign Affairs Committee? This is the second of a series of one-off evidence sessions on 
defaultMiddle East
default issues. The first was held in December on 
defaultSyria
default, and we have other plans. This session will examine the current state of relations between 
defaultIsrael
default and the 
defaultOccupied
default 
defaultPalestinian
default 
defaultTerritories
default, the efforts of the international community to bring about an agreement, and the prospect for the 
defaultMiddle East
default peace process in 2014. 
default              
defaultMay I give a very warm welcome to Professor Manuel 
defaultHassassian
default, the head of the Palestinian Mission in 
defaultLondon
default? Professor, it is very good to see you again. You have been a generous host to us in the past when we have had meetings, so we are particularly delighted that you have accepted the invitation. 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default It is my pleasure, sir. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ1default 
defaultChair:default Would you like to say a few words by way of an opening statement? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default As members of the Committee know, the year 2014 is declared by the UN as the international year of solidarity with the Palestinian people. We hope that this year will not simply be in support of maintaining the status quo; we would like to see positive action in the Palestinians having their own independent Palestinian state. As far as the Palestinians are concerned, we have been committed to the peace process for the past 20 years. As a matter of fact, we have accepted so many concessions, starting with the acceptance of the state of 
defaultIsrael
default over 78% of the Palestinian historic territory, and so far there has been no acknowledgement of our nationhood or our statehood from the Israeli side. We want this peace process to succeed because we gain much, as Palestinians, from its success, for the simple fact that we could fulfil our national aspirations of having our independent state over 22% of historic 
defaultPalestine
default. Yet we are the ones who could really set a precedent for security, not only in our part of the world but in the entire 
defaultMiddle East
default region.
default              
defaultWe still do not know what 
defaultIsrael
default’s agenda is as long as it does not recognise Palestinian nationhood, and we are not really clear about 
defaultIsrael
default’s position in the peace process. We have seen preconditions coming into the actual, real negotiations, sponsored by the 
defaultUnited States
default. Secretary of State John Kerry is putting his whole heart into making this a success story. The Palestinian side has been very co-operative with Mr Kerry in making it a success story. However, we have not seen the Israelis after almost 20 rounds of talks; we are still just vacillating between borders and security and trying more or less to agree on semantics—what kind of security and borders we are talking about. 
default              
defaultWe do not have the maps that 
defaultIsrael
default wants really to share with us. We went there with the idea that the 1967 borders are the borders for a two-state solution in which two democracies could live side by side. So far I can say that the peace process is being stalled by the impediments being put by 
defaultIsrael
default and by the continuing Israeli settlements—the building of settlements. The 
defaultlatest was a couple of days ago. Prime Minister 
defaultNetanyahu
default has daringly announced that they will build another 1,400 units. Since 30 July last year, when we embarked on this new peace process, 
defaultIsrael
default has pledged to build more than 6,400 units on the West Bank and in 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default. Those are signs of a lack of commitment to the peace process as far as 
defaultIsrael
default is concerned. They are negative signs to our side that 
defaultIsrael
default is not serious about peace.
default              
defaultChair:default Thank you. I should have added at the beginning, professor, that we have just half an hour and a lot of questions, so please stay focused on the precise point being put to you.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default You called me “professor”; as you know, professors tend to speak. If I were an ambassador, I would change my style. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ2default 
defaultChair:default I am the son of a professor and I know exactly what you mean.
default              
defaultDo you have the same feeling of urgency about the negotiations as Secretary of State Kerry had as he launched them? Is this the last chance for the two-state solution?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default I think it is the last chance for the two-state solution. That is why the Palestinians are taking these negotiations very seriously. We have been very co-operative with Mr Kerry. It is not only that the President is in direct contact with Mr Kerry, let alone the negotiating team, but I have managed to attend a couple of meetings with Mr Kerry. We have portrayed to him the total commitment of the Palestinians to non-violence with diplomatic efforts. We want the peace process to succeed and to have an independent Palestinian state. We have to finish with this occupation once and for all. We do not need crisis management. We want an end of conflict and an end of claims.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ3default 
defaultChair:default What are the implications if the talks do not succeed?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default The implications are many. First of all, the strategy of the Palestinians has always been a commitment to non-violence, so we are going to pursue our aims through non-violent means. It has been reiterated many times by President 
defaultMahmoud
default 
defaultAbbas
default that the path towards a solution is through negotiations, diplomatic efforts and non-violent means. But saying that does not mean that the President, myself or any authority could crush the tendencies of the frustrated—almost four and a half million Palestinians—so that they do not go to the street and start a new wave of a third intifada.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ4default 
defaultSir John Stanley:default Could you tell us how satisfied or not the Palestinian Authority is with the role and policies of the British Government towards getting meaningful negotiations under way between the Palestinians and the Israelis?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default In my opening remarks, I should have thanked the British Government for their total support to the Palestinians, not only politically, but economically, and their serious concerns about making this peace process a success story. We know through our private channels that the British Government have been working closely with Secretary of State Kerry and the American Administration in trying to push for a resolution to the conflict through peaceful efforts. Time and again we have heard Foreign Secretary William Hague saying that this is the last chance for a two-state solution. If we go to the 
defaultWest Bank
default today, we see that it is 
defaultdivided into four major cantons with no geographical continuity. With the building of the apartheid wall, with 
defaultGaza
default being totally separated and 
defaultJerusalem
default being isolated, there is no way that we could have our politically independent Palestinian state with this non-contiguous geographic entity, let alone with the building of settlements. It is not an encouragement to resolve this deal once and for all. 
default              
defaultGoing back to the question of the British Government, I think the British Government has been very committed to the peace process, and it has been very committed to helping Palestinian infrastructure development as well as promoting business with the Palestinians. It has always been committed in paying its contributions to peace efforts. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ5default 
defaultRory Stewart:default Thank you very much for coming. Given what you have said, it seems surprising that you still have confidence in a two-state solution. Why is that you came back to the negotiating table in July 2013? What gave you that optimism? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default The PLO since 1988 has committed itself to the recognition of the state of 
defaultIsrael
default and to a two-state solution. In 1993, we reiterated our commitment to de jure recognition of the state of 
defaultIsrael
default, believing that the only way out of the conflict was through negotiation. However, 
defaultIsrael
default did not really comply with all the agreements that were signed, and it kept on building settlements and trying more or less to create settlement blocs with what they call natural expansion in those settlements. The continuation of that will be an impediment to striking a peace with 
defaultIsrael
default. As I mentioned earlier, if that process continues, the Palestinians will not be able to accept a two-state solution. 
default              
defaultThe principle stands that our commitment has been to a two-state solution. That has been the position of the PLO, as the interlocutor with the state of 
defaultIsrael
default. If you ask simple lay people and academics, looking at what is happening on the ground, it will be impossible to have a two-state solution with the current status quo. That is why we are still committed, as a Government, to a two-state solution, but we do not know what the future holds if 
defaultIsrael
default continues with the same expansionist policies. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ6default 
defaultRory Stewart:default Just looking at the repeated threats by negotiators on your side to leave the table, why have those repeated threats been made and what do you think their impact has been? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default When you sit in a room and you keep talking about the same principles—
defaultIsrael
default came to the negotiations not discussing the substantive issues that were outstanding in the final status agreements. 
defaultIsrael
default continued to talk about two issues: security and borders. They have never shown the maps of what their borders should be. 
default              
defaultWe went to the peace process believing that there would be a Palestinian state eventually, through negotiations, on the 1967 borders, which were part of the international legitimacy and part of the UN resolutions. The frustration of the Palestinian negotiating team is that time and again, 
defaultIsrael
default talks about borders and tries to impose new ideas like, for example, having total security of the 
defaultJordan
default 
defaultValley
default and talking about a lease of 40 years, after which they would rethink sitting with the Palestinians for a joint security over the 
defaultJordan
default 
defaultValley
default. Such initiatives, at a time when we know exactly what the endgame is, and when we know exactly what Israel should have and what we have—injecting the idea of a Jewish state at this time when the negotiations are 
defaultabout permanent status issues is an attempt, more or less, to deflect the entire peace process into something else. That is where the frustration of the Palestinian negotiators is coming from. Nothing is moving forward with the Israeli side. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ7default 
defaultAndrew defaultRosindelldefault:default Professor, can you explain why the Palestinian Authority opposes the idea of accepting 
defaultIsrael
default as a nation state of the Jewish people? If the wording explicitly included equal rights for minorities, would that be acceptable?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default First of all, we have accepted the state of 
defaultIsrael
default, not the Jewish state of 
defaultIsrael
default. When you talk about a Jewish state, it implies two things for us immediately. One is the idea of negating the right of return for refugees, because by UN stipulations, they cannot go back to their original home, which today is in so-called 
defaultIsrael
default. Secondly, when you talk about a Jewish state, you are talking about an exclusive Jewish state, from which 1.5 million Palestinians holding Israeli citizenship are going to be banned. They will have to either be shifted into the 
defaultWest Bank
default or go to a third country. That is why the question of a Jewish state has a lot of implications for us. That is the first thing.
default              
defaultSecondly, why are we discussing a Jewish state at a time when we are still struggling to have our own borders set with 
defaultIsrael
default? Thirdly, I would say, let 
defaultIsrael
default start by changing its name by going to the United Nations. Why is 
defaultIsrael
default today not asking Jordan, with whom it has a kind of peace treaty, to recognise it as a Jewish state? Why not 
defaultEgypt
default, for example? Why is it mandatory that the Palestinians should give them that recognition? At the same time, how can we recognise an entity when we are not recognised by the contending party as an entity ourselves? They did not recognise us as the Palestinian nation state; why should we give them recognition of a Jewish state? After the end of these negotiations, when we come to a final agreement, I do not see any reason why we should not accept a Jewish state. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ8default 
defaultMr Roy:default Professor, what progress has been made to bring about greater unity between 
defaultGaza
default and the 
defaultWest Bank
default?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default We have never stopped the meetings between the Fatah faction and 
defaultGaza
default, but first I would like to make some general remarks. There is no division among Palestinians between 
defaultGaza
default and the 
defaultWest Bank
default. 
defaultGaza
default and the 
defaultWest Bank
default has been recognised internationally by the United Nations. It has been considered an occupied territory. We are one and the same. The Palestinian Authority has never stopped funding 
defaultGaza
default, even under the control of Hamas. Thirdly, Hamas is part and parcel of the Palestinian people. We are part of the same social fabric. If they have certain ideologies that we do not agree with, it does not mean that they are on the wrong side of the equation. 
default              
defaultWhat I am trying to say is that reconciliation is going to take place one of these days. Hamas has accepted giving the PLO the mandate to continue negotiations, and the result of those negotiations will be bound for a national referendum. In that respect, Hamas has not been an impediment to the peace process, and neither has it stopped the Palestinian Authority from meeting the Israelis and negotiating for peace, for that matter. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ9default 
defaultMr Roy:default When will elections take place? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default Elections will take place as soon as we have reconciliation. Three kinds of elections are going to take place. One is legislative elections, because the Parliament has been dead for the last five years. Secondly, we will have presidential elections, and third, we will have Palestinian national council elections for the PLO. We hope that Hamas will participate in the three elections, representing the entire Palestinian social fabric. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ10default 
defaultMr Roy:default What work, exactly, has been done on agreeing these elections?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default There are some concerns from Hamas about going back to the quota system. They want, as in the national council of the PLO, which is our organisation in exile, 40% of the seats. That is not really acceptable, for the simple fact that elections need representatives of all kinds equally. There is no quota system. If there is a quota system, then there is no democracy or electoral process to start with. Of course, Hamas was in a situation where it was in total control of 
defaultGaza
default; it is still controlling it militarily. But as you know, with the developments in 
defaultEgypt
default and 
defaultSyria
default, Hamas’s political position is becoming very weak in 
defaultGaza
default. Hamas would not like to see elections held now, because they know that they would lose elections in 
defaultGaza
default. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ11default 
defaultChair:default Professor, 
defaultFathi
default 
defaultHamad
default, Hamas’s Interior Minister, claimed in a speech the other day that 
defaultIsrael
default would cease to exist by 2022. Do you distance yourself from those remarks? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default I not only distance myself from those remarks, I categorically reject them.
default              
defaultChair:default Thank you. That is very helpful.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ12default 
defaultMr Baron:default Professor, we all know how important sound economics and economic prosperity are to any process—peace process or otherwise. As you are aware, there are proposals on the table from Secretary of State Kerry and the Quartet representative Tony Blair to secure something like $4 billion in investment for the Palestinians. Is it possible to make economic progress before a political breakthrough? If so, how important is it? Where does this fit into the big scheme of things? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default This is a philosophical question: which comes first, the chicken or the egg? We have many differences over the issues of whether economic stability will bring political resolution to any kind of conflict. Or vice versa—if we have a political resolution then the economic development will basically pave the way towards more settlement, security and stability in the area. 
default              
defaultIt is important in our case that we should continually have economic development and try to secure that. The major problem today facing the Palestinian Authority is unemployment, as you know. I just came back from the West Bank three days ago and—my goodness gracious—the consumer goods in the West Bank are more expensive than in 
defaultLondon
default. Would you believe that? We talk about a per capita income ratio of one to almost 20, and we buy our goods basically from 
defaultIsrael
default. If you talk about the basic necessities, the Palestinians cannot really afford to pay for their basic necessities. 
default              
defaultI believe that economic development, yes, will try to create the ambience for stability and for the negotiations to succeed. But I would not say that it will be enough basically to maintain the status quo. We need to change the realities on the ground. Any kind of economic help would really give the momentum for the people to have hopes that they will cash very soon the dividends of the peace process.
default              
defaultIf we start with some kind of development, and let us assume that the negotiations are moving well in tag with that kind of economic development, then I think that would be a recipe for success. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ13default 
defaultMr Baron:default Thanks, Professor. On a related theme, can I move on to 
defaultBritain
default’s role in the peace process? 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default The Europeans’ role?
default              
defaultMr Baron:default No, the British, the UK Government’s role. You were very complimentary in answer to a previous question from Sir John Stanley about the role we have played so far. However, as has been mentioned in the House of Commons, in Parliament, a number of times, we talk about a peace process but there is very little peace and there is not much process, so more needs to be done. What more should be done, can be done, by the UK Government to drive the process forward, given that we all accept that we could be drinking in the last-chance saloon?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default First, let me be a little bit blunt. With all our praise and acknowledgment to the British Government in supporting the Palestinians, not only the peace process but the Palestinians per se in the 
defaultOccupied
default 
defaultTerritories
default, we also have our frustrations with the British Government. Not recognising us as members of UNESCO was a total blow to me personally. I shouldn’t have seen such a position coming from the British Government while you have been very supportive of the Palestinians, let alone the issue of the Palestinians’ non-observer status in the UN, which was another frustration. 
default              
defaultI think the British Government are trying their best to help but I can see certain pressures coming from the Israeli and American side. I see that the British are there not as full partners in the political process. They are much more involved in paying the cheques rather than in playing an important role in the peace process itself politically. But yet we never undervalued the role of the British Government in putting pressures—low profile and discreetly—with the Americans through their own recommendations, let alone their tough position, especially on the issue of settlements. The British Government have been very outspoken on the question of the illegality of building Israeli settlements. 
default              
defaultThat is very encouraging for us as Palestinians, but we need the British Government to play a little bit more effectively on the political scene. They could put pressures on the Americans, for example, to put aside the question of the Jewish state. Let’s put those issues aside and deal with them at the end of the political process. The problem has always been the process and not the substance. Both parties know exactly what the endgame will be and what the political solution will be. Our problem has always been the process. When the rules of the game are being permanently and 
defaultdraconianly
default changed while we are engaged in a process, that is not an 
defaultencouraging gesture by the Israelis, so we would like the British Government to be more assertive and more affirmative in their position that the rules of the game should not be changed. You cannot change horses in the middle of the battle, and this is where we need you to be more proactive.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ14default 
defaultMr Baron:default A brief follow-up. You have described our role, perhaps accurately, as being more of a bystander than being proactive. If there were one, two, or perhaps three things that you would want to see changed in the 
defaultUK
default’s approach with regard to the negotiations and the peace process, what specifically would they be?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default First, continue with your position of saying that settlements are an impediment to peace. This is very important. Secondly, we would like you to continue to give warnings to your business people not to do business with illegal settlements. We are not talking about an Israeli boycott here. We are talking about illegal Israeli settlements that are selling products for $700 million to $1 billion. That is profit a year, and that in itself gives the Israelis the incentive to expand their settlements. Trying not to warn but to discourage business people—British people—to make deals with the Israeli settlements is something that we would really appreciate. Very much so.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ15default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Professor, in December last year, the European Council set out some conclusions that resulted in an offer of what they called an unprecedented package of European political, economic and security support to Israel and Palestine if they reach an agreement. What is the PA’s response?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default We opened our arms and we said we accept that. 
defaultIsrael
default has been lobbying the Europeans to improve the business guidance in its favour, and it has not stopped lobbying to change the rules of the association agreement. As far as we are concerned, we are really encouraged and we accept the fact that the EU has played a major role at least in economic development, but our frustration lies in the fact that it never had political teeth in the political process itself. So we have basically welcomed that package, but, of course, 
defaultIsrael
default is always trying to change the rules of the game and they always undermine the role of the Europeans, especially when it comes to the political part of the process.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ16default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Do you not see that this offer, which obviously has benefits for Palestinians, also has benefits for the Israelis in that it gives them a better status in terms of the trading relationship with the EU?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default 
defaultIsrael
default has to decide whether it wants peace or wants to continue with its activities. 
defaultIsrael
default so far has shown us a war agenda, not a peace agenda. If 
defaultIsrael
default continues to go with impunity, we are discouraged to see any kind of resolution. Denying Palestinians human rights and their rights for self-determination will exacerbate the situation to the point where violence will be inevitable. 
default              
defaultIf you ask me, in a nutshell, where do we stand in the negotiations, I can give you one sentence that has been my tagline for the last three years: we are stuck between the historically inevitable and the politically impossible.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ17default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default We are coming towards the end of our allotted time, Professor, but I want to press you on the status of  
defaultEast Jerusalem
default. Will you tell us briefly about the importance that the Palestinian Authority attaches to the status of 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default and its availability to be the capital of a Palestinian state?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default First, East Jerusalem is considered to be an occupied 
defaultJerusalem
default, so when we talk about the West Bank and 
defaultGaza
default, we talk about 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default. We have never isolated 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default. We will never accept 
defaultJerusalem
default as being the undivided capital of the State of Israel. We have two solutions there. I have written extensively on the issue of 
defaultJerusalem
default, with 15 models of sovereignty through second-track negotiations. There is no time to discuss them, but our position, as the PLO and as the authority, is that without 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default there will never be an independent Palestinian state. That is number one. East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem should be part of an open city and the holy sites should be open to all faiths from all over the world, but if 
defaultIsrael
default decides to separate the city, the eastern part would be under our control and the western part would be under its control. 
default              
defaultAt Camp David, we accepted the fact that the Wailing Wall and the Jewish quarter would be ceded to the state of 
defaultIsrael
default as part of the continuation of the holy sites and religious rituals. We accepted that in a letter from the late Yasser Arafat to President Clinton. As you know, the 
defaultCamp David
default accords did not succeed for two reasons. First, 
defaultIsrael
default did not accept the right of return of refugees. Secondly, 
defaultIsrael
default wanted total political sovereignty over 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default. Those were the reasons why the peace process failed and why we had a second bloody intifada.
default              
defaultAs we stand today, 
defaultEast Jerusalem
default should be the capital whether open or not and that could be done. I have been working with Canadians on the issue of the internationalisation of the one square kilometre, which is the old city where we have all the religious sites, and on how an international body could control it, with the consensus of Israelis and Palestinians. There is much lateral thinking about how we can share the city of 
defaultJerusalem
default without building high walls between us and the Israelis.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ18default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default Can I take you back to the right of return? You mentioned it a moment ago and in a little more detail earlier in our discussion. Do you accept that it is not now possible for there to be an absolute right of return and that some kind of compromise may be necessary, including, for example, financial compensation for those who might have that right in other circumstances but who cannot now exercise it for reasons of geography?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default First, let me say that the right of return is a legal, moral and individual right.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ19default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default It is resolution 194 of the United Nations General Assembly, not of the Security Council.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default Yes, I agree that it is not a Security Council resolution and that it is not legally binding, but it is still a resolution that came from the General Assembly. As I said, it is a legal, moral and individual right. Each Palestinian refugee is entitled to reparations and to the right to choose how his or her right of return should be implemented. The refugees have been 
defaultgiven meaningful options here. This is coming not only from my side as a Palestinian; it has also been discussed in the second-track negotiations. There are plausible solutions to the question of return.
default              
defaultIsrael
default has to accept the principle of return. In terms of pragmatism, which means choosing between constraints, we know for a fact that 7 million refugees are not going to come back, and 
defaultIsrael
default also knows that for a fact. Our red line of refugees is basically the 350,000 who are living in 
defaultLebanon
default, but not all of them would like to go back to their original homes, as you know. The options are as follows. First is returning to their original homes in what we call today 
defaultIsrael
default; the second is returning to the state of 
defaultPalestine
default. Third is naturalisation in host countries, and many of them have been naturalised. For example, our refugees in 
defaultJordan
default hold Jordanian citizenship. In 
defaultSyria
default, they hold Syrian identity cards. They have been naturalised in many countries, such as 
defaultCanada
default and 
defaultAmerica
default, but not 
defaultLebanon
default. Fourth is resettlement in a third country, such as if they opt to go to 
defaultCanada
default, the 
defaultUK
default or the 
defaultUS
default.
default              
defaultIn addition to all those options, the question of reparations must include restitution of property, which 
defaultIsrael
default is adamantly refusing, and compensation for material and non-material damage that was inflicted as a result of the forcible removal of the Palestinian 
defaultdiaspora
default following the 1948 war. There are solutions to the refugee issues. We should not take that as an impediment for a final settlement.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ20default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default Finally, do you accept that land swaps may be a tool to be used not only in the overall settlement, but also in relation to a right of return?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default I have to be explicit with you: I was the top consultant for the late Faisal 
defaultH
defaultusseini
default, and in the year 2000 when we decided to go to 
defaultCamp David
default it was my team that came up with the idea of land swaps. Land swaps are important, if we first acknowledge that the borders are the 1967 borders. If there are minor rectifications
default 
defaultto be pragmatic—we agreed in Camp David that they should be equal in quality and quantity, consensual and accepted by both sides—land swaps could be a concession on the part of the Palestinians, and they could salvage Israel from getting into a deep confrontation with its own internal population, especially the upcoming war with the Israeli settlers if a decision is taken to dismantle the settlements. So yes, we agreed to land swaps at that time. We are reconsidering the question of land swaps, depending on the outcome of the negotiations.

default              
defaultQ21default 
defaultSandra Osborne:default Can I ask about the human rights situation of the Palestinian people, in relation to non-violence? You have reiterated the PLO position on non-violence, but you have said that under certain circumstances violence is inevitable. The situation in 
defaultGaza
default is dire, as you know, and there is a lack of ability for economic development because of the blockade, etc. Do you think it is right that the tunnels should be destroyed? How do you think the people in 
defaultGaza
default are going to react if the peace talks fail, and do you think that Hamas will abide by a peaceful campaign?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default This needs a long answer.
default              
defaultChair:default I am afraid that you have one minute. 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default First, if there is peace with the Israelis, I think all issues will be resolved; but the opposition is nurtured by conflict and if there is no progress, the opposition could take that as an excuse to perpetuate its presence on the ground. That is what Hamas has been doing. 
default              
defaultWith the situation in 
defaultEgypt
default, the total crushing of the Muslim fundamentalists and all the tunnels being closed, Hamas is now precarious at best. It is in no position to make a political bargain, except accepting that the only way is to reconcile with Fatah and accepting the outcome of the negotiations. Hamas has no other choices. The military option for Hamas is no option at all. By the way, it is not Hamas that is instigating rockets against 
defaultIsrael
default: there are some Islamic jihadists, al-Qaeda members and extreme fundamentalists, which Hamas no longer controls in 
defaultGaza
default. They are the sources of tension now. That is why I say that if there is a breakthrough in the peace process, the situation will change on the ground and people will become more hopeful. 
default              
defaultNobody can control how people react to dire economic conditions. We saw that in the first and second intifadas. It was not political frustration that led to the intifadas, but the dire economic conditions. Now, with a package deal of $4 billion—the PLO has been investing almost half its budget in Gaza—and with a political process coming to fruition with the Israelis, with pressure put on by the United States, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel. 
default              
defaultBut I am not that optimistic, looking at the situation on the ground and trying to see, through leakage, what is going on in the negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis. There are no signs for us to be hopeful yet. We are emphasising that the peace process is the only way out, that there will never be a military solution to the conflict and that we have to exert all our strenuous efforts to make the peace process a success, but not at the expense of giving up our legitimate rights.

defaultChair:default Professor 
defaultHassassian
default, thank you very much indeed. 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultHassassiandefault:default Thank you, sir. It is my pleasure. 
default              
defaultChair:default Our time is up, but you can probably sense that the Committee is holding itself back, as indeed you have been. We could have gone on for at least another hour. Thank you very much indeed. We look forward to maintaining our contact with you.
default&#xa0;defaultExamination of WitnessdefaultWitness: 
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault, defaultIsraeli Ambassador to the 
defaultUK
default,
default gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ22default 
defaultChair:default We continue with our second witness. I am delighted to welcome His Excellency Daniel 
defaultTaub
default, the Israeli ambassador to 
defaultLondon
default. You have been the ambassador here since 2011, and we have enjoyed our contact with you. I am delighted that you can appear here publicly to take our questions
default 
defaulttoday. We have 35 minutes and we have a lot of questions. Is there anything that you would like to say by way of an opening remark?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default First, thank you very much for having me. It is a pleasure to be here. Perhaps I will make a couple of very brief opening comments.
default              
defaultAnyone who thinks about our region at the moment, and through the two years that I have been here, has to approach it with a fair amount of humility, and we need humility at a number of different levels. We have been taught again and again how much we can actually know about what is going on in the countries of the region, how much we can actually analyse what it is that we know and, most of all, how much we can actually influence our neighbouring countries, which are going through a period of upheaval such that you would probably have to go back more than 100 years to find anything remotely similar. But even during this period, when things are playing themselves out and we are finding that the old order in many of these countries is both more fragile and more resistant or resilient than we imagined, there are one or two insights that might help us when we come closer to home.
default              
defaultIf I had to point out just two of them, the first is that when it comes to 
defaultIsrael
default’s conflict, particularly with our Palestinian neighbours, we need to resolve it because we need to resolve it, but we should not delude ourselves that resolving our conflict will be the core of resolving all of the issues in the 
defaultMiddle East
default. For many years, that has been a dogma for a lot of people approaching our region. We have enough on our shoulders as it is.
default              
defaultThe second thing is that if we look at all the different conflicts in our region, one of the things they have in common is that hardly any of them are territorial. They are ideological, tribal, generational, but not territorial. That invites us to look a little more closely at the conflict that we are involved in to see whether it is simply a territorial conflict. 
default              
defaultClearly, our conflict has a territorial dimension, and clearly a territorial compromise will be a part of any solution, but I think that it is a mistake to imagine that simply addressing territorial dimensions will actually resolve a conflict. I think one of the things that Israelis have realised is that we are talking about a conflict with roots that run much deeper—in some quarters, we are talking about a simple, fundamental opposition to the idea of the Jewish people having a homeland in this part of the world. Unless we address that, it will be very difficult to achieve a lasting solution. Those are my opening remarks. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ23default 
defaultChair:default Thank you, ambassador. Can I point out that we have half an hour and a lot of questions, so brevity in answers would be appreciated? As far as the current negotiations are concerned, John Kerry said there was a sense of urgency about this. Do you think this is the last-chance saloon for a two-state solution?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default We certainly agree that there is urgency and a desire for peace. If you look at the Israeli public, you will see something very interesting. The statistics show that, today in 
defaultIsrael
default, you have a larger majority that supports significant, generous concessions for peace—territorial concessions—to create a two-state solution than ever before in the history of the state of 
defaultIsrael
default. And yet the same statistics show that the Israeli public is more sceptical about the chances of reaching that peace than it has been at any time over the past 65 years. 
default              
defaultI think there are two reasons for that. The first reason is that we are talking about a public which has tragically been burned. It has seen twice, over the past decade, territory handed over to neighbours in an attempt to reach peace or stability with them and in both cases we have 
defaultseen the territory that was given back—whether in south 
defaultLebanon
default or 
defaultGaza
default—turning into launching pads for thousands of missiles that have been fired into the heart of 
defaultIsrael
default. Yesterday we saw the surprising, shocking spectacle at the funeral of Ariel Sharon, who pulled 9,000 Israelis out of 
defaultGaza
default, of missiles being fired from the areas that he pulled out of. This is something that Israelis are aware of: the danger that the area that we pull out of will not be a force for peace, but a basis for continuing the conflict. 
default              
defaultThe second reason, I think, why Israelis are sceptical, unfortunately, is that at the moment it does not seem like we are working with a partner that is able or prepared to grapple with the real nub of the conflict. To have a statement by President 
defaultAbbas
default this week that continues, 65 years later, still to reject the partition resolution that talks about a Jewish state and a Palestinian state; to insist on what is called a right of return for Palestinian refugees, which would be the end of the two-state solution—those are the reasons why Israelis, unfortunately, are sceptical at the moment. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ24default 
defaultChair:default What would be the implications if the negotiations do not succeed?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default The focus of our attention at the moment is to do everything we possibly can in order to make them succeed. In fact, that is the reason why we are doing things today which previously would have been considered impossible or unconscionable for Israelis. You are talking to me at a time when 
defaultIsrael
default has just released the third tranche of brutal murderers. There are no other words for it: these are people who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment because they had deliberately killed innocent women and children and men, and they are being released into a society where the families of the victims are witnessing them go free, expressing no regret for their actions. 
default              
defaultThe only reason why 
defaultIsrael
default is doing that is that we realise that we need to give this particular round of negotiations everything that we possibly can. Our partner has said that that is what is necessary for them to stay at the negotiating table. If that is the case, as painful as it is, that is what we are prepared to do. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ25default 
defaultSir John Stanley:default Ambassador, how satisfied—or not—is the Israeli Government with the role and policies that have been pursued by the British Government in trying to get meaningful discussions under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians? 
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default First of all, thank you, Sir John, for the question. We are enormously appreciative of all the support that has been given to the current process. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, has spoken very highly of, and been very supportive of, John Kerry in getting the negotiations on track. 
default              
defaultHaving said that, there are a number of things that could be done that might help to contribute to making negotiations more effective. One is that there is a need to keep the centre of gravity at the negotiation table. One of the things that is most damaging to the negotiations is the sense that there is a magnetic attraction away from them. For example, one of the things that is very problematic for the negotiations is the sense that the Palestinians constantly have one eye on either the United Nations or other international organisations as an alternative track to try to get political achievements. 
default              
defaultThe fact is that there have been decades of resolutions against 
defaultIsrael
default in the United Nations, and they have not changed the situation on the ground for Palestinians. What has changed the situation on the ground for Palestinians are a few short years of negotiations that resulted in a situation where 98% of Palestinians voted for a Palestinian council that they elected themselves. If we are going to get further down that track we have to keep the centre of gravity at the negotiating table, which is why resolutions, initiatives and international organisations, in our view, probably play a counter-productive role in moving us forward. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ26default 
defaultSir John Stanley:default Do you think that the British Government have been as proactive as the Israeli Government would have wished in trying to get a meaningful negotiation under way?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default The British Government have made a number of different contributions. At the moment, they have made it quite clear that their view is that the initiative is being spearheaded by the 
defaultUnited States
default and they are playing a supporting role as far as that is concerned. We have also noted that thought is now being given within 
defaultEurope
default to ways of incentivising peace for the parties. We think that is very important, in order to try to paint a very clear picture for the peoples of the region of what a post-peace future could look like for them and to try to incentivise peace in that way. Those are positive directions. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ27default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Ambassador, you have said that, despite the scepticism and the experience of the past years, the Israeli Government decided last year to go back to the negotiating table. What was the specific reason why 
defaultIsrael
default went back? 
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default It may sound banal, but we went back because we want peace. The fact is that if you think about Israeli society, we are talking about a society that is paying a price for not having peace on a daily basis. Last year, we had 1,277 terrorist attacks or attempted attacks in the West Bank alone—that is not even talking about the vast number of missiles that have been fired from the Gaza strip, the tunnels that we have discovered going from the Gaza strip under Israel in an attempt to blow up Israeli villages or kidnap soldiers, and so on. We are talking about a society where every young man and woman has to serve three or two years of army service and then a month a year of army reserve duty. We are talking about a situation where if you simply look economically, the benefits of the synergy between an Israeli economy and a Palestinian economy that were working in peace next to each other would be enormous. There are clear and obvious benefits of peace, and those are things that we would very much like to achieve. 
default              
defaultHaving said that, we are doing it with a great deal of concern at the moment. We are doing it in a region where on every border we see signs of either current instability or potential instability. In that situation, we need to be very careful that when we do reach an agreement, it will be an agreement that enhances 
defaultIsrael
default’s security and does not reduce it. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ28default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Can I ask about one of those neighbours—not a direct one, but one that is not far away—
defaultIran
default? Is it more important for 
defaultIsrael
default, as a security priority, to get an agreement with the Palestinians, or to have your concerns taken into account with regard to what is happening with 
defaultIran
default?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I don’t think anyone is offering us a choice between the two. We are talking about a situation where 
defaultIran
default is a strategic threat, not just to 
defaultIsrael
default but to the entire region and further afield, of an order that it is hard to imagine anything else that comes close. If we are talking about the most radical regime getting hold of the most radical weapons, what that would mean in terms of Iranian hegemony and in terms of an Arab nuclear arms race throughout the Middle East, what that would mean in terms of the empowerment of Iran’s terrorist proxies whom we already see are the most nefarious influences throughout the region, then the impact and dangers there are very clear indeed.
default              
defaultWhat is clear is that if we were able to address the Iranian nuclear aspirations effectively, that would be a significant setback for many of the elements in the region that are very destructive and obstacles for peace. The only connection that I might point out is that with all the complexity that we see at the moment, the fact is that when we think about Iran and its proxies and the radical axis that runs from Tehran, through Damascus to Beirut and perhaps even on to Gaza, it makes us realise that there is actually a profound commonality of interest between Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan and maybe the Gulf states. If we can hold fast to the realisation that we have fundamental strategic interests in common, that could actually be a help in moving us forwards towards a peaceful arrangement.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ29default 
defaultMike Gapes:default So there is a relationship between your security concerns about 
defaultIran
default and the 
defaultMiddle East
default peace process?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I think all these things are related, but those are particularly related because we have 
defaultIran
default deliberately playing an extremely negative role in training, supporting and funding the fundamentalist organisations and elements that have tried to destroy prospects for peace in the region. That is a fact.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ30default 
defaultMr Baron:default Ambassador, welcome. Can I press you on the areas of disagreement between yourselves and the Palestinians? You hinted—and it makes absolute sense—that it is in your interests as well as that of the Palestinians that the peace process progresses, particularly with regard to the wider security of Israel within the Middle East. We heard earlier from Professor 
defaultHassassian
default that when it comes to negotiations, the Israelis only really seem keen to focus on borders and security, and not to address some of the other substantive issues, whether it is the division of 
defaultJerusalem
default, Palestinian refugees, the settlements and so on. What would you say to that, and can you give us an outline of your position on those other issues, other than borders and security?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default First, I don’t think it is my job to give you details of 
defaultIsrael
default’s positions inside the negotiating room at the moment. One of the most effective aspects of the current negotiations is how little is actually being leaked from the room. It is something of a precedent and is one of the things that actually gives us hope that things may be moving differently this time round. 
default              
defaultI certainly don’t think it is the case that 
defaultIsrael
default is only talking about or only showing flexibility on these issues. The fact is, we have had quite a number of negotiation processes, and I have had the opportunity to be involved in many of them, where 
defaultIsrael
default has gone into considerable detail on all issues, including those you have mentioned. Sadly, repeatedly, even 
defaultwhen 
defaultIsrael
default has surprised the international community with the generosity of its proposals, whether it was by Prime Minister 
defaultOlmert
default or Prime Minister Barak, it has not been met with a forthcoming response, or in some cases any response at all, by the Palestinian side.
default              
defaultI do think that security is important even to enable us to deal with some of the issues that the Palestinians want us to deal with. I say this as a negotiator: it is not possible to talk about territorial issues without addressing the security issues in some way, because what you are able to do in relation to territory very much depends on whether you have a presence, a protective force or some other kind of arrangement in another area, and you simply cannot talk about one thing in the absence of another. That is one of the reasons why we think that all the issues must be on the table.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ31default 
defaultMr Baron:default May I follow that up, Ambassador? One wouldn’t want to know, and one respects the confidentiality of the negotiations. However, can I push you on one issue that is in the public domain—the 
defaultJordan
default valley? I think it is common knowledge that 
defaultIsrael
default would like to maintain a presence in the 
defaultJordan
default valley. The Palestinian Authority has objected to that and has talked about, at least, an international presence. I know that it is a contentious issue from your point of view, but 
defaultIsrael
default’s occupation of the West Bank, 
defaultGaza
default and east 
defaultJerusalem
default is believed to be illegal under international law. I don’t want to go there, but isn’t adding in the 
defaultJordan
default valley adding in an obstacle to progress in the peace process?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default The simplest way to answer that is that we want peace, primarily, for our children, but it is not going to be any good unless it lasts for our grandchildren. We are trying to think of a peace that will be sustainable. If we try to think realistically about how to ensure a modicum of security for the state of 
defaultIsrael
default and, actually, for the Palestinian entity itself, it is very hard for us to imagine how that will happen without some form of security presence in the 
defaultJordan
default valley. That was one of the reasons why, in the past, for many years 
defaultIsrael
default thought that it could not accept the idea of a Palestinian state altogether.
default              
defaultOver the past decade or two, 
defaultIsrael
default’s positions have moderated considerably, in a way in which, interestingly, Palestinian positions have not. The fact is that today we have the establishment of a Palestinian state as being part of the Government’s manifesto. Having said that, that cannot be done at the expense of ensuring a line of security and defence that will prevent jihadist and other extremist elements being invited into Jordan and coming across into Israel.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ32default 
defaultMr Baron:default Can I press you on that very briefly, Ambassador? The 
defaultJordan
default valley has become an obstacle, rather than just an issue, only relatively recently, certainly from the point of view of the public ether. Can you understand the frustration of those sitting on the other side of the table? There are enough obstacles to a peace process as it is, yet this seems to be an additional one that has been introduced relatively recently.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I actually don’t think this is a new issue. 
defaultIsrael
default’s position on the issue has been long-standing; I think what is new is the Palestinian recalcitrance on the issue, genuinely. In fact, without going into too much detail, it is also fair to say that, even while the threats have increased, Israeli demands for a security presence along the 
defaultJordan
default valley have become more focused and narrower than they have been in most previous rounds of 
defaultnegotiations. I think you will find that, in the face of genuine security threats, 
defaultIsrael
default is asking for something far more focused, far less intrusive and far less troubling to the establishment of a viable, sovereign, independent Palestinian state. At the end of the day, however, that is something that is going to be necessary.
default              
defaultUnless we have some sort of security, for both 
defaultIsrael
default and 
defaultPalestine
default—
defaultIsrael
default has considered options regarding international forces. I have to say that the record of international forces in our region has been rather mixed. There is a phrase that Israelis sometimes use: “an umbrella which melts in the rain.” That phrase sometimes comes to mind when one describes the record of international forces when push comes to shove. Israel has never asked anybody else to defend its citizens, but if we are going to move towards a situation in which Israel will have a narrow waist—where there will be a significant territorial withdrawal—there needs to be some basic elements to try to ensure that what has happened in Gaza and south Lebanon, and what is even beginning to happen in Sinai, does not happen in large areas of land that are close to the centre of the Israeli population.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ33default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default A moment or two ago, Ambassador, I interpreted you as expressing some optimism, heavily qualified, about the possible outcome of an agreement with 
defaultIran
default. However, it seems to me that that is in quite sharp contrast to the dismissive approach taken by Mr Netanyahu when it came to the recent agreement brokered by John Kerry and others.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default Okay. I don’t want to deny it, but can I just ask what I said that made you think I was optimistic about an agreement?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ34default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default My understanding was that you were pointing to possible benefits if the 
defaultIran
default question could be resolved. I think I am right about that.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I think that’s absolutely true, yes. I think so, if we could resolve it.
default              
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ35default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default And you did so, if I may say so, with qualified optimism.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default Sure.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ36default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default That seems to be rather different from the rather dismissive attitude that Mr Netanyahu took in relation to the agreement recently brokered by John Kerry and others.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I think that within 
defaultIsrael
default there was very broad consensus about concern about the interim agreement that was brokered by John Kerry. The general feeling was that this is an agreement that in terms of preventing Iranian ambitions was not restrictive enough and did not stop any one of the current centrifuges from carrying on spinning. It did not 
defaultstop the 
defaultweaponisation
default programme and it did not stop the R and D programmes, and so on and so forth. The hints in the interim agreement as to what might be the parameters of a permanent agreement were also very worrying. I think the concerns are genuinely widely felt. 
default              
defaultHaving said that, we are now working very closely with the 
defaultUnited States
default, and we are also in close dialogue with the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default. We are trying to make sure the final agreement, when it is reached, will be an effective way of resolving the issue. At the end of the day, our goals are joint goals, but I don’t think it is a secret that there have been some differences along the way as to what the arrangements are that will help us to achieve those goals.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ37default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default But if any final agreement is to be reached, it needed a temporary, interim agreement, albeit one that 
defaultIsrael
default finds unacceptable. It is only one step along the road, isn’t it?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default That is certainly the position that has been presented to us by some of our close friends. 
defaultIsrael
default is concerned that at the end of the six-month period, whenever it starts, we may find ourselves in a situation where 
defaultIran
default is not further away from but is closer to being a nuclear weapon state. Obviously, that is a cause of great concern for us.
default              
defaultThere are a number of reasons why we see this differently. One of them, if I put it simply, is that here, although there is genuine concern about Iran, it seems to focus on what Iran might do in future if it becomes a nuclear weapon state. That is of course of major concern to us, but where we sit in our region we see not just what Iran might do in the future, but what it is doing today on a daily basis. There is simply not a day when our security forces, our armed services, our kids and our diplomats—without going into too much detail—are not dealing with the results of an Iranian war against the state of 
defaultIsrael
default. That is continual on a day-to-day basis, and focuses our attention on the need for a very robust agreement to make sure that 
defaultIran
default’s ambitions cannot be fulfilled.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ38default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Mr 
defaultTaub
default, many would say that the Jewish state proposal would ignore the history of and probably undermine the rights of Muslim and Christian Arabs who are Israeli citizens. What place is there for the 20% of Israeli citizens who are not Jewish, and why is this being introduced into the negotiations at this time?
default              
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default Thank you for the question. It has not been introduced into the negotiations at this time. The notion that we are going to resolve this conflict by having a Jewish state and an Arab state next to each other goes back almost as far as the conflict. The fact is that that was the language of the UN partition resolution in 1947 and almost every other initiative to try to resolve it. You are absolutely right that the fact that a state is a homeland for the Jewish people cannot and should not prejudice in any way the rights of the 20% of citizens in 
defaultIsrael
default who are not Jewish. That is why we have full equality under the law and Members of Parliament who are Christian and Muslim. In my embassy here—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ39default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default So why do you say it is a Jewish state?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I don’t think there is a country in our region that does not have a definition of being a Muslim state, an Arab state, an Islamic state and so on. I wish we could see in those states freedoms for their minorities. The most important thing here—and the reason why it is so upsetting to Israel—is that we must recognise that the Palestinians have not only not recognised the fact that the Jewish people have a right to a homeland, they have been actively denying it. 
default              
defaultThis may relate to Sir John’s question about what 
defaultBritain
default could perhaps do to help in the Palestinian context. I have spent quite a lot of time working with Palestinians on their school books and their children’s television, and so on. There is a degree of rewriting history, incitement, indoctrination and glorification of what is called martyrdom, but is effectively suicide terrorism, which to my mind really borders on child abuse because children are being deprived of access to their history and a proper education. Part of that is simply denying, in a preposterous way, any Jewish connection to Islam at all.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ40default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Mr 
defaultTaub
default, if you want the Palestinians to recognise an Israeli state, it would be a good start if you recognised a Palestinian state. The chance of their recognising Jewish state might come afterwards. Is this not putting the cart before the horse?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default No, quite the opposite. The fact is that, at the moment, between the two sides the only side that actually recognises the state of the other is 
defaultIsrael
default. Every single Prime Minister of Israel for close to two decades has talked about the right of Palestinians to a Palestinian state. Sadly, we are still waiting for the first Palestinian leader to recognise the right of a Jewish state. Only when we both do that will we be able to move forward.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ41default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default How do you think it helps the establishment of a Palestinian state, because that is obviously what the endgame should be, when the construction of settlements in the Occupied Territories has been unabated since the 1967 six-day war, with an international view that the territories are occupied illegally? Why is 
defaultIsrael
default pursuing settlement expansion at a time when we are supposed to be talking about a peace process?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default First of all, of course, it is not unabated. I can think, very significantly, of a period of time when, in response to President—
default              
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Why hasn’t it stopped full stop?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault—when, in response to President 
defaultAbbas
default’s
default request, Prime Minister 
defaultNetanyahu
default did stop settlement building and it turned out that that did not help to keep President 
defaultAbbas
default at the negotiating table. I think that there is a need for a certain element of perspective here. The fact is that, within the 
defaultWest Bank
default, the entire quantity of territory that is taken up by Israeli settlements is less than 2%.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ42default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default There are half a million Israeli settlers.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default It is less than 2%. We are talking about a situation where 
defaultIsrael
default has not only had periods of freezing settlements but has uprooted them. From 
defaultGaza
default, we 
defaultpulled out 9,000 Israeli settlers, and we also pulled out settlers from settlements in the 
defaultWest Bank
default—
default              
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default What about international law? Do you not recognise international law?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault—and in those places where we did pull settlers out, unfortunately, as I mentioned before, we have seen those areas turning into launching pads for Iranian-backed weaponry.
default              
defaultThe goal at the moment has to be not sending a message to Israelis that large parts of their population, or significant parts of their population, are disfranchised but quite the opposite: how do we create an environment where, once and for all, we and the Palestinians can reach an agreement that will render the issue of settlements, like so many other issues, obsolete because we have two states living side by side and working and co-operating together?
default              
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default How can you have proper negotiations—
default              
defaultChair:default Order. I call Frank Roy.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ43default 
defaultMr Roy:default Ambassador, last month the EU outlined a clear offer of support to both sides in the event of a settlement. What is 
defaultIsrael
default’s reaction to that offer of support?
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default As I mentioned before, the offer of support is very important. I think the whole process of incentivising peace and making people realise that peace is possible is very important. There are two elements that I would highlight. First, when you are offering support, no party in the 
defaultMiddle East
default is monolithic. One of the questions that you need to ask yourselves is “Who are we strengthening and who are we weakening in the way that we provide this support?” One of the areas where there has been improvement, although it could be that additional improvement is required, is that in the past aid, support and funds have gone to those aspects of Palestinian society that are not the most peace minded and are not the ones that are trying to reach out and accommodate but that, in many cases, have actually tried to subvert the chances for peace.
default              
defaultThe other point I would make is slightly more general. I think that 
defaultBritain
default and the international community, and we Israelis as well, probably need to change the way that we talk about peace. In an extraordinarily complicated arena, we talk about peace in our corner as though it turns out to be a rather simplistic approach and a rather utopian ideal. The fact is that that is not the case. The fact is that, when peace comes, it is going to be a very complicated peace. If I look at peace resolutions that have taken place in the modern era around the world—in 
defaultCyprus
default, in former 
defaultYugoslavia
default and so on—they have been complicated and messy agreements. I went with one of my Palestinian counterparts in the negotiations to see the situation in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, so many years after the Good Friday agreement. What was most inspiring to us was not seeing how easy it was to make peace, but seeing how hard it was to make peace and how hard it was to keep it alive. In a very profound way, it made this peace seem realistic to us. It made it seem tangible to us. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ44default 
defaultMr Roy:default Ambassador, on that same analogy, surely it was right for the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default to offer support at a grass-roots level. If it was, surely it is right for the EU to offer that very same support at a very grass-roots level.
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default I think support is very important. You need to have peace from the top down, you need to have peace from the bottom up and you need to have peace from the outside in. You need to have your neighbours being supportive of peace. The only point I am making is that when you have grass-roots support, you need to make sure that it is grass-roots support for peace and not grass-roots elements that are trying to undermine peace. 
default              
defaultTo return to the final point I was making, when we talk about peace we need to be honest. We need to send a message to Israelis and Palestinians that we recognise that peace is not going to solve all their problems. Peace is really exchanging one set of problems for a different set of problems; they are just a much better set of problems. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ45default 
defaultChair:default The Arab peace initiative—as you know, it has been on the table for over 10 years, but 
defaultIsrael
default does not accept it. Is there any reason for that? 
default              
default              
defaultHis Excellency Daniel defaultTaubdefault:default We should start by recognising that the Arab peace initiative is a significant step forward from where the Arab League was in 1967 when we saw what were called the three “
defaultnos
default” of 
defaultKhartoum
default: no to peace, no to recognition and no to negotiation. Here we have a document that talks about the possibility of genuine, normal relations between 
defaultIsrael
default and its neighbours, and I think that is a significant step forward. Having said that, it is not really a basis for negotiations. It is a document that sets out what the Arab League think that the results of the negotiation should be on a series of issues, and, obviously, 
defaultIsrael
default has a number of problems with the Arab League dictates.
default              
defaultI would say, picking up from Frank’s question, that there is another issue in relation to the Arab League document proposal that I see with a certain amount of disappointment. According to the document, no normalisation between Arab states and 
defaultIsrael
default can take place until every conflict that 
defaultIsrael
default is involved in—between 
defaultIsrael
default and the Palestinians, between 
defaultIsrael
default and 
defaultSyria
default, and so on and so forth—has been resolved in its entirety. If we are talking about the potential for creating an environment in which the difficult decisions can be made, we are going to need some outside influence, and a process of gradually normalising relations between 
defaultIsrael
default and the Palestinian states is one of the elements that can contribute to that. To have the states of the Arab League saying, “We are not prepared to play this role; we are simply going to sit on the sidelines until somehow or other all the problems have been resolved,” is unfortunate. It takes out of the mix an element that could actually be very constructive. 
default              
defaultChair:default That is very helpful, thank you. May I thank you very much indeed, ambassador, for your time? It is time to move on to our next witnesses. We enjoy the regular contact that we have with you, and we look forward to its continuing in the future.

default              
defaultQ46default 
defaultChair:default May I welcome our third set of witnesses? We have Professor Rosemary Hollis, from 
defaultCity
default 
defaultUniversity
default, 
defaultLondon
default, Dr 
defaultAhron
default 
defaultBregman
default, from King’s College, 
defaultLondon
default, and Professor 
defaultYezid
default 
defaultSayigh
default, from the Carnegie Endowment’s Middle East Centre of Beirut. I thank you all very much indeed for finding the time to come and talk to us today. It is much appreciated. On an administrative note, I am told that there may be a vote at any second. Unfortunately, we would have to suspend the sitting for 12 minutes while we do that. 
default              
defaultMay I open the batting by taking soundings from you on how you see the current negotiations going? Dr 
defaultBregman
default, would you like to start?
default              defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default We do not know much about the negotiation. Kerry is very tough and determined and we are waiting to see what he is going to tell us. If he succeeds and puts a plan on the table, it will be a general one, with principles. If there is some progress, the secularists will probably be very unhappy about it. If it fails, the Palestinians will be very frustrated, so it is not going to be very optimistic. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ47default 
defaultChair:default What do you think the implications of failure are?
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default There might be war. The Palestinians might embark on the third intifada. I think that it has already started. I think the historians, looking back, will say that the third Palestinian intifada started in 2012, 2013. It is different. It is not the first intifada, which was quite organised, and it is not the second intifada, which involved suicide bombers, but there are random, sporadic attacks in the 
defaultOccupied
default 
defaultTerritories
default and in 
defaultIsrael
default proper. If the negotiations fail, they might embark on the third intifada. They are very careful, because the man who was buried yesterday—Ariel Sharon—taught them a very harsh lesson in 2012, turning the West Bank into middle-eastern 
defaultDresden
default. So they are very careful, but they are also very frustrated and they might do something. 
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default I thought it was instructive that the Israeli ambassador said earlier, “Be careful not to get too excited about any peace.” My position is that if the Kerry initiative produces a deal, an awful lot of Palestinians will perceive it as a stitch-up. They will not be celebrating peace. They will, in a sense, be feeling rather grim and humiliated that they have had to capitulate to something that they cannot be proud of and that will not end the conflict for refugees around the region. On the Israeli side, my perception is that, whereas once there was a conscience among most Israelis that they did not want to be party to an occupation and to the suppression of other people’s rights, I sense now that it is more common to find an attitude that simply says, “The Jews historically have had the most appalling treatment. Life is not fair. You guys get used to it.”
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default I guess a lot depends on just what is in any framework agreement or deal, if there is one. A lot also depends on just what the 
defaultUnited States
default in particular, and to a significant degree the EU, and in general the 
defaultUK
default, provide in the form of political oversight for the implementation, and on what sort of substance they give the whole process. That means that if there is just enough in a framework agreement, even if it is overall a modest package that is backed by the political will to see the process through—we have not see that sort of will before, so I am already casting some doubt—there is some hope of going forward with that in the West Bank, although not necessarily in Gaza. 
default              
defaultHowever, I am not hopeful that we will start seeing that sort of political leadership from the EU
default 
defaultor the 
defaultUnited States
default in particular. I do not see any signs of that. I do not see why we should expect a package to come out of whatever secret talks are going on that would somehow produce outcomes that will differ
default 
defaultfundamentally from what we have seen in the past. Whether that leads to what my colleague and friend Dr 
defaultBregman
default just referred to as a third intifada, I am equally doubtful. There is a high level of cynicism and fatigue among Palestinians over a number of different issues, including their own divisions, which means that the scope for mass mobilisation and confrontation is not very high. That leaves us pretty much where we are today, which is not great.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ48default 
defaultSir John Stanley:default May I ask all three of you—briefly, in the interests of time—to give us your assessment of the performance of the British Government, bearing in mind our long historical presence in the region since the end of the Ottoman empire and our P5 membership? What is your assessment of the British Government’s performance in trying to get meaningful negotiations under way between the Palestinians and the Israelis?
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default I think it is an American affair; they will lead it. The British could help by providing incentives to the parties, for example. The Israelis are now reluctant to give up on the 
defaultJordan
default 
defaultValley
default for what they describe as security reasons. The British can say, “We will help you to protect the border from the Jordanian side of the river. We know the Jordanians and we will work with the Americans to help you there.” The Israelis would also like to see a deal that is bigger than an Israeli-Palestinian deal. Perhaps you can help to mobilise other Arab countries in the 
defaultMiddle East
default to support the Palestinians. Some of the issues are not in the hands of the Palestinian leadership. Abu 
defaultMazen
default cannot give up on 
defaultJerusalem
default. He needs the support of 
defaultSaudi Arabia
default, for example, and other nations. Here the international community can help by mobilising other member states.
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default Historically, the British have never made a priority of a Palestinian state. In so far as they were quite vigorous about Palestinian rights for a period in the mid-20th century, it had to do with the perspective of a number of people at the Foreign Office. I would say that the most logical position that the British came up with, which they were driving inside the EU up until the beginning of the Blair Government, was to be careful about how you make a peace deal. If it utterly ignores international law and gives the Palestinians the absolute minimum, it is likely not to be a good peace. In other words, the more land, the more peace. The more that this is something that can be celebrated, the more it will last. The more that it is stingy, non-liberating, certainly not sovereign and certainly barely contiguous and so on, the less it is a sustainable peace.
default              
defaultNow, as of the Blair Governments, the British have essentially recognised that there is not a great deal that they can do. They defer to the Americans. The British position, up until John Kerry’s initiative, was essentially: “The parties must talk to each other directly. That will sort it, and the only player that can make them do that is the Americans”. So, it is playing second fiddle to the Americans; it is not really feeling any sense of agency or even any sense of vision of to what would work better as opposed to worse.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default I would agree with what Dr Hollis has just said. I will take one instance where I think Her Majesty’s Government could have done something differently. This was about a year and a half ago, when the Palestinians went to the United Nations—not the first time, when they went to the Security Council, but the second time, when they went to the 
defaultGeneral Assembly—for the request to become a non-member state. The Europeans were allowed a free vote, and most European countries voted in favour. A few abstained, one of them being, of course, the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default.
default              
defaultThat was an instance when the 
defaultUK
default could have delivered a different kind of political message—one that, frankly, would have had very little material impact on the ground, but which would have been very important demonstratively. It would have said: “We are unquestionably committed to Palestinian statehood”. This was going to be non-member status—it was bound and limited and was going to pass anyway, and other Europeans took that step. That is one little example of where the British did not need to be in the lead—they could still have followed the Americans in terms of process—but where the United Kingdom could have done something that politically was significant. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ49default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default I absolutely agree on that last point. I regret that the British Government at the time took that position. 
default              
defaultDoes the panel believe that Britain’s strength is through its membership of the European Union and the line that the European Union is taking, albeit one more disposed towards development and trade; or do we have a role, as you say Professor 
defaultSayigh
default, in perhaps differentiating ourselves a bit more from the United States, so that we could apply more pressure and not just look as though we are falling into line with those views all the time?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default I am glad you brought up the issue of the European Union. One of the positive tools that has been available for some time to the EU as a whole, as well as to member states, has been the trade association with 
defaultIsrael
default. The terms within that referred specifically to produce of the settlements—how it had to be marked differently and so on—and there were penalties attached. It took various Palestinian and non-Palestinian activists, lobby groups and the rest a very long time to get the EU to actually act on even these very minimum provisions.
default              
defaultAgain, these were maybe more symbolic than anything else, but they were still available tools that had already been established and did not require a new political fight and more political capital in order to enact, because they were there. The 
defaultUK
default can play a particular role—whether in bilateral relations, applying similar types of distinctions between the produce of 
defaultIsrael
default versus the produce of settlements, for instance—while also being much more proactive in the European context, not following the rest so much as taking more of a lead there.
default              
defaultAgain, I am trying to emphasise relatively modest instruments that are already available and where the model is already there. These do not require a fundamental shift in political strategy or a rethinking of relations, either with 
defaultIsrael
default or the United States Administration. They have been established; it is not a new fight to engage in.
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default I notice a different mood in the European Union and a determination, if the Kerry initiative does not work, to get tougher on Israel; yet I also see a determination on the part of Israel to be less dependent on Europe as a market, to be less exposed to criticism and pressure from the European Union and instead to develop markets and opportunities in Russia, China, Latin America and Mexico. These are places where they do not anticipate that they will get pressure about the human rights of the Palestinians. So I think that the horse has bolted; this 
defaultis closing the stable doors. The moment for the European Union to have made a significant difference has passed.
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default I would make one more point. I think it is very important to distinguish, as 
defaultYezid
default mentioned, between, for example, products coming from the 
defaultOccupied
default 
defaultTerritories
default and 
defaultIsrael
default. If you decide to go down this path of boycotting—which is a quiet movement I can see also in the 
defaultUnited States
default—then you should distinguish between the settlements and 
defaultIsrael
default. It is very important to do that, and it is not always done. I hear about boycotts on Israel; I would say boycott the settlements if you think that it is illegal—don’t eat their cucumbers if you think that it is illegal—but eat the cucumbers that are produced in Israel proper. Don’t say it is a boycott of 
defaultIsrael
default; say it is a boycott of the settlements.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default If I may clarify: what is already in EU legislation is not a boycott of Israeli settlement products; it is simply labelling, so that people can make informed choices when they go to the supermarket at Sainsbury’s or Tesco or wherever.
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default Also through customs.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default Yes, exactly.

default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ50default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Can I ask you what your perception is of the internal pressures within the Palestinian Authority during the negotiations? If there is an agreement, will the Palestinian Authority be able to deliver that agreement? How will Hamas react?
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default I can say from an Israeli point of view that there is very little trust. The basic view in 
defaultIsrael
default, as you heard from the ambassador, is to sit tight and do nothing now, especially with the 
defaultMiddle East
default shifting and moving and so on. That is the basic instinct: “We have got the tangibles. We don’t want to give them now, especially not to Abu 
defaultMazen
default, whom we do not trust to be able to deliver the goods in terms of security, for example.” That is the Israeli view as I can see it in 
defaultIsrael
default now.
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default Professor 
defaultSayigh
default is the expert here, but I would say that my observation is that the rift between Fatah and Hamas at leadership level is utterly destructive and counter-productive to the servicing of Palestinian interests by the leadership. The “ordinary Palestinians” I am in touch with are very disillusioned with their leadership and put no enthusiasm or faith in either faction. They are barely paying attention to the talks initiated by John Kerry because they do not see them producing anything of relevance that they should be interested or excited about. 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default I agree pretty much entirely with that. I will add that in order to reach a meaningful and durable peace deal between Palestinians and 
defaultIsrael
default, it is important that both 
defaultHamas and the Fatah/Palestinian Authority in the 
defaultWest Bank
default can both be brought on board. I will explain briefly why I say that. 
default              
defaultFirst, there is an opportunity. Hamas initially responded to the Arab Spring with a lot of enthusiasm and became over-optimistic. They thought that they and their general position of resistance had been vindicated and that the Arab Spring had brought a number of sympathetic Governments, in 
defaultEgypt
default and beyond, and that they had made it to the shore of safety, as it were. They now feel differently and they are under siege again politically as well as economically. They are starting to have to face up to the fact that their grand strategy and expectations are not very likely to succeed in the foreseeable future. 
default              
defaultAt the same time, something important happened this year. When they had their internal elections, it was widely expected that Khalid 
defaultMeshaal
default—who had been leading the way to position Hamas for negotiations on the basis of a two-state solution with 1967 borders and so on—was on his way out. In fact, he was returned along with a number of other people of his faction, at the expense of some of the more hawkish figures. That suggests that Hamas remains heavily pragmatic. 
default              
defaultI have a concern about any kind of deal that John Kerry produces. On the one hand, as Professor Hollis just said, it is correct that most Palestinians just do not have much faith in their leaders and are too disillusioned to respond much. That does not mean that they have bought in; they might not do anything physical against it for a while. However, is that a peace upon which both Palestinians and Israel can actually build much further, without bringing Gaza—and therefore Hamas—back into the equation? 
default              
defaultSooner or later, we all have to bite that bullet and deal with it. I am making the point that I think Hamas is a party that needs to be brought in. Somehow, in some form, it has to be part of the political dialogue. There is no choice there in my view, if we really want some sort of long-term understanding. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ51default 
defaultMike Gapes:default On the Israeli side, this is a right-wing, or right-of-centre, Government. Mr 
defaultLieberman
default, the Foreign Minister, was here this week, making very clear where he is. I thought he was moderating his position for a British audience. I am interested to know your assessment of whether an agreement would actually be possible with the current Israeli Government, or would the internal compromises be too much? Would they, in effect, have to bring the 
defaultLabor
default party in, so that they get the agreement with another Government? 
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default I think that he will have to change the composition of his coalition, because part of the current coalition—at least one important party—is based on settlers, and they would be very reluctant to vote for any agreement that involves giving up land which they believe belongs to them. But it is only a right-wing Israeli Government that can deliver peace in 
defaultIsrael
default, ironically enough, because the left will always support the right’s peace plans, and on the other hand, the right will never support a 
defaultLabor
default Government offering the West Bank etc. So it is a 
defaultLieberman
default we need; 
defaultNetanyahu
default is a moderate now. We need a right-wing Prime Minister who would be able to carry Israeli people with him. The Israeli nation now—and this is not a criticism but an observation—is a right-wing nation. In 1990-91, thousands of Jews came from 
defaultRussia
default, and most of them, not all of them, are right-wing voters now. Interestingly enough, there is a wave of immigration coming from 
defaultFrance
default now to 
defaultIsrael
default, and they are—most of them—
defaultright-wing Israelis. It is a right-wing nation. People like me—liberal-left—are not really important. We give them the ideas and they implement them.
default              
defaultMr Roy:default Same here.

default              
defaultChair:default You can be liberal-right, you know. 
default              
defaultMike Gapes:default I don’t think we should go there. 
default              
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default That’s the fate of the Liberal Democrats. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ52default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Professor Hollis? 
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default I am concerned. As you may know, with the scholarship programme that I am director of, I am very proud that one of our alumni went on to be the youngest Member of the Knesset, 
defaultStav
default 
defaultShaffir
default, and she made her name, after graduating from City university under the scholarship programme, as leader of the Israeli equivalent of the Occupy movement—the tent city in Rothschild b
defaultoulevard
default—a couple of summers ago. She, as she explained to me and others, absolutely could not make any mention of the Palestinian issue, in order to make her political career. That movement had to appeal to social justice for the middle classes who find the prices too high in 
defaultTel Aviv
default. Only now is that element in the Knesset slowly and cautiously moving towards revealing how much the settlements cost Israeli taxpayers. But contacts such as hers and other alumni who are working for human rights organisations—some of which the Israelis have tried to crack down on and crack down on the foreign funding for—are reporting to me that Israeli schoolchildren and Israeli people in general since 1967 have not had maps in general circulation that show where the green line is. When it is pointed out to them what a settlement based on the green line would be, they become very nervous. This is not something that they think is doable without compromising their security. 
default              
defaultThe “narrow neck of 
defaultIsrael
default” theory has been around in the international observer community for ages. There is ignorance on the other side: ignorance of the issues and what they mean. There is no sense of “giving back land”—it is conceding stuff that belongs to 
defaultIsrael
default, to shut up these people who insist on living in the midst of what 
defaultIsrael
default needs for 
defaultIsrael
default. I feel that what used to be the conversations that you could have about the value of a two-state solution in the 1990s are inconceivable now because of ignorance, lack of contact with the other and fear, uncertainty and absolutely no concept of and no preparation for a positive version of peace.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default Your question usefully makes us think of Israelis, of voters, of ordinary people. I think that since 
defaultIsrael
default is a democracy it is critical for the Israeli public to rethink the incentive structure. In other words, as long as Israelis feel that 
defaultIsrael
default can continue to build settlements and expand and so on—and this has pretty much been the feeling for the past 20 years of the peace process—there has not been a choice to make. Ronnie has referred to the one time we saw evidence. At the start of the 1990s when hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews came to Israel, there was a moment, if you remember, when President George Bush Senior stood up and made the provision of housing loans guarantees to Israel partly contingent on spending on settlements in the Occupied Territories. By contingent, I mean where an amount that the 
defaultUS
default calculated was being spent by the Israeli Government on settlement activity would be deducted from the guarantees. It was a penalty. 
default              
defaultThat came at a moment when these hundreds of thousands of new immigrants needed housing and subsidies and a package, basically, and there was a cost. That created enough of a swing to bring Yitzhak Rabin to power in the next election in June 1992. Ever since then that sort of contingency, that sort of incentive structure has been lost. Israelis today feel that they have access to world markets; they want normalisation as per the Arab peace plan before providing peace—I mean an actual peace deal—and to build settlements. Every time John Kerry goes to 
defaultJerusalem
default, yet another few hundred or few thousand housing units are announced, and there is no cost to pay. Why should an Israeli voter think that this is an issue about which to distinguish between one party and another? I mean, if an Israeli party comes along and says, “We stand on a ‘no more funding of settlements’ ticket”, people would laugh at them. That has pretty much been the fate of the Israeli left, or left of centre. So the question here then becomes, what could the 
defaultUS
default have done, or the EU have done, or what can they do now? Not to penalise 
defaultIsrael
default—I am not talking about punitive sanctions, I am just talking about fixing the incentive structure a little bit. There is a choice and choice means costs and relative costs. 
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default It is against human nature for the Israelis to just give. The minimum that the Palestinians are asking for is such a maximum for the Israelis. You don’t just give up on water and mountains and strategic depth and so on, and therefore there must be pressure. Now I am not saying that pressure on 
defaultIsrael
default needs to be sticks—it could be carrots—but there must be pressure on the Israelis and the Palestinians. Otherwise, you cannot move. Here I agree with 
defaultYezid
default. You must do something—the international community—which is, again, not necessarily sticks, but some incentives that will make the Israelis and the Palestinians want to do something. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ53default 
defaultMr Roy:default What has the Arab Spring meant for the 
defaultMiddle East
default peace process? Has it brought a solution closer or pushed it further away?
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default From an Israeli point of view, the Arab Spring means, “We don’t want to do anything now.” You can hear it. I could hear it when the Israeli ambassador gave his presentation. He said it in his opening words—not in my bold words, but that was the message: “It is all moving, it is all shifting; we don’t want a real peace process now.” That is the Arab Spring from an Israeli point of view. 
default              
defaultIt might be that in the future the Palestinians will look out and say, “Maybe we should do the same in the 
defaultOccupied
default 
defaultTerritories
default. Maybe we should import the Arab Spring to the 
defaultWest Bank
default and do something to put some pressure on the Israelis.” 
defaultYezid
default said that they are tired and exhausted, and I understand that; but—and without encouraging violence; absolutely not—they cannot get a state on a silver platter by going to cocktail parties. In the war of independence, the Israelis lost 1% of their population, and they don’t stop talking about it. To add it to the package of pressures—God forbid, I am not encouraging the Palestinians to send suicide bombers into Israeli restaurants—what a stupid idea—but they could get out of bed tomorrow morning, cover themselves with white sheets and just walk through the streets.
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default You can’t walk through the streets; you can’t walk through the barrier—you have to go through the checkpoints. They do not have places to demonstrate in the major cities, and 
defaultIsrael
default still reserves the right to raid Palestinian houses in the middle of the night if there is someone they want to come and get. We are watching the erosion of self-confidence, self-agency and the sense of hope in a whole population. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Israelis that they cannot trust the other side to deliver, and the other side is a society in slow meltdown.

defaultQ54default 
defaultMr Roy:default But what difference did the Arab Spring make? 
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default With the way the Arab Spring went, the Palestinians were very inspired initially. 
defaultYezid
default has pointed out that they thought it was going to be good news for Hamas, too, that resistance was rewarded with success in overthrowing Governments—there was resistance to the Palestinian Authority. However, the way things have gone and the appalling war in 
defaultSyria
default mean that they cannot even claim to be the biggest victims in the region any more. They are not hurting anything like how the Syrian population is hurting. The sight of fellow Arabs tearing each other to pieces and a regime turning on its own people simply feeds the worst fears of the Palestinians that they are losers, losers, losers. 
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default The Arab Spring tells us something about timing. There was a reason why 
defaultOslo
default could happen when it happened: there was a convergence of Palestinian domestic dynamics, Israeli domestic dynamics—I just mentioned the Russian Jewish votes—the strategic situation of the Gulf war and the end of the Iraqi threat, and the international situation of the end of the cold war. A lot coincided to make it possible to have the Oslo Accords, and we are not in that fortuitous, virtuous convergence today. 
default              
defaultThe Arab Spring, although a good thing in many senses, has sadly taken us further away. The Arab countries in the Middle East are at the start of a long process of social and political transition as a result of everything that has been happening in the past 40 years: massive urbanisation; social transformation; massive state expansion; liberalisation and privatisation, which affect societies on a massive scale; and massive population growth. We are living with something that is going to be with us for a very long time. I don’t see any of the external powers—I am thinking mainly of western ones, of course, although I am not assuming a moral, political or other obligation on their part—able to intervene in pretty much any of these places.
default 
defaultWhat are they to do about 
defaultEgypt
default now that the armed forces have in effect reasserted authoritarian rule, or whatever we want to call it? What do they do about 
defaultSyria
default? What do they do about 
defaultMaliki
default in 
defaultIraq
default?  When you look at what is in front of us, I do not see any outside power or group of powers able to intervene in a sustained and systematic way in any one of these countries. So, to expect any kind of intervention, by which I could mean diplomatic or political—helpful, not adversarial—in 
defaultIsrael
default and 
defaultPalestine
default, I just do not see it happening.
default              
defaultThere was a time when much lesser interventions could have made a bigger difference. I will remind you of just one instance. I am thinking of March 1998: the 
defaultBerlin
default statement, when the EU Council issued a commitment to Palestinian statehood, because the expectation was that the final status negotiations would start the year after. The statement said that unless statehood did result, the EU might reconsider waiting for the outcome of the negotiations and instead go ahead with recognition of statehood. 
default              
defaultWhere are we today, compared with that European position, which the 
defaultUK
default was a part of? There was a time when something like that could have made a world of difference. Today, sending NATO in would not make that much difference. I wish I had something more positive to say, but I fear that not just the Arab Spring, but a whole range of things, have placed us today in a situation where there is no power around us—the British Government, the American Government or the whole coalition of Governments—that is able or willing to invest what it would take to make a real shift in the direction of events in Palestine or elsewhere. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ55default 
defaultMr Roy:default Lastly, can I ask you about the role of 
defaultIran
default and the conciliatory moves from the 
defaultUnited States
default towards it? What difficulty does that bring to formulating a peace process for the Americans in relation to 
defaultIsrael
default and the Palestinians? Does their mindset change the game?
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default I am one of the few people I know who is not criticising Obama for being weak. I think he—unlike some people—learned the lesson of 
defaultIraq
default. Had the Americans sought to lead some sort of intervention in 
defaultSyria
default at whatever stage, I think they would have ended up in the same situation as they did in 
defaultIraq
default. 
default              
defaultYezid
default may differ from me on that, but I am pretty clear and it is reinforced by what you just said. Intervention in any of these places is not an option that will turn things around. I therefore cannot think of anything more foolhardy than resisting an opportunity to get a negotiated deal with 
defaultIran
default. Of course it will not be 100% secure on whether they have a bomb in the basement, or the capacity close by, but I think it is mind-boggling that 
defaultIsrael
default should bounce the 
defaultUnited States
default into a war with 
defaultIran
default. So I think the position of the 
defaultUnited States
default has to be with the Israelis. We are determined that the region should not be destabilised by a nuclear-armed 
defaultIran
default and, if that takes some concessions for a one-off opportunity with President 
defaultRouhani
default, I am afraid you are going to have to put up with it.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default If I could add something, I think a comprehensive deal on the nuclear issue would be a tremendously positive thing for the region, but let us not assume that a de-escalation on that particular issue will necessarily change the dynamics of Iranian, Saudi or other competition. It is sort of like with the cold war: once we had established mutual assured destruction by the early ’60s, it did not prevent a lot of very destructive rivalry in the rest of the third world between the Soviet Union and the 
defaultUSA
default. 
default              
defaultWhen it comes to Israel and Iran, in particular, my feeling is—I base this on what people I know who are very close to the Israeli nuclear programme
default 
defaulthave been telling me for several years—that Israel can live with the sort of deal that seems to be on the cards now. I think Israel will come to terms with this, never mind what Netanyahu says, but that does not mean that, when it comes to Syria, Iraq, Lebanon or elsewhere, Saudis, Iranians and others will not still be competing, or even more so than before. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ56default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default It was interesting what you were saying, Professor 
defaultSayigh
default, about the United States or any other western power having enough influence to make any difference on the ground itself. What do the panel think about the first Obama Administration? When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, she was quite firm on settlements and what was happening on the ground. She gave the impression that she was quite firm, but that President Obama seemed to rein her in a little bit. We see in the second term an attempt by John Kerry to get this thing going again. While I am sure everybody around this table hopes it is successful and we get a deal, do you feel that the Americans’ heart is really in it and that they feel, as you described it, that there is not a lot that they can do? Is there an element that they are maybe going through the motions towards the latter days of the second Obama Administration?
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default It is very difficult to work out how the Kerry initiative came about. The best interpretation I have heard is that it has a lot to do with his personality. Kerry has a particular way of operating and particular views, and he wanted to do something. I do not know whether that is a correct interpretation. I don’t feel that the Obama Administration took a 
defaultstrategic decision at some point saying that this was something they needed to do, but it is probably something that Kerry wanted hard enough to push and Obama was not going to stand in his way, or something along those lines, which suggests that the US could probably do at lot if it really wanted to. 
default              
defaultI think Obama took a very wrong step at the very start of his first term by calling for a settlement freeze. I think he was absolutely right to raise the issue; he was wrong to select a freeze. He should have been speaking of an entire halt. For technical and legal reasons in 
defaultIsrael
default, a freeze is far more complicated to bring about and involved far more negotiation within the bureaucracy than a policy decision from the Government. Those are different things. Having done that, Obama backed off completely and I don’t think he is back on track to continue it
default 
defaultand to push all the way through. 
default              
defaultDr defaultBregmandefault:default I shall be brief. About this initiative, it is Kerry. It is him; it’s the man. He is very determined to get something. There are expectations now that something will happen. I am afraid that not much is going to happen. He is going to come up with some principles and I am afraid of the frustration that will follow his programme. 
default              
defaultI want to say something about Israeli settlements. We should distinguish between the announcements and the heavy machinery on the ground. Two weeks ago, Netanyahu said that they were going to build 5,000 units—or 4,000; I can’t remember which. I want to see the heavy machinery. The heavy machinery is not there, whatever he is announcing, because in the coalition there is a right-wing party: 
defaultHabayit
default 
defaultHayehudi
default—the Jewish National Home, etc. The settlement project lost much of its vitality. There are a lot of announcements now, but very little building.
default              
defaultChair:default A last question and a very brief answer please.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ57default 
defaultMike Gapes:default What are the implications for an agreement of what is happening in 
defaultEgypt
default? Is it positive because it closes off the tunnels and puts pressure on Hamas, as we heard earlier, or is it potentially uncertain for 
defaultIsrael
default because of the turmoil in 
defaultEgypt
default and the possibility of problems in Sinai and elsewhere?
default              
defaultProfessor Hollis:default I am deeply depressed that anybody could think it is okay to close the tunnels. You had a question earlier. There is a report on 
defaultGaza
default that says that this place is uninhabitable for that size of population by 2020—then what are we all going to do? So the fact that the Egyptians, as a result of their own domestic politics, choose sometimes to close the tunnels and sometimes not, and sometimes to mount an offensive against smugglers in the Sinai and sometimes not, and to have on-off relations with Hamas, means that it is just a mess. It is not clear-cut that there has been a fundamental switch and that it will be good or bad for the peace process. It is just terrifying that 
defaultGaza
default can be treated in that manner when it is home to 1.6 million people.
default              
defaultProfessor defaultSayighdefault:default I do not really have much to add to that. What is happening in 
defaultEgypt
default is likely to continue to complicate Egyptian-US ties in particular and, to some extent, Egyptian-EU ties. I am not confident at all that Egyptian economic recovery is going to happen or to be sustained. 
defaultEgypt
default is entering a very dangerous zone, as it were, that several other Arab countries have already been in for years, which is an inability to agree on the basic rules of the political game, as reflected in the continuing tinkering with the constitution. This is now the third 
defaultconstitutional referendum that we have had in three years—not to mention other constitutional declarations and initiatives. This is a country that is reaching a point where there is no consensus on the overarching authority within which people conduct their business. The implications for all neighbours are going to be very big but, as Rosemary said, one cannot assume that it will necessarily go in one direction or another when it comes to the peace process.
default              
defaultChair:default Thank you all very much indeed. It really is appreciated. It is always quite difficult with a panel of three, but you have done very well. On behalf of the Committee, I thank you very much for your time.
