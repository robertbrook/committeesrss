[[[Letter to the Committee from Peter Schofield, Director General, Neighbourhoods Group, Department for Communities and Local Government]]]I am writing to you following my appearance at the CLG Select Committee on the 14th October 2013.At the Committee I mentioned that, following the introduction of Help to Buy: Equity Loans, there had been an increase in the amount of demand for new build homes of between 10 and 20 per cent as a result of the scheme. The Chair asked whether this represented an additional 2,500 to 5,000 homes a year, based around 25,000 homes a year the scheme will help to finance and the 10-20% estimate, and I said that it did.However, rather than using the number of homes the scheme is helping, I should have used the overall number of new build homes in total. Last year, 22 of the largest builders singed up to Help to Buy and built around 61,500 homes. For these builders, an increase in 10-20% would represent 6,000 to 12,000 homes a year. The overall number may be higher still, given there is now a total of 939 house builders that have registered for the scheme.Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information.7 November 2013&#xa0;
