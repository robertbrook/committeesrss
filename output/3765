defaultIn addition to greenhouse gas emissions, other fi
defaultrst-
defaultorder human climate forcings are important to understanding the future behavior of Earth’s c
defaultlimate. These forcings are spatially heterogeneous and include the effect of aerosols on clouds and associated precipitation [e.g., Rosenfeld et al., 2008], the influence of aerosol deposition (e.g., black carbon (soot) [Flanner et al. 2007] and reactive n
defaultitrogen [Galloway et al., 2004]), and the role of changes in land use/land cover [e.g., Takata et al., 2009]. Among their effects is their role in altering atmospheric and ocean circulation features away from what they would be in the natural climate syste
defaultm [NRC, 2005]. As with CO2, the lengths of time that they affect the climate are estimated to be on multidecadal time scales and longer.
defaultWe also wrote (with respect to the 2007 IPCC WG1 report, but their focus was not changed for the 2013 WG1 report)
defaultUnfor
defaulttunately, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment did not sufficiently acknowledge the importance of these other human climate forcings in altering regional and global climate and their effects on predictability at the regional
default scale. It also placed too much emphasis on average global forcing from a limited set of human climate forcings.

defaultIn that 
defaultarticle we 
defaultWe discuss the adoption of a bottom-up, resource-based vulnerability approach in evaluating the effect of climate and other environmental and societal threats to societally critical resources. This vulnerability concept requires the determinati
defaulton of the major threats to local and regional water, food, energy, human health, and ecosystem function resources from extreme events including those from climate but also from other social and environmental issues. After these threats are identified for e
defaultach resource, then the relative risks can be compared with other risks in order to adopt optimal preferred mitigation/adaptation strategies. This is a more inclusive way of assessing risks, including from climate variability and climate change, than using 
defaultthe outcome vulnerability approach adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A contextual vulnerability assessment using the bottom-up, resource-based framework is a more inclusive approach for policy makers to adopt effective mitiga
defaulttion and adaptation methodologies to deal with the complexity of the spectrum of social and environmental extreme events that will occur in the coming decades as the range of threats are 
defaultassessed, beyond just the focus on CO2 and a few other greenhouse gas
defaultes as emphasized in the IPCC assessments.

defaultIn the text
default of the 2003 article
default, 
defaultI 
defaultwrote
defaultSince the surface temperature is a two-dimensional global field, while heat content involves volume integrals, as shown by Eq. (1), the utilization of surface temperature as a monitor of the earth system climate change is not particularly useful in evaluat
defaulting the heat storage changes to the earth system. The heat storage changes, rather than surface temperatures, should be used to determine what fraction of the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere are in radiative equilibrium.

default-the-global-average-surface-temperature-trend-as-the-diagnostic-for-global-warming/
defaultIn that post I discuss
default an issue (of deeper ocean sequestration of heat) that provides one (of several) major reasons that the global average surface temperature is an in
defaultadequate metric to monitor global warming and cooling
default.
defaultI would be glad to elaborate on the above issues, as well as provide other examples of the failure of the 2013 IPCC WG1 to
