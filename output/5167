[normal]Inquiry into tobacco smuggling and the trade in illicit tobacco [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We are grateful to the Committee for launching an inquiry into tobacco smuggling and the trade in illicit tobacco. We welcome the opportunity to debate the nature and scale of tobacco smuggling and the Government’s response to it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please find enclosed the Government’s written submission. Should you require any further information or evidence on any issues, we would be pleased to provide it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This written evidence has been provided by the following government departments with responsibility for tackling tobacco smuggling. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]HMRC have policy responsibility for the effective collection and administration of taxes and have overall responsibility for the strategy to reduce the illicit market in tobacco. HMRC are also responsible for inland and overseas delivery of the strategy; criminal investigation of fiscal offences and prosecution and other sanctions. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. Border Force, Home Office [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Border Force is responsible for the seizure of illicit tobacco and the collection of revenue at the border. In his role as Director Border Revenue, the Director General Border Force is directly accountable to the Chancellor of Exchequer in respect of customs and revenue controls at the border.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. This paper sets out the Government evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry into tobacco smuggling and the trade in illicit tobacco. It has been prepared in consultation with officials from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and specifically seeks to address the following areas / questions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why the number of arrests, prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have fallen over the past three years [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2. The number of tobacco arrests and prosecutions have shown an overall increase over the past three years, with conviction numbers broadly stable, as illustrated below.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]During the above period, HMRC changed its approach to investigations which recognised an alternative to prosecutions designed to disrupt Organised Criminal Gangs (OCGs). This involved an end-to-end strategy whereby upstream activity in conjunction with partner agencies sought to attack the overseas supply chain of illicit tobacco. Coupled with the increased use of civil powers inland, HMRC was able to deploy organised crime criminal investigation resources more efficiently. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Criminal investigation and prosecution plays a key role in the delivery of HMRC
[normal]’
[normal]s strategy. HMRC seeks prosecution where that is seen as the most effective intervention on the criminal trade – both to punish criminals and to deter others from becoming involved in the trade. Prosecution is not appropriate in every case as it is often neither the most efficient nor effective means of disrupting criminal activity. 
[normal]5. Over the last three years, HMRC has sought to increase the quality of its organised crime casework – targeting resource against the greatest threats. At the same time, the department has taken on a significant number of smaller
[normal] tobacco cases, as part of its ‘volume crime’
[normal] initiative to increase deterrence against fraud in the tax and duty systems. This approach saw an increase in the number of Volume Crime prosecutions, disrupting a greater number of smugglers across all levels of criminality, whilst the number of OCG prosecutions fell. This more efficient deployment of investigation resource delivered an overall increase in the amount of revenue protected from criminal investigation work from £281 million in 2010/11 to £378 million in 2012/13. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13 [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Border Force works in partnership with HMRC overseas officers and inland teams to jointly interdict illicit tobacco en route to the UK market. Whilst Border Force faced a broad range of challenges in 2012/13, not least the London Olympics, resource was allocated proportionately and in line with the Border Force Control Strategy which balances all of Border Force
[normal]’
[normal]s operational priorities including efforts against Class A drug smuggling. 
[normal]7. 
[normal]Border Force tobacco targets for 2012/13 were derived from Border Force
[normal]’
[normal]s agreed contribution to the joint 2011 HMRC/UKBA Tackling Tobacco Smuggling strategy. They reflect the strategic priorities that are agreed annually with Treasury Ministers
[normal]. 
[normal]8. The seizure targets for 2012/13 were re-calculated using the 2010/11 outturn and uplifted to reflect the expected benefits for SR10 investment. The Border Force targets for cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco (HRT) were also re-calibrated to reflect the large volumes of HRT seized at the border. The overall Border Force and HMRC tobacco volume targets were increased. The Border Force cigarette target was decreased by 9% to 558 million sticks and the HRT target was increased by 54% to 524 tonnes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. In 2010/11 650 million cigarettes were seized at the border. Since then, there has been a consistent shortfall of cigarettes seized against volume targets. There was small increase in the number of cigarettes seizures made at the border in 2011/12 and 2012/13. 
[normal]10. HRT seizure volumes have also fluctuated over the last three years between 315 and 508 tonnes, although seizure 
[normal]numbers 
[normal]have shown a small increase. 
[normal]11. Border Force believe that that the following factors are significant in explaining changing seizure patterns: 
[normal]12. To inform targeting to improve seizure levels Border Force and HMRC have undertaken a number of joint initiatives and exercises over the past year to develop intelligence and increase our understanding of the threat. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Border Force and HMRC recognise that the nature of tobacco fraud continues to evolve and we keep our approach under constant review to ensure that the balance and application of our responses are applied to maximum effect. HMRC and Border Force are currently refreshing the joint Tobacco Strategy (from April 2011) taking into account the change in risk / threat and modus operandi, along with lessons learned from the current strategy. This work will help us to understand how the overseas and inland activity impacts on seizures at the border. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]14. We have a comprehensive and effective range of sanctions available to deter people involved in all aspects of tobacco fraud and tailored to fit the seriousness of the offence. Tobacco smuggling ranges from individuals abusing cross-border shopping rules through to highly organised, trans-national OCGs smuggling containers of illicit product from across the globe. HMRC and Border Force
[normal]’
[normal]s Tobacco Strategy aims to maximise impact across all levels of criminality, capitalising on the wide range of civil and criminal sanctions and penalties available. The strategy has been successful in reducing the illicit market share of overall tobacco consumption in the UK from 21% in 2000 to 9% for cigarettes and from 65% to 38% for HRT. We regularly review our strategy ensure that we have the appropriate sanctions and penalties available to respond to changes in the risks we face. Current sanctions include: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. In addition to the sanctions available to HMRC and Border Force, Trading Standards Officers have additional sanctions and penalties for contraventions of labelling and packaging requirements, age of sale restrictions, and trade mark offences. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect on each other and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency operations in Northern Ireland [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16. The most significant difference between Great Britain and Northern Ireland criminality is the make-up of the OCGs and their potential links to paramilitaries. We deal with this further in paragraph 26 below. 
[normal]17. Another major difference in tobacco smuggling is the existence of the Irish land boundary. There is a high incidence of smuggling cigarettes into the Republic of Ireland and then overland delivery into
[normal] Northern Ireland – often with ‘
[normal]cooling off
[normal]’
[normal] points or lorry „switches‟ taking place close to (either side of) the land boundary. 
[normal]18. A further difference is the existence of hostile areas of Northern Ireland where law enforcement activity is both difficult and dangerous. Again, the criminals expl
[normal]oit these areas as ‘drop’
[normal] sites and onward distribution hubs. 
[normal]19. Product brands, however, tend to be very similar to mainland Great Britain, so a ready market exists for onward shipment of illicit cigarettes to Great Britain. 
[normal]20. Recent investigations have unearthed clear evidence of Irish criminals smuggling cigarettes directly into Great Britain from mainland Europe and further afield. 
[normal]21. HMRC remains entirely consistent in its approach to all organised criminals, irrespective of their political or violent affiliations. Caution is exercised in developing operational risk assessments where such affiliations are known or suspected, but all available investigation techniques are deployed - either alone, or in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies - to bring criminals before the courts and to deprive them of their criminal assets. HMRC has no operational remit in matters of national security, but where any individuals are suspected of HMRC offences, they are investigated accordingly. 
[normal]22. The National Crime Agency will operate UK-wide, including in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland the Agency will be able to operate in relation to matters that are not devolved, including investigations into smuggling by organised criminal groups importing illicit commodities. The Agency will continue to support Border Force and HMRC activity to tackle tobacco smuggling, as the Serious Organised Crime Agency does now. Furthermore the Agency will also continue to be able to take forward civil recovery investigations in Northern Ireland, albeit with restrictions. Civil recovery investigations related to tobacco smuggling for example, which is a reserved matter, will be unaffected. 
[normal]23. The restrictions on the 
[normal]Agency’
[normal]s operations in Northern Ireland, as a result of the Northern Ireland Executive's failure to agree to take forward a legislative consent motion, prevents the National Crime Agency undertaking activities which relate to transferred matters. National Crime Agency Officers in Northern Ireland will still be able to be designated with the powers of an officer of revenue and customs and the powers of an immigration officer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]24. There is no data available to predict the potential impact in the UK of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland. Standardised packaging has only been introduced in Australia and there is very little intelligence available on the criminal response. Whereas the nature of the licit and illicit markets in the UK and Ireland bear many similarities, the markets in the UK and Australia and proximity to other countries differ. As such, the lessons learnt from the introduction of standardised packaging in Australia may not necessarily translate to the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25. If standardised packaging leads to any change in the risk to the illicit trade in Ireland, it is possible that there could be an increase in illicit product transiting through the UK The extent to which that impacts on the UK illicit market would be considered as part of our continuous assessment of the risks and threats which underpin our strategic approach to tackling tobacco smuggling. The HMRC/Border Force Tobacco Strategy would adapt to any changes in risks as it has done over many years, successfully reducing the illicit market to its lowest levels since 2000. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activity [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]26. Overall, this is a particularly difficult issue to judge with any degree of confidence. Former and current National Security suspects do engage in a wide range of criminality – including tobacco smuggling. Apart from the situation in relation to Northern Ireland, we do not see direct links between tobacco smuggling and terrorism or paramilitary activity; although it would be naive to ignore such a possibility. 
[normal]27. Turning to Northern Ireland specifically, the majority of OCGs investigated to date have either a direct or tenuous link with one or more individuals who are (or have been) the subject of alleged paramilitary connections. This makes it all the more difficult to establish any clear discrimi
[normal]nation between ‘affiliated’ or ‘unaffiliated’
[normal] OCGs. The simple fact is that many of these people are involved in a broad range of significant crime and it is extremely difficult to assess the split between personal profits and the desire to fund paramilitary activity. 
[normal]28. Moreover, there is clear evidence that OCGs with presumed loyalist and nationalist affiliations are prepared actively to trade contraband cigarettes with each other, with one group smuggling, and then selling to the other for onward distribution. This further blurs any clear delineation of criminal activity according to particular factions / groups.

[normal]There is no direct correlation between arrest and prosecution numbers as many cases are progressed using information &amp; summons rather than arrest.
