"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Ohms Law (BRC 43)&#xa0;\n1. \nIn answer to \nthe select committee\ns\n request\n,\n I feel the bullet points you raised are best answered individually. Please see \nm\ny answers to your questions below. I am an Electrical engineer and have worked in the electrical installation industry for over 20 years. I am currently employed by an engineering \nentity\n and\n my view is my own personal view and not that of my employer\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. \nThe general public as a whole do not understan\nd Part P, nor realize the requirement for using a suitably competent person. In my experience that part of the general public actually having works carried out to their property may use various media to understand what they need to do to employ a contracto\nr and in so doing pick up what Part P is\n about,\n but not really understand it\n,\n as many contractor web sites can be misleading. So\n,\n as advice is scant and misleading at best\n,\n I would say that only a small majority of the public are aware of Part P of the building regulations\n;\n however being aware of and understanding something are two very different \nconcepts and most people don’t understand Part P of the building regulations. I\n have come across electricians registered on competent person’s schemes, that don’t understand the wiring regulations or Part P, so how could their unsuspecting general public clients possibly stand a chance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. \nI feel that a large portion of the workforce pertaining to be compe\ntent and trained are way wide of the mark and wouldn’t consider a large section of those on competent persons schemes to be competent to carry out electrical installation work\n in general,\n regardless of that covered by the scope of Part P of the building Re\ngulations. The proliferation of 3-5 day or 12 week training courses do not provide prospective electricians with the skills to become competent and sadly they are accepted on to competent persons schemes and left to “practice” on the homes of the general p\nublic. This is a truly shocking scenario. I have discussed this with \nscheme\n officials \nand\n they \nwere concerned\n that they were\n almost\n forced to keep unskilled non \ncompetent\n people on their registers as the cost implications of losing the annual payment from them was not acceptable. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. \nThe \nscheme\n \noperator’s\n used to send a field engineer out annually to inspect a supposedly competent \nperson;\n however the wor\nk that was inspected was chosen by the contractor and \nran the risk of being stage managed\n by the contractor,\n \nready \nfor the inspecting field engineer. In many cases the inspections lapsed to two years and now the schemes\n are\n rumored to be operating a risk based approach where by contractors may skip annual inspections for a number of years. \nThe concept is flawed as\n one scheme provider runs a Qualifying Supervisor\n (QS)\n scheme, whereby the Qualifying Supervisor is assessed, ann\nually or other, but the rest of the company, which could have multiple\n non skilled\n \noperators\n that\n are not inspected\n. T\nhis is a highly dubious practice and allows totally inadequate and un skilled persons into a dwelling to carry out work, the paper work fo\nr which may only receive a cursory glance by the QS\n, who may not have even visited site to view the work. It is a misnomer that an electrical certificate or report produced\n,\n proves that the installation has been installed correctly, in many cases the elect\nrical test readings will not highlight poorly installed electrical systems or indicate the work that was carried out is in accordance with the building regulations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. \nThe two schemes mentioned are not requir\ned as a register already exists\n that will tell a member of the public if a person or entity is registered with a competent person’s scheme, the existing register can be found at:\n \nhttp://www.competentperson.co.uk/\n , this register is alrea\ndy fit for purpose \nand no other is required.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nThe register offered up by the Certsure alliance (Electrical Safety Council, NICEIC, ECA,SELECT and ELECSA), requires that any person accepted on to it is a member of, or registered with\n,\n one of their member \nbodies, therefore any person or entity registered with a non-Certsure group company, would not be accepted on to it. How then can it be the register for the public? It is merely a register of all of the people registered with Certsure and not a register of\n those people or entities equally competent and registered to carry out electrical work\n.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nThe NAPIT register has all of the non Certsure registered bodies but also accepts the Certsure group members on to its register, however it is still a register and not required as the competent person scheme register, \nhttp://www.competentperson.co.uk/\n is by far the most effective and neutral.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nOne of the new registers \nseemed to be\n set up as a direct competitor to the other as the competition between competent person schemes can only be described as ferocio\nus and volatile in nature. They are constantly attempting to discredit each other\n. I feel they\n are not working to the benefit of the general public with the\nir\n new register \nfolly\n,\n which\n they both seem to be driving very hard\n&#xa0;\n9. \nIn short a new register is \nnot required as a perfectly serviceable register already exists.\n \nhttp://www.competentperson.co.uk/\n10. \nI am not aware of any supervision what so ever by DCLG of the accreditation bodies. The experience I \nhave had of DCLG interacting with the accreditation bodies was to ask for feedback and minimal advice on the recent changes to Part P of the building regulations. I see the accreditation bodies very much as individual companies and not answerable to DCLG i\nn a way that can be seen as useful to the general public.\n \n&#xa0;\n11. To sum up, I don’t feel Part P has impacted the general public in a positive way, it has only served to enable scheme operator’s to prosper and develop well beyond their bounds. Vigilant monito\nring of competency by a neutral body, not driven by massive profit requirements is what is required to improve safety and by doing so increase the skill levels of those undertaking electrical installation work by continual development.\n&#xa0;\n12. Merely taking ci\nrca £500 a year from a contractor to enable them to work is no use to anyone, especially not the public they are supposed to ensure the safety of\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
