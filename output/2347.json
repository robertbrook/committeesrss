"&#xa0;\nNorthumbria Area Ramblers – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNorthumbria Area of Ramblers supports the PDGLA in its proposal to strengthen the current draft Deregulation Bill with the addition of more binding clauses in order to protect vulnerable green lanes from mis-use by unauthorised off-road vehicles.\n&#xa0;\nCurrent legislation is failing to deal with the problem.  Walkers in \nNorthumberland  and\n Durham have found routes impassible because of the continued and growing use of off-road vehicles managed by an increasingly determined and militant group.\n&#xa0;\nWe are aware that the need to regulate the use of unsealed unclassified country roads (UUCRs) and Byways Open to all Traffic (BOATs) by authorised vehicular traffic has long been recognised and that the Deregulation Bill is designed to address the problem.  What we, along with the PDGLA and other users of green lanes such as cyclists and horse riders, ask is that the Deregulation Bill includes the downgrading of all UUCRs and BOATs to restricted byways status and awards the right of appeal against any highway authority which refuses to impose a Traffic Regulation Order when asked to do so.\n&#xa0;\nWe also feel that this is the opportunity to legislate for the inclusion of UUCRs as restricted byways on Ordnance Survey maps.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJudith Taylor\nArea Chair on behalf of 2,300 Northumbria Area Ramblers\n&#xa0;\n8 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
