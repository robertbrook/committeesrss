"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from David Tredrea (GMC0017)&#xa0;\nGMC effectiveness concerns&#xa0;\nI write this letter in a personal capacity as David \nTredrea\n, 12 Harley Street, London W1G 9PG. \n&#xa0;\n1: \nI regret feeling obliged to bring this sordid affair to your attention.  \nI \nf\neel it \nis \nsomething which affects the very DNA of the G\nM\nC and its inability to deal with \ncomplex but important \nrogue doctor \ncases.  \n&#xa0;\n              \n2:  \nFor me, t\nhe matter started \nin 2008 when\n I made \nserious allegations \nto the \n              \nGMC about \nphysici\nan BB\n.  She \nso abused one of her young\n daughters \n              \nthere was a suicidal crisis.  I was brought in to assist this child, safeguard her \n              \nfuture and help the family re-establish its moral compass.  In the ma\nin I was \n              \nsuccessful and achieved all objectives.  The daughter is now an adult, \n              \nindependent and \nhas completed a university degree.  \nBB has divorced and \n              \nnow lives alone, estranged from family. \n&#xa0;\n3: \nI submitted evidences to the GMC in 2008 but they felt \nthen \nthere was \ninsufficient evidence to challenge her ‘\nfitness to practice’\n.  I \nhave \nsupplied \nvarious evidences since and now there are some 90 independently verified \n              \nand \ndispirit threads showing this doctor to be an exceptional risk to others – \nprofes\nsionally and otherwise.  \nThe catalogue showing \n66 of these w\nas\n sent to \nthe GMC 12 months ago\n.  The \nbottom line is the GMC \nmakes some noises of \ngrunt but f\nails to take robust action.  This is largely because BB has the \nhallmarks of a vexatious litigant and constantly Appeals in the various Courts \n(criminal and civil) in which she has re\ng\nularly appeared since 2008. \n \n&#xa0;\n4:  \nOn 19\nth\n November \n2013 \nI wrote to the GMC with:  \n‘I have your email of \nNovember 15\nth\n informing me o\nf the GMC position but note there is still \nnothing \ntangible by way of evidence or effort.  My anxiety is that in 12 months I will be\n \nfobbed off with similar platitude and secrecy.  As a victim of serious crime \n              \ncommitted by BB 5 years ago, I am no longer\n prepared to accept the GMC \n              \nlack of progress report as satisfactory.  If, as you say, this case is at a crucial \npoint, I need to alert the Police to ramp up protection because of BB’s past \nhistory and evidence the GMC already has of her retaining the\n \ndi\nsreputable\n \nfor nefarious activities. Clearly she would see me as a prime target that needs \nto be quietened so she can continue with her various \nmischiefs\n.  I see no \nevidence of change in her alarming mental disorders.\n The GMC shares duty \nwith me to pr\notect my family and home as much as possible\n.’  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n5:  \nOn November 27\nth\n \n2013 \nThe GMC replies with:  ‘\nFinally, in terms of \n              \nprotection for you and your family this is not a matter for the GMC and if you \n              \nhave concerns for your safety and wel\nl\n-being you should raise these with the \n              \nPolice’\n.  \n&#xa0;\n              \n6:  \nOn its Internet home page,\n t\nhe GMC \nshows\n \nfive core organisational \n              \nvalues which underpin everything \nit does:  \n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n1: \nWe protect the public through the work that we do.\n              \n              \n2: \nWe treat everyone fairly.\n              \n              \n3: \nWe are honest and strive to be open and transparent.\n              \n              \n4: \nWe are committed to excellence in everything we do.\n              \n              \n5: \nWe are a listening and learning organisation.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThese values form the basis on which our organisation operates. We want \n              \nevery decision \nwe make, every interaction we have and every email we write \n              \nto embody our values.\n&#xa0;\n              \n7: \nThere is evidence the GMC has previously \nlied\n in aspects of this case.  The \n              \nconclusion I reach is that the GMC is unable to address this case with \n              \nappropriate serious\nness, resource and priority.  BB has shown on many \n              \noccasions that Harold Shipman and similar reprobates are cases she \nhas \n              \nstudie\nd carefully\n.  This doctor \na\nctively lied to a GMC \nFtP\n \nabout 12 \n              \nmonths \nago that led to a ‘\nno sanctions\n’ verdict despite being \ndismissed for \n              \ngross \nprofessional conduct and lack of trust from her NHS employers\n.  \nBB\n \n              \nwas sacked with immediate effect \nbecause of sustained dishonesty.  \n              \n              \n8:  \nBB submitted her own Application to the Supreme Court of Judicature \n              \nthat \n              \nshe \n‘lacked ment\nal capacity’\n concerning another case she was running at \nthe \n              \ntime her NHS suspension \nstarted \n– yet still saw fit to see private patients. \n              \n              \n9: Despite knowing this information, t\nhe current position is the GMC has \n              \nabsolutely no restrictions on her current licence to practice despite \nknowing in \n              \ndetail about 66 \nindependent\n, separately \nevidenced \nchallenges to her probity \n              \nand risk to patients.  \n&#xa0;\n10;  \nIt is my view that whilst the GMC has gloss and fine words for its\n web-\nsi\nte \nand publications, when faced with tough, rough doctors it is easily subjugated \nand lacks the spirit, wherewithal and other means to \nmeet its objectives.  \n&#xa0;\n              \n11:  \nIn complaint to the PSA they take a similar stance of timidity.  Their \n              \nChairman r\necommends the case is taken to the Privy Council.  \n&#xa0;\nRecommendation:  &#xa0;I would like the HSC to highlight this case as an example where the GMC ‘\ntalks the talk’ \nbut \nstridently and knowingly \nfails in its core duty to protect patients and public. I would \nalso \nlike the HSC to continue to monitor the progress of this important case.  \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
