"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Industrial Communities Alliance&#xa0;Industrial Communities Alliance&#xa0;The Industrial Communities Alliance is the all-party \nassociation of local authorities in the industrial areas of England, Scotland and Wales.  The Alliance was formed in 2007 by the merger of longer-standing associations dating back to the 1980s.  The Alliance\n works with the Westminster government, the devol\nved administrations and the EU to deliver\n policies and funding \nthat\n support economic and social regeneration.  Some 60 local authorities are currently members.\n&#xa0;\nWelfare reform has been a regular topic of discussion at regional and national meetings of the \nAlliance.  The present submission draws on these discussions and on published academic evidenc\ne to illustrate the\n impact \nthat \nwelfare reform in general, and reform to housing benefits in particular, is having in much of older industrial Britain.  The submi\nssion was prepared by staff in the National Secretariat and endorsed by the Alliance Executive, comprising senior elected members from around the country.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nContext&#xa0;Britain’s older industrial areas include some of the most economically deprived parts of t\nhe UK.  Over many years, substantial parts of Scotland, Wales and the North of England, and even some areas further south, have seen the decline of the industries on which their economies and communities were once based.  Coal, steel, shipbuilding and text\niles, for example, have now disappeared entirely from some places and survive only on a much diminished scale in others.  This has cast a long shadow over economic and social well-being.  Reg\neneration efforts have brought\n new jobs, but rarely on a sufficie\nnt scale\n to offset previous job losses.\n&#xa0;\nThe result is that Britain’s older industrial areas mostly suffer from high levels of worklessness.  Even in the years prior to the 2008 recession, they remained a long way off ful\nl employment.  The worklessness\n is \nfar more extensive than just conventional ‘un\nemployment’.  For example,\n one of the long-term consequences of a weak demand for labour \nin older industrial Britain \nhas been that very large numbers of men and women with health problems or disabilities have en\nded up \nparked outside of the labour market on incapacity benefits.\n&#xa0;\nThe consequence is\n that individuals\n are more likely to be out-of-work on benefits in older industrial Britain than in more prosperous local economies.  Because of lower wages for those in \nwork, they are also more likely to draw on in-work benefits.\n&#xa0;\nWelfare reform\n te\nnds to be discussed with little\n reference to its impact in specific places up and down the country.  However, because benefit claimant rates va\nry so much across Britain,\n the pla\nces where claimants are concentrated – such as older industrial areas – are \nclearly \nmost exposed to financial losses.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study: under-occupation of social housing (‘bedroom tax’)&#xa0;\nTo illustrate the disproportionate impact of welfa\nre reform\n on olde\nr \nindustrial areas\n it is worth looking at the new under-occupation rules governing support for housing costs in \nthe social rented sector, generally\n known as the ‘bedroom tax’.  The rules on under-occupation are of course the same across the who\nle country but\n the impact differs\n from place to place for two \nmain \nreasons.\n&#xa0;\nFirst, the \nshare of the housing stock \nin the social rented sector\n varies a great deal across the country.  This often reflect\ns\n complex historical reasons – the aftermath of the redevelopment of slum housing for example, and t\nhe differing priority that\n authorities once attached to building council houses.  Older industrial Britain, with a legacy of slum clearance and a tradit\nion o\nf municipal activism,\n has some of the highest proportions of social housing.\n&#xa0;\nSecond, the \nproportion of working-age households who claim Housing Benefit\n varies according to the scale of worklessness and the extent of low wages.  Older industrial Britain \nis\n among the places where the claimant rate is highest.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1 shows the estimated impact of the ‘bedroom tax’ by district across the whole of Great Britain.  The figures here are taken from a report by Sheffield Hallam University\n, publis\nhed earlier in 2\n013, and are\n ultimately rooted in the Treasury’s own estimates of the financial savings and in DWP benefits data for \nlocal areas.  T\nhe map shows the \nannual \nfinancial loss \nper adult of working age – i.e. averaging the financial loss across the whole working\n age population of each area, inclu\nding non-claimants\n.  This is the best measure of the intensity of the financial ‘hit’ in each part of the country.\n&#xa0;\nAnyone familiar with the economic geo\ngraphy of Britain will see that \nthe areas hit hardest by the ‘bedroo\nm tax’\n include\n the industrial areas of northern England, the Welsh Valleys, the Birmingham and Glasgow areas and a number of inner London boroughs.  By contrast, substantial parts of the south and east of England outside London are relatively lightly affec\nted.\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1: Impact of the ‘bedroom tax’ by district&#xa0;\nSource:\n Sheffield Hallam

data\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo und\nerline\n t\nhe highly uneven impact of\n the \n‘\nbedroom tax\n’, Table 1 shows a range of figur\nes for each of the GB regions.\n&#xa0;\nThe first column shows that i\nn total\n 660,000 households are thought to\n be affected\n – the Department fo\nr Work and Pensions own\n figure\n – but of these\n just 40,000 are in the South East of England, compared to 240,000 in the thre\ne regions of northern England.\n&#xa0;\nThe second column shows that t\nhe annual financial loss to Housing Benefit claimants in the \nSouth East totals £30m.\n \n I\nn \nthe three re\ngions of \nnorthern England\n it totals\n \n£160m.\n&#xa0;\nThe third column shows the proportion of households affected by the ‘bedroom tax’.  In the North East it affects 440 out of every 10,000 household\ns\n , four times as many as in the South East.\n&#xa0;\nThe fourth column av\nerages the financial loss across the whole working age population (including non-claimants).  The loss is more than three times greater in the North E\nast than the South East.\n&#xa0;\nThe point here is that the\n highly\n uneven impact of the ’bedroom tax’ \nhas largely\n been overlooked.  Yet it is increasingly leading to widespread distress in some of the most disadvantaged communities in Britain.  According to reports to Alliance na\ntional meetings\n, the ‘bedroom tax’ is leading to a sharp rise in rent arrears, to high le\nvels of demand for smaller accommodation that is \nsimply  not available, and to\n difficulty in \nletting \nthe \nlarger properties owned by housing associations and councils.  Local authorities are als\no aware that a move from social-\nrented housing to smaller but m\nore expensive accommodation in the private-rented sector would not normally reduce benefit payments.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOther reforms to housing support&#xa0;\nT\nhe evidence on the other elements\n of support for housing costs \nconfirms an\n uneven impact across the country, though not always in \nquite \nthe same way as for the ‘bedroom tax’.  The Sheffield Hallam study, for example, indicates that the\n household benefit cap\n impact\ns\n to a major extent \nonly in London, where\n rent levels \nhave hithert\no driven up Housing Benefit entitlement\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe reforms to\n Local Housing Allowanc\ne\n, \nwhich apply to the private-\nrented sector\n,\n impact on London because of high rent levels but quite a number of older industrial areas in the North West, Yorkshire and North Eas\nt are also badly affected because of the high proporti\non of tenants\n out-of-work or on low wages.\n  There are reports\n that in some places private landlords have become nervous about letting or re-letting to Housing Benefit claimants and that this is feeding \nthrough to levels of homelessness.  Indeed, government figures show that the proportion of households citing loss of a private tenancy as the trigger for their homelessness is \nr\nis\ni\nng and now at an all-time high.\n&#xa0;\nThe impacts of the reforms to Council Tax \nBenefit are complex.  It might have been expected that older industrial areas would be hit hard because of hig\nh worklessness\n.  In the event, the devolved administrations and a number of English local authorities, such County Durham and Northumberland, have\n chosen not to pass on the reduction in government grant.  But as the Sheffield Hallam report shows, in the older industrial areas where the cut in government grant has been passed on in full the\n financial losses\n are among the largest in the country.\n&#xa0;\nLook\ning a little further ah\nead, there are\n worries that the intention to pay the ‘rent’ component of Universal Credit to claimants rather than direct to landlords, and to do so on a monthly rather than for\ntnightly basis, will have damaging\n repercussions for hou\nsing associations and local councils.  The fear is that the financial pressures on tenants will mean that rent\ns go unpaid and arrears\n develop.  Since social landlords borrow against their anticipated income stream, this \nalso \nhas potential knock-on conseque\nnces for \nthe volume of \nnew building.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe cumulative impact on households&#xa0;\nIt would\n be misleading\n to take the housing-related benefit changes out of their wider context.\n  Changes to\n \nincapacity and disability benefits, \nto \ntax credits and \nto \nChild B\nenefit\n are underway at the same time\n, and \nin several cases are\n substantially larger in terms\n of their financial impact.  The effect is that\n several d\nifferent elements to the\n welfare reform package impact simultaneously on the same households and individuals.\n&#xa0;\nIt\n is the \ncumulative\n aspect of\n the reforms \nthat \noften \nmake \nthem so pernicious\n.  Drawing on official data, the Sheffield Hallam report quantifies the average annual loss\n,\n per affected household or individual, when \neach of \nthe reform\ns has\n come into full effect\n:\n&#xa0;\n              \nIncapacity benefits\n              \n              \n              \n£3,480\n              \nTax Credits\n              \n              \n              \n              \n£   810\n              \nChild Benefit\n              \n              \n              \n              \n£   370\n              \nHousing Benefit:

cap\n              \n              \n£4,820\n&#xa0;\nThe point here is that some of the hous\neholds adversely affected by\n reductions in housing support are also likely to find that that they will lose mo\nney as a result of other elements\n of the reforms.  Indeed, this is already h\nappening.\n&#xa0;\nThe group that is perhaps mo\nst exposed to reductions in entitlement\n are older working age couples who have hitherto combined entitlement to a number of b\nenefits\n.  Many incapacity claimants, for example, also claim DLA, Housing Benefit and Counci\nl Tax Benefit.  \nSome of t\nhose within this group \nwho have lesser disabilities will\n find that they are unable to claim Employment and Support Allowance or Perso\nnal Independence Payments\n and that they must now pay some Council Tax\n for the first time\n.  If they\n live in social housing and their children have moved away\n, which is ofte\nn the case, the ‘bedroom tax’ \nwill also come into play.\n&#xa0;\nThis group – older out-of-work couples – is especially numerous in many older industrial areas, where meaningful job opportuni\nties \nfor them \nhave long since dried up.  They will often find that the cumulative effect of the reforms is to push them down to the poverty line.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe overall impact on places&#xa0;\nLikewise, the \ncumulative \nimpact of the reforms on specific places and local \neconomies should be a major cause for concern.\n&#xa0;\nTable 2 lists the 50 local authority districts which, according to the Sheffield\n Hallam report, are\n worst affected by the welfare reforms as a whole.  The measure used here is \nagain \nthe financial loss average\nd across the whole of\n the working age population\n.\n&#xa0;\nTable 2: Overall impact of welfare reforms by

\nExcept DLA by 2017/18, incapacity benefits and 1% up-rating by 2015/16\nSource: Sheffield Hallam estimates based on official data\nAlthough for very specific reasons a \nseaside town (Blackpool) and an inner London borough (Westminster) top this list, a careful reading of the other authorities in the top 50 shows that around two-thirds are ‘older industrial areas’.  By contrast, the 20 districts least impacted by the welfa\nre reforms, also shown in the table, are all in southern and eastern England outside London.  The disparities are very large – a factor of nearly four-to-one between the extremes, and in excess of two-to-one in all other cases on this table.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConcluding remarks&#xa0;Reforms to housing benefits, such as the introduction of the ‘bedroom tax’, will in most cases widen the divides in prosperity between the best and worst local economies across Britain.  The current welfare reforms, taken as a whole, also have this\n impact.  Britain’s older industrial areas are especially exposed to losses of benefit income.\n&#xa0;\nMinisters argue that one of the main effects of the welfare reforms will be to increase the financial incentive to work, and that because more people will look \nfor work, more people will find work.  That work incentives for many will increase is not in dispute.  However, the Industrial Communities Alliance and its member authorities do not share the view that the welfare reforms will raise the overall level of em\nployment.  Some benefit claimants will intensify their job search, and some will find work, but in Britain’s weaker local economies, where there remains a shortfall in job opportunities, this will mostly be at the expense of other jobseekers.\n&#xa0;\nIn the view \nof the Alliance, the key to reducing the number of working-age benefit claimants is \nregional and local economic growth\n.  In practice, by reducing household incomes and local spending power in older industrial Britain, the current welfare reforms are likely\n to have precisely the opposite effect.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26 September 20138\n&#xa0;\n \nC Beatty and S Fothergill (2013) \nHitting the Poorest Places Hardest: the
