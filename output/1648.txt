[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cambridgeshire is a diverse county, consisting of large rural areas, market towns and the city of Cambridge. The issues facing rural areas vary considerably across the county. In Fenland, in the north of the county, the key concerns are linked to an ageing population, deprivation, educational attainment and health inequalities, while in rural areas to the south of the county the overriding issue is the availability of transport to access services. Improving transport has an important role to play in reducing social exclusion, improving accessibility and helping people to live independent lives, but the location of services and choices as to how they are provided often have significant transport impacts. Different groups in the county face a variety of transport problems, for example children and young people often rely on parents to provide transport where public transport opportunities do not exist&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 30th January 2012 the County Council Cabinet committed to a three year phased programme of removing (in two steps) the £2.7 million used to subsidise bus services. In its place it committed £1.5M of targeted investment to be spent providing transport solutions that better reflect the needs of local areas.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This investment in local transport solution and is part of a wider Programme of work being delivered under the Cambridgeshire Future Transport Programme. The CFT Programme is focusing on:&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; strengthening the connections between transport solutions and community outcomes,•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; enabling the pooling of resources across boundaries where applicable•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; providing a strategic framework to bring partners together•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; stimulating opportunities to create new community joint ventures to operate as local delivery bodies•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; engaging more widely with other services to explore the potential to innovate and improve service accessibility in order to &#xa0;provide transport solutions that better meet communities’ needs &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2012 Cambridgeshire

[[[ ]]]County Council

[[[ ]]]embarked on this ambitious programme to increase and improve accessibility. A key part of the CFT Programme is a comprehensive review of the transport needs of communities and how the previous bus subsidies are being spent. Value for money and cost (in £) per subsidised bus journey are critical dimensions of this review. The methodology of this approach, how the needs of different groups/sections of the community together with the challenges faced are all described in further detail below. &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For the local transport solutions work, the County has been divided up into 13 areas or tranches. The engagement work described below has been undertaken (fully) in Areas A to D and is being launched in October 2013 in Area E F and G.  &#xa0;

[[[Communities]]]&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The key feature of the approach to developing new local transport solutions using input and information gained through engagement rather than consultation. Progress to date has implemented new solutions that have been co-produced with local communities. The approach of subsidising bus services on the basis of existing passengers has been replaced with encouraging community involvement throughout the process and broadening the reach to include potential passengers, as well as existing. The result has transport that is more (commercially) sustainable and appropriate.  &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Decisions are being made on an area by area basis about the level and type of engagement that is most appropriate for that community.  Local engagement plans are in place and have been contributed to by local members and the local parish council. This local engagement is reflecting the diversity of communities within Cambridgeshire whilst recognising and responding to differences.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The scope of what is part of the engagement (and what is not) is set out below.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In scope&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Out of scope&#xa0;&#xa0;Engagement Outputs &amp; Outcomes

The following outlines the basic process from which different engagement techniques can be employed at a local/community level depending on the area.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stage 1]]] –Meet with local District and County Council members and Parish Councils to agree a community engagement plan and to answer questions on the CFT process.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stage 2 ]]]– Begin the quantitative data collection of current travel patterns and bus usage as well as collating any existing transport data within the area.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stage 3]]] – Set up initial meetings with identified community groups. These meetings will have a number of purposes. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stage]]]

[[[ 4 ]]]–

[[[6]]] – Feedback options to the parish councils and local communities for comment, amendments.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stage ]]]

[[[7 ]]]– Finalise design of solution

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stage 8]]] – Take it back to the wider community for approval – This is via members, the parish councils and community events.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Taking into Account Groups of Passenger with Different Needs]]]&#xa0;3.1              The approach described above is well defined and has good structure and clear and intended outcomes. However in the absence of active and positive participation from local communities the approach will not yield results or lead to the implementation of solutions that reflect local needs. &#xa0;3.2              A comprehensive stakeholder analysis and mapping exercise has identified six main groups that will be key to community engagement for this project.  Local engagement plans will provide more detail on an area basis and explore the mechanisms that can be used to engage with each of these groups and their sub-sections.&#xa0;Communities

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is not a one size fits all approach to community engagement.  Within Cambridgeshire there is considerable diversity between each local community that will determine the most appropriate approach to engagement.  When working with communities it is recognised that there may already be groups and networks of active people that could play an important role on the engagement process. In addition to this consideration will also be given to the two main forms of engagement;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Communities of place]]] – formed from residents who live in an area where services are being reviewed.  There are two key audiences within this group. Those who currently use buses and those who have the potential to use services in the future. The success of the project will depend on engaging with these two groups.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Communities of interest ]]]– formed from those with a shared interest in the provision of transport in an area. There communities may be made up from interest groups such as ‘Save our buses’ part of the campaign for better transport or ‘Towards Sustainability’, they could also be businesses within the area. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Members&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lack of member buy-in is a key risk. The withdrawal of bus subsidy is a contentious issue. The engagement process needs to move on quickly from these discussions to allow all stakeholders to engage positively in the development of alternative solutions. We intend to mitigate this key risk by working closely with both District and County members drawing on their invaluable experience of the local area to help us fully understand local need, to work with CCC to organise engagement events and for members to be involved in the design of any new transport solutions.&#xa0;Parish Councils

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although parish council’s have a wide range of powers there are few statutory duties placed upon them.  Parish plans may already have considered transport need for a village and identified actions. These are a valuable source of information. The knowledge and experience of a parish council will enable the formation of working groups and ensure the most difficult to reach are included in the process.  The parish council will also have access to those who are active in the community and can help to communicate the aims of the project.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The potential assistance and support that a parish council can provide to the project should not be underestimated.  Parish councils should be involved from the outset of the project moving into an area. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Where the engagement has been at its best, there have been local champions who are driving the process forwards. In some areas the local champions have been local politicians form the county, district or parish council 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Partners

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A number of partners have been identified that will become involved over the course of the project. This will include organisations that currently commission transport such as PCT (GP Clusters) or are involved in transport issues such as ACRE (Action for Communities in Rural England).  Local employers, schools and the further education sector will also be approached to become involved in the process.  The stakeholder management plan identifies how we plan to work with these organisations.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cambridgeshire County Council already has strong links with District Councils and they have been involved in Cambridgeshire Future Transport Programme from its inception. This partnership working is continuing.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transport providers including Community Transport Schemes, Car Scheme, Commercial operators, Taxi firms, Entrepreneurs and Communities or parishes which provide their own transport also form part of this group. &#xa0;Interest Groups&#xa0;3.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a wide range of groups who represent residents with an interest in passenger transport. Broadly these are;&#xa0;&#xa0;Internal&#xa0;3.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Internal stakeholders can be split into four distinct groups;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;A key element of CFT is encouraging local communities and service providers including partners to become more involved in the process of designing and delivering transport, developing a culture of co-production. This moves away from the historic approach whereby subsidised services have been designed based on previous or existing provision. The first step is working with local communities to asses the transport need in their local area to then work with transport providers and the local authority to design transport solutions that best reflect the identified need. By encouraging community involvement throughout the process and broadening the reach to include potential passengers, as well as existing, the resulting transport will be more sustainable and appropriate.

[[[Successes to Date]]]&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Area B (Whittlesford to Cambridge city corridor) there is a brand new bus service in place that has been designed by the working group and funded by the County Council. It has been in operation since March 2013 and is very successful. It links a number of villages to key public services (such as the health centre in Sawston) and also provides a link to the Babraham Road Park and Ride site for journeys onwards to Cambridge. There is also an interchange opportunity at Sawston to the Stagecoach service into Cambridge. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Area A, a new service will be launched in October – following a vote undertaken in the local communities involved as to what their preferred solution is from the two available.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
