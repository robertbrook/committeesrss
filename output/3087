[normal]Written evidence from Clean Highways (SRN 041)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background[bold]In March 2010 Mike Penning 
[normal]MP
[normal] said in
[normal] a 
[normal]debate in Westminster Hall on Motorway Litter
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]“
[normal]our road networks,
[normal] in particular our motorways
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]re
[normal] 
[normal]blighted by rubbish
[normal].
[normal] I am 
[normal]aware that there 
[normal]is 
[normal]legislation in place however …
[normal] it is frankly not working
[normal]“. 
[normal]Rather disappointingly none of the 
[normal]Highways Agency’s Business Plans
[normal] published during his s
[normal]ubsequent tenure 
[normal]as minister with responsibility for 
[normal]the 
[normal]motorways
[normal] 
[normal]contained any reference
[normal] to this problem.
[normal]The prime objective of 
[normal]Clean Highways
[normal] is to
[normal] find out why the legislation is not working and advise the Government accordingly. I am now working 
[normal]closely 
[normal]with Andrew Gwynne MP
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Statutory Duty[bold]The Secretary of State for Transport has a duty under the S89 (1) of the 
[normal]Environmental Protection Act 1990
[normal] (EPA) in respect to the trunk roads and motorways for which he is responsible 
[normal]to ensure, so far as is practicable, that they are kept clear of litter and refuse.[bold] 
[normal]In doing so h
[normal]e has to hav
[normal]e regard to the 
[normal]Litter Code of Practice
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Relevance[bold]Any 
[normal]failings in this regard 
[normal]should
[normal] be taken into account in 
[normal]considering 
[normal]the 
[normal]reforms required to improve the 
[normal]management of the network. Also, 
[normal]efficient travel
[normal] should include the concept of travel in a clean environment.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Service provider c[bold]ontract mismanagement[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The contractor
[normal] c
[normal]ould then devis
[normal]e his own programme of inspections
[normal] and 
[normal]cleansing
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] be 
[normal]motivated to
[normal] 
[normal]execute it in a timely 
[normal]and thorough 
[normal]manner
[normal].
[normal]However t
[normal]his is not what happens
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Agency does not carry out any formal monitoring
[normal] of the cleanliness of 
[normal]this motorway
[normal].

[normal]unhelpful reply
[normal] I received.
