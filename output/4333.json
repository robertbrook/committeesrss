"&#xa0;\nEvidence from The Leprosy Mission, England &amp; Wales (TLMEW)&#xa0;1.\n1 \nPeople with disabilities \nare among the poorest of the poor but \nhave not been adequately included in \ndevelopment or \nthe\n \nMDGs\n;\n this must be rectified in any post-2015 development framework which should include clear indicators \nto measure\n disability inclusion\n.\n This is a critical moment for DFID to \ntake a leadership role \nin \nchampion\ning\n disability in post-2015 discussions.\n1.\n2\n Mainstreaming people with disabilities into development programmes can be effective if it actively includes people with disabilities in the planning process. \nA\n conso\nrtium approach, \nwhere at least one \npartner is able to provide expertise in disability\n is an effective model\n. \n1.3\n \nProgrammes that use a twin-track approach – mainstreaming \naccompanied by\n disability-\nspecific interventions – are \nparticularly\n effective.\n1.4 Disability disaggregated data is nee\nded at national but also project level\n,\n in order to plan appropriately\n and \nmeasure inclusion.\n \n1.5 Disability is not just a medical or physical issue. Strategies must also address the social, psychological and legal issues around disability, including addr\nessing stigma through a combination of individual \nempowerment\n and community awareness.\n1.6\n Disability strategies, as well as \naddress\ning the consequences of disability, \nshould consider \nprevention of\n disability, including the treatment of neglected tropical diseases \n(NTDs) \nthat cause disability, such as leprosy.\n \n1.8 Inequalities intersect, so people with disabilities can also be marginalised due to gender, caste, ethnicity, location, etc. \nMainstreami\nng is important, with programmes \nfocus\ning\n on the person rather than \njust \nthe disability.\n1.8 DFID has begun to recognise the need for disability inclusion but much more needs to be done to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are realised. This sh\nould include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Leprosy Mission, established in 1874, is an international development org\nanisation working in 11 leprosy-\nendemic countries to defeat leprosy and transform the lives of people affected by the disease.  It uses a holistic approach \nto development that addresses not only the medical aspects of leprosy and disability but promotes so\ncial inclusion of those who have been stigmatised and disabled, supporting them to realise their human rights and live in dignity.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nTLMEW \nap\npreciates the initial steps\n \nDFID\n has taken towards the inclusion of people with d\nisabilities\n, including the ‘\nHow to \nNote on Working on Disability in Country Programmes\n’\n and other guidance documents\n.\n  \nTLMEW also commend\ns\n \nLynne Featherstone MP’s\n recent signing of the \nManhattan Declaration on the Inclus\nion of People with Disabilities and her announcement that schools built\n with DFID funding will be accessible\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nTLMEW is \ncurrently \nreceiving\n support from DFID for \ntwo\n projects that seek to meet the needs of people affected by leprosy and disability\n:\n Challenging Anti-Leprosy Legislation\n that is facilitating people affected by leprosy to unite and advocate for their equal rights and entitlements at local, state and national level; and \nReducing the physical and social barriers faced by 2,000 people with disabilities in seven States and Reg\nions in Myanmar and improving their livelihood opportunities\n which \nfacilitate\ns\n empl\noyment of people with disabilities\n through small business creation, as well as working with \nthe private sector\n and government to ensure their inclusion in the workplace.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nA\nlthough \nDFID has made a good start\n, \nmuch \nmore \nmust be\n done\n to \nensure people with disabilities are not left behind in the development process and to \nmeet the UK’s obligations \nunder\n Article 32\n of the UN Convention on the Rights of P\nersons\n with Disabilities \n(UNCRPD) \nwith regard to International C\nooperation.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n \nPeople with disabilities\n comprise some of the \nworld’s \nmost marginalised and vulnerable people\n. A\nccording to\n \nthe \nWHO ‘people with \ndisabilities and their families are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage than those without disability’.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n \nIt is not sufficient for development programmes to target the easiest to reach. I\nn order to effectively address poverty\n,\n \nDFID-\nsupported programmes (including Bilateral and Multilateral Aid) must\n target the poorest-of-the-poor\n.\n It\n \ncan\n be argued that without involvement\n of people with disabilities\n,\n poverty alleviation measures will not achieve\n \nfull success:\n f\nor ‘\npeople with a disability are less likely to attend school, more likely to be unemployed, while \nh\nouseholds with a disabled member are more likely to experience material hardship – including food insecurity, poor housing, lack of access to safe water and san\nitation, and \ninadequate access to health care\n’, affecting a wide range of development indicators.\n  \n \n&#xa0;3.3\n \nOn\n the whole most conv\nentional development programmes\n do not by defaul\nt include people with disabilities\n. This is \nnot\n necessary due to\n their impairment or functional limitation. Inadequate policies, negative attitudes and lack of accessibility oft\nen prohibit their participation\n.\n \n&#xa0;3.4\n \nThe WHO World Report on Disability (2011) calls for inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream pro\ngrammes: ‘\nPeople with disabilities have ordinary needs – for health and well-being, for economic and social security, to learn and develop skills, and to live in their communities. These needs can and should be met in mainstream programmes and services. Ma\ninstreaming not only \nfulfils\n the human rights of persons with disabili\nties, it is also more effective’\n.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;3.5\n \nD\nespite there being international recognition that a key factor in preventing the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is the lack of inclusion of \npeople with disabilities\n,\n \nt\nhere is currently no DFID polic\ny \nn\nor strategy on disability. Thu\ns\n there is no obligation for DFID programmes to demonstrate or monitor the inclusion of disabled people\n. Therefore\n, disability is not adequately reflected within strategic documents in other areas, such as the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls. Neither is there a requirement that Bilateral \nn\nor Multilateral Aid is inclusive of people with disabilities.\n&#xa0;3.6\n \nEven when di\nsability is said to\n be ‘mainstreamed’ in some DFID-\nsupported projects there is evidence\n that this has\n not necessarily \nbeen \nwell implemented\n. For example,\n the \nDFID Char Livelihoods Project in Bangladesh\n,\n where alth\nough ‘disability’ was a criterion\n for selection,\n because\n people with disabilities\n were not specifically encouraged \nn\nor enabled to participate in the programme their involvement was limited\n,\n with only 3.3% of participants having a disability\n. \nYet\n prevalence of disability in Bangladesh was\n 31.9%\n and as global proportions of disability are estimated to \naverage between 15% -20% of the \npopulation\n  they \nwere\n significantly under-represented. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n \nFrom 2009\n-\n13 \nTLMEW was part of a consortium impl\nementing a large European Union funded programme: the Gaibandha Food \nSecurity Project f\nor Ultra Poor Women (GFSUP)\n (see Annex 1)\n.\n The GFSUP was implemented in order to improve the food security situation of 40,\n000 women-\nh\neaded households. W\nomen were\n organis\ned in\n 1\n,\n600 women\n’s\n groups, and these in turn formed federations. \nW\nomen received training and assets to develop two inco\nme generating activities (IGAs) along with\n \nfurther \ntraining on homestead gardens, health and hygiene, disaster preparedness, \nand \non how to \naccess \ngovernment benefits\n. \nPeople with d\nisabilities\n were intentionally included in this project \nwith\n \nsupport from \na dedicated ‘\ndisability and leprosy team\n’ that\n provid\ned health education \nand\n rehabilitation services to beneficiaries and\n family members with a disability\n.\n T\nhis twin \n-\ntrack approach involved\n mainstreaming and disability-\nspecific inputs.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n \nThis intentionality in terms of inclusion led to 9.5% of direct \nbeneficiarie\ns being a person with disabilities\n and 21.4% of households of beneficiaries containing a person with disability, \nall of \nwhom received various support serv\nices. This figure compares \nwell to global estimates of the propor\ntion of people with \ndisab\nilities\n \nand\n \nfar surpasses \nthe prop\nortion of people with disabilities\n included in the \nDFID \nChar Livelihoods Project which operated in adjacent sub-districts to the GFSUP.\n&#xa0;4.3\n \nThis \nis\n a good example of \n‘active’ mainstreaming\n where\n \ntwo international partners (Light for the World and TLMEW) and two of the \nconsortium implementing pa\nrtners C\nentre for \nD\nisability in\n \nD\nevelopment (CDD)\n &amp; \nThe Leprosy Mission Bangladesh (\nTLMB\n)\n \nhad\n a\n \ndisability \nfocus\n. They\n \nraised the knowledge of \nmainstream NG\nO \nconsortium partners on disability inclusion and \nkept the\n issue on the agenda. They also provided\n \ntechnical \nexpertise\n for implementation\n and \ntrained\n \nimplementing partner staff\n.\n Often ‘mainstreaming’ can be merely a sensitisation which exists on paper but gets lost\n in project implementation. T\nhis \nactive focus on disability inclusion\n proved very effective. \n&#xa0;4.4\n \nThe report\n on Lessons L\nearnt from the GFSUP \nemphasised that disability mu\nst be considered \nin \nthe project design phase if \ninclusion of people with \ndisability and/or leprosy is to be effective.\n \n \n&#xa0;4.5\n \nIn \norder to \nplan for ‘mainstreaming’\n it is essential \nthat the needs assessment process involves actively seeking out people with disabilities, who in many cultures are often hidden away, explores their needs and involves them in \nthe \nproject design\n process\n.  \n&#xa0;4.6\n \nT\no assess the effectiveness of ‘mainstreaming’\n,\n sufficient baseline data and actively track\ning\n the engagement of people with disabilities in the intervention\n is paramount\n.  Monitoring and evaluation with regard to disability inclusion should be both quantitative, the number of people with disabilities \nbenefiting from the programme, but also qualitative, reflecting their level of participation in project activities as well as the most significant changes \nseen\n in their lives as a result of the intervention.\n&#xa0;4.7\n \nInc\nlusion of people with disabilities\n is not as\n expensive as often imagined\n. For example\n,\n \nwithin the GFSUP \nproject \nbudget, \nprov\nision for people with disabilities\n totalled \njust \n6% of project costs\n even though \nthere were many disability-\nspecific services\n \nprovided\n, demonstrating significant value for \nmoney in\n reaching the most marginalised\n and enabling them to contribute to the local economy.\n&#xa0;4.8\n \nM\nainstr\neaming of people with disabilities\n within a larger project\n,\n such as GFSUP\n,\n has also \nhelped \nreduce\n stigma\n, as\n \ndisabled members of\n self-he\nlp groups \nwere \ntreated as \nequal members \nalong\nsi\nde\n others with no \nimpairment\n. T\nhey were encouraged to become involved\n in the groups\n and as their confidence and abilities came to the fore, they were respected for their talents \nand abilities. T\nheir leprosy/\ndisability \nthen \nbecame \nmuch less significant in terms of their status, with many being voted into positions of responsibility within the groups and community.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n \nDisability strategies and programmes \nmust\n recognise that disab\nility is not just \na \nmedical\n condition\n. There are significant s\nocial impacts of disability\n that must be addressed.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n \nIn many cultures there is shame associated with disability resulting in people with disabilities being hidden away\n,\n prevented from engaging in their community and being denied their rights.  People \naffected by\n leprosy often are scared to admit their condition, or even \nto \nseek treatment\n,\n because of the stigma and social exclusion that often accompanies diagnosis. Many p\neople try to hide their disability in order to retain social acceptance. (Annex 2)\n&#xa0;5.3\n \nWhen people experience clawed hands\n due to leprosy\n, not only are they unable to grip things, they ar\ne also unable to greet people\n. A simple \nIndian \ngesture of greeting \n‘namaste’\n \nhighlights not only their disability but often triggers a deeply rooted fea\nr of a disease \nthat \nleads to stigma and discrimination. \nAs a result\n, people affected by leprosy often withdraw from social interaction. Barriers to \ninclusion are not only \nphysical, but also social and psychosocial\n;\n \nissues of stigma and discrimination\n \nneed to be addressed.  \n&#xa0;5.4\n \nWork\ning\n with the individual to build confidence and \nrights\n-awareness\n,\n as well as work\ning\n with the wider community to promote understanding and support is vital\n. \nFor example, in\n the TLMEW-\nsupported \nM\nIRANDA\n project in Myanmar\n,\n Disability Resource Centres are providing physiotherapy service\ns\n to people with disabilities, \nas well as\n counselling an\nd\n rights-\nawareness. They\n have\n \nestablished \nself-help groups w\nh\nere people with disabilities provide support \nfor\n each other for\n livelihood development and \nrun\n community awareness programmes on disability.  \nThese activities have resulted in p\neople with disabilities \nbecame more valued and\n \nincluded in \nsociety\n \nand \nthe whole community has\n benefited from more accessible raised pathways that are wheelchair accessible\n, meaning they\n \nno longer have\n to wade through \nmonsoon floods\n to get to \nthe marketpla\nce\n \n(\nSee \nAnnex 3)\n.\n&#xa0;5.5\n \nL\negal support \nis \nalso \nneeded \nto \nensure\n \nnational legislation\n, policies and practice\n \ncomply\n \nwith the \nU\nNCRP\nD\n and discriminatory legislation \nis \nrepealed. For example, leprosy is still grounds for divorce in India.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n \nAlthough it is essential to address the rights of persons with disabilities, it should be recognised that some people experience disability that could \nbe\n prevented. M\ninimisation of the cau\nses of disability is paramount (see Annex 4).\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n \nNeglected Tropical Diseases \n(NTDs) \nsuch as \nLeprosy, Lymphatic \nFilariasis\n and Trachoma \nare a significant cause of serious disability worldwide \nrepresenting\n high levels of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS - the sum of the potential life lost due to pr\nemature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability)\n. These treatable diseases \nmust be addressed in order to prevent people developing disabilities\n. Thus,\n DFID’s approach to NTDs should be li\nnked to its disability strategy.\n&#xa0;6.3\n \nA\nddressing NTDs is not just about mass drug administration. For many of those who have received late diagnosis and treatment\n,\n \ndisability is already a result.\n For some the disability is obvious. Others, including \npeople\n affected by leprosy\n, \nmay not have a vi\nsual disability\n but like those with diabetes\n the sensation loss they experience\n is \ndisabling\n.\n  \nP\nroper self-care and management of their conditions is \nessential in preventing \nfurther disability.\n \nA\n disability i\ns not always visible \nn\nor obvious, yet \nn\not \nsupporting \na person \nin\n prevention of disability\n \ncan\n lead to further \nimpairment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7.1\n \nInequalities intersect\n,\n so a person with \na \ndisability may also be marginalised in other ways such as gender, caste, \nethnicity\n, living in\n remote\n locations\n or by leprosy\n-related\n stigma\n.\n&#xa0;7.2\n \nB\neing marginalised in one way \noften\n leads to \nother forms of marginalisation\n; for example poor access to health care due to discrimination due to ethnicity or caste may lead to late treatment \nafter \nan accident \nor after contracting a disease\n,\n resulting in disability.\n&#xa0;7.3\n \nIt is notable that the risk of disability occurring is heightene\nd due to marginalisation\n,\n and further marginalisation is more likely \nto occur\n due to disability. \n This therefore leads to \na \nbi\n-\ndirectional link to poverty: disability may increase the risk of poverty, and poverty may increase the risk of disability\n&#xa0;DFID should:\n8.1\n \nDemonstrate best practice \nin inclusive development by \nbuilding disability into its strategic frameworks and budgets, and \ndevelop\ning\n an \nequity and inclusion strategy that ensures \na focus on disability inclusion. This should include \nassigning a senior staff member at DFID and a lead person responsible for disability inclusion in each country office. This person\n would\n have responsibility for championing and monitoring\n disab\nility incl\nusion, \nsharing good practice\n and ensuring the implementation of Article 32 of the \nUNCRPD\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.2\n \nTake a leadership role in discussions around the post-2015 development framework, \nchampioning disability inclusion to ensure it is an integral part of any new development framework\n. To maintain its commitment to the implementation of disability inclusive development\n and to keep disability on the international agenda\n, DFID should \nmake specific disability-related \npledge\ns in 2014 e.g. three\n DFID country programmes to be fully inclusive be 2016, all DFID funded projects required to report on disability disaggregated data, etc.)\n&#xa0;8.3\n \nPromote the voice of disabled people in development processes, ensuring they are i\nncluded in strategy development, \nprogramme planning\n, monitoring and evaluation\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.4\n \nMake ‘\nDisability’ a core, cross-cutting element of all development programmes, investing in good practice and recognising the benefits of a twin track approach. Guidance should recommend that\n mainstream NGOs and G\novernment\ns partner\n \nwith organisation\ns\n with expertise in \ndisability, such as Disable\nd\n People’s Orga\nnisations (DPOs) and disability-\nfocused NGOs,\n to ensure capacity development for effective inclusion\n.\n \n&#xa0;8.5\n \nC\nommit to \nensuring \naccountability by requiring \nthat \ndisability disaggregated data is collected for all programmes, including those funded through Bilateral and Multilateral Aid.&#xa0;\n8.6\n \nEnsure the \nsocial and psychosocial impacts of disability such as stigma and discriminatory behaviour are appropriately addressed within an equity and inclusion strategy.\n&#xa0;8.7\n \nInclude ‘prevention of disability’ as an important \napproach \nwithin its disability policy, \nensuring a coordinated approach to the elimination of NTDs (including leprosy), that lead to disability.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1 – see document “Lessons learned in Mainstreaming Disability GFSUP”\n forwarded to Polly Meeks.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 2 – Case StudyJahiruddin, IndiaJahiruddin Kahan is \nmarried with two children and two grandchildren. He has a small stationers shop on the edge of Kolkata. Twenty years ago, when he was 41 years old, he fell from a minibus and a stone went inside his leg. The ulcer that developed would not heal and he spent\n over 10 years going to different hospitals and doctors to get help. One \ndoctor gave him medicine to which his body seemed to react and he became covered with boils.  He went to a skin specialist who referred him to an expert in tropical medicine.  It was \nthere that leprosy was eventually diagnosed, he was given MDT and eventually the ulcer healed.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, 10 years without a diagnosis took its toll on his feet and nerve damage was evident. In 2003 he developed another ulcer and came to TLM’s Hospital.  Here doctors recognised that he had been given the wrong dose of MDT originally so he was given a \nnew treatment regime, his leg was put in plaster to help his ulcer to heal and he returned home, coming back to the hospital every 15 days for a check-up and the rest of his treatment.  However, he never told anyone that he had leprosy. \n&#xa0;\nFour months ago h\ne injured his toe and so he returned to the place where he had received loving care.  However, the severity of his wound meant that he needed a skin graft and a month of bed rest.  During this time, Kavita, a hospital volunteer, has been encouraging people\n to learn to read and write.  Jahiruddin was already literate and could write well in Bengali, so he decided to use his time in bed to write a story.  During my visit he proudly read what he had written, a story about a man, magic and a mango tree, a story\n with a clear moral message of the need to obey your master and the importance of honesty.\n&#xa0;\nYet this talented man also expressed that he is frightened that when he returns home people will be suspicious of the causes of his problem since he has been away h\naving treatment for so long.  He is worried that if they guess his disability is due to leprosy that he will be excluded by the local community of which he is a part.  As for his dreams, he said, “I want people to understand that leprosy is curable and not\n a curse, I want to return to my community as a businessman, not an untouchable. Don’t let them call me a ‘leper’.”\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 3 – Case StudyKan, Myanmar &#xa0;Kan Tint\n is\n 67 years old and is married with seven children.  27 years ago he developed leprosy but \nwaited for 7 years before accessing treatment, by which time the disease had attacked his nerves and he had permanent disability. However, it was not just his physical disability, cause by his clawed hands and loss \nof digits, which affected his life.  More\n painful than the physical impairment was the social stigma he experienced. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nKan was rejected by his community and not allowed to attend social functions such as weddings or Buddhist festivals. He was looked down upon with distain and his friends desert\ned him.  He faced such rejection and despair that he tried to commit suicide twice, the first by taking tablets and then by hanging.  Eventually his family chained him up to prevent his suicide attempts.  The stigma, discrimination and isolation all got to\no much for Kan and he decided to move out of the village he had called home to go and live with his grandchildren.  \n&#xa0;\nIt was here that he came in contact with The Leprosy Mission. Staff provided him with psychosocial support and worked with the community t\no raise awareness about leprosy and disability, working with them to help reintegrate Kan back into the community. It has been a long process, but he is now accepted in his village and can join in celebrations and community events without being shunned.  H\ne is treated just like anyone else and now has the joys of watching his grandchildren growing up without being isolated from community life.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 4 – Case study Nafisa, Nigeria&#xa0;\nNafisa Aminou, 20, is from Nigeria and was told, aged 14, she had \nleprosy and was advised to go to hospital for treatment. But instead she was given traditional herbal treatment for five years. If she was given multidrug therapy at an early stage, it would have been highly unlikely that she would have become disabled.\n&#xa0;\nE\nighteen months ago she developed painful ulcers on her legs and hearing of the reputation of The Leprosy Mission's services run from Danja Hospital, she and her mother crossed the border to Niger. On arrival from Nigeria, Nafisa had seriously shortened lim\nbs as a result of her untreated leprosy and her legs were too painful to be touched below the knees. She was given multidrug therapy to treat the disease and her legs were bandaged to in attempt to remove the swelling and some of the pain.\n&#xa0;\nWheelchair-bound, she began physiotherapy sessions to improve her mobility. Her legs were put in a plaster cast to straighten them and Boehler irons were attached to the plaster casts for walking. She is now able to walk with the help of a walking frame bu\nt she is still awaiting surgery on her lower legs which will further increase her independence.\n&#xa0;\nDespite her disabilities Nafisa is hugely grateful for the medical treatment and love she has received at Danja Hospital. She is optimistic that her mobility w\nill continue to improve and she dreams of marrying and having children.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 32 \nhttp://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=292\n \n World Report on Disability.
