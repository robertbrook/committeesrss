&#xa0;Written evidence from members of Llandovery U3A Transport Group (TIC 090) &#xa0;Summary&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  Background.This submission is based on Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, to highlight the public transport problems in this rural area. The main form of transport, as in all rural areas, being the private car.Transport is needed for employment, further education, hospital visits, entertainment and shopping.The main problems are lack of transport combined with the lack of co-ordination between modes of transport resulting in difficulties for both able and disabled members of the community.&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Existing provision.Llandovery is on the A40 and is served by:1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Three bus routes via various villages to  Carmarthen   Brecon   Lampeter 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Heart of Wales railway line from Swansea to Shrewsbury via several small towns, with connections to London from Swansea and the north and the midlands from Shrewsbury.3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; County Cars a volunteer run car service initiated by the WRVS for essential journeys  ie  hospital appointments.4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Two private taxi services.  &#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Problems with the current infrastructure.The low number of bus services combined with the length of the journey and the limited time available for activities.The poor links between train and bus for onward travel.The non - existent connections between the town and neighbouring villages.  Busesa)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carmarthen  - five per day during school term, only three per day during school holidays. Duration 1hr 20 mins. Last service departs Carmarthen at 17.45b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Brecon  - three per day (Mon to Sat). Duration 40mins. Last service departs Brecon at 17.05c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lampeter –   route A -  one service on Monday and Friday.  Route B – one service Mon, Tues, Wed and Thurs.              Last service departs Lampeter  13.45. &#xa0;Trains Four services per day at 4 hour intervals.1hr 30 mins to Swansea, last service departs at 18.212hrs 30mins to Shrewsbury, last service departs 18.05&#xa0;Link between train and bus service extremely poor.eg the bus to Brecon departs Llandovery train station at 10.40, the train arrives from Swansea at 10.37 allowing just 3mins for the connection.No connection if the train is late.&#xa0;Lack of services to/from nearby villages not on the A40 corridor.Surrounding villages used to connect to Llandovery by the Post Bus.This service has been discontinued.  &#xa0;There are many villages and communities that have no access to public transport at all.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  Resulting problems for the local community:&#xa0;Young people unable to access after school activities, no transport home. &#xa0;People out of work, school leavers, work placement people, those struggling with poor mental health issues and those with physical and learning disabilities  - an efficient transport system would increase access to work opportunities for them.&#xa0;18-25 year olds have to pay a high premium for car insurance which restricts those who might have a car. The young who do not live in towns are severely limited in their access to work, cultural activities and socialising. &#xa0;Families – affected by cost of keeping a car on the road, eg  a two car family having to give up one car resulting in limitations on access to out of school activities.&#xa0;Able bodied adults who are non drivers have to rely on neighbours or expensive taxi services to travel into Llandovery, eg  £30 return fare from Rhandirmwyn to Llandovery – a distance of seven miles.&#xa0;Adults with mobility problems are dependant on others being able to visit them for social and caring services. &#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  Suggested solutions &#xa0;Buses  - increase the number of services to include evenings &#xa0;Trains – add one extra service per day in each direction at appropriate times. &#xa0;Transport links – realistic co-ordination of timetables, this should be feasible as both buses and trains are operated by Arriva.&#xa0;Links to nearby villages – introduce a dial-up request mini-bus service.A service entitled Bwcabus operates in the western half of the county only. &#xa0;Rural areas require direct buses linking town to town centres, with feeder minibuses from surrounding villages. The times of trains and buses should facilitate work in the mornings and socialising in the evenings. &#xa0;
