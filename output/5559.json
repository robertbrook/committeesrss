"Improving the utility of surveillance data for antibiotic usage and resistance monitoring and for healthcare associated infection prevention and control&#xa0;\nA group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection\n&#xa0;Background&#xa0;There is a renewed focus on the risks posed to public health by antimicrobial resistance. The Chief Medical Officer’s 2013 report warned that antimicrobial resistance\n \nis a more serious issue than global warming and \ncalled for it to \nbe included on the Government’s National Security Risk Assessment.\n Recently we have also seen the publication of the Government’s Five Year AMR Strategy.\n This aims to improve knowledge and understanding of AMR, conserve the effectiveness of existing treatments and stimulate the development of new antibiotics.  Although the strategy is welcome, there is still a great deal of work to be done to ensure these ambitious aims are achieved. \n&#xa0;\nSince 2007, the NHS has focused on measures to reduce two healthcare associated infections (HCAIs), MRSA blood stream infections (BSIs) and \nClostridium \ndifficile\n \n(\nC. \ndifficile\n) infections, and has implemented strict targets and objectives to help drive down rates. A multi-faceted approach that has included both infection control and antimicrobial prescribing measures has been associated with declining rates of these infections, though the effect of specific interventions remains subject to debate.\n However, there have been some unintended consequences to these control measures, which require a modified approach to maintain improvements and to address emerging infection and antimicrobial resistance threats.\n \n&#xa0;\nDuring the period of successful control of MRSA BSIs and \nC. \ndifficile\n \ninfections, Gram-negative infections, including \nE\nscherichia\n coli\n \n(\nE. \ncoli\n) \nBSIs\n, have become a greater \nchallenge. R\necent Health Protection Agency (now part of Public Health England) figures show that \nE. coli \nBSI\n \nrates increased by 35% in the last five years\n,\n and there were  32,307 mandatory reported cases in England between July 2012 and June 2013. \n Consequently, the CMO called for an expansion of the focus on HCAIs to include other significant infections, which could help reduce resistance to critically important antibiotics, including \ncarbapenems\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn order to address the need for further improvements, \na group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection\n, supported by Astra Zeneca UK, have come together to consider improvements that can be made. This group of experts\n agreed\n the following recommendations in order to improve clinical practice and patient safety.\n&#xa0;Need for change&#xa0;We\n believe that there is a real need to improve the utility of data available to the NHS and clinicians, so that there is greater understanding of current antibiotic prescribing practice with clearer links to patient outcomes.\n&#xa0;We are concerned about perverse antibiotic prescribing \nbehaviours\n that are being driven by existing MRSA BSI and \nC. \ndifficile\n \ninfection objectives/targets.  Whilst avoiding the use of certain antibiotics is sensible in patients at high risk of MRSA or \nC. \ndifficile\n \ninfection, antibiotic prescribing has become too concentrated on a limited number of drugs.  There is evidence that such intensive use of few antibiotics, rather than using a wide range of agents, can lead to the emergence of resistance, particularly in prob\nlematic Gram-negative pathogens (particularly \npiperacillin-tazobactam\n and \ncarbapenems\n.)\n&#xa0;\nWe believe that changing the focus of the current HCAI targets can improve patient care.  The\n following measures would refine\n current implicit and explicit restrictions on antimicrobial \nprescribing.  If supported by high quality data, this would empower specialists to recommend the most appropriate antibiotic for patients at the most appropriate time, while still taking into account HCAI and antimicrobial resistance challenges. \n&#xa0;\nWe therefore call for \nthree\n measures to drive high quality antibiotic prescribing, which aim to improve patient outcomes and to protect the efficacy of existing antibiotics:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\nAntimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest public health threats.  \nA group of experts in antibiotic resistance and healthcare associated infection \nis\n calling for changes to establish an environment whereby infection specialists can make the best prescribing decisions for patients.  Diverse (but appropriate) antibiotic prescribing can reduce the selection pressure for resistance and can improve outcomes for current and future patients.\n&#xa0;\nFor further information, please contact Professor Mark Wilcox on \nmark.wilcox@leedsth.nhs.uk\n \n&#xa0;\n \nHouse of Commons Science and Technology Committee,  Uncorrected Transcript Of Oral Evidence from the Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, HC 921-I, Published 11\nth\n February 2013\nhttp://www.publication\ns\n.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmsctech/uc921-i/uc92101.htm\n \n \nUK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018, Department of Health, September 2013  \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238872/20130902_UK_5_year_AMR_strategy_FINAL.pdf\n \n Health Protection Agency, Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance: 2010-2011, August 2012 \nhttp://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317136146912\n \n \nHealth Protection Agency, \nEscherichia coli bacteraemia in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 2007-2011\n, \nJune 2011\n \nhttp://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317134482059\n \n \nAnnual Report of the Chief Medical Officer Volume 2, 2011, Infections and the rise of antimicrobial infections\n, \nMarch 2013\nhttps://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n"
