"BRC14\n&#xa0;Submission from Tiden Engineering Ltd&#xa0;\nAfter watching the Parliament video of the “ Building Regulations applying to electrical installation and repairs in dwellings “ committee,\n  \nI would like to give my opinion on the operation of the Pat “P” regulations and what seems to be a dog eat dog fight by the so called Registered Schemes all trying to make sure that they get my money instead of Joe Bloggs.\n&#xa0;\nI served a “real” apprenticeship\n where I spent 4 years working alongside professional tradespeople learning the skills and more importantly the dangers of working with Electricity. I took my exams and passed to the level required by the governing body. THAT is my proof of competency to w\nork on electrical systems. I feel one of the biggest problems in my industry today is just how easy it is for someone to retrain and become an electrician or worse still those that train as a “Domestic Installer” and think they are electricians.\n In New Zea\nland for instance once you have become one of these “quick”  electricians you still have to work under supervision for two years before you can work on your own or become self employed, in fact I would have to do that if I were to emigrate there. I have ju\nst put my son through an apprenticeship with a training advisor, he has been able to show his competence with his exams and through his companies apprentice scheme. \n&#xa0;\nWhy do I have to be part of ANY registered body to practice what I have been trained for \nand worked at all my life. I understand that regulations move on and new standards are to be met and I personally have just sat the latest City &amp; Guilds 2395 exam for inspection and testing. \n&#xa0;\nWe as electricians SHOULD be required to prove our competence b\ny such means but why we then have to pay significant amounts of money to scheme  operators is beyond me. Why not have one department that knows the regulations have changed and therefore do not reissue some form of  renewable ID pass for instance that show\ns to the consumer that this particular electrician is up to date with the current legislation.\n&#xa0;\nMy suggestion are\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
