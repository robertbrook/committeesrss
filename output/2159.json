"&#xa0;\nJohn E. Warren – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;First let me say I agree with a large amount of the proposed changes. I do however have concerns with some parts which I explain below\n&#xa0;\nClause 27 (1) (F)\n&#xa0;\nTargets, reports \nect\n. \nAre important for judging progress so I think reports should still be issued.\n Informal objectives are often not open to scrutiny by 3\nrd\n parties which is wrong in my view.\n&#xa0;\nClause 29\n&#xa0;\nEach step in process to giving fine increases the cost of the process. I think issuing a warning is enough.\n&#xa0;\nClause 47 (I)\n&#xa0;\nFrom personal experience I know councils need to \nrequired\n to use local people in decision making.\n&#xa0;\nI was a tenant representative for 5 ½ years and struggled to get copies of policies before they were implementation for review. My council was using me to rubber stamp decisions.\n&#xa0;\nI was also a trustee of a self advocacy group for people with learning difficulties. Trying to get easy to read version of proposed policies was difficult and at least 2 times we had to force an extension to consultation period as easy read not available\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
