default% that the Local Housing Allowance has been lowered and just under a third of respondents (3

default%) knew of the introduction o
defaultf a
default Housing Benefit cap.
default&#xa0;
default1default.2default 
defaultHaving co
defaultnsidered the reforms, very few young people felt the changes would positively impact on them. Only 5% felt 
defaultthat the raising of the Shared Accommodation Rate would have any positive implications, 9% for the Housing Benefit cap and 12% for the lowering of th
defaulte Local Housing Allowance rate. 
defaultThe primary concern raised was
default the impact that these 
defaultreforms 
defaultwould have in further limiting
default the housing opt
defaultions available to them
default when leaving supported accommodation
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default1default.default3default 
defaultEven before the
defaultse
default 
defaultreforms 
defaultwere implemented
default, 
defaultyoung
default people’s housing options were already extremely limited. As well as home ownership proving too expensive for young people, social housing was already difficult for them to access, even for those coming out of supported accommodation that traditional could
default have relied upon this form of housing. 
defaultGiven 
defaultalso 
defaultthat living with parent
default(
defaults
default)
default is not an option for many of 
defaultthe 
defaultyoung people 
defaultthat
default YMCA
defaults
default work with, t
defaulthis has made the private rented sector the 
defaultonly 
default‘non-supported’ 
defaulthousing option
default available to 
defaultmany 
defaultyoung
default 
defaultpeople
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.4default 
defaultThis penalises young people in 
defaulta 
defaultnumber of ways including;
default 
defaultt
defaulthe higher cost of rent in the private rented sector, the competition and availability of lower rent and shared properties, and the 
defaultreluctance of many private landlords to let to young people on housing benefit. 
defaultFinally, YMCAs are seeing a 
defaultresistance
default 
defaultto moving on 
defaultfrom 
defaultsome 
defaultyoung people when properties in this sector do become available, due to both the quality 
defaultof the property 
defaultcompared 
defaultto the quality at the YMCAs 
defaultand a reluctance to share
default with other individuals
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default1default.default5default 
defaultThese factors 
defaultplus to reforms 
defaulthave meant that 
defaultmoving people on from supported accommodation to appropriate housing within the community 
defaulthas
default become increasingly
default challenging
default for YMCAs
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultslow-down in the move-on
default 
defaultrates currently being experienced by YMCAs creates two negative consequences. The first is delaying young people’s transition to independence. Something which 
defaultthe young people responding felt was further perpetuated
default 
defaultby potentially being forced 
defaultby the benefit system 
defaultto live in shared accommodation 
defaultup until the age of 35
default. The second consequence 
defaultis that the young people who are not able to be moved on are creating a situation of 
default‘bed-blocking’, which 
defaultis 
defaultincreasing
defaultly
default 
defaultpre
defaultventing
default young people in 
defaultgreater 
defaultneed from being a
defaultble to access the accommodation and services YMCAs provide
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1default.default6default 
defaultA
defaultnother concern 
defaultraised by the young people surveyed
default, which further compounds this 
default‘perfect storm’ 
defaultsituation, is
default the problem
defaults
default these reforms 
defaultalso 
defaultcreate when they do manage to move out of supported accommodation. With the Local Housing Allowance being lowered and the extending of the Shared Accommodation Rate, the respondents felt 
defaultthat 
defaultthis increases the likelihood that the
default 
defaulth
defaultousing 
defaultb
defaultenefit they
default receive w
defaultill
default not meet the cost of renting in the private sector
default, putting
default young people under greater financial pressure and subsequently 
defaultincreas
defaulting
default 
defaultthe risk of homelessness.
default 
defaultYet a
defaultgain the concern raised by young people
default surveyed
default is supported by what YMCAs 
defaultare
default observing
default. A
default 
defaultnumber of YMCAs 
defaultreported 
defaultbeginning to see increased demand 
defaultfor supported accommodation 
defaultfrom young people 
defaulthaving difficulties accessing and sustaining 
defaultprivate rented housing
default in their local area.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1default.default7default 
defaultIn response to the impact that YMCAs ar
defaulte seeing from 
defaultthe
default reforms, they are introducing a range of measures. 
defaultGiven the
defaultir
default l
defaultimited knowledge of the reforms 
defaultand 
defaultjust under half the respondents (49%) saying that they did not feel prepared for the changes
default, 
defaulta
default number of YMCAs 
defaultare
default 
defaultbeginning to deliver
default 
defaultan increase in the
default 
defaultprovision of 
defaultrelevant 
defaulttraining and explanatory information 
defaultthey provide to
default young people.
default 
defaultYMCA Cornwall has begun running a Pre Tenancy Award training scheme as part of their Life Skills Project
default and
default 
defaulta number of 
defaultother YMCAs 
defaultdeliver similar
default schemes such as YMCA South Devon which runs a ‘fit for life’ scheme for 14-16 year olds.
default&#xa0;
default1default.default8 defaultSeveral
default 
defaultYMCAs
default are 
defaultalso 
defaultworking in partnership at a local level with 
defaultboth public 
defaultand private sector landlords to identify and develop suitable move-on accommodation for young people. 
defaultAn example is Crewe YMCA who have initiated a private sector floating support scheme across the borough and
default are seeking additional private landlords to en
defaultter the market and either reduce their rents to Shared Accommodation Rate levels or change their model to a shared one.
default 
defaultA
default significant number of 
defaultYMCAs 
defaultfrom right across England, including Milton Keynes, Exeter, Grimsby
default,
default Cleethorpes and Humber Region, Birmin
defaultgham and South London 
defaultare 
defaultalso 
defaultlooking 
defaultat
default extend
defaulting
default the amount of move-on accommodation provide
defaultd.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1default.default9default 
defaultTo help overcome the 
defaultinitial 
defaultbarrier that the cost of both the deposit and rent presents 
defaultwhen
default looking to leave supported accommodation, a number of 
defaultYMCAs are also 
defaultbeginning 
defaultto 
defaultdeliver a range of schemes
default.
default 
defaultYMCA Central Herts are encouraging saving 
defaulttowards a deposit 
defaultby introducing an 
defaultincentivised savings scheme for residents in partnership with their local Credit Union. Another example is the Accelerated
default Move-On Scheme introduced by Romford YMCA, where the non-housing businesses provide a charitable bursary and rent deposit to young people.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.1default0default To 
defaultaddress the
default 
defaultissue of increasing 
defaultdemand
default for places
default, many YMCAs are running proactive schemes such as 
defaultEastbourne and Wealden YMCA which delivers homelessness prevention workshops in schools.
default&#xa0;
default2default. Direct Payment of Housing Costs to Claimantsdefault2default.1default 
defaultNearly half (47
default%) of all young people responding had heard about the introduction of monthly benefit payments, whi
defaultle a third (3
default5
default%) were aware of plans to introduce the direct payment of housing costs to claimants. Again, YMCAs were identified as the main source of their knowledge on these reforms, suggesting shortcoming in how 
defaultthey 
defaulthave been communicated to young peop
defaultle by 
defaultrelevant 
defaultlocal and national government bodies.
default&#xa0;
default2default.2default While awareness of these reforms is much higher than with the 
defaultprevious 
defaultchanges, the respondents remained concerned that the impact of introducing direct payments of housing costs would be negative. 
default15% of those surveyed felt monthly payments would be beneficial
default to them
default, 
defaultwhile 
defaultonly 
default11
default% felt that directly receiving their housing costs would be positive. The main reason given by those questioned focused on the difficulties 
defaultthey
default find managing their finances, and the potential for these reforms to lead to increased levels of debt, rent arrears, evictions and eventually homelessness. 
defaultT
defaulthe widespread reluctance and anxiety towards these reforms is demonstrated by 86% of those young p
defaulteople surveyed saying that if given the choice they would choose to have their housing benefit paid directly to their landlord.
default&#xa0;
default2default.default3default The concerns raised by the young people surveyed were echoed by the YMCAs who are particularly concerned with the period wh
defaulten young people move-on into the community. These reforms, without a managed transition phase, 
defaultwere felt to 
defaulthave 
defaultthe 
defaultpotential to place unnecessary extra pressure on this already vulnerable gro
defaultup during this
default critical period in their move to independence. 
default&#xa0;
default2default.default4default 
defaultFirst
defaultly by delaying move-on rates
default,
default 
defaultas 
defaultYMCAs 
defaultwill be reluctant to move
default vulnerable young people 
defaultinto independent living if this could lead to them quickly going into arrears
default. 
default 
defaultSecondly, due to the predicted increase in the levels of arrears, evictions 
defaultand homelessness resulting from vulnerable young people being unable to manage their housing costs, YMCAs expect to see an increase in demand for supported accommodation
default.
default&#xa0;
default2default.default5default While issues around budgeting are the biggest concern of the young people survey
defaulted 
defaultregarding
default the introduction of direct payment of housing costs, the 
defaultmost 
defaultpressing issue for 
defaultthe future of 
defaultYMCAs 
defaultremains
default the
defaultir
default classification as ‘exempt’ or ‘non-exempt’ accommodation.
default 
defaultUnder the current arrangements, the majority of the accommodation provided by the YMCAs would be classified as ‘exempt’, however uncertainty remains around a number of YMCA managed schemes. 
defaultAn example is 
defaultSupported Lodgings schemes
default run by YMCAs across Engla
defaultnd
default; 
defaultwhere
default YMCAs recruit community hosts who have spare rooms 
defaultto 
defaultaccommodate a young person in need as a ‘lodger’. 
defaultIn these cases YMCAs receive the young person’s housing costs, and then pay the community hosts for their room.
default&#xa0;
default2default.default6default 
defaultFor YMCAs providing accom
defaultmodation and services that are not classified as being ‘exempt’, vulnerable residents will be paid 
defaulttheir housing benefit directly
default.
default This would mean that the cost of additional support services offered in these types of accommodation would not be covered. Al
defaultso, claimants
default receiving their own housing benefit may also put their tenancies at 
defaultYMCA
defaults 
defaultat 
defaultrisk if they are not able to pay their rent in full
default. 
default 
defaultAt present, residents in most YMCAs are responsible for the payment of a 
defaultsmall 
defaultpersonal service charge
default, which
default 
defaultis manageabl
defaulte for the majority, but YMCAs still
default incur arrears on these payments of around 10%
default of the total amount due
default. If this was translated into an equivalent loss against the total rent, this would 
defaultrepresent
default a significant sum. 
default&#xa0;
default2default.default7default The current lack of 
defaultclarity provided by the government at a national and local level on the issue of ‘exempt’ classification 
defaultputs the viability of many YMCAs at risk and 
defaultmakes any long-term planning difficult. YMCAs, along with YMCA England, have been working with
default and making 
defaultrepresentations to
default local council
defaults
default and the Department of Work and Pensions 
defaultover the last year 
defaultto seek further clarification on this matter.
default&#xa0;
default2default.default8default 
defaultIn response to the impact that YMCAs are expecting to see from 
defaultthese 
defaultreforms, they are introducing a range of 
defaultmeasures. The young people surveyed suggested
default that their greatest need in preparation for these reforms was more information as well as additional training to help them manage their finances.
default 
defaultTo address this 
defaultneed
default, YMCA England and YMCAs have produced a ran
defaultge of materials 
defaultand training 
defaultaimed at informing young people of the 
defaultreforms
default. An example 
defaultis 
default‘
defaultYour Guide to
default Universal Credit’ 
defaultwhich was circulated widely across the
default YMCA
default movement.
default&#xa0;
default2default.default9default To support young people with their financial management, l
defaultast year YMCAs provided 10,693 young people 
defaultwith basic life skills training
default. 
defaultTaking
default 
defaultNorth London YMCA 
defaultas an example, they
default run a ‘My Bank’ money management scheme
default for their residents
default and 
defaultSouth London YMCA have introduced 
defaulta new process which sets clear expec
defaulttations on rent payments
default which
default has assisted them in reducing their overall arrears from 14% to 2% per year.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3default. Localised Council Tax Supportdefault3default.1 defaultA significant number of the young people questioned (
default4
default2
default%) were aware
default of the removal of Crisis Loans and Community Care Grants, however only just over a quarter (
default28
default%) were aware of the introduction of 
defaultCouncil Tax Support. The main sources of information on these were the YMCA and in the case of 
defaultthe removal of 
defaultCrisis L
defaultoans a
defaultnd Community Care Grants 
defaulttheir local Job Centre.
default&#xa0;
default3default.2default 
defaultOnce again there were very few young people 
defaultresponding 
defaultthat 
defaultfelt these reforms would have a positive impact on their lives. 
default10
default%
default felt 
defaultthe introduction of Council Tax Support would have a positive impact 
defaulton them, while only 
default8
default% felt that the impact of the Localised Social Fund would be positive.
default The key concern raised by the young people 
defaultwas the difficulties the removal of Crisis Loans and Community Care Grants had made in being
default able
default to access finance, in particular capital, when in situations of need. A number of the respondents also raised the problems they were having or would have in paying Council Tax on already limited budgets
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3default.3default 
defaultThe views expressed by the young people surve
defaultyed were suppor
defaultted by findings from the YMCAs, 
defaultwho are seeing 
defaultyoung people 
defaultthat
default 
defaultare now eligible to pay some form of Council Tax
default finding it more difficult for 
defaultto manage 
defaultfinancially
default. 
defaultA
defaultgain the move-on stage was identified as being critical, with both the la
defaultck of access to finance and 
defaultthe 
defaultburden of paying Council Tax 
defaultputting 
defaultadditional financial pressure on them at an already difficult time.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3default.4default As with the other reform
defaults
default, 
defaultthe
default 
defaultLocalised Council Tax Support was 
defaultagain 
defaultidentified as contributing to a decline in
default move-on rates and an increase
default in demand for supporting accommodation amongst young people.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4default. Household Benefit Cap &amp; Social Sector Size Criteriadefault4default.1default 
defaultT
defaulthe introduction of both the Household Benefit Cap and Social Sector Size Criteria have to date only had a limited impact on the YMCAs and the young people they work with. 
defaultThis
default is 
defaultreflected in the responses received by th
defaultose young people
default surveyed, with a si
defaultgnificant majority believing the
default Household Benefit Cap 
default(78%) 
defaultand Social Sector Size Criteria
default 
default(65%) 
defaultwould have no 
defaultimmediate 
defaultimpact on them.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4default.default2default 
defaultHowever, a number of YMCAs
default 
defaultare seeing
default 
defaultthe introduction of the Social Sector Size Criteria 
defaultas 
defaultfurther 
defaultexacerbating
default the problem of moving young people on from supported accommodation. 
defaultF
defaultirstly
default due to
default people ‘downsizing’ t
defaulto avoid the financial penalties further limit
defaulting
default the number of appropriately sized social housing available to young people. Secondly, youn
defaultg people who are fortunate enough to be offered a place in social housing are less likely to take this up if it 
defaultis not appropriately sized and would mean
default being instantly hit with a financial penalty.   
default 
default&#xa0;default5default. Recommendationsdefault5default.1default Based on the findings set out in this response, the YMCA wishes to make the following recommendations to the Work and Pensions Select Committee.
default&#xa0;
default5default.2 defaultCommunicate with young people on the reformsdefault5default.2.1default As the response demonstrates, young people’s knowledge
default of the reforms taking place to housing support is extremely limited. For significant change
defaults such as the reduction in the Local Housing A
defaultllowance and 
defaultthe raising of the age for the Shared A
defaultccommodatio
defaultn R
defaultate, fewer than 20% of the young people questioned w
defaultere aware that these had been introduced. Even for the most recognised change (The Social Sector Size Criteria), less than half of the respondents were aware of its introduction. 
default&#xa0;
default5default.2.2default These figures are even more concerning when considering that the majo
defaultrity (90%) of the respondents live in supported accommodation
default and are benefit recipients. T
defaulthis indicates a failing by national and local government to effectively communicate these changes to young people, denying them the opportunity to prepare and respon
defaultd effectively to the reforms.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 1: The YMCA proposes that the Government work with service providers to ensure that information about the reforms to the support for housing costs is tailored to young people.default&#xa0;
default5default.3 defaultEnd discrimination against yodefaultung people in the support arrangementsdefault5default.3.1default As highlighted in this response, young people are already finding it disproportionately more difficult to find housing and they are seeing the choices available to them becoming increasingly limited. The feeling
default amongst the young people surveyed is that the reforms to the support for housing costs is not going to improve this situation, with no more than 15% thinking that any of the changes will positively impact on their lives.
default&#xa0;
default5default.3.default2default The support available for h
defaultousing costs should not perpetuate this
default problem
default, especially based on a false assumption that all young people can remain living at home. The welfare system should be primarily based on ‘need’ rather than actively discriminate against people based on ‘age’.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 2: The YMCA strongly opposes any moves towards the removal of housing benefit entitlement for under 25s.default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 3: The YMCA proposes that the shared accommodation rate be removed.default&#xa0;
default5default.4 defaultOffer protection for vulnerable young peopledefault5default.4.1default As the evidence in this response demonstrates, the overwhelming preference (86%) of young people living in YMCAs is to continue to have their housing benefits paid directly to their landlord. The Government needs to exercise caution in its desire to
default pay housing benefit direct to claimant and respond to the views being expressed by vulnerable young people.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 4: The YMCA proposes that people living in supported accommodation remain exempt from directly receiving their housing benefit defaultpayments.default&#xa0;
default5default.4.2default 
defaultLinked to this, t
defaulthe potential loss of funding for additional support services along with the risks associated with paying vulnerable people their benefits directly mean
default the future viability of many 
defaultYMCAs across England and the valuable sup
defaultport they provide to young people depends on the decision made on what constitutes ‘exempt
default’
default accommodation.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 5: defaultThe YMCA proposes that the Government work with service providers to broaden the definition of ‘exempt’ to ensure it reflects the defaultdifferent models of supported accommodation delivered across the sector. default&#xa0;
default5default.5default Encourage a successful transition of vulnerable young people into independencedefault5.5.1default Moving
default from supported accommodation to living independently is already a challenging time for 
defaultvulnerable 
defaultyoung people, both financially and emotionally. Young people felt having to begin managing their own housing benefit immediately upon leaving supported accom
defaultmodation had the potential to put additional pressure on them, increasing the likelihood for their transition to independence failing.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 6: The YMCA proposes the introduction of progressive pathway for people leaving supported accommodationdefault, whereby they can choose to continue to have their housing benefit paid to their landlord for an agreed period of time while they receive a tailored package of defaultrelevantdefault training and support.default&#xa0;
default5default.5.2default With the replacement of Crisis Loans and Community Care G
defaultrants with ‘cashless grants’, the Government has significantly reduced young people’s access to capital in situations of need. This lack of capital can be particularly critical when young people are looking to move out of supporting accommodation in paying
default for a deposit and other related costs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 7: The YMCA proposes that the Government work with relevant organisations to develop and promote financial products targeted at young people, in particular to help them access capital when moving frodefaultm supported accommodation.default&#xa0;
default5default.6 defaultTackle the housing shortagedefault5default.6.1default 
defaultFinally t
defaulthe reforms to the support for housing costs should not been seen as a substitute to the urgent need in England to build more homes, an issue which underpins all the points raised by
default the young people surveyed. As part of its Housing Strategy, the Government needs to focus on the housing needs of young people, particularly those in most need.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation 8: The YMCA proposes that the Government, private sector and social landlords defaultwork together to invest in house building and increase the availability of social rent models and affordable private sector rentals.default&#xa0;
