[[[from Mr ]]]

[[[Carins]]]

[[[ and Ms ]]]

[[[Munnoch]]]1. Personal background Mr Carins – A Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner with extensive experience within Local Government.Ms Munnoch – A Marketing and Sales executive working for an international company&#xa0;2. Personal complaint to LGO 2011 – LGO came to agreement with Council; that in exchange for the Council to reinvestigate nuisance issue then LGO would not investigate- April ‘12 LGO closed matter; finding of “no fault” with Council, informal agreement – LGO’s decision internal reviewed – providing detailed new evidence and consequences of decision - result of internal review advising no change to decision- Councils 2nd investigation flawed – second complaint to LGO September ’13 (under considered) – encountering problems with LGO.It should also be noted that when working within Local Government there is experience of being under investigation by the LGO &#xa0;3. Proviso of submission; - As indicate above there currently is an complaint being considered by LGO hence these comments are made in good faith on the understanding that there will be no detriment to the consideration of our complaint before the LGO 1. 

[[[Reorganisation and transformation]]]4. Comment; - It is clear from evidence provided that the new complaint handling system is expected to deal with and streamline more complaints through to investigation (suggested level of around 6,000 complaints for this year). This is in excess of the previous levels when there were more investigators. Hence it is clear that once the 6,000 complaints are passed through to “commencement of investigation” then with less staff but more complaints then there will be a further “decimation “ on what-ever ground the investigators can use to disencumber themselves from complaints. Hence it is envisaged that more aggressive techniques and extension of the not inconsiderable discretion of the LGO will be used to get the complaints down to the point when only a couple of dozen cases will be actually investigated (see 2011/12 figures 25 reports finding mal-administration out of 96,000 contacts (0.038%)).5. It is the process of filtering complaints that will require the greatest scrutiny in order to ensure fairness and to prevent complaints that should have actually been investigated are not squeezed out due to targets, deadlines and pressure of further complaints. Hopefully the LGO will  be able to get back from their “not on top of their game” position.

[[[&#xa0;]]]In our view, Parliament can legitimately and reasonably call the Commission to account, to explain how it plans to implement its own Review within its budget and to ensure that the Commission operates transparently and efficiently. (Paragraph 41)

[[[&#xa0;]]]6. Comment;-  Scrutiny is to be welcomed – see comments provide in relation to transparency

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;8. In terms of the independence of the 2013 report then it is interesting to note that that one of the 3 persons is the Public Services Ombudsman for Scotland and although we are sure that Mr Martin has come to the task with “clean hands” and has not in any way exerted influence over the other two auditors however it is the fact that his background is as an LGO and in terms of public perception then would the claim of being a fully independent external review hold more credence if all the “auditors” were drawn from a background of not having had any direct association with a LGO service. &#xa0;

[[[9. Recommendation ]]]

[[[LGOs extensive discretion]]]Page 44. Section f – last sentence– It is stated “ there is no capacity in English Law to appeal any aspect of the Ombudsman discretion”&#xa0;We would refer to the R v LCA ex p Liverpool City Council [2001] 1All ER 462 – Lord Justice Henry para 27/ 28 in relation to the use of section 26(6)( c) – ie use of alternative legal remedy – It had been suggested that the LGO had failed to adequately consider not investigating a matter( Section 26(6)(c ) because the person had alternative legal remedy ie Judicial Review (JR).&#xa0;Para 27…Indeed, on those grounds she (LGO) did not consider that sub-section (c) was a bar to her proceedings. I am not sure that she was right in that conclusion. If wrong, she would have had to consider the proviso. And this she addressed in her affidavit:"Had I been advised that judicial review was potentially available to the complainants her, I would have gone on to consider whether I should exercise my discretion under the proviso to Section 26(6) to investigate the complaint. It is my belief that in that event I would have exercised discretion in favour of the complainants because I believe in the particular circumstances of this case it would have been unreasonable to expect the complainants to have been required to resort to the remedy of judicial review. This is because I understood the complainants to be a group in 

[[[modest housing]]], who would have been unlikely to have had the means to pursue that remedy from their own resources, particularly having regard to the uncertainty of the remedy; it seems to me that it is by no means certain that judicial would be appropriate for mal-administration where it related to a breach of the Code of Conduct. Further I would have particularly had in mind that it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, for the complainants to obtain the necessary evidence to support such an application. Much of the evidence upon which I relied in my report was not available in documentary form, but emerged during interviews with the members concerned. The complainants however do not have the investigators powers given to the Commissioner by the Act and thus that evidence would have been unobtainable by them."28. In my judgment this was a clear case for the application of the proviso. Serious allegations of mal-administration had been made. Such allegations could best be investigated by the resources and powers of the Commissioners, with her powers to compel both disclosure of documents, and the giving of assistance to the investigation. The Commissioner was in a position to get to the bottom of a prima facie case of mal-administration, and the ratepayers would be unlikely to have reached that goal, having regard to the weaknesses of the coercive fact finding potential of judicial review. As she found, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the complainants to obtain the necessary evidence in judicial review proceedings. Additionally, the complainants were a group in modest housing, unlikely to have the means to pursue the remedy. 

[[[The Commissioner was clearly right to use the proviso to continue with her investigation]]]. This case is a good example of a case where the Commissioner's investigation and report can provide the just remedy when judicial review might fail to; and can reach facts, which might not emerge under the judicial review process.    &#xa0;From the above it is clear that the Court may be interested in exploring the use of the LGO discretion and it would seem rather perverse that should the LGO exercise her discretion in an ultra vires manner or an irrational way or in breach of natural justice then, in this current era, she would, it is suspected not be beyond the reach of the Courts.&#xa0;

[[[Consideration could be given to further exploration into the extent to which the LGO could have her discretion challenged in Court and a statement made setting out the position.]]]&#xa0;

[[[13. Publication of guidance on how, when and what consideration are taken into account when exercising discretion. ]]]It is clear that the above Court case demonstrates that the LGO view was that people in modest houses are such that are not able to reach for JR when she exercised her discretion in favour of the complainants. We wonder what size of house would trigger the use of the requirement to seek alternative legal remedy? Is this a fair test of resources?&#xa0;We have searched the LGO web site for information about how such a “means test” is considered when such an exercise is undertaken yet we are unable to find any guidance on this subject area. It is also clear from the Court case that an LGO investigation can ask and probe deeper into a matter that the JR process and hence is this also a factor that would be used when considering her discretion in relation to section 26(6)(c)&#xa0;

[[[Clear guidance should be provided as to the circumstances and considerations that the LGO would take into account when she will determine when a person can be advised that she is to discontinue her investigation on the grounds that the person is required to seek an alternative legal remedy]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[15.  Section 26(6) (c ) Use of alternative legal remedy]]]“26 (6). A Local Commissioner shall not conduct an investigation under this Part of this Act in respect of any of the following matters, that is to say,—  (c)any action in respect of which the person aggrieved has or had a 

[[[remedy by way of proceedings in any court of law:]]]

[[[ ]]]Provided that a Local Commissioner may conduct an investigation notwithstanding the existence of such a right or remedy if satisfied that in the particular circumstances it is not reasonable to expect the person aggrieved to resort or have resorted to it. &#xa0;16. We are initially told by the LGO that this section provides the LGO with the discretion to reject complaints since there is a potential legal remedy still open to the complainant to take against a Council.  We are further told and it is stated on the LGO’s website that section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) is one such Act that the LGO considers is open to take action against the Council since the LGO states “an application by a person aggrieved of a statutory nuisance (S7 of EPA for full list – error -it is not S7 but rather S79).

[[[The Council can be joined in proceedings where action is taken against a neighbour]]]

[[[“]]]. We believe that such statement is at best misleading and if the LGO did reject complaints because the LGO was of the view that section 82 provided an alternative legal remedy that the person should have taken rather than complaining to the LGO then it is suggested that this could constitute an abuse of process and of the LGO’s discretion. (We have sought clarification see para 25 below for comment) &#xa0;17. From looking at some of the recent decisions (eg 13002178) then it appears that the LGO has engaged in using this particular piece of legislation as such a mechanism and it was clearly initially intimated to us by the LGO that S82 is an alternative legal remedy available to her under S26 (6)(c)  &#xa0;18. Consideration of Section 82 -Relevant sub sections below (2)If the magistrates’ court is satisfied that the alleged nuisance exists, or that although abated it is likely to recur on the same premises or, in the case of a nuisance within section 79(1)(ga) above, in the same street the court shall make an order for either or both of the following purposes— (a)requiring the defendant to abate the nuisance, within a time specified in the order, and to execute any works necessary for that purpose; (b)prohibiting a recurrence of the nuisance, and requiring the defendant  within a time specified in the order, to execute any works necessary to prevent the recurrence; and may also impose on the defendant a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. (4)Proceedings for an order under subsection (2) above shall be brought— (a)except in a case falling within paragraph (b), (c) or (d) below] against the person responsible for the nuisance; (b)where the nuisance arises from any defect of a structural character, against the owner of the premises; (c)where the person responsible for the nuisance cannot be found, against the owner or occupier of the premises. (d)in the case of a statutory nuisance within section 79(1)(ga) above caused by noise emitted from or caused by an unattended vehicle or unattended machinery or equipment, against the person responsible for the vehicle, machinery or equipment.&#xa0;(13)If it appears to the magistrates’ court  that neither the person responsible for the nuisance nor the owner or occupier of the premises or the person responsible for the vehicle, machinery or equipment] can be found the court  may, after giving the local authority in whose area the nuisance has occurred an opportunity of being heard, direct the authority to do anything which the court would have ordered that person to do.&#xa0;19. The historical introduction of section 82 can be traced through Hansard and other documents produced at the time but in essence this section was introduced for a variety of reasons the first being that people could easily take action against Councils eg Housing departments where there were conditions that were considered to be a nuisance and problems had been encountered because Councils were unable to serve a nuisance abatement notice effectively on themselves. It was also seen as an alternative to action in the County Court or High Court for the matters listed as statutory nuisance for whatever reason the person did not want to ask the Council health department to investigate it under their powers to do so. &#xa0;20. An action can be instigated in the Magistrates Court quickly after giving notice to the person causing the nuisance. If the nuisance was established the Court would produce an 

[[[order]]] against the author of the nuisance.  S82 was never introduced as a mechanism to seek to review the performance of a Council’s action and its clear from the section there is no statutory framework to do so. There are rare occasions when a Council can be cited and this relates to sub-section 13 which allows action to be taken against the Council in circumstance where the author of the nuisance/ owner cannot be found.&#xa0;21. However it is clear from the above (S 82(4)) that the action in the Court is to be commenced against the 

[[[person responsible]]] for the nuisance. If that person is the Council then obviously action can be commenced against the Council. However the LGO has advised that the use of Section 82 is seen as an alternative remedy where the Council is not the author of the nuisance but rather a neighbour.We believe that this interpretation could be considered as an attempt to be able to use this as an excuse for not taking action against a Council who have not performed their statutory duty of investigation of a nuisance.&#xa0;22. Clearly for S82 the action is in nuisance against the person responsible for the matter in most cases a neighbour. The complaint to the LGO is in relation to injustice caused by the mal-administration of a Council. The Magistrates Court would rule on nuisance and if proven then it would issue an order. The Magistrates Court could not dispense a remedy against the Council for mal-administration that is the role of either the High Court (JR) or the LGO. &#xa0;23. However, if the LGO interpretation is correct then I am sure that any person with a mal-administration complaint against the Council in relation to statutory nuisance would be delighted to seek to a “judicial review” of the Council in the Magistrates Court rather than in the High Court or seek to involve the LGO. If this was the case then all statutory nuisance complaints about the service provision of Council could be redirected and therefore should other legislation be introduced for all other areas of the LGO work so that people have the same right of redress to the Magistrates Court and hence there would be little requirement for the LGO? &#xa0;

[[[24. Recommendation]]]

[[[Section 82 should not be cited on the LGO web site nor should it be expressed by investigators as a mechanism of alternative legal remedy (S 26(6)(c) in relation to neighbour nuisances and hence must not be used as a reason for dropping the complaint against a Council. ]]]&#xa0;25. 

[[[Use of section 24(A) LGA74 – Wide discretion of LGO]]]&#xa0;We further asked the question of the LGO; if taking action in nuisance against our neighbour would cause our complaint with the LGO to be discontinued and the use of S82, we were advised as follows&#xa0;“The 26(6) (c) remedy would not apply if you took action against your neighbour. This is because 26(6)c only applies if people take action against the Council. However, the Ombudsman has wide-ranging discretion and may decide not to start an investigation or to discontinue an investigation. One reason why she may decide to discontinue an investigation is where someone takes legal action against someone else. In your case, that would be your neighbour. Or, she may discontinue if she thinks the complainant should take legal action against someone else.”&#xa0;It seems as if the wide-ranging discretion of the LGO is such that any action we could take to prevent nuisance might be construed as grounds to drop investigation into mal administration of the Council. If that is the case then such wide ranging discretion should be better defined since it would seem bizarre that action to prevent nuisance against another person, not the Council, would cause a discontinuance of the LGO’s mal administration investigation. It seems odd that parliament would seek to define when such powers can be used ie S26 and then provide such a wide ranging discretion that “trumps” everything else  &#xa0;It is interesting that slightly different advice starts to emerge once pressed. Whenever the LGO is pressed their standard response as in this case is that we are told not to contact the LGO, which further goes to the heart of the issue of transparency. &#xa0;

[[[26. Recommendation]]]

[[[Clear unambiguous, correct, guidance should be provided at the first point of contact in relation to how the LGO discretion is considered and applied. ]]]

[[[External report- typos]]]?Page   48. “ These tests have been applied above 

[[[points (ii) (iii) (iv]]])” – it is hard to see which points are these – maybe some clarification?&#xa0;Page 71 “we accept that an internal process of review cannot achieve the same appearance of justice as an internal review process.“ We wonder if the word should read external?&#xa0;&#xa0;28. “

[[[Informal agreements of the LGO]]]” – allowing Councils to re-investigate issues – then closing matter with a “

[[[no fault]]]” finding – yet Jerry White (former LGO) when he gave evidence to a Select Committee 2005 advised that “ in the vast majority of cases with an informal resolution if we had investigated we would have found fault”(HC 458 20045)&#xa0;At best a “ no fault” finding is disingenuous in such cases, since cases are not investigated and deals are brokered between the Council and the LGO eg that in exchange for another investigation then the LGO will look no further and close the case. We wonder if cases should be reported in a neutral fashion to actually reflect what occurred eg “Informal remedy;-no investigation unable to comment on fault “&#xa0;This leads to problems when the same matter is subsequently complained about when the Council’s second investigation is also as bad as the first. Requests have been made for these types of complaints to be considered in its entirety and since the first matter was not investigated it seems reasonable that if the Council second attempt is also being complained about then should not the whole case be reopened when considering it for investigation. It is palpable wrong in the interest of fairness to artificially compartmentalise what is effectively an ongoing issue&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[29. Recommendation ]]]

[[[Where matters have been informally agreed and a second investigation is agreed then the first complaint should have the potential to be reopened and subsequent complaints considered holistically otherwise the system is being biased in favour of the Council since they have already been given a massive benefit and then they are given yet another. Hence to ensure fairness then consideration needs to be giving to providing a mechanism to “park” informal agreements (]]]

[[[sine die]]]

[[[) until such times as the subsequent matters have been undertaken.]]] 

[[[Also matters to be reported in a natural and factual manner]]]&#xa0;30. 

[[[Internal review mechanism]]]It is clear that the external auditors see little merit in a fair and open review mechanism for appeals against decisions made by the LGO. Statistics show that a staggering 10% of complainant ask for a review even when the review mechanism is so severely stacked against any likelihood of there being a different result.The current internal review mechanism flies in the face of natural justice (no man shall be the judge of his own cause). There is an attempt to try and produce an artificial separation by suggestion that a different person not in the same LGO team undertakes the review but effectively this division is false since it is a small pool of staff all bound to the same doctrines/ peer pressure and cooperate solidarity then in these circumstances the likelihood of a genuine meaningful review is very limited since one has to consider the organisation as an entire cohort. &#xa0;

[[[31. Recommendation]]]

[[[If there is to be no appeal to say a Tribunal as with the ICO and their Decision Notices then it is suggested that a totally independent external expert could be paid from central funds (not LGO funds) to undertake the reviews. This would be a step toward providing public confidence with a review system and would at least be more in keeping with natural justice and not in the pay of the LGO ]]]&#xa0;32. Miscellaneous&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;From our dealings with the LGO it’s clear that they are an organisation, which are under severe pressure from a public that comes to them disenchanted with services they have received from Councils. People come to the LGO “wound up” in the anticipation that the LGO will help and then they meet with a similar wall of animosity and dismissmiveness. We seem to receive a hostile and non-empathic response from the LGO. We would not list the LGO as customer oriented/focused body.   &#xa0;It seems as if the service has a phenomenal range of unfettered discretion, which is undefined and nebulously ambiguous. The power seems to be used in all ways so as to not investigate complaints rather than to look at injustices caused by mal-administration. It is suggested that many of the wide-ranging discretion requires to be codified so that everyone is aware of the range and extent and hence provide some transparency. &#xa0;It is also considered inappropriate to use S82 EPA as an alternative legal remedy. That a “no fault” finding for an un-investigated informal LGO agreement requires closer consideration since it is wrong to suggest “no fault” when this has not been established. Also matters that are a continuation ie where Councils are given a second chance should be considered holistically. There requires to be a review system in which the public can have more confidence in and, as a minimum there requires to be some genuine independence.&#xa0;We hope that the LGO can “get on top of its game.” &#xa0;29 October 2013&#xa0;1&#xa0;
