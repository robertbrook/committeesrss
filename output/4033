[normal]Although certain genres, such as impartial news and current affairs are essential to a public service remit, ‘public service’ s
[normal]hould not be seen as confined to specific genres.  The values of ‘intrinsic importance and merit’ apply across the board.  The BBC’s non-commercial status has underpinned its leading role in a wide range of genres, including innovative comedy, popular dram
[normal]a and numerous entertaining factual formats. This competition with commercially funded channels has been essential to maintain a high standard across terrestrial broadcasting as a whole.
[normal]The Corporation’s role in pioneering technological developments in th
[normal]e public interest is central to its public service remit, as is its delivery of exceptional online content.

[normal]This proposal also assumes that a limited part of the broadcast output can be described as ‘public service content’ rather than recognising that broadcas
[normal]ting as a whole offers a service to the public

[normal]46. As newspapers, that are not subject to impartiality requirements, become ‘broadcasters’, with online audio-
[normal]visual content, there are renewed threats to impartiality rules. 
[normal]….
[normal] The standards of public service broadcasting, and in particular the all-important requirements for impartiality and balance, could be seriously jeopardised by the effects of politically pa
[normal]rtisan broadcasting creeping in through the back door. In our view, online versions of newspapers should therefore come within the regulatory scope of 
[normal]Ofcom
[normal], but with a lighter regime than for conventional broadcasters
