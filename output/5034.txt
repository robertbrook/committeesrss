[[[INTRODUCTION]]]1.1              On the 6th November 2013, the Home Affairs Committee launched a new inquiry on Police and Crime Commissioners in order to examine the work and effectiveness of the newly-created statutory role that first took office on the 22nd November 2012.1.2              This response by the North Wales Police and Crime Panel (NWPCP) complements the written submissions made by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) in relation to Police and Crime Panels.  However, the NWPCP wanted to reiterate the following points:&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[HOLDING THE COMMISSIONER TO ACCOUNT]]]2.1              During the last year, the NWPCP has worked closely with the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) to develop a good working relationship and whilst the NWPCP is becoming more experienced and knowledgeable, its activities to date have been mostly reactive due to the timescales involved and resources available. Whilst it is important that the NWPCP and PCC each know their own roles, it is also imperative that they understand each other’s roles and responsibilities.2.2              There has been some confusion and consequent frustration around the role of a good Police and Crime Panel (PCP), particularly during the transition period.  Whilst the NWPCP has a good relationship with the PCC, the Home Office should provide clearer guidance on the roles and responsibilities of a PCP, to ensure accountability, transparency and good governance.               A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been drafted to capture the processes between the NWPCP, PCC and North Wales Police. The MoU will be designed to outline processes and procedures together with the timelines in which they are to be achieved. In addition, there has been some confusion amongst Members of the NWPCP as to the definition of ‘operational matters’, matters upon which the PCC has no remit.  2.3              An area of particular concern in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 (Act) is the mis-match between the extensive and wide-ranging powers of the PCC and the envisaged light-touch scrutiny powers of the PCP.  In order to carry out their roles and responsibilities under the Act, it is felt that the powers the PCPs have are limited and in order to truly hold the PCC to account and provide effective challenge and scrutiny, stronger powers are required, particularly in relation to veto – a veto should mean a veto.  2.4              It is also felt that greater resources are required in order to provide effective scrutiny and challenge.  This would enable the NWPCP to be more proactive in its role and prepare a Forward Work Programme for topics that require scrutiny to allow it to gather evidence and investigate the key priorities, particularly in relation to the Police and Crime Plan and precept but also over and above its key statutory functions.  This would also help support the PCC in his role and aid the development of policies.2.5              Under the old Police Authority regime there would be a number of Sub-Committees with remits to scrutinise different fields of practise within the Police Authority. Although it is clear that the PCC has set up internal performance teams, it is unclear as to how the makeup of such teams is decided, how they arrive at conclusions and who if anyone other than the PCC himself can scrutinise the processes used to reach such conclusions. It is argued that the processes are not transparent enough and there should be a more proactive role for the PCP Members to observe and scrutinise these new practises. Again, this links directly to the shortage of funding.2.6              Earlier engagement with the PCC is needed, so that the NWPCP is made aware of the PCC’s plans and is able to scrutinise the key decisions made by the PCC. This will be particularly important when the PCC starts commissioning and decommissioning services.2.7              Whilst PCPs have limited powers in relation to the resolution of complaints, it has taken up a disproportionate amount of time and resources. Although detailed guidance has been produced by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), the lack of experience of Host Authority members of staff dealing with such complaints has led to a tentative and some-what proliferated approach to their categorisation.

[[[ENGAGEMENT]]]3.1              The NWPCP recognises the need to build relationships and engage with partners, particularly the Community Safety Partnerships in the future.  This would aid the development and review of priorities around the Police and Crime Plan.3.2              The NWPCP also recognises the need for greater engagement with the public, so they have an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a PCP.  During the high profile incidents involving PCCs in the first year, there has been a profound misconception amongst the public as to the role and powers of the PCP. Webcasting and social media should be used to address this and educate the public by raising awareness of the role and somewhat limited powers of the PCP. In addition, this will make the PCPs more accountable to the public.3.3              PCPs should not work in a vacuum but work together across Wales, in order to develop and share good practice.  The WLGA has facilitated training and development days, which have been of great benefit to the NWPCP together with chairing the Host Authority Officers’ Group Meeting on a quarterly basis. 3.4               The NWPCP wishes to see the PCC progress with establishing collaboration agreements with other PCCs, policing organisations, local authorities, partners and key stakeholders in the field of community safety, health, social care and education. It is vitally important that collaborations exist with the North West of England and on an all-Wales basis.

[[[LEGAL STATUS OF PCPs IN ]]]

[[[WALES]]]4.1              Due to the stance of the Welsh Government and hence the legal status of PCPs in Wales, its funding is limited to the Home Office Grant only. This leads to an inequality of resources as PCPs in England can draw down financial contributions from the Local Authorities that fall within its Police Force Area to supplement their budget. As a consequence, it is able to deliver greater scrutiny beyond its key statutory functions.4.2              It is felt that the Act could have an adverse effect on the future development of PCPs, particularly as the PCP gains more experience and focuses on their scrutiny role.  The NWPCP feels that this could limit the number of meetings per annum, which would only allow it to concentrate on its key statutory functions, such as the precept, Plan and confirmation hearings.  In addition, limited funding is stifling the creation of much needed Task &amp; Finish Groups, Sub-Committees and the triangulation of PCC evidence.4.3              In relation to transparency, the PCC does publish Decision Notices on their website. However, again due to lack of resources, the NWPCP are reactive rather than proactive in using their general powers to request information from the PCC in relation to the Decision Notices e.g. method used to form conclusion. This relates to the argument for increased resources and a dedicated Scrutiny Forward Work Programme (as many PCPs’ in England have achieved due to a greater level of funding, which has enabled them to employ dedicated members of staff to support the PCP and facilitate Task &amp; Finish Groups). For example, scrutinising the Office of the PCC to ensure they have the appropriate number of staff together with the necessary skills and expertise to perform their statutory functions e.g. commissioning, procurement, HR and legal. This would be particularly relevant if spending on consultancy and agency fees were disproportionately high. 4.4              The Home Office Grant is currently split between Administration Costs,  Translation Costs and Members’ Expenses; the NWPCP feels that the grant should not be demarcated but pooled, and that it be up to the individual PCP to best determine how the grant is spent.4.5              PCPs in Wales are free standing bodies, which also limits the operation of the PCPs.  Any changes to the membership have to be approved by the Home Secretary; which can be a lengthy process. As a result, nominated members have missed one or two meetings whilst the Host Authority for NWPCP awaits Home Secretary approval. This is not the case in England.4.6               PCPs currently claim their Home Office Grant on a quarterly basis, however this administrative task is very time consuming and it would be more efficient to claim on an annual basis.&#xa0;
