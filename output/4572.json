"&#xa0;\nAFS0038Written Evidence submitted by Janet Downs, education researcher and blogger for the Local Schools NetworkThe effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children and what further steps should be taken w\nithin the academies system to bring about a transformati\nonal impact on student outcomes\n?\n1 \nE\nvidence suggests \nsponsored academies are no better than similar non-academies in raising results (Academies Commission 2013\n \nhttp://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1008038/Unleashing-greatness.pdf\n \n).  Converter academies are mainly schools which were good or outstanding before conversion.  Not all converter ac\nademies have maintained this standard post-conversion\n.  Claims confirming Michael Gove’s assertion that converter academies raise results do not exist (Freedom of\n Information response\n \nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/statement_by_mr_gove_re_academy\n \n).\n   The Academies Commission found the claimed advantages of academy conversion were present in non-academies\n (\nop cit\n)\n.\n2  \n \nNational Audit Office (2010) found \nthe\n gap in\n attainment between \ndisadvantaged pupils and others has grown wider in academies than in comparable maintained schools\n (\nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/report/department-for-\neducation-the-academies-programme/\n )\n.  More recent research \ncomparing\n academi\nes with non-academies in bands \naccording to level of disadvantage (as measured by % of students on free school meals), fi\nnds non-academies out-perform\n academies in every band.\n  \n3 \nThe Academies Commission \n(\nop cit\n) \nfound some academies were using admission criteria to deter pupils who could have a negative impact on league table position.  It found n\not all academies were committed to social inclusion\n and warned academis\nation cou\nld have a negative effect on hard-to-place pupils.\n4 \nC\nhanging the structure of schools \ndoes not\n transform student outcomes as evidenced above.  However, academies exist and they need regular monitoring.  An Ofsted visit every few years is insufficient to s\npot any decline in education provision. Local oversight is essential.  The eight \nRegional C\nommissioners who are supposed to do this monitoring will not be as ef\nfective as day-to-day oversight \nby local authorities.  The advertisement (\nTES \n6 \n/12/\n2013) for th\nese commissioners even suggested they could be part-time positions.  This shows a woeful under-appreciation of the work involved.\nThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors\n5  Recent e\nvidence (eg BAU Fou\nndation/Mentora Academies Trust\n \nhttp://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2013/12/how-did-a-private-turkish-university-and-the-carlyle-group-a-global-asset-management-company-end-up-in-the-mix-to-run-three-rural-schools-in-oxfordshire/\n \n) sugges\nts approved academy sponsor \nstatus is\n conferred without due diligence.   The rush to find sponsors, encouraged by financial \ninducements\n (\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors\n )\n, appears to take priority\n over suitability\n.  There is also growing evidence that some academy trusts are “vehicles” by which shareholders can receive a r\neturn\n on \ni\nnvestment\ns in linked for-profit companies\n (eg Wey Education Schools Trust was set up as a “vehicle” by Zail Enterprises Ltd, a subsidiary of Wey Education PLC\n.  This is made clear in Wey Education P\nLC Preliminary Announcement for year ending \n31/12/12:\n  \nhttp://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=201305310700089451F\n \n).  Again, it appears insufficient attention is \npaid to discover any potential links w\nith for-profit compani\nes which c\nould pose a conflict of interest.\n6 \nThe process of academy conversion does not encourage formal consultation with stakeholders until too late in the process.\n  According to Department for Education rules\n (\nhttp://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/academies/b00229234/becoming-an-academy/consultation\n )\n, \nGoverning Bodies are supposed to consult informal\nly with \nstakeholders\n before making\n a Resolution to become an academy. \n  \nWhether these informal c\nonsultations actually happen\n before Resolutions are passed is unclear.  Formal consultations do not take place until\n after the Secretary of State has given perm\nission for conversion to go ahead, academy trusts \nhave been established\n and companies registered with Companies House\n.   \nThis gives the impression \nconversion is a done deal.  The Governing Body \ndecide\ns\n who to consul\nt, how the consultation is\n done and the t\nimescale\n.\n  This suggests \nGoverning Bodies can get away with minimal consultation.\n7\n \nThere should be a statutory requirement for consu\nltations to take place before \nResolution\ns to convert take\n place.  This requirement should also lay down who is to be consulted, how it is to be done and for how long.\n8\n \nThere is evidence \nschools are being pressurized into becoming academies. \nIn the \ndebate\n on forced academy conversion \n(Hansard 12/3/13 Column 40WH\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm\n )\nRosie Cooper MP described \nthe Schools Commissioner, \nD\nr \nLiz Sidwell, \nas “\npeddling the Education Secretary’s ideological wares as if she was some kind of snake oil saleswoman\n.”\n  Downhills School is \nan infamous example.   An Ofsted monitoring visit to the school, which was in special measures, judged it to be \nimproving.  But the Secretary of State intervened and pronounced it was failing.  Ofsted returned within less than a term with the same lead inspector and overturned its previous judgement.  Th\ne school was handed over to Harris\n against the wishes of the ma\njority of parents.  The career of the head teacher was ruined.\n  This debacle also brought Ofsted into disrepute.\n  \nS\nuch tactics are unacceptable.  \n \n9  The duties described in the adve\nrtisement  \nfor Regional \nCommissioners made it clear\n promoting academy con\nversion was an important part of the job, if not the primary duty.  Yet\n,\n as stated above\n,\n \nthere is no evidence \nchanging school structure raises educational standards.  It is not acceptable for taxpayers’ money\n to be used to promote policies which have\n no p\nroven benefits and many disadvanta\nges including \nthe possibility of taxpayers’ money being diverted from education into shareholders’ pockets.\n10 \nSome local authorities appear to be using the academies programme to \ndrop\n \nresponsibility\n \nfor \nschools \napart from\n statutory requirement\ns.  Linc\nolnshire acts as a case study.\n \n11 \nIn 2011, Lincolnshire\n recommended it should\n \n“\nencourage all schools to j\noin a single Trust through CfBT”\n (\nMinutes of Extraordinary Meeting of \nLincolnshire Children and Young P\neople Scrutiny Co\nmmittee, \n26 July 2011\n \nhttp://lincolnshire.moderngov.co.uk/Data/Children%20and%20Young%20People%20Scrutiny%20Commit\ntee/20110726/Agenda/Document%201.pdf\n \n).  \nCfBT \nran Lincolnshire’\ns School Improvement Service and its Directo\nr,\n \nAndy Breckon\n, was also \nAssistant Director of Childr\nen's Services.  This gave rise to accusations of conflict of interest which the Council deni\ned\n (\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/84863/response/214163/attach/9/SKMBT%20C55211092209341.pdf\n )\n.\n12 \nLincolnshire’s decision to encoura\nge academy conversion was motivated by the estimated \nnegative \nimpact \nof academis\nation \non its budget for Children’s Services \nwhich\n would present Lincolnshire with\n “\nchallenges in terms of retaining its existing school support service provision and support\ning its most vulnerable schools” (Minutes \nop cit\n). \n  The answer to the problem, then, seemed to lie in passing \nthis \nresponsibility to schools themselves.\n13 Lincolnshire County Council \nmay have come to\n regret its decisi\non\n.   It belatedly realised it was be\ncoming difficult, if not impossible, to regulate school place supply when West Grantham Academies Trus\nt \ndecided wi\nthout consultation to close \nCh\narles Read Academy \nagainst the wishes of parents, pupils and the Council\n (\nhttp://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/education/education-news/school-closure-decision-under-fire-from-council-1-4747377\n )\n.  The academy was only saved by th\ne Department for Education handing it over to another academy trust\n (\nhttp://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/education/educ\nation-news/charles-read-academy-saved-from-closure-by-trust-1-5181862\n )\n.\n14 This case study shows the academy conversion programme can encourage local authorities to \navoid all but statutory duties to \nschools, can encourage schools to join academy chains\n which may not be in the \nbest interests\n of pupils nor value-for-money \nand makes it difficult for local authorities to manage the supply of school places.  Local authorities can no longer commission their own schools – there is a presumption that new school\ns will be academies or free schools.  Yet the National Audit Office \n2013 (\nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10314-001-Free-Schools-Book-Copy.p\ndf\n ) found \nhalf of areas where the need for extra school places was high or sever\ne\n received no applications \nfrom free school proposers.   L\nocal authorities have to tout around for chains or sponsors to set up schools\n when new provision is required\n.\nThe \nrole of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands\n15 \nI\nn the event of an Academy failing, th\ne Department for Education\n allocate\ns\n a new sponsor to take over the particular institution.\n  The same is true if an academy chain wants to close\n an academy\n.    The choice of sponsor/\nacademy chain \nwould not be a Local Aut\nhority decision but would be imposed by the Department for Edu\ncation.  I\nt appears, then, \nacademies are in the gift of the Secretary of State.  This can pave the way for future take-over by for-profit education providers to \nrun\n English academies.\n16 The Regional Commissioners being recruited are supposed to \nauthorise new sponso\nrs.  It’s unclear by what criteria the Comm\nissioner will judge prospective sponsors\n.   Neither is it clear how the Commissioners, especially those working part-time, will be able to adequately support and intervene failing academies over a much wider area \nthan any local authority.  Local authorities are much better placed to support and challenge local schools than remote bodies.\nThe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations \noperating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in su\npport for schools at this level\n17\n \nLocal authorities should be the “middle tier” between the Secretary of Sta\nte and individual schools.  They h\nave \nlocal knowledge.  Their responsibilities should be towards all the area’s schools whatever their structure: to p\nromote co-operation between \nschools\n; to ensure individual \nschools do not act in their own interests to the\n detriment of other schools and particular children; \nto monitor schools admission criteria to ensure they adhere to the Schools Admission  Code; \nto intervene and support \nstruggling school\ns\n; to ensure academy chains are not using their monopoly to impose pa\nrticular methods or resources on their acade\nmies and denying heads the \nfreedom they had when they were local authority schools, and to have access to the financial records of academies to ensure there is no misuse of public funds (e\ng Priory Federation \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/media-statement-in-relation-to-the-priory-federation-of-academies-trust\n \n) or nepotism (eg Kings Scien\nce Academy\n \nhttp://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/i/kings%20science%20academy%20investigation%20report.pdf\n \n).\n18 \nIn summary, local authorities have three roles: organizing partnerships; commissioning services, and championing pupils, parents and communities.What role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they \nraise with regard to governance arrangements\n19 \nEarly academy chains (Harris, ARK) were sponsors which offered support, expertise and financial help to their academies.  The need to provide financial backing has \ngone\n – the National Audit Offi\nce 2010 \n(\nop ci\nt\n) \nfound a “significant proportion”\n of pledges had not been honoured in any case.  The National Audit\n Office also expressed concern about conflicts of inte\nrest between academies and \nsponsors when the latter exerted pressure on academies to purchase service\ns\n from them\n.\n20 \nThis conflict of interest has become more of an issue as academy chains increasingly \nsupply \nback-office services once \nprovided by local authorities.  Academies are tied into contracts with their chains \nwhich may not be the best value-for-\nmo\nney or of appropriate standard.  This is exacerbated when chains impose resources, curricula and methods of working on to their academies.  This reduces the autonomy of heads – the Academies Commission \n(\nop cit\n) \nheard evidence from some heads of academies i\nn chains that they had less freedom than when they were local authority maintained.  \n21 \nWorse, \nthe \nprovision of centralised curricula by a ch\nain risks poor quality \nmaterials or methods:  two of the \nfour academies sponsored by \nLearning Schools Trust, the\n c\nharitable arm of Kunskapsskola\nn\n, the Swedish for-profit education provider, were judged Requires Improvement in Autumn 2013, and a third was judged Inadequate.   Kunskapsskolan schools all follow the “KED education programme” developed by Kunskapsskolan fo\nr individual learning.  Ofsted criticised the teaching materials for being pitched incorrectly.\n22\n \nPeje Emilsson\n, chair of Kunskapsskolan, \nhas global ambitions. Another of his firms, \nMagnora\n (\nhttp://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6305024\n )\n, has \nset up a school in Delhi which it hopes will be the start of a school chain\n on the sub-continent\n.\n \n Indian teachers will be trained in “KED pedagogies”. \n \nEmilson\n spoke to the US-based, libertarian think-tank, the Cato Institute\n, in 2011\n (\nhttp://www.cato.org/multimedia/cato-video/peje-emilsson-discusses-how-scale-g\nood-schools\n )\n, where\n he \nsaid \nhis firm could increase test results at a 20% cheaper cost. \n \nIn the UK, he said, he had told his “Conservative friends” he could do it even more cheaply.\n \n23\n But cheaply doesn’t always mean adequate.\n  And education is not ju\nst about test results: the OECD warned two years ago there was already an excessive emphasis on test results in England which risked negative consequences (\nEconomic Survey UK 2011\n).\n24\n \nKunskapsskolan is not the only firm supplying materials.  \nThe \nAspirat\nio\nns Academies Trust operates \nin association with the Quaglia Institute for Student Aspirations (QISA) and Aspirations Unlimited International (AUI)\n (\nhttp://www.spacest\nudiobanbury.org/266/who-is-the-aspirations-academies-trust\n  )\n. \n The US-\nbas\ned QISA and AUI organisations “\noffer significant support by providing aspirations research, materials, surveys, and consultation support.\n”  AUI is a for-profit provider of “\ndynami\nc assessment tools to assist schools and universities with collecting and analyzing student perspective\n”.   AUI entered into partnership with global education company, Pearson, in 2008\n (\nhttp://www.thefreelibrary.com/Pearson+Announces+Partnership+With+Aspirations+Unlimited.-a0180734924\n )\n.\n  \nQisa’s\n products and surveys are distributed by Pearson including the My Voice survey \n(\nhttp://myvoice.pearsonfoundation.org/\n )\n \nwhich \nOfsted found was being used \nin Aspirations\n sponsored Rivers Academy.\n  Such links between Trusts and publishers of educational materials provide a \nsteady, pr\nofitable\n outlet for the publishers’ products\n but would prevent heads purchasing other materials which they felt more appropriate\n.\n24 Similarly, t\nhe \nAurora Academies Trust \npaid\n £100,000 a year to its American parent\n, Mosaica Education Inc\n (\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/18/academy-pays-for-us-curriculum\n )\n,\n \nfor its schools to use \ni\nts patented curriculum.  Ofsted criticised the curriculum which is man\ndatory in schools sponsored by Aurora.  Again, this reduces the power of heads to decide curricula and locks schools into contracts to purchase unsuitable materials.\n25 Local authorities do not impo\nse uniformity on s\nchools.  But m\nany academy chains have co\nrporate images which promote the chain’s “brand”\n:\n  Harris schools all bear the name of the Harris chain; most Greenwood Dale \nsecondary academies have the same website format\n which makes them almost indistinguishable\n (\nhttp://www.greenwoodacademies.org/our-academies/\n )\n.  Future Academies, set up by schools minister Lord Nash, has links with the Curriculum Centre which publishes\n \nthe \nUS \n“Core\n Knowledge” curriculum developed in the \n1990s\n by E D Hirsch. It was adapted for the UK by the short-lived head of \nFuture Academies \nPimlico Primary Free S\nchool, \nAnnaliese\n Briggs\n (\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24466928\n )\n, and published by Civitas. \n \nIt i\ns promoted by schools \nminister \nLiz Truss\n \n(\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/elizabeth-t\nruss-speaks-on-the-national-curriculum-to-the-fellowship-commission\n )\nand admired by the Secretary of State.  Three of the four primary schools in Pimlico are Future Academies schools\n (\nhttp://www.westendextra.com/news/2013/oct/facing-facts-teaching-fears-pimlico-primary-school-parents-%E2%80%98left-very-little-choice%E2%80%99\n )\n.  There is \nlittle cho\nice for \nPimlico \nparents who \nwould prefer a diffe\nrent curriculum or for heads who wish to devise their own\n.\n26 Future Academies raises several questions: whether there is a conflict of interest when a minister is so closel\ny connected to an academy chain\n and\n whether it is appropriate for other schools ministers to promote materials associated with that chain.\n27 \nRecent events at Al-Madinah free school, the Kings Science Academ\ny and Discovery New School \nr\naise questions about governance and whether such groups \nare given too much freedom to decide how to spend taxpayers’\n money.  It is unlikely \nthe eight Regional Commissioners will be able to adequately scrutinize the governance and financial affairs of academies and free schools.  This role could be delegated to \nlocal authorities.\nThe appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply; and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole\n28 \nPrim\nary schools have bee\nn reluctant to convert for \ngood reasons.  They are too small to go-it-alone as they lack the resources of larger secondary schools to hire business managers and the like.  That means they are likely to be forced to join chains which \ncould result in loss of freedom as described above.  Primary schools value the support that local authorities offer.  Small rural schools are threatened by academy conversion for two reasons: they are too small to operate as stand-alone operations and they\n could be seen as too expensive or unprofitable\n for take-over by an academy chain.\n29 There is increasing evidence that primary schools which are their own admission authori\nties\n,\n which \nincludes academies, are changing their admission criteria to give prior\nity to pupils already attending attached nurseries.  The School’s Adjudicator has ruled this does not adhere to the Schools Admission Code and has upheld all complaints about primary schools behaving in this way.  However, a school could get away with such\n procedures unless someone complains.  There is a role for local authorities in ensuring the admission criteria for all schools in its area adhere to the Code.\n30 Academy status does not bring value for money.  £1b has already \nbeen overspent on the \nprogram\nme but academy status alone does not raise results.  Where schools have improved it is be\ncause of initiatives such as London Challenge or because schools\n demonstrate the qualities Ofsted identified as being present in good or outstanding schools.  These \nqu\nalities \ndid not include academy status.\n  When schools “compete”, as they are expected to do, money is likely to be diverted from educat\nion to marketing.  CHAT\n, for example, employs a m\narketing manager (\nhttp://www.chat-edu.org.uk/press-enquiries\n )\n. \n \n32 There is also the problem outlined above: schools will be required to purchase services, resources or materials from their academy cha\nin which might\n not represent value-for-\nmoney and, in the worst cas\nes, are substandard.\nWhat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools\n?\n33 It is not clear that all primary schools identified as “failing”\n are\n failing.   Results at Downhills were improving and had exceeded the ben\nchmark.\n34 That said, if primary schools are struggling then they should be given the option of remain\ning with their local authority\n especially where th\ne authority has\n been supporting the school.  Ofsted, before it changed its mind, said Downhills’ improve\nment was down to the head and local authority support.  \n35 This suggests that the imperative to get as many primary schools converted to academies is taking precedence over \nother factors including parental wishes and council support.  \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
