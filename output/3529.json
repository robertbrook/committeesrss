"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Sussex Police Crime Commissioner [CST0014]&#xa0;\nInterpretation of the counting rules is subject to much meaningful debate locally, regionally and nationally.  \nWe have therefore six apparently simple questions that require technically complex \ndecisions.  A\ns the force crime registrar for \nSussex\n I \nattend regional\n and national meeting\ns\n where issues are discussed with a view to providing clarification by means of examples for inclusion in the counting rules.\n&#xa0;\nEach incident has to be judged on its o\nwn merits \nhence m\ny response therefore is global\n,\n rather than local\n,\n in an attempt \nto \nhighlight \nthe \ndaily debates/issues that impact on recorded crime figures.   \n&#xa0;\n1. Are crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?&#xa0;An interesting opening question as nothing is ever straight forward particularly given the subjective judgements when interpreting the counting rules\n.  Influencing factors, in no particular order include, but are not restricted to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe raison d’être of NCRS is to promote greater consistency between police forces \nin the recording of crime and to ensure a more victim focused approach.  \nInterpretation of NCRS and the counting rules\n is however subjective and the topic of much debate and \ndiscussion nationally on many occasions.\n&#xa0;\nThe general principles of the NCRS rightly focus on a victim centric crime recording process.  In other words if a victim makes an allegation that amounts to an offence in law which is contained within the \nnotifiab\nle\n crime series\n,\n then such a crime should be recorded unless there is evidence to contradict that which is alleged.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the current financial climate\n,\n the cost of any “back office” support function has to be balanced against operational\n requirements.\n&#xa0;\nThe guiding principal is compliance with national standards however internal checks and balances vary between forces and \na consequence of Performance Targets is the adoption of a innovat\nive\n approach\nes\n to crime recording together with an element of manipula\ntion / manoeuvring of crime statistics.  \nWithin \nSussex\n risk based NSIR/NCRS auditing enable early remedial intervention, where necessary, to ensure practices and procedures are fit for purpose.\n \n&#xa0;\nAn\n outside audit pressure \nenhances the\n focus on the integrit\ny of crime recording.  HMIC do a valuable job in this respect and the upcoming audit plan seems to focus on meaningful reviews including outcomes.  It would be of benefit for the numbers of records audited to be increased to allow a 'substantial' benchmark\n for future audits.  The current numbers do not allow a reasonable conclusion to be drawn on the figures provided\n, nor by their own understanding, legitimate comparison between forces.\n&#xa0;\nThe advent of the PCCs has also had a positive impact in this area.  A\ns they are electable positions and therefore accountable for the pledges they have made there is a keener sense that the crime data should be more ethical and correct.  It is \nmore significant when a\n force shows a reduction in crime, \nand\n they are audited by\n an external agency\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe victim based approach means evaluation \nof \nwhether to\n record as a\n crime or not should be based on the initial information provided\n.\n  \nWe are oft\nen being reminded that HOCR and NCRS is fit for purpose but there are always numerous 'slight' changes being made and various offences being moved between sections.  This will make any future comparisons difficult if not impossible.  Next year will see a h\nuge change in the way that forces record outcomes which may well add\n,\n inadvertently\n,\n another performance indicator between forces.  To ensure that crime data will be appropriately comparable over the foreseeable future and allow forces to go forward in the\n knowledge that the playing field will not be changed there should (in my view) be no further large scale changes to HOCR.\n&#xa0;\nSussex Police has moved a long way from red/green targets to developing performance products that really help to understand the busi\nness.  \nThis contributes to achieving\n ethical recording.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhilst it is clear that all forces have issues around the same sort of i\nncident\ns\n (ABH v Common Assault, Criminal Damage v Burglary and mobile phone theft) I still feel that a reasonable amount of confidence can remain in the crime statistics.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNo, t\nhere \nshould be\n National Statistics.  \nT\nhe results of the HMIC inspection of all forces will provide an indication as to whether or not the recorded crime statistics can be accredited - however that will \nbe indicative for the future of the audit\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe move to the ONS seemed a step forward and will allow the data to be maintained by a department that is free from any internal or external pressures. \n \n&#xa0;\nCombination with the British Crime Survey results\n should provide the desired information.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
