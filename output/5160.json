This resulted in the sale of cigarettes which, on further examination by the brand holder, were found to be counterfeit.\n&#xa0;\nAs a result, on 30\nth\n January, the shop was searched and a quantity of counterfeit cigarettes (approximately 31,000) and tobacco (approximately 16kg) was found on the premises, all of which has been confirmed as counterfeit or illicit.\n&#xa0;\n These goods were found hidden in an outside store, linked to the premises, and under the counter. The assistant in the shop at the time was arrested, interviewed in custody and bailed pending our on-going enquiries.\n&#xa0;\nFollowing further reports that the shop was continuing to sell, a second visit was carried out on 20\nth\n March 2013, with police and Trading Standards Officers again in attendance. A prior test purchase was conducted\n on the day which resulted in a \nsale. \n&#xa0;\nOn this occasion the goods were hidden inside a security door (which we believe had been constructed since the last raid) and in the empty tank of a disused water heater. In total 4\n,\n680 cigarettes and 2.15\n \nkg of tobacco were found. \n&#xa0;\nOn th\nis occasion the shop assistant \nwas arrested, questioned, detained (as he provided no definitive address) and prosecuted in Chesterfield Magistrates Court on the following day, having pleaded guilty to the ‘sale’ charges for the test purchase. Our enquiries continue following this subsequent enforcement.\n&#xa0;\nIt is worth noting that the person working in the shop has been different on the three occasions our officers have attended (overtly or covertly)\n&#xa0;\n- and we do not believe that they are acting in isolation of some greater degree of control from a ‘directing mind’.\n&#xa0;\nWe have had reports again since our visit that the shop has reopened and is continuing to sell illegal goods. The reports have been direct and via the local police, and often emanate from local shopkeepers who \nstate that\n they are losing significant trade due to the illegal activities \nof the Bzee shop\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe local authority has no power\n to close down premises \nbreaching either\n \nthe \nTrade Marks Act 1994 or the Consumer Protection Act 1987 \nwhich are enforced by the \nTrading Standards\n division\n. Our experience is that the shops restock and are up and running within a day/a few hours of our enforcement, and consider our intervention an ‘occupational hazard’\n&#xa0;\nIt \ncould be argued\n that the get up of the shop, the concealment of illegal stock, the lack of legitimate cigarettes and tobacco (and other stock) and the alterations undertaken to facilitate this trade (security door and water heater), as well as the conduct of the shop workers, all give rise to the conclusion that the main purpose of the shop is the supply of counterfeit cigarettes and tobacco. \n&#xa0;\nTobacco worth £15,000 seized in raid against counterfeit suppliers: Your council - Derbyshire County Cou\nn\ncil\n.\nSniffer dog used in latest raids to target counterfeit tobacco suppliers: Your council - Derbyshire County\n \nCouncil\nobert Tayloury,\nnterest.se whcih aders not to call. ar to provide a source of local relaible traders (eness of this issue. heir\n1\n \nhttp://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/news_events/news-updates/2013/may/news_items/hefty_fine_for_illegal_tobacco_seller.asp\n \nhttp://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/news_events/news-updates/2013/february/news_items/tobacco_worth_15000_seized_in_raid_against_counterfeit_suppliers.asp\n \nhttp://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/news_events/news-updates/2013/march/news_items/sniffer_dog_used_in_latest_raids_to_target_counterfeit_tobacco_suppliers.asp\n"
