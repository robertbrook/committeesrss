"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Miriam Hall [FBB0064]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Need \nFor\n The Television Licence Fee In The 21\nst\n Century\nWritten evidence submitted by Miriam Hall, \nBritish \ncitizen\n, student\n and Public Service Media consumer\nExecutive summary:\nThis submission addresses the following terms of reference of the committee: \nI have \n3 policy recommendations:\n&#xa0;\nThe licence fee: best funding method\nSimilarly \nadvertising funded \nproducers\n \nneglect\n smaller \naudiences\n, leaving minorities \nunder represented\n.  \nDr Helen Weeds notes that the reason that PSM was developed in the 1930s \nwas because advertising would not fund\n high quality or diversity in television, as advertisers value audience size or attracting specific demographics “rather than the value of the co\nntent to consumers.”\n \nIn PSM the value of content for the public must be paramount\n, so advertising should not fund it\n.\nIn 2013 Finnish PSB Yleisradio replaced its licence fee with a ring-fenced means tested tax collected by the government, calculated per head not pe\nr household. The 2013 annual report shows the broadcaster has transformed well\n, but it will likely take several years (and a few governments) to see if the fears of budget cutting and loss of independence due to state control of funding are realised.\n&#xa0;\nDecriminalisation\nN\new \nM\nedia \nP\nlatforms and the licence fee\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReferences\n BBC Trust Press Release, \nBBC publishes Annual Report for 2012/13\n,  BBC Website, \n(16/07/2013), \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2013/annual_report.html\n (Accessed: 30/11/\n2013)\nBBC,\nThe Licence Fee\n, BBC Website,\n h\nttp://www.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/2013/executive/finances/licence_fee.html\n, (Accessed: 30/11/2013), para.4\n Human Capital\n,\n \nPublic service broadcasting now and in the future– audience attitudes\n, \n(\nLondon, \nHuman Capital, June 2008\n)\n, p.4\n \nIbid, p.4\n \nAndrew Graham\n, \n‘\nIs Broadcasting Just Another Good or Service?\n’\n, \nIs there Still a Place for Public Service Televisio\nn?\n \nEffects of the Changing Economics of Broadcasting, \nEd.
