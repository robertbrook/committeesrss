"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Frank Bertie the Chairman of the NAPIT Trade Association (BRC 46)&#xa0;OverviewThis submission is based on the results \nof a survey\n sent out to all \nNAPIT\n \nTrade Association \nfull scope electrical\n \nmembers\n. The survey was designed\n to \ncapture members \nviews on the qu\nestions put forward in the CLG Select C\nommittee’s call for evidence.\n \nSurvey r\nespondents were\n full scope competent r\negistered\n \nelectrical installers\n with the \ncompetent person\n scheme provid\ner NAPIT Registration. I\nn total\n,\n \n4\n50\n registered electrical installers\n filled in the questionnaire. \n&#xa0;\nPlease note this response reflects the views of the 450 \nregistered electrical \ninstallers\n who responded to the survey and anecdotal evidence I have received as Chairman of the NAPIT Trade Association and is not designed to reflect the views of all individual members.\n \n&#xa0;\nAbout NAPIT Trade AssociationThe National Association of Profess\nional \nInspectors\n \nand \nTesters \n(NAPIT)\n is a trade association that has been representing \nprofessional \nelectricians f\nor over 20 years. \nThe trade association strives to enhance the success and excellence of its membership through the promotion of professionali\nsm\n and\n best b\nusiness practice\n. \n&#xa0;\nSummary:&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExtent of Competent Person Scheme and Building Regulations Awareness&#xa0;1.1 \nWhen asked about \nlevels of consumer awareness\n \nof the Competent Person\n Scheme\n, the majo\nrity of respondents (\n39.3\n per cent\n)\n said few\n of their customers\n ha\nd a basic understanding\n. A further \n35.\n6\n per cent said hardly any\n of their customers\n were aware \nof the initiative. \nThis indicates that more than three quarters of electricians experience low levels of consumer awareness of the Competent Person Scheme.  \n \n1.2 \nIn r\nesponse\n to\n whether\n consumer\ns were aware\n \nof\n their\n responsibility to ensure electrical work in their home complies with the Building Regulations, almost half (\n48.\n2\n per c\nent\n)\n said hardly any were aware, with a further \n36.2\n \nper cent\n saying that few we\nre aware of their responsibilities. \nThis suggests that around five in every six electricians experience poor levels of Building Regulation awareness among consumers.&#xa0;1.3 \nWhen asked whether \nthe two \nconsumer facing \nregisters\n should come together and f\norm one that would\n promote\n all full scope registered electrical installers working in England and Wales, 72.2 per cent of respondents though\nt\n they should, 16.7 per cent weren’t \nsure and only 11.1 per cent thought they shouldn’t. \nThe creation of one single \nlist\n would help to create an easier message to promote the use of Competent Registered Electricians to consumers via. The promotion of this single quality mark and \nlist\n by all e\nlectrical Competent Person Scheme Providers would also help focus the message and therefore the promotion.\n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nThe \nsingle \nquality mark\n would go\n \nsome\n way to raising the profile of com\npetent, registered electricians \nand electrical safety in the home, but \nawareness is not just about a memorable mark, easy to use search facility\n,\n and a simple message. \nT\nightening up\n the\n Building Regulation enforcement \nframework \nand introducing measures that may reduce the ability of \nunsafe\n,\n electrical\n \ninstallers\n \nto undercut c\nompetent, regist\nered operatives are also steps\n that would need to \nbe taken to\n decisively \naddress\n the problem of low consumer awareness.\n&#xa0;\nLack of Enforcement1.5 \nThe limitations of current \nB\nuilding \nC\nontrol enforcement \nof Building Regulation compliance \nwere h\nighlighted in a DCLG report commissioned during the consultatio\nn process for changes to Part P which took place in 2012. The r\neport, compiled by EC Harris, noted\n:\n \n“The building control enforcement landscape is one of extremes. On the one hand there is an e\nxtremely, perhaps unduly, low level of formal enforcement applied. Against this there is a massive (5million p.a.) portfolio of informal compliance\n interventions being conducted.\n It has also been shaped by the particular unwieldiness of building control la\nw and the constraints of it\ns formal enforcement procedures\n”\n \n  \n&#xa0;\n1.6 \nThe lack of adequate enforcement of the Building \nRegulations \nalluded\n to\n here\n,\n \nand \nsupported by \nextensive \nanecdotal evidence from \nNAPIT \nmembers\n,\n means unregistered \ninstallers and \ncowboys who chose not to comply with the regulations or notify work are able to undercut those \ncompetent \nregistered\n electricians. \n&#xa0;\n1.7 \nAnecdotal evidence also exists \nto suggest that work carried out by r\negistered \ni\nnstallers \ndoes not always comply with Building\n Regulations and is not always notified as it should be.\n&#xa0;Adequacy of Training &#xa0;Non-registered Individuals2.1 \nT\nhere are many electrical installations carried out each year by inadequately trained individuals such as unregistered electricians and rogue trad\ners. \nWhen asked about the nature of the electrical work they do, 60.4 per cent of survey respondents said remedial work to electrical installations accounted for, on average, between 26 and 75 per cent of their work load. This type of work accounted for le\nss than 26 per cent of the workload of \n30.7\n per cent of respondents but a worrying \n7.6\n per cent said this accounted for more than 76\n percent of their workload.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nWhen asked about the nature of this remedial work\n, 88.9\n per cent of respondents indicated that they had been called out to fix the work of a non-registered electrician, \n45.8\n per cent said dealing with the work of non-registered electricians \naccounted for between 26 and 75 per cent of their work and 7.8 per ce\nnt estimated that the figure was higher\n. The extent of non-compliant work which had been carried out by registered members of Electrical Competent Person Schemes did not form part of the survey.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nThe Committee may be aware of the provision of new Condi\ntions of Authorisation set by DGLG in 2012.\n \n One of the most significant requirements set out in this new document is that all CPS providers gain \nmust \nUKAS accreditation before June 2014. The industry standard the CPS providers work to in order to satisfy\n UKAS accreditation criteria is the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification (EAS). This specification was written by the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) in collaboration with a number of industry stakeholders including NAPIT Trade Associati\non and UKAS.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.4 \n59\n per cent of respondents to the survey \nbelieve the EAS standards are satisfactory in showing the electrical installers are of a standard to complete work which complies with wiring regulations and building regulations\n. Only \n5.3\n per cent said EAS standards were too low, while \n6.2\n per cent said they were too high. A further \n29.3\n per cent weren’t sure. \nThis shows that the vast majority of respondents who were able to comment on this question believe EAS will ensure the provision of adequate training moving forward. &#xa0;2.5 \nHowever, the EAS \nonly refers to ‘enterprises’ and does not ensure\n all operatives \nworking on electrics within a company \nare brought up to the same\n skill \nlevel.\n NAPIT TA members have often expressed concerns that the c\nurrent emphasis in this document on registered enterprises/ qualified supervisors\n (QS)\n \nmean\ns\n only one \nelectrical installer \nin each registered enterprise need \nto \ndemonstrate their competence \nvia the EAS standards and through\n regular assessments\n.\n \n  \n2.6 \nMany\n survey respondents\n profoundly disagree with this approach. \nWhen questioned on the qualified supervisor model, 64.4 per cent of respondents \nsaid \nthat it was \nunacceptable and dangerous as the QS may not always be present at all stages of installation pr\nocess\n and\n may not see a potential fault.\n Only 25.1 per cent were of the opposite view, that\n it was\n \nacceptable and safe as the QS has responsibility for all electrical work done b\ny non-assessed electricians. A further\n 10.4 per cent weren’t sure. \nThis sugges\nts\n the majority of \nrespondents\n would\n \nsupport steps towards an individual competency model\n that\n would increase the e\nxtent to which all operatives are brought up to the same skill level\n.\n&#xa0;\nExtent and Adequacy of the Review of Electrical Work and those carrying it out3.1 \nI\nndustry estimates suggest that there are currently \n58,000 \npracticing \nelectrical installers \nin England and Wales\n, of which only 40,000 are currently registered.\n \nThis means there may be around 18,000 \nelectrical installers\n whose competency, and therefore ongoing ability to comply with the Building Regulations, is not reviewed. On top of this, it is estimated that a staggering 0.95 million jobs a year are carried out by DIYers\n, of which five per cent\n are currently notifiable\n.\n A\n 2011\n \nsurvey of 3,763 \nelectrical installers\n \nregistered with ECA, Elecsa, NAPIT and the NICEIC\n \nprovided a useful insight into this. Respondents to that survey estimated that\n \n25.19 per cent of non-registered installers’ work\n,\n and 63.43 per cent of DIY en\nthusiasts’\n,\n was “usually poor”.\n This suggests that there are \nlots\n of people \ncarrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply\n,\n who may not have\n had\n their work reviewed at all\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nI\nntroducing a more effective framework to \nencourage\n more\n electricians \nto \nchoose\n to register \nunder\n the Competent Person Scheme\n \nand discourage\n \nhouseholders from attempting electrical work themselves\n,\n would improve this situation. \nIn total, 85.3 per cent of \nsurvey \nrespondents th\nought\n all installe\nrs carrying out \nwork under the Building R\negulations should be registered as Competent Persons, while 81.1 per cent\n would\n support the introduction of a legal requirement for all practicing electrical installers to be registered as individually competent.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nIn total, 86.4\n per cent of respondents, say they \nhave had their work reviewed \nby their Competent Person Scheme Provider NAPIT Registration, \nto a standard that ensures it continues to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.\n \nA further 7.1 per cent were unsure w\nhile 6.4 per cent said they did not.\n&#xa0;3.4 \nT\nhe specification mentioned above, EAS, will further regulate the training and assessment criteria \nto be met by \ncompetent registered\n \nelectrical installers\n.\n \nIn total, \n65.5 per cent of respondents said they thought th\nese standards were either satisfactory or too high (with only 5.6 per cent saying they were too low)\n. \n&#xa0;Effect of Registration Scheme and Register Competition5.1 \nThe survey asked: Which of the statements about the competition between CPS \nproviders\n do you a\ngree with:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nResponses indicate that all of these factors \nplay a part\n in the current \nelectrical Competent Person Scheme arena\n. A total of 20.4 per cent thought competition was bad because it drove standards down and 28.2 per cent thought it was bad because it limited c\nonsumer awareness. However, this is set against the 38.2 per cent of respondents who thought that competition was good because without it prices would be higher and the 59.6 per cent that thought competition was good because it \noffered\n them choice.\n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nBy\n recoding\n this data into positive and negative statements, we can see that while 48.6 per cent of respondents thought competition was bad, more than twice as many (97.8) saw competition as a good thing for them.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4 \nThe two negative aspects of competiti\non that we have identified here are currently being addressed \nin line with\n DCLG\n’s 2012\n Conditions of \nA\nuthorisation\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.5 \nIt is hoped that the new EAS 2012 standards,\n to be\n introduced in June 2014, will help to address the current issues in the industry\n aro\nund the dilution of standards\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.6 \nT\nhe concern that competition creates a confused market for consumers\n has also been addressed. \nOne of \nDCLG\n’s \nConditions of Authorisation is\n to\n promote awareness of the Competent Person Scheme to consumers.\n \nThis response highlights \nthe effec\nts of competition in the market\n going forward, will be \npredominantly\n \npositive.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nEC Harris (\nJanuary 2012)\n.,\n Further\n Economic and analytical support for impact assessment of proposals to amend the Building Regulations in 2013\n, \nDepartment for Communities and Local Government\n p61\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8387/2076727.pdf\n  \n Recoded: \na\nd\nd\ned 1-25%  and 26-50% and 51-75% and\n \n76-100% categories for estimated proportion of work together to arrive at a figure that represents \nall electricians who had experienced having to carry out remedial work to the installation of an unregistered electricians = 88.9 per cent of respondents. \n Recoded: \na\ndded number of respondents estimating 26-50% of their work to those estimating 51-75% to\n arrive at the number of respondents estimating between 26-75% = 45.8 per cent of respondents.\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n \nhttp://electrical.theiet.org/building-regulations/eas/index.cfm\n A minimum of one\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-regulations-part-p-electrical-safety-in-dwellings\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/49996/121217_-_Part_P_IA_-_to_publish_for_web.pdf\n pg 9\n.\n \nThe data was recoded by adding together the % who agreed with the negative statements and adding together the % who agreed with the positive statements. \n \nT\nhat the percentages do not add up to 100 per cent reflects the fact that respondents were permi\ntted to select more than one answer.\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n (point 6, p2)\n"
