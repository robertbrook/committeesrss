[normal]Can use of h[bold]eat from power generation through combined heat and power CHP reduce emissions for[bold] the power sector?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]On the 24
[normal]th
[normal] or August we submitted a letter to Ed Davey
[normal] ref
[normal] copied to Tim Yeo Committee Chairman, Phillip Lowe Director General for Energy at the European Commission, Professor David Mackay, and Dr Fatih Birol Chief Economist and Director of the International Energy agency
[normal] expressing serious concerns about the 
[normal]ana
[normal]lytical methods used by the EU emission trading scheme EUETS adopted by the UK for Electricity Market Reform.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A paper given to the International Association of Energy Economists which analyses EUETS, Dukes and CHPQA 
[normal]in detail was submitted with our
[normal] letter
[normal].
[normal] ref
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The formulas signal a reduction in powe
[normal]r emissions when 
[normal]waste heat is used.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The formulas 
[normal]assume that this, now useful, 
[normal]rejec
[normal]t heat has been generated in an
[normal] “imaginary” boiler.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The imaginary fuel for the boiler is then deducted from the actual fue
[normal]l being used for power generation to calculate lower emissions for electricity 
[normal]sector and their consumers
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The formula results in a 
[normal]serious 
[normal]“emissions” 
[normal]market distortion
[normal] 
[normal]contravening
[normal] 
[normal]the second law of thermody
[normal]na
[normal]mics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This method was at one time used for 
[normal]the UK statistics “Dukes” to calculate the fuel use
[normal] for electricity generation from 
[normal]Drax when 
[normal]some of the 
[normal]heat 
[normal]from condensing the steam that normally goes
[normal] to
[normal] the cooling towers, was 
[normal]diverted to grow tomatoes,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dukes retains elements of this methodology
[normal] with its allocation of  
[normal]any 
[normal]benefit from CHP two thirds to the heat and one third to the electricity
[normal]. I
[normal]n practice no benefit
[normal] arises for power production and 
[normal]electricity consumers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dukes statistics 
[normal]are used as 
[normal]input to other policy models such as Markal/T
[normal]imes used by DECC
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he Markal output 
[normal]may be 
[normal]flaw
[normal]ed if the input is flawed. 
[normal] .
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ed Davey’s response
[normal] 
[normal]explains 
[normal]that 
[normal]DECC sees no reason to calculate the fuel or the CO2 overhead for the respective heat and electrical products 
[normal]from 
[normal]CHP.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our opinion such 
[normal]information is essential for any analysis or modelling of heat networks
[normal].  The following table

[normal]Our response 
[normal]to Ed Davey 
[normal]dated the 16th of December 
[normal]Ref 
[normal]copied to 
[normal]the committee include
[normal]s poster identifying the relative merits of heat supply from CHP and insulation measures and the relative merits of heat from electric heat pumps as analysed today and by Energy Paper 35. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The EU Carnot method for analysing Renewable CHP.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Page 16 to 18 Ref 2 explain 
[normal]how 
[normal]the 
[normal]EU Carnot 
[normal]“Exergy” 
[normal]method for 
[normal]the analysis of renewable CHP disadvantages low temperature district heating by assuming it operates at 150C.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal]further 
[normal]identify an error in th
[normal]e
[normal] formula as when it allocates emissions the 
[normal]total emissions after allocatio
[normal]n are greater than the 
[normal]actual 
[normal]emissions from the fuel input to the CHP.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Analysis of the fo[bold]rmula for the EU CHP directive and thermodynamic superiority of heat from CHP compared to heat from electric heat pumps.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We analyse t
[normal]he EU directive which was formulated on the basis that CHP reduced electricity sector emissions hence the idea of good quality electricity from CHP and an incentive on the electricity production not the heat ill
[normal]ustrated in the following chart on Page 34 Re
[normal]f 2                                       
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Note the actual primary energy savings for the heat sector are illustrated by the red triangles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The EU directive signals 
[normal]the savings by the blue line a combination of two different products where there are 
[normal]not savings in the electricity sector only savings in the heat sector with the blue line showing the overall saving for the combined sectors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reject heat from electricity generation is a major energy resource always at a higher temperature than the enviro
[normal]nment for its rejection in line with the second law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This reject heat exceeds UK domestic gas 
[normal]energy supply in quantity but 
[normal]not in quality and exergy.
[normal] Exergy allows the fundamental relative “value” of power and heat to be assessed and is an important conc
[normal]ept for optimal use of scarce fuel resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CHP, a “Virtual heat pump” (ref 
[normal] &amp; ref 
[normal]) , can in practice decarbonize dwellings heated by gas retrofitted as at Odense in Denmark to the coal fired CHP and district heat 
[normal]where ten units of waste heat are up
[normal]graded using one unit of electricity.  The ten is directly
[normal] comparable to coefficients of 
[normal]performance for air source electric heat pumps of two to four driven by the plants electricity.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Coordination of [bold]Modelling of heat networks in DECC and the distribut[bold]ed CHP hub concept.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We have been researching where 
[normal]domestic sector 
[normal]modelling of heat networks is being 
[normal]done within the 
[normal]DECC structure
[normal] so our energy hub concept reviewed by Greg Barker can now be modelled.

[normal] being done by various 
[normal]other 
[normal]consultants 
[normal]such as ETI 
[normal]the Climate Change Committee and their subcontractors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have found 
[normal]no consistent approach to the modelling of CHP 
[normal]and heat networks 
[normal]or its assumptions. 
[normal] 
[normal]We fu
[normal]rther found that contracts between DECC and external consultants meant that DECC officials do not have access to the internal workings
[normal] and algorithms in 
[normal]models.  This applied to exchanges with officials in relation to work by 
[normal]Ricardo-AEA
[normal] for the department
[normal].
[normal] Ref
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Effect of [bold]Real Rate[bold]s[bold] of Ret[bold]urn and lifetime assumptions on output from [bold]models.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We note
[normal] 
[normal]Ricardo-AEA use a 15% real rate of return for information feeding into the DECC Monte Carlo model.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have noted Delta Energy use
[normal] a 10% real rate of return to evaluate the heat infrastructure in their work for the Energy Networks Association and National Grid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst one can identify anomalies in outputs from models
[normal] such as a saving in the electricity sector with CHP or cost of he
[normal]at from CHP heat network to consumers higher than cost of heat from gas boilers Delta Energy. One 
[normal]cannot
[normal] g
[normal]ain access to 
[normal]model to 
[normal]check the assumptions that determine
[normal] the results
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Or 
[normal]whether the modeller has cross subsidised electricity consumers from heat 
[normal]consumers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To indicate how easy it can be to change the output of a model by changing lifetime and real rates of return the following table
[normal] illustrates the effect by presenting the information in the form of an equivalent payback on the investment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We w
[normal]ould as an example expect a low temperature heat network to have a lifetime of over 100 years and be assessed at the same rate of return as other infrastructure investments such as incremental insulation or investment in extension of gas and electricity in
[normal]frastructure or storage, funded by consumers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One can see that the 
[normal]Ricardo-AEA
[normal] 15% assumption will require the heat network to pay back with a lifetime of 60 years in 6.67 years for low CO2 heat supply.
[normal]For an insulation measure with a 60 year life 
[normal]evaluated at 3.5% for inclusion as a building regulation measure
[normal] 
[normal]the payback is 24.94 years.
[normal]The Delta Energy assumption of 10% requires a 9.97 year pay back on the heat network and a 7.6 year payback every time a new gas boiler is installed at the end of 
[normal]its 15 year lifetime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently it appears 
[normal]different models make different assumptions
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e have concentrated in this evidence on modelling areas where the boiler displacement 
[normal]method is 
[normal]used
[normal] by modellers and the EU.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Pathways modelling by DECC 
[normal]uses the correct power plant displacement method with an assumption of COP of 7 for heat from CHP and we note that the latest CIBSE guide AM12 also endorses this method of analysis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We recommend that any modelling of the energy sector has a clear list of 
[normal]costs and lifetimes for the elements that are modelled and where the model is dealing with CHP and its joint products a clear example of how the respective fuel and CO2 overheads for the two products have been calculated in the model.

[normal]The [bold]domestic sector [bold]heat load. The [bold]Low CO[bold]2 heat supply investment [bold]option [bold]networks[bold] to [bold]decarbonize domestic sector compared to [bold]investment in incremental fabric insulation.[bold] Low CO2 piped heat supply first better than fabric first due to large savings[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Heat networks are the most
[normal] common form of heat supply in the UK where water is the vehicle for carrying the heat from its source to its destination mainly to perform three heating functions. One to provide domestic hot water, two to heat the air we breathe the ventilation heat load
[normal], three to counteract heat loss through the fabric of the building the “fabric load”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Often the importance of the domestic hot water and ventilation loads are forgotten as well as the electric loads for dishwashing and laundry that can be met either from 
[normal]district heat or electricity.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Subject:[bold] RE: Percentage Savings and comparisons.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dear William
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is a very informative way you have presented the calculation of the efficiency of CHP and insulation.
[normal]It also explains why the building insulation factories
[normal] in e.g. Denmark do not like DH and CHP
[normal]It illustrates that there is a competition between the various methods to provide good indoor comfort.
[normal]It also illustrates why strong commercial interests in the electricity, gas and building material sector in gener
[normal]al are against DH and CHP.
[normal]The consumers and their democratic elected representative are among the few who have interest in DH and CHP
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have added some remarks to the calculation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Med venlig hilsen
[normal]Anders Dyrelund[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Anders remarks read as follows
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]detailed spreadsheet has been supplied to the committee to illustrate why the low carbon heat sup
[normal]ply option offers such 
[normal]high savings compared to fabric insulation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The relative impact of low CO2 heat supply and demand side measures is illustrated in a pap
[normal]er to the solar trade association
[normal] and its poster
[normal] as well as results illustrated below from a retrofit for the future project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our paper we 
[normal]propose Modular Energy Hubs incorporating 500 kW-2000kW CHP, heat pumps, fuel and heat stores, with battery sto
[normal]rage and exchange for Electric Vehicles. The Hubs optimize intermittent renewable electricity from wind and solar PV, minimizing electrical infrastructure investment for 2050.  Large scale solar thermal feeds the 75C flow 30C return heat networks.
[normal] The conc
[normal]ept has been discussed with Greg Barker and we understand it will be modelled by DECC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We suggest that when heat from fossil CHP has a lower CO2 footprint 
[normal]i.e.
[normal] higher COP than electric heat pumps it should be treated as qualifying for the same incentives as heat from 
[normal]“renewab
[normal]le” biomass and 
[normal]electric he
[normal]at pumps’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The paper submitted to Ed Davey explains that electric heat pumps 
[normal]can 
[normal]generate higher CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions t
[normal]han fossil CHP, where electricity for the heat pump is fossil-derived.
[normal] 
[normal]Also CO2 emissions when wood is burnt on a grate are larger than emissions from coal.  
[normal]Whilst the sustainable element associated with the wood has to be considered current regulations b
[normal]y treating its emissions as zero independent 
[normal]of the
[normal] efficiency of the conversion of the wood to energy resulting in poor use of a scarce resource.
