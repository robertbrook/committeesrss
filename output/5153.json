Ireland needs two additional scanners at Irish ports in the short term and this should be increased to six over the medium to long term. Funding from the tobacco industry for scanners should not be accepted.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReduce the minimum indicative levels for travellers to the smallest amount allowable under EU rules. \n&#xa0;\nEnsure sanctions for smugglers and sellers of il\nlicit tobacco are comprehensive\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLegislation should be drafted that makes it illegal to buy non-duty paid tobacco. This would bring tobacco in line with the penalties for the purchase of other smuggled goods.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI\nntroduce financial penalties on tobacco companies whose product is smuggled. In the UK, the Government has made it a legal duty for tobacco manufacturers not to facilitate smuggling and companies which fail to take sufficient steps to prevent their products being smuggled into the UK face fines of up to £5 million.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;YearTotal Payments Received €2008959,7032009907,32920101,224,02520111,325,3642012694,558&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government should sign and ratify the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Illicit Trade Protocol as soon as possible, and begin consideration of how its provisions will be brought into effect in the Irish market. \n&#xa0;\nGovernment \nshould\n consider how the tracking and tracing provisions of the FCTC Illicit Trade Protocol \ncan\n be implemented. In particular they must assess whether the \nCodentify\n system promoted by the major tobacco manufacturers meets the terms of Article 8 of the Protocol; whether it allows for effective tracking and tracing throughout the supply chain; and whether it could compromise the integrity and independence of enforcement action by public agencies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government should ensure, as far as possible, that the costs of implementing the provisions of the Protocol on Illicit Trade are borne by the tobacco industry, in line with Article 36.7 of the Protocol.\n&#xa0;\nGovernment should limit their interaction with the tobacco industry as per Article 5.3 of the FCTC. Meetings with the industry should only occur at official level and only on issues directly related to the \nregulation \nof the industry. Any such meetings should be open and transparent, with all minutes made publicly available. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are concerned with the methodology, data collection and reporting practices used in tobacco industry-funded or commissioned reports about the illicit tobacco trade. \nWe encourage \npolicy makers\n to publically challenge tobacco industry figures when the industry goes to the media seeking support for their anti-health policies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGovernment strategies\n should not include the view that counterfeit tobacco is more dangerous to health than manufactured tobacco. This is a view which is promoted by the tobacco industry. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPART 2&#xa0;THE ILLICIT TOBACCO MARKET &#xa0;&#xa0;(A) Causes of smuggling&#xa0;&#xa0;\nResearch from the World Bank (summarised by Merriman, 2002) suggests that the main factors leading to increased smuggling are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe UK – with comparable tobacco prices\n to Ireland\n – has drastically reduced the size of the illicit tobacco market, while increasing taxation revenue from tobacco products. The level of cigarette smuggling in the UK has fallen from 21% in 2001 to 9% in 2011, despite considerable increases in cigarette prices over the last decade. \n&#xa0;Year£ RRP per pack of cigsIllicit marketTotal tax take (m)2000/14.22\n21%\n7,648\n2001/24.39\n20%\n7,754\n2002/34.51\n16%\n8,055\n2003/44.65\n18%\n8,093\n2004/54.82\n16%\n8,103\n2005/65.05\n16%\n7,959\n2006/75.33\n15%\n8,149\n2007/85.44\n14%\n8,094\n2008/95.67\n13%\n8,219\n2009/106.29\n11%\n8,813\n2010/116.63\n9%\n9,144\n2011/127.09\n&#xa0;\n9,551\nFrom 21 March 20127.47\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(B) The Illicit Tobacco Market in Ireland&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(C) Measures to tackle the illicit tobacco trade&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“In light of the clear incentives for criminals to engage in illicit trade, measures to control the tobacco supply chains, either by authorities or by economic operators themselves, are largely insufficient. \n&#xa0;\nA part from existing agreements with the main manufacturers, there are so far no legal measures at EU level that oblige economic operators engaged in the tobacco supply chain to conduct due diligence during the course of their activities. There is also, at this stage, no general legal obligation in place for producers or importers to monitor the movement of cigarettes and other tobacco products through their supply chain (tracking). In the absence of such measures, it is very difficult (even impossible) for the authorities to determine at which point a product was diverted into the illicit trade (tracing).Considering the context of the trends and incentives outlined above, the current requirements on economic operators to control supply chains must, despite some success with regard to contraband of main brands, clearly be considered insufficient.”\n&#xa0;\nPART 3&#xa0;SMUGGLING AND STANDARDISED PACKAGING&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIrish Cancer Society\nAugust 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nDail\n \nEireann\n – Parliamentary Questions, 8 May 2013, Department of Finance, Illicit Trade in Tobacco. \nhttp://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2013-05-08a.219&amp;s=illicit+trade+in+tobacco\n In July 2010, the Revenue Commissioners initiated a programme of nationwide blitz-type tobacco operations, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the purpose of identifying and seizing illicit tobacco products. Three such operations were mounted in 2010, resulting in the seizure of more than 15 million cigarettes and 370kgs of tobacco (Revenue Commissioners’ 2010 Annual Report). The overall value of combined seizure of cigarettes and tobacco for 2010 was €76.4 million.\nRevenue Commissioners (Feb. 2012) ‘Revised Action Plan for the Revenue Commissioners under the Public Service /\nCroke\n Park Agreement’, \nwww.revenue.ie/en/about/publications/revised-action-plan-2012.pdf\n See Cigarette Consumption Surveys of the Revenue Commissioners. \n HM Revenue &amp; Customs and UK Border Agency (2011) Tackling Tobacco Smuggling – building on our success. \nhttp://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_MiscellaneousReports&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_031246\n See, UK Finance Act 2006, see http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/25/section/2.  \nParliamentary Question, Minister for Finance, 14\nth\n May 2013, ‘Tobacco Control Measures’.
