[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]1. The National Children’s Bureau and Council for Disabled Children welcome the Education Select Committee’s inquiry on the under-achievement in education by working class children.  There are a wide range of factors, both within and outside the school environment, which are having a deleterious effect on the educational attainment of children and young people from disadvantaged families.   The Centre for Social Justice’s recent report ‘Requires Improvement: the causes of educational failure’ highlights the critical need to gain a better understanding of why white working class children, and in particular boys, are falling behind their peers and not meeting their full potential. &#xa0;2.

[[[Our response draws on NCB’s ]]]

[[[recently published]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[report ‘]]]

[[[Greater Expectations’]]] This compares current data on different aspects of children’s lives with that of NCB’s national cohort study ‘Born to Fail?’ of 11-year olds born in 1958, and published in 1973. 3.

[[[ ]]]

[[[NCB sets out a number of recommendations in ‘Greater Expectations’ to request that immediate action is taken to tackle child poverty and redu]]]

[[[ce inequality experienced by children and young people.]]] We would welcome the Education Select Committee’s consideration of the following, which we believe will lead to improved educational attainment for the most disadvantaged children:

[[[• ]]]The government should create a Children and Young People’s Board with full ministerial representation to develop and implement a genuinely cross-government multidimensional strategy to reduce the inequality and disadvantage children and young people face;

[[[• ]]]The Office for Budget Responsibility should disclose the impact each Budget would have on child poverty and inequality in the report it publishes alongside the Chancellor’s annual statement;

[[[• ]]]At the next general election, each political party should set out in their manifesto the full range of measures they will take to improve the lives of children and young people, reducing inequality in the key areas set out in this report;

[[[• ]]]Parliament and civil society should establish a common set of indicators that are used as a matrix to hold government to account for what it is doing to address the inequalities and disadvantage that children face.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5. The ‘Greater Expectations’ report identifies that there are 1.5million more children living in poverty today than there were in 1969. These children are more likely to be obese, less likely to achieve a good level of development at age four, liable to under-achieve at age eleven and prone to attaining poorer GSCE results than children from a more affluent background. &#xa0;6. In 2013, the 3.5million children living in poverty are more likely to be the victim of an unintentional injury or accident in the home. They are nine times less likely than those living in affluent areas to have access to green space, places to play and to live in environments with better air quality.&#xa0;7. ‘Greater Expectations’ compares our children’s quality of life with other industrialised countries and finds that, if the UK was the best place to grow up:•              Almost one million children could be lifted out of poverty;•              The deaths of 172 children through unintentional injuries could be prevented          every year;•              320,000 more 15 to 19-year olds would be in education or training;•              Nearly 45,000 fewer 11-year olds would be obese;•              And 770,000 children under 5 would not be living in poor housing.&#xa0;8. An analysis of Free School Meals data shows the impact of child poverty on educational attainment. Young people who are eligible for Free School Meals are less likely to continue in post-16 education, employment and training – 82% compared to 90% of young people not claiming Free School Meals - and more likely to be categorised as NEET (16%) compared to non-FSM pupils (8%). In addition, pupils with special educational needs are much more likely to be eligible for and claim free school meals than those pupils with no SEN: two thirds of the secondary school pupils eligible for Free School Meals have SEN. 9. We must respond to these findings and stop the widening gap between poverty and affluence to avoid increasing social division and rising costs to society.

[[[improve the quality and sufficiency of early education and childcare in disadvantaged areas.]]]10. The significant increase in the proportion of children accessing early education since ‘Born to Fail?’ was published, reflects a growing understanding of the long-term benefits of good quality early education, and in particular the previous Government’s decision to invest in free early years services for children and families, including fifteen hours of free nursery education for three and four year olds and access to Children’s Centres. The vast majority of 3 and 4 year olds (96 per cent) in England now attend early education: 93 per cent of 3 year-olds and 98 per cent of 4-year-olds. &#xa0;11.

[[[ ]]]

[[[Y]]]

[[[oung children living in poorer economic circumstances are less likely]]]

[[[ to develop well than their more affluent peers]]]. We know that children from poor backgrounds can develop equally well if they have access to good quality early years provision; however, the quality of early years services is often weakest in areas with high levels of deprivation. The likelihood of a young child achieving a ‘good level of development’ in the Early Years Foundation Stage – for example being able to listen to stories, have good hand-eye coordination and communicate and play well with others – varies significantly when we look at children from poorer backgrounds. While nearly two thirds (64 per cent) of all 4-year-olds achieve ‘a good level of development’ during their early education, only half (48 per cent) of children eligible for free school meals achieve this level. &#xa0;12. We welcome the expansion of free early education for two year olds, in enabling children from the 40% most disadvantaged families to attend pre-school provision for 15 hours a week.

[[[ ]]]Access to early education is also valuable in engaging parents and provides a route in to supporting families most in need through early intervention support and services, as identified through NCB’s Raising Early Achievement in Literacy (REAL) project.

[[[ ]]](Please see NCB’s submission to the Education Select Committee’s inquiry on Sure Start Children’s Centres.)13. It is apparent that society must do more to support disadvantaged young children to develop as well as their more affluent peers. While the UK has above average levels of participation in early education, according to the most recent available comparative international data we are not doing as well as the best performing countries – France, Belgium and Denmark – who have 100% enrolment. 

[[[If ]]]

[[[the UK]]]

[[[Greater emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring that the education system meets the individual learning and development needs of each and every child. ]]]

[[[This coupled with improvements to the home environment, would reduce the attainment gap between disadvantaged and more affluent children. ]]]15. In Born to Fail?, NCB found that growing up in disadvantaged circumstances had a negative impact on children’s educational outcomes, and on their expectations of continuing in learning beyond the age of 16.

[[[ ]]]Nearly five decades on there is no indication of the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged children at school disappearing. 

[[[Today, a child from a disadvantage]]]

[[[d background is still more likely to achieve a lower academic level than their peers. ]]]Although eighty per cent of 11 year olds achieve to the expected level in English and Maths, those children who are eligible for Free School Meals do not do as well with only 66 per cent achieving to the expected level. The gap between the achievements of disadvantaged children and their peers continues at GCSE level, with far fewer achieving at least five A*–C grade GCSEs including English and Maths. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]16. Although literacy rates for children in the UK are above average for OECD countries, we are underperforming when it comes to translating children’s learning into education, training and job opportunities post-16.

[[[ would be in education and training.]]]&#xa0;17. Children living in poverty or deprived areas are doing considerably less well than their more affluent peers. Children who are in care have particularly poor educational outcomes compared with other children; and too many children with special educational needs (SEN) are not being supported to reach their full potential. 91% of pupils without special educational needs go on post-16 education, employment or training, compared to 84% of pupils with a SEN statement, 84% of pupils on School Action and 75% of pupils on School Action Plus.  The performance gap between children from poor backgrounds and those living in richer homes remains just as wide today. A quarter of children from poor backgrounds fail to meet the expected attainment level at the end of primary school compared with 3 per cent from affluent backgrounds. The gap widens at 16 with just one in five children from the poorest families achieving five good GCSEs, including English and Maths, compared with three quarters from more affluent families.&#xa0;

[[[Children from poorer backgrounds continue to be more ]]]

[[[likely than better off children to suffer from ill health, with consequences for their education, employment and health into adulthood]]]

[[[.]]] This is despite the fact that, thanks to medical developments and rising standards of living, we have seen a decline in illness and death in childhood since the publication of ‘Born to Fail?’.

[[[&#xa0;]]]19. In his review of health inequalities, Michael Marmot found that ‘there is a social gradient in health – the lower a person’s social position, the worse his or her health’. These social inequalities affected children in ‘Born to Fail?’ in 1969, and they are still having a significant an impact on children’s well-being today. Today, a child’s socio-economic circumstances have an effect on some aspects of their health behaviour. For example, the more affluent school age children are, the more likely they are to eat fruit daily and children living in more affluent areas have better access to play or leisure spaces than children in deprived areas. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]20. In the most deprived areas 45% of children reported two or more unfavourable environmental conditions compared to 5% of children in the least disadvantaged areas. Poor housing was used as a key indicator of disadvantage in the ‘Born to Fail?’ study, in recognition of the negative effect of living in a cold, damp and overcrowded home on children’s lives. Almost 50 years on, 7 per cent of children – one in 14 – are still growing up in overcrowded housing conditions, having a detrimental impact on their education, health and well-being. &#xa0;21.

To improve educational attainment it is crucial that children and young people are provided with access to a curriculum and assessment processes, which meets their needs, skills and interests, and enables them to evidence what they are capable of achieving. In our response to consultations on GCSE reforms, we set out a number of recommendations to improve and widen access to Key Stage 4 curriculum and assessment, particularly for disadvantaged or vulnerable pupils. Those which are of relevance to the theme of this inquiry include:23. Please see our consultation response on GCSE reforms, which was informed by a survey conducted with Young NCB members and young people from our partner organisation.

[[[research review]]]24. In 2011, the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes published a research review on ‘Effective classroom strategies for closing the gap in educational achievement for children and young people living in poverty, including white working-class boys’.

[[[ ]]]The report sought to examine what works in closing the gap in educational achievement for children and young people living in poverty, including white working-class boys. It identified that that schools are adopting a number of promising strategies to improve outcomes for children living in poverty including:25. The report also highlighted the valuable contribution that the sector can play in improving the attainment and achievement of children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds: 26.

[[[ ]]]

[[[Childr]]]

[[[en and young people]]] living in poverty respond to classroom interventions that improve instructional processes and teaching methods. Well-specified and well-supported programmes and practices provide the greatest learning outcomes, which motivate and engage all learners, not just those from poor backgrounds. Children from deprived areas respond positively to opportunities that raise their aspirations for learning and future success. 27.

[[[ ]]]

[[[Parents and carers]]] should be actively engaged by schools to support their child’s development and learning. Breaking cycles of low aspiration and disenfranchisement with education is an important step for narrowing attainment gaps. &#xa0;28.

[[[ ]]]

[[[Strong and visionary leadership]]], provided by head teachers and principals, is often the driving force behind improving outcomes for children living in poverty. Senior decision-makers play a key role in improving teaching strategies, by providing extensive professional development in evidence-based programmes and practices. &#xa0;29. As the direct contact point with pupils in schools, 

[[[education staff]]] are the key route to inspiring children from low-income families into learning. They need to develop their teaching methods to meet the needs of these young people in line with evidence-based strategies drawn from the profession and research. &#xa0;30.

[[[ ]]]

[[[Local ]]]

[[[authorities]]] need to work across the Early Years Foundation Stage sector, primary and secondary schools to support the adoption of evidence-based programmes and practices in schools. They should encourage changes in pedagogy through extensive, school-based professional development. They should plan targeted approaches to raise the aspirations of children from low-income families and engage parents in school life. &#xa0;In a climate of financial austerity it is crucial that schools target any new resources for poor children into interventions that are proven to raise outcomes. 

[[[National policy-makers]]] should support the use of evidence-based strategies and interventions, and build more widespread access to programmes of this kind.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[[The National Children’s Bureau (NCB)]]] The National Children’s Bureau (NCB) is a leading research and development charity that for 50 years has been working to improve the experiences and life chances of children and young people across England and Northern Ireland, especially the most vulnerable.
