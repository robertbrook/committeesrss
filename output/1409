[normal],  
[normal]METHODOLOGY
[normal]21 female academics in the field of medical physics and clinical engineering, from a total of 17 HEIs, were identified from the AAG database of academic contacts.  They we
[normal]re invited by email on 31
[normal]st
[normal] July to participate in an online survey designed by the author from the select committee website briefing.  11 responses (52%) were collected by the 16
[normal]th
[normal] August deadline.  All respondents were assured of confidentiality.  The po
[normal]ll can be viewed at

[normal]RESULTS
[normal] AN D CONCLUSIONS
[normal]QUESTIONS 1-4[bold] – INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS[bold]Most respondents were lecturer-level appointments, or indeed at more senior levels up to Professorial grade (Fig. 1.).    They identified two clear career appointment levels at which female progression is particularly tough: the first formal academic post 
[normal]at lecturer level and the senior leadership roles in research groups and academic faculties (Reader/Prof/Head/Dean) (Fig.2.).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Only around half of r
[normal]espondents were able to list initiatives that support female academic careers in STEM. The most 
[normal]highly regarded, as shown in Table 1., were th
[normal]e initiative
[normal]s
[normal] of Athena SWAN, and 
[normal]arrangements for 
[normal]flex
[normal]ible working in HEIs.
[normal]  Not all initiatives were rated very highly. 
[normal] 
[normal]Table 1[bold]. Q4:“List initiatives that support female academic careers in STEM, scoring as shown for effectiveness”
[normal] 
[normal]Early in the survey, respondents were asked why 
[normal]numbers of women in STEM
[normal] academic careers are in decline
[normal] further up the career ladder
[normal].  Answers related mostly to c
[normal]hildcare/
[normal]family reasons, as well as work/life balance and
[normal] issues concerning the academic environment (Table 2).  
[normal]Childcare/family related[bold] [bold]Women have more childcare responsibilities than men. W
[normal]omen face discrimination and can find it more difficult to obtain grant funding etc.
[normal]engineering jobs in universities are not family friendly
[normal]A mixture of lack of confidence, slowed progression because of childcare, unconscious bias that leads managers 
[normal]to assign to women roles (e.g., pastoral care) that are less expendable in terms of promotion.
[normal]The pressures to take on and excel in research, teaching and administrative duties are very difficult to balance with child care responsibilities.
[normal]Several reas
[normal]ons: 1. Historical - 20 or 30 years ago it was much less usual for a woman to work full-time; as more women do so it will take time for them to reach the higher grades 2. Societal pressures; the assumption is still that the woman will be responsible for ch
[normal]ild-care. This means not working at all, working at a lower grade that she could achieve, working part-time or having to leave early to collect children etc. etc. 3. Marital pressures; it is very difficult for two partners both to get the perfect job in th
[normal]e same location. The woman may follow her partner and end up with a lower grade job.
[normal]Even if dad takes on a strong parenting role there is often pressure (e.g. from the children) to spend time at home. I think if nothing else, it becomes increasingly exha
[normal]usting to climb the ladder with all the internal and external pressures that are therefore imposed. Most of the women I know who have successfully reached professor status either do not have a family or have an au pair/cleaner
[normal]Work-life balance[bold]Women are
[normal] less likely to enjoy the politics of high level academia and can be less able to do the long hours expected of higher level positions.
[normal]Work-life balance and juggling other responsibilities.
[normal]Real barriers include the expectation from some senior managers
[normal] that work life balance does not have to be taken seriously, and that flexible or part time working is untenable at senior level
[normal]Male dominated environment[bold]Engineering can be a male dominated environment which is not attractive for promotion or contract 
[normal]renewal as the only female
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]QUESTIONS 5-7 – CAREER DIRECTION AND PROGRESSION [bold]Fig. 3. shows the broad range of careers that women colleagues have subsequently worked in after leaving academia, as determined by the anecdotal answers of survey respondents.  The consequences of this loss of female 
[normal]workforce in academic medical physics and clinical engineering was further examined in Question 7 (Table 3.), where deleterious outcomes were observed in the working environment through reduced diversity among staff, loss of scientific and engineering tale
[normal]nt in research groups and the development of
[normal] a male-orientated environment
[normal] where there are few female role

[normal]male scientists and engineers in medicine. 
[normal]Table [bold]3[bold].[bold]  Q7: “What consequences have you noticed from the loss of scientifically trained women in academia?” 
[normal]Decline in working environment [bold]working environment more intimidating
[normal]Less diversity. Models of working are suited to those with a non-working partner to support them and carry out childcare duties.
[normal]Worse communication between scientists - a mixed academic group are less aggressive and more collaborative. Mixed groups are more innovative in all disciplines, not just academia.
[normal]Loss of female talent[bold]Definitely there is often a waste of skills and of training, as many women, particularly after having children, take up jobs they are overqualified for, just for having more regular working patterns, or even quit working altogether.
[normal]Development of a male-dominated environment[bold]Most of the more senior positions are held by men.
[normal]One is that it then sends the message to everyone that women are unlikely to manage to progress their careers; lowering the expectations for the ones remaining.
[normal]Public perception of science as a male-oriented area. This of course has knock-on effects for the next generation of scientists.....

[normal]Table 4. outlines what can be done to encourage female colleagues to stay working in STEM academic subjects.  The answers are insightful, and mainly concentrate on issues of greater encouragement through targeted
[normal] initiatives as well as  better adoption of flexible working practices. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Explicit encouragement[bold]extra funding schemes from Research Councils
[normal]Explicit encouragement. Examples include appraisals by male managers and heads of department in which it is just 'assumed' that no praise or encouragement needs to be given. Encouragement needs to be given alongside constructive criticism.
[normal]Better career progression opportunities following postdoctoral work. 
[normal]We need to tackle the tendency of some women to not realise how good they are or to defer too readily to their male colleagues. This is more tricky to solve as the last thing we want to do is label women as lacking in confidence which may have a very negative impact. I have previously been very averse to women-only discussions but have recently changed my view on this given my experience of preparing an Athena Swan application. We set up women only meetings in our department and I believe this was of great value in giving women (senior and junior) a safe space to think about how they deal with themselves and their careers. 
[normal]Flexible working[bold]Acknowledging the practical considerations that where children are involved women are more likely to take on the bulk of the childcare responsibilities. HEIs need to be transparent about the range of possible career paths that can lead to senior positions, highlighting those of us who have worked part time for extended periods (16 years in my case) and have still been promoted to Professor. Education of PIs and 
[normal]HoDs
[normal] (male and female) of the choice in working patterns and practical advice on dealing with funding part time members of staff or those requiring a career break
[normal]Encourage flexible working patterns, making part-time work a concrete possibility (in the current arrangements of deadlines/priorities it is a possibility that exists on paper, but I don't believe is practically viable); removing unconscious gender bias that often causes tasks that are less expendable in terms of career progression to be assigned to women (e.g., pastoral care duties); taking really (and not just "on paper") into account all contributions to academic life for promotion, whilst now it is all about research which might be difficult to keep up to speed with if the possibility, for instance, to attend conferences far away is limited if one has children.
[normal]More acceptance of part-time working by both men and women. This would make it easier for a couple to manage childcare.
[normal]Less discrimination, better childcare
[normal]QUESTIONS 8-10[bold] – [bold]GOOD PRACTICE AND POLICY[bold]Fig. 4. lists the most popular initiatives 
[normal]from the 
[normal]Athena S
[normal]WAN
[normal] Charter for Women in Science
[normal] (1- ranked by most useful by respondents, 7
[normal] – least 
[normal]useful).  Greater flexibility of working practices is
[normal] 
[normal]clearly the most popular initiative, followed by promotion of non-standard career routes, and the setting of targets for female staff appointments in
[normal] HEIs.     
[normal] 
[normal]Only three respondents had children (25%).  Asked how they has adapted 
[normal]their
[normal] working live
[normal]s, or t
[normal]hat of their partner, around academia and childcare answers involved a variety of solutions, from having a partner not work, to paying a nanny, to working part-time (Table 5.).   Improved childcare provision also dominates the final question on how the gov
[normal]ernment could implement new policies to support Women in STEM.  Six of the seven answers referred to better childcare, while the other answer called for targets on recruitment levels for women academics in HEIs. The most comprehensive and insightful answer
[normal] to this final question on government policy is given in full:    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Ensuring sufficient and affordable childcare is available. Promoting equal parenting policies (e.g. I
[normal] 
[normal]don't think there is much awareness that paternity leave can be mo
[normal]re than 2 weeks). Pushing universities, funding bodies etc. to have a greater flexibility around the issues (e.g. gap in publications, productivity) that having children has on an academic career. Even if dad takes on the largest role of parenting, just be
[normal]ing pregnant can have a negative impact on a career.  I recommend continuing to push this issue across a variety of platforms. Although I think there is still a long way to go, by continuing to raise awareness and investigate th
[normal]e problems things will impro

[normal].
[normal]We are both hands-on parents and adapted our working routines around it. We have pre-school twins who are looked for by a nanny. We got into a pattern of coming back home at fixed times to take over from our nanny and catching up with work at night; in his case, going into work very early one day a week to come back home early in the afternoon; in my case, selecting conferences/events that won't involve more than one or two nights away.
[normal]I have worked part time since I had my first child 16 years ago. I worked 0.6FTE for the first 8 years and 0.8 FTE for the last 8 years.
[normal]I am lucky in one sense as my partner does not work and so is free to take on childcare duties.
