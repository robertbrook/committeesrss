"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Freddie Talberg CEO of PIE Mapping’ (CYC0026)Executive SummaryPIE mapping have been running successful\nly\n a HGV complaint routing service in partnership with London Councils that gives hauliers routes to follow\n, \nwhich is \nwell \nreceived by the industry, both domestic\nally\n and with a growing number of international operators.  \nPIE also developed for\n the Olympics \na Freight Journey Planner used by TFL (still in legacy) that has the capability to impose road segment restrictions by time of day.  This was used effectively by the freight industry during the Games.\nAs such intelligent use and sharing of the road is in o\nperation for the Lorry Control Scheme and is proof that it is possible to add further time and day dependent restrictions that the industry can manage around.  \nShould good quality cycle data by; location and time of day\n for a\n \ncycle safety restriction, \nplu\ns any key \n‘left turn’\n sites that are more dangerous to use at certain times \nbe available. \nThis data can be included into a \nviable safer freight routing scheme.  This will be a more practical app\nroach than an area wide HGV ban and more effective as we learn\n more about how best to de-conflict HGV’s and cyclists. \nOther recommendations that would be\n effective and\n easier to implement \nthat will have \na big impact is to enforce construction projects to ensure contractor vehicles meet time of day and location routi\nng criteria.  \nAs such we have working proof that with good data we can set up a service for compliant HGV routes.  This will enable us to share our limited road space capacity more securely and still operate the city effectively.\n&#xa0;\nA&#xa0;brief introduction about yourself/your organisation and your reason for submitting evidence.I\n (Freddie Talberg) \n live in London with a young family and \nI \ncycle and well as motorbike\n (having passed a test) commute into central London so have firsthand experience from road user \nprospective. \n  I have \na \nprofessional experience in making maps for the different driver communities in London from; motorcyclist, disabled (blue badge) driver as well as LCV (vans) and the HGV driving community.\nMy organisation PIE Mapping started \nby creat\ning\n mapping guides for the various driving communities into London and \nhas\n developed to \nmore\n complex and sophisticated transport mapping and information services.  We delivered for TFL the comprehensive Freight Journey Planner (FJP) that was used in the Ol\nympic Games and is currently still being used in legacy.  We also created Journey Planning services for LOCOG during the Games that included navigating VIPs, Athletes, media etc across London.\nPIE Mapping is \na SME\n business that has used \nentrepreneurial\n innovation to work with London Councils to create a real first in navigating HGV’s across London in compliance to the London Lorry Con\nt\nrol Scheme (LLCS).  We have created the first compliant routing service for HGV’s that provides routes to hauliers/drive\nrs that ensure\ns\n the correct routing for their vehicle\n’s\n to the roads and with compliance \nto\n the LLCS scheme.  This ensures no penalties \nare\n imposed,  for use of inappropriate roads.  We currently have over 330 paying hauliers with a 100% compliance and a z\nero PCN issue for our clients.  Customers include operators like; Superdrug, Wincanton\n and Hanson\n. \nThe number of international haulier that sign up for our service is growing and the feedback we get from them is \npositive as \nthey love that \nthere \nis a servi\nce th\nat provides an creditable routing \nto navigate a HGV in London.  \nWe digitise \nplanned events such as the recent Lords Mayors Show, Remembrance Parade road closures etc.  \nAs such we\n automatically regenerate routes if any of these planned events \naffect\n t\nheir normal routes \nthis \nensure\ns\n \nOperators a\nlways have a compliant route\n by day and time\n.\nThe recent development \nis the ability to download a route \nto sat nav.  This enables drivers to be se\nnt a route to follow on their sat nav making it easier for drivers \nto follow the complaint and appropriate route\nWe are submitting evidence to prove that London has already a great working model for an HGV routing service that serves compliant routes which we have made easy enough that the drivers simply follow.  The feed\nback is that the driver\ns\n love it and they are h\nappy to be compliant and advised \non their rout\nes through London\n.  \nPlus du\nring the Olympic G\names the FJP (Freight Journey Planner) we created was able to restrict certain parts of the road network on a time of\n day basis.  i.e. road closures for a couple hours\n, even with \ntwo \nshort\n time\n window\ns of\n closure\ns\n in the same day\n.  This is reflective of the cycle community commuter morning and afternoon peaks. These are complex time closures which the FJP has incorporate\nd.  Each freight operator was able to use the tool/service to create their time of day routes.  We routed journey\ns\n around the restrictions or if impossible suggested a new start time for their journey. \nAny factual information you have to offer from which the committee might be able to draw conclusions, or which could be put to other witnesses for their reactions.The conclusion I draw from this is that London has already some great working models to implement compliant routing that could include location a\nnd time specific restrictions around the cycle network.  Our London Lorry Route Approver (\nwww.londonlorrycontrol.com\n) could be configured to include these restrictions as could the TFL FJP.  \nPlease also note that a \nhigh risk \nof accident\ns\n happen at left turns,  these \ncan \nbe \nadd\ned as \nleft turn restrictions on smaller roads and on a time of \nday basi\ns easily for HGV routing to be routed accordingly.\n \nThe beauty of this approach is the ability to c\nreate time and location restrictions for cycle safety.  \nThe key for a viable city and road share model is good data to determine what times and locations we can de-conflict. \nThe locations will need to be dynamic as TfL &amp; other\ns will need to \nget a handle on\n cycle \nbehaviour \ndata and which locations and times we need to protect from HGV’s .  This approach can provide a safer freight routing requirement.  i.e. hauliers have to sign up for the safer freight scheme which could be \na \nvolunteer \nservice \ninitially bas\ned on their TFL FORS membership (Fleet Operators Recognition Scheme).\n  Alternatively this could be a compulsory requirement for construction project sites.\nPIE with City University have been researching (own time) the data that is readily available that wi\nll enable us to create a good understand of the cycle behaviour model.  This\n would include \nwhich roads/routes/areas by time of day and day of the week do we ne\ned to identify.  Our research found good contacts in TFL plus sites like thi\ns:\n&#xa0;\nhttp://casa.oobrien.com/traffic/\n , \nTfL\n have volumetric data \non \n \nhttp://w\nww.wocref.org/CRI-Volume_2_files/Gordon,Parkin-Patterns_of_Use_by_Season,_Day_of_Week_and_Time_of_Day_Leading_to_Route_Typologies.pdf\n \n&#xa0;\nAny recommendations for action by the Government or others which you would like the committee to consider.My \nrecommendations would be to change the current LLCS\n (London Lorry Control Scheme)\n to be day time routing also instead of just night-t\nime or change the network restrictions for day time.  (technically we can handle the restrictions data and provide the comp\nliant routes by time and day).\nOther recommendations that will be easier and quick to implement that can work would be to enforce all construction sites/projects to have a complaint routing service for HGV contractors vehicles that includes time and \nlocation restrictions on the cycle network.  Therefore ensuring construction vehicles are not on these roads at the key times and locations as cyclist\n based on a good cyclist data model\n.  \nI recommend that the restriction areas are set up so they can be ch\nanged as we will need flexibility to \nassign key locations as we better understand the vulnerable areas and behaviours.   \nWe need more data on which locations that is best for HGVs to avoid and at what times and days of the week so the system really works. \n \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
