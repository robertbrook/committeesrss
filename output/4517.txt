[[[&#xa0;]]]“What is being created is the most personally centralised education system in Western Europe since Germany in the 1930s – each school contracted directly to the Secretary of State…”&#xa0;1.  The main focus of this submission is on the third and fourth points identified by the Committee for consideration by respondents, concerning the space between the Secretary of State and individual schools and the issues raised by academy chains with regard to governance arrangements.  I begin by referring briefly to the wider context.&#xa0;2.  The issue of ownership of publicly-funded schools is hardly ever debated.  To whom do – and should – schools funded by the public purse belong?   In past periods this may not have been a major concern.  For example politicians in the post-war period attempted to develop education policy largely by consensus, as illustrated by the three great reports from the Central Advisory Council (England) between 1959 (Crowther) and 1967 (Plowden).  2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the second of these – the Newsom report on the education of 13 to 16 year olds of average and below average ability – and like the others it provided a model of how to achieve widespread understanding of a set of educational challenges and substantial agreement on ways forward.  Actual policy tended to be negotiated between the central education department, the associations representing the local education authorities and the teachers’ unions.  It was a corporatist approach which is out of fashion today.  Even if it tended towards excessive ambiguity and diffuseness and perhaps exaggerated the degree of consensus it had the merit of taking into account some key stakeholder interests and experience outside central government.&#xa0;

[[[Autonomy – over what and for whom?]]]&#xa0;3.  The current scene is very different.  Since the Education Reform Act of 1988 schools have become ever more closely directed and monitored from Whitehall on the core aspects of education while they have been granted increasing autonomy over operational matters such as premises, staffing and admissions.  The rhetoric of autonomy has been a strong and consistent feature, expressed in terminology such as that of the ‘independent state school’.  This draws on the symbolic power of the fee-charging independent school sector which is a highly distinctive and influential feature of English education.   Although educating only about 7% of the pupil population it is resourced lavishly by any international standards, whether of state or private schools.  Its class sizes are half those of our state-funded schools, it has about twice the number of teachers for its pupil population and it charges fees up to three times the per-pupil spend in state schools.  Yet OECD research shows that, once the differences in socio-economic intake are taken into account, state-funded schools in the U.K. perform much better than independent schools.  Nevertheless independent school alumni are heavily and quite disproportionately represented in the top professions.&#xa0;4.  The status and image of independent schooling exert a powerful influence on the public imagination and this has encouraged politicians to seek to mimic the governance structure of the English private school in state-funded schooling, most notably in relation to academies which now make up more than half the secondary schools in England.  Yet the international evidence on increasing autonomy is mixed.  Autonomy over the curriculum is positively related to a system’s performance but there is no clear relationship in regard to autonomy over staffing and budgetary decisions, which is where the emphasis has been placed in England.   It seems too that institutional leaders are the big gainers rather than teaching and support staff.   Whether putting so much power – and responsibility – in the hands of headteachers is a wise strategy will become evident in due course.  Autonomy is not as simple a concept as is often implied and key questions about it are: autonomy over what and for whom?   &#xa0;5.  Moreover the private schools arguably provide an entirely inappropriate governance model, since they are primarily responsible to their owners or trustees whereas publicly provided schools have a much wider set of responsibilities including to taxpayers and indeed the whole citizenry, as well as to their local community in the broadest sense.  A pluralist governance model is surely needed that reflects these multiple obligations.&#xa0;

[[[The dem]]]

[[[ocratic deficit]]]&#xa0;6.  Yet the system as a whole has been moving sharply away from such a pluralist perspective.  The powers of local government in education have been greatly reduced in spite of evidence that a strong mediating layer is vital for successful performance.   This has given the centre ever greater control to impose its often controversial and sometimes idiosyncratic preferences about school structure, curriculum and assessment, generally with minimal trialling, on our large and complex system.  There are distinctive national constitutional issues involved, such as the weak separation of the executive from the legislature, the absence of proportional voting and the lack of constitutional protection for local government, so that the checks and balances generally found in other comparable jurisdictions are absent.  For example the Academies Act passed through Parliament at high speed in 2010 with very limited debate using special powers intended for emergency situations such as those related to terrorism.  &#xa0;7.  Also academies and other new types of school such as ‘free’ and studio schools operate on the basis of funding agreements, in effect contracts, made directly with the Secretary of State rather than any local arrangements under public law, a mechanism originally introduced by the previous Labour government.and extensively used by the present administration.  This ‘governance by contract’ raises major issues of public accountability, not least that the contract is between the Secretary of State and the sponsor and neither the child nor the parent is a party to it.  There is a significant and growing democratic deficit indicating a crisis of legitimacy.&#xa0;8.  None of this is to suggest that central government should have no role in shaping and monitoring the system.  At present however ownership is determined too heavily by its control over resources and as a consequence the distribution of power has become seriously unbalanced.  More than a decade ago the distinguished philosopher Onora O’Neill argued in her acclaimed BBC Reith Lectures that professionals and public servants should be given more scope “to serve the public rather than their paymasters”.  In education there is just as much need today to achieve a better balance between upward, lateral and downward accountability.&#xa0;9.  The issue becomes even more acute in relation to the academy chains which are currently proliferating.  Although they vary in style and organisation, their head offices and centres of power are generally distant from the social, economic and geographical communities in which the schools are located, so that substantial control is exercised remotely.  This model is very different from that of the ‘independent state school’ and it offers little scope for local democratic or strategic co-ordination or community governance.  It can fairly be said that schools in chains are not independent, they just have different masters.  In fact the barrister David Wolfe who specialises in education law has pointed out that a maintained school entering into a sponsored academy chain loses its distinct legal identity – it becomes simply the educational activity which the sponsor provides at that particular location under its funding agreement.  In fact Wolfe comments that the academy chains “have even greater control over the academies they run than did local education authorities” before delegated budgets and so on were introduced a quarter of a century ago.  It is a vivid illustration of how misleading the rhetorical use of terms like autonomy can be.  &#xa0;10.  Policy has also since the late 1980s strongly reflected a belief in the power of competition to improve schooling.  However a major OECD review in 2010 of more than 250 studies found very little evidence to support this view.  According to this wide-ranging study, introducing market mechanisms in education does not tend to generate innovation, it could increase social segregation and the evidence showed no link to improved teaching and learning.  There was no indication that private providers did better than traditional ones.  Research from different contexts showed that co-operation between schools is a highly fragile and vulnerable process in a competitive, market-driven climate.&#xa0;

[[[The need for a new framework]]]&#xa0;11.  Contrary to much rhetoric, there is no convincing evidence that any particular type of school in terms of governance structure produces superior performance, against the narrow criteria determined by policy-makers, when all relevant factors are taken into account and like is rigorously compared with like.  Beyond this, the governance of publicly-funded schooling should be far more than a technical matter of which provider can get the best test and exam results: moral, social and cultural issues lie at the heart of schooling.  If, for example, the academy chain model became more widespread and some chains achieved control of large numbers of schools, as some aspire to do, the issue of who exercises legitimate power in the system would become prominent.&#xa0;12.  In this general context there is an urgent need to define models and approaches that can deliver an alternative to the current polarisation: an excessive focus on autonomy and competition on the one hand and alienating and unsustainable centralisation on the other.  A new framework is required in which trust and collaboration are emphasised and which spreads ownership to local communities and stakeholders within a pluralist multi-level system.  The support and performance management of all schools should be provided locally and the concepts of ‘local school system’ and ‘local family of schools’ should have real meaning.  It is not right for the only significant democratic input to schooling to be at central level.  &#xa0;13.  The Committee will no doubt receive numerous detailed formulations and I hope will assess them at least in part against the above criteria.  I want to make one specific proposal.  The arrival of academies has brought with it stark differences in the ways in which publicly-funded schools are governed.   This is unfair, divisive and indefensible.  All publicly-funded schools should be placed within a common administrative and legal framework based on the principles of public not contract law.  It follows that variations in levels of autonomy between different categories of school should be kept to an absolute minimum and a strong and convincing rationale should be provided for any such differences, which is not the case currently.&#xa0;14.  This proposal puts into strong focus the regime of outsourcing embodied in the mechanism of funding agreements applied to academies.  This method (which is highly idiosyncratic for this type of purpose internationally) was not designed to be operated on the kind of scale at which it is now being employed.   In view of recent incidents it is becoming even clearer that this process cannot be managed at such a scale by central government without major risks but it is also unlikely that local authorities or other middle tier bodies, such as the regional ‘headteacher boards’ led by ‘chancellors’ that the government is reported to be planning, could effectively, consistently and economically do so either.&#xa0; It would be irresponsible to continue along this path.  The aim should be to phase this system out as existing agreements come to the end of their life.  In the meantime an approach based on over-riding the agreements by regulation and/or by primary legislation “in order to bring proper coherence and restore a schools ‘system’” as proposed by David Wolfe should be adopted.&#xa0;15.   Various models might be considered suitable for providing the common framework.  An obvious one is that of the maintained school trust.  This preserves that degree of ‘autonomy’ which has achieved such totemic significance in English policy discourse as well as allowing for the involvement of external bodies in governance which is claimed to have a beneficial impact.  It also facilitates strong collaborative arrangements and enables wide stakeholder involvement as successfully demonstrated, for example, by the Co-operative group of schools which now number over 600.  It might also allow faith schools to be effectively integrated.  Stronger regulation or reform of admissions might be required, since trust schools are their own admissions authorities.  This is simply one possibility, and legal as well as educational and administrative expertise would need to be brought to bear on fashioning an appropriate framework.  What is required above all is an inclusive and integrated set of arrangements which avoids favouritism and unjustified hierarchies.  To my knowledge, the most successful educational systems, combining high quality with equity, have such arrangements at their heart.&#xa0;

[[[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The status and image of independent schooling exert a powerful influence on the public imagination and this has encouraged politicians to seek to mimic the governance structure of the English private school in state-funded schooling, most notably in relation to academies.  Autonomy is not as simple a concept as is often implied and key questions about it are: autonomy over what and for whom?&#xa0;The centre has secured ever greater control to impose its preferences about school structure, curriculum and assessment on our large and complex system.  There is a significant and growing democratic deficit indicating a crisis of legitimacy.&#xa0;‘Governance by contract’ in relation to academies raises serious issues of public accountability and cannot be operated at the very large scale intended without major risks.  The aim should be to phase this system out as existing agreements come to the end of their life.  In the meantime an approach based on over-riding the funding agreements should be adopted.  &#xa0;The ‘academy chain’ model is very different from that of the ‘independent state school’ and it offers little scope for local democratic or strategic co-ordination or community governance.  It can fairly be said that schools in chains are not independent, they just have different masters.&#xa0;Contrary to much rhetoric, there is no convincing evidence that any particular type of school in terms of governance structure produces superior performance against the conventionally-accepted criteria.&#xa0;A new framework is required in which trust and collaboration are emphasised and which spreads ownership to local communities and stakeholders within a pluralist multi-level system.  It is not right for the only significant democratic input to schooling to be at central level.&#xa0;All publicly-funded schools should be placed within a common administrative and legal framework based on the principles of public not contract law.  Variations in levels of autonomy should be kept to an absolute minimum and fully justified as exceptions.  Various models including that of the maintained school trust should be considered.  An inclusive and integrated set of arrangements which avoids favouritism and unjustified hierarchies is required.       &#xa0;December 20131&#xa0; Pring, R.
