[normal]• 
[normal]All consumers should be able to open a bank account unless they have a
[normal] 
[normal]criminal conviction
[normal] that prevents them from doing s
[normal]o.
[normal]• Branches should have opening hours to suit consumers and provide a full
[normal] 
[normal]range of services.
[normal]• Staff should be involved in training programmes to deal with every
[normal] 
[normal]eventuality and 
[normal]be empowered to make decisions to help consumers quickly.
[normal]• Fees and charges should be transparent, fair and proportionate.
[normal]• Better communication around how consumers are protected online and training to use these services are vital.
[normal]• Contacting the bank should cost the same for new and existing
[normal] 
[normal]customers. More detail is needed on how much it costs to call using
[normal] 
[normal]different networks.
[normal]• Communications should be in plain English. More work is needed to 
[normal]revise how 
[normal]changes to products can be more easily communicated whilst remaining within the guidelines from the financial regulator.
[normal]• Product offerings should be presented in a way that helps consumers compare the full range of services and know that they can switch.
[normal]• The complaints process should be available from all points of contact,
[normal] 
[normal]verbal 
[normal]complaints logged and actioned and leaflets available in branch displays.
[normal]• A review of packaged accounts, eligibility processes and usage of
[normal] 
[normal]individual 
[normal]services is needed.

[normal]People in Northern Ireland have told us they use branches of banks quite regularly. Eight in ten (80%) visited a branch of a bank at least once in the past year, six in ten (60%) in the last month and three in ten (32%) in the last week.

[normal]Previously the Financial Services Authority (FSA) supervision policy allowed for increased scrutiny of the largest firms with the largest number of customers across the UK. 
[normal]This meant that not all banks operating in NI were receiving the same robust and persistent supervision.   We are expecting to see a more detailed level of testing extended to NI now that FCA has taken up its new role.
