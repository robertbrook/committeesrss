"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence submitted by Professor Roger Scully (DWB 04)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nWhile t\nhe Draft Wales Bil\nl \n(2013) \ncovers many important matters, here\n I will concentrate on the proposed reform to National Assembly for Wales (NAW) elections regarding ‘dual candidacy’. I will address two areas: the substance of the proposed reform, and the process of reform.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDual Candidacy: Substantive Considerations&#xa0;\nThe \nGovernment of Wales Act 2006 (GOWA) \nmade a change to\n \nthe \nelectoral system \nused for NAW elections\n,\n introducing a provision \nto \nprevent\n individuals from standing \nas candidates\n both in a constituency and for a regional party list.\n Th\ne justification offered for this change \nin the Government White Paper preceding the 2006 Act\n was \nthat “\nvoters are confused and concerned by the way the Assembly’s \nelectoral system permits \ncandidate\ns who lose in a first past the post\n \nconstituency ballot still to become Assembly Members representing the\n \nsame area through the regional list system and competing with\n \nAssembly Members who defeated them\n” (\nBetter Governance for Wales\n, 2005, \np.3)\n. The White paper\n later \nalso \nargued that \n“For losing candidates to become Assembly Members regardless of their constituency election results both devalues the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to vote in constituency elections” (\nBetter Governance for Wales\n, 2005, \npp.28-29).\n&#xa0;\nIn evidence given to th\nis\n committee \nduring consideration of the 2006 Act, \nI argued against the ban on dual candidacy. I believe that the main argument\ns I developed then remain intact\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHowever, while \nthe arguments used to support the 2006 ban do not stand up to any serious scrutiny, the ban is\n now in place. The question is whether it should remain.\n&#xa0;\nN\neither \nAMS \nwith dual candidacy nor \nAMS \nwithout dual candidacy would be my most preferred system for electing the NAW. \n(I am personally a supporter of the Single Transferrable Vote, as advocated by the Richard Commission). However, of these two versions of AMS, I think that one with dual candidacy\n is clearly preferable.\n&#xa0;\nI find it very difficult to see \nany\n strong principled arguments against dual candidacy\n.\n Opponents of dual candidacy have argued that it is inappropriate for those who have already been rejected by the electorate in a particular constituency to nonetheless end up being elected.\n This, I believe, represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the AMS electoral system – at least in its MMP variant. \nDefeated constituency candidates have, of course, been rejected for that particular constituency. But list seats are a wholly different type\n of mandate, and under MMP these seats are allocated\n \nin a way that \nspecifically allows for the representation of parties who have \nnot\n been very successful \nin constituency contests – parties who have, in a sense, been rejected at the constituency level.\n If parties that are defeated at constituency level can still win representation through the list, then it is difficult to see why that should not also apply to individuals.\n&#xa0;\nBanning dual candidacy under the MMM variant of AMS makes a little more sense. \nUnder MMM, t\nhe constituency and list elections are wholly separate, with the allocation of list seats unrelated to success in the constituencies. In this context, requiring parties to offer separate groups of candidates for these separate contests perhaps makes some sense. For MMP, it makes no sense whatsoever. This is probably why n\no countries or regions other than Wales who have \nimplemented the \nMMP version of AMS have seen any compelling reasons to\n ban dual candidacy\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere are also some good practical reasons for favouring dual candidacy. First, banning dual candidacy helps to create \nsome perverse incentives. \nIn particular, banning dual candidacy makes\n it electorally advantageous for a party’s list \ncandidates \nto see their \nconstituency candidates\n lose\n.\n Similarly, voters wishing to see a particular list candidate elected may have an incentive to vote against that candidate’s party in the constituency election.\n&#xa0;\nSecond (and I think, \nfar \nmore importantly), there is a compelling need to ensure that the electoral system does not inhibit the quality of elected representation within the NAW. The Assembly has only 60 members – as many have arg\nued, a wholly inadequate number. Given the paucity of AMs, we should certainly not impose restrictions on the ability of the parties to ensure that their best people (or at least those whom the parties believe are their best people) are elected to the Assembly. This was a \nprincipal\n conclusion \nof the recent \ndetailed investigation of AMS conducted in New Zealand, where the system was introduced to replace First Past the Post in the 1990s.\n As the final report of this commission stated, “It is both proper and desirable under MMP that political parties can protect good candidates contesting marginal or unwinnable electorates [constituencies] by positioning them high enough on their list to be elected.” (\nReport of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System\n, 2012, \np.38)\n&#xa0;\nThirdly, there are better ways than a ban on dual candidacy to remove the problems that have occasionally been reported \nwith \nconstituency representatives \nbeing \nconcerned that list AMs are encroaching on ‘their turf’. One way would be to implement the Richard Commission recommendation of STV.\n STV would remove the problem of there being two categories of elected representative (constituency and list), and place all AMs on the same footing. \nA second \nway of addressing the problem \nmight \nbe to elect list AMs from a national list (with a 5% minimum threshold imposed to prevent the system fragmenting excessively\n). This\n \nwould remove\n any sense of local r\nepresentation from list members, and might well therefore reduce the scope for friction between constituency and list members.\n&#xa0;\nBy far the most detailed examination of AMS conducted in recent times \nis \nthat \nproduced in \nNew Zealand\n.\n The\n report\n of this Commission\n, which drew on substantial evidence from numerous sources, is an impressive piece of work. On dual candidacy, the report’s conclusion was unambiguous: \n“Candidates \nshould continue to be able to stand both for an electorate [constituency] seat and be on a party list” (\nReport of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System\n, 2012, \np.37).\n&#xa0;\nI see no reason to disagree with this conclusion.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReforming the NAW Electoral System: Improving the Process&#xa0;\nDebates about dual candidacy, both in 2006 and now, raise questions o\nf process as well as substance. The following statements \nare \nso obvious as to border on the banal, but they have, I think, important implications for when and how electoral systems are\n reformed\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFrom these statements, it follows \nfairly \ndirectly \nthat political p\narties should be inhibited from \nchanging electoral rules \nto their own benefit\n. It also follows\n that any \nchanges to \nthe \nrules \nthat are implemented \nshould command widespread\n, cross-party\n support\n.\n&#xa0;\nEvaluated in relation to these standards, the \n2006 dual candidacy \nban fell a long way short of the ideal.\n \nThe ban \nwas mentioned in the 2005 Labour manifesto, so there was in some sense an electoral mandate for the change.\n \nHowever, as described above, \nthe ban was introduced \non \nthe \nbasis of very dubious arguments\n,\n and \nunderpinned by \nlittle\n or no\n obvious\nly\n principle\nd conduct. The ban was also introduced\n by one party against widespread opposition: not only \nthat of \nall\n \nthe \nother major parties, but also \nagainst the \nviews of most other \nrelevant \nnon-partisan actors (\nthe \nElectoral Commission, \nthe \nE\nlectoral \nR\neform \nS\nociety\n, \nand most academic commentators\n)\n.\n This is surely an example\n, in terms of the \nprocess\n of electoral reform,\n that we \nin Wales \nshould \nseek never \nto repeat.\n&#xa0;\nOne could also question the \nprocedural \nlegitimacy of Westminster continuing\n, over the\n long-term\n,\n to legislate over electoral arrangements for the NAW, \ngiven that the Assembly is \na body with its own democratic mandate. Such questions may become particularly stark in the future if one see\ns UK governments elected with\n very limited electoral support from Wales.\n&#xa0;\nI therefore propose that the Wales Bill should be amended to transfer powers over the conduct of NAW elections to the National Assembly. \nHowever, to prevent any possibility of manipulation \nof the electoral rules \nby \nany \none party, \nthe Bill \nshould \nalso provide \nfor \na ‘\nsuper-majority\n’\n requirement for any change to \nthe \ncurrent la\nw, with a \nthree-quarters majority \nof all \nNAW \nmembers \nneeded \nto approve any changes. This would prevent \nany \nsingle party \nfrom changing the electoral system to suit its \nown interests\n; \nindeed, a three-quarters majority \nwould \nalso \nhave prevented \nthe 2007-11 \nLabour-Plaid coalition \nfrom \nchanging \nthe electoral system \nwithout \nthe support of \nat least one other party.\n&#xa0;\n6 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n I thank Prof David Farrell (University College Dublin), Dr Thomas Lundberg (University of Glasgow), Prof Louis \nMassic\note\n (Laval University, Quebec) and \nDr Alan Renwick (University of Reading) for assistance \nand advice \nin drafting this evidence.\n See\n evidence by Prof David Farrell of University College Dublin to the Irish Convention on the Constitution, in\n \nFourth Report of the Convention on the Constitution\n, \nAugust 2013 (\nhttps://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=fdf70670-030f-e311-a203-005056a32ee4\n).\n Bavaria offers an interesting variant of MMP: it uses open-list MMP, where Bavarians vote for individual party list candidates, not closed party lists. It does not allow for the dual listing of candidate names \nin the particular single-member constituency in which a candidate stands\n, because the constituency candidates' names would be on the ballot papers twice. These candidates, however, \nmust\n be dual candidates and are on their parties' ballot paper lists everywhere else in the electoral region.\n It should be pointed out, for the sake of accuracy that Hungary’s system, and Italy’s between 1993-2005, are\n/were\n only semi-proportional.\n The ban on dual candidacy in Ukraine was introduced prior to the 2002 parliamentary elections – by the same party that \nnot long afterwards \nattempted to fix the result of the \np\nresidential election and poison the main opposition candidate.\n In debates preceding the 2006 GOWA, particular attention focused on the example of the 2003 constituency contest in Clwyd West, where three defeated constituency candidates all ended up being elected as list AMs.\n \n \nReport of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System\n, 2012; available at:\nhttp://www.mmpreview.org.nz/have-your-say/final-report\n.\n One might reasonably question the extent to which voters had been inf\normed about, never mind endorsed, the dual candidacy ban in the 2005 general election.\n \nThe issue was barely discussed in the main Labour manifesto, which stated only that \n“\nIn \nWales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger\n \nAssembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure\n \nand electoral system to make the exercise of Assembly responsibilities\n \nclearer and more accountable to the public\n” (p.108, \nBritain Forward not Back\n)\n. \nThe dual candidacy b\nan \nwas \nonly mentioned explicitly \no\nn pp.108-110 of \nthe \nWelsh Labour ma\nnifesto, \nWales Forward not Back\n.\n"
