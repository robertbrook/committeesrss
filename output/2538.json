We sought to get her support \n              \nreinstated.  The local authority did not back down and (unsurprisingly) ran a delay argument.  We issued a judicial review, with detailed witness st\natements from the client, ourselves, and the charity dealing with the delay point.  Permission was refused on the grounds of delay. We renewed, and after a very tough hearing were able to persuade a judge to make an exception from the normal three month ru\nle and grant permission.  The case then subsequently settled very favourably for our client, but in order to secure a favourable settlement, we settled on the basis of no order as to costs.\n&#xa0;\nThere is no way that a case such as this would be brought in the \nfuture if the current judicial review proposals are implemented, as no firm would run the risk of getting knocked out on permission and \nthen \nnot \nbeing \npaid at all, even though the underlying case was good. \n&#xa0;\nCivil merits test – removing legal aid for borderline cases&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlternative solutions&#xa0;Some years ago, the Legal Services Commission   consulted on the possibility of restricting legal aid for judicial review to those firms and organisations that had a demonstrable track record of success and expertise or who had staff who could show this. \n \nWhile it was rejected at the time, the climate may now be right for the introduction of this to ensure that the Court’s time is not wasted by badly prepared applications and legal aid money is not wasted on frivolous applications\n. This would resolve many o\nf the issue the Government has said its proposals are intended to address.\n&#xa0;\nEquality Assessment in the original consultation paper              \nWe do not recognise the assumptions lying behind th\ne supposed “Impact Assessment”. \n We estimate that virtually all of our cl\nients in our recent education judicial review cases have protected characteristics and are vulnerable and some 70% of those in community care cases.  Even where the client does not have a protected characteristic, they are almost invariably  vulnerable as \nthey will be young people who \nare or \nhave been in care and are nearly always in extremely deprived and difficult circumstances.  \nOn the face of it these proposals seem discriminatory in themselves.  \nThe proposals on paying for work up to obtaining \npermission\n would seriously affect their interests as it is highly likely that \nmany\n providers will be extremely reluctant to take on cases other than those that \nare\n absolutely certain of success, and then only if the amount of work which is carried out, can\n be done at half the current time levels.  In addition, many providers will simply be unable to act pro bono in effect in these cases.  Provision for this group which is already low, wi\nll\n diminish further as local authorities realise that there is little e\nffective control over their actions.\n27 September 2013\n25\n&#xa0;\n \n“Habeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to \"British subjects.\" Is it really limited to British nationals? Suffice it to say that the case law has given an emphatic \"no\" to the question. Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal \nprotection of our laws. There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protection. This principle has been in the law at least since Lord Mansfield freed \"the black\" in Sommersett's Case (1\n772) 20 St.Tr. 1 . There is nothing here to encourage in the case of aliens or non-patrials the implication of words excluding the judicial review our law normally accords to those whose liberty is infringed.” \n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/lsc/legal-aid-stats-12-13.pdf\n, see page 2\n See \nthe comments of the Shadow Attorney Gene\nral, Emily Thornberry MP at: \nhttp://legalvoice.org.uk/topstories/legal-aid-cuts-very-much-a-labour-issue/\n [2006] ULPB 567\n Re Appeal by Governing Body of JFS School [2009]WLR 2333\n"
