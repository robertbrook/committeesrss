[normal]Having been inspired by the example and prominence of phenomenal female athletes throughout London 2012, we were determined to contribute to women's sport having much higher visibility and funding.  We conceived the idea of a movement for women’s sport that provided multiple routes of engagement for women and men to positively affect change.

[normal]We have the active support of an extraordinary range of elite athletes who comprise world champions, Olympians and rising stars across 20 able bodied and Paralympic sports.  We asked them, “What would you change to advance women’s sport in the UK?”

[normal]As a new charity, we have yet to promote our grants and clearly state on our website that our grant process is not yet fully operational.  Despite this, we have received 96 online applications since November 2012.  WST grants range from £500 to £5000.  Figure 1 shows the level of financial support applicants have requested to date.

[normal]We have identified that there is an opportunity for sponsors who want to capitalise upon the focus on gender equality by government (Davis Report).  By supporting women’s sport, sponsors have the opportunity to positively position their brand, and differentiate themselves from their competitors.  There are also significant opportunities in taking a lead in a marketplace that is relatively underdeveloped and therefore less costly.

[normal]Statistics from WSFF amongst others on the paucity of media coverage of women’s sport make a compelling case for the need for change.  That said WST has taken a strategic decision to work constructively with the media to amplify good practice, highlight progress and build alliances with individual journalists as well as media organisations.  Although we only officially launched in July 2013, our contacts at organisations including Sky Sports, the BBC, the Guardian, the Metro and the Telegraph have enabled us to place stories, raise the profile of athletes and comment on live issues.   We want to play our part in making it easier for the media to cover women’s sport rather than just tell them that they should.  There is perhaps scope for some of the NGBs to look at more ways of actively engaging the media and instigating stories.

[normal]There is no magic bullet or single initiative that will generate progress in women’s sport.  We can’t wait for the media to change the landscape, the sponsors to bring the money, the spectators to encourage the sponsorship or role models to drive participation.  We can’t wait for any of this to happen in isolation – it needs to happen together in a systemic way that enables lasting change.
