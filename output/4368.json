"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nCivil Engineering Contractors Association\n (LTD0008)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Civil Engineering Contractors Association (CECA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the above named call for evidence. \n&#xa0;\nCECA provides the voice for those companies who create, improve and maintain th\ne UK’s vital transport and utility networks. Our membership of more than 300 companies together delivers an estimated 70-80 per cent of all infrastructure construction work carried out nationwide. Our industry supports the employment of around 200,000 peop\nle with annual activity worth up to £25 billion.\n&#xa0;\nCECA cautiously welcomes the introduction of local decision making on transport expenditure. While there is a long way to go before the success of the policy can be measured, it is clear that greater integr\nation between bodies operating at local and regional level is required\n to enable effective delivery\n.  \n&#xa0;\nCECA is concerned that there is a lack of clarity as to how the funding will be allocated and how local bodies are expected to work together to deliver \nmajor transport projects. We call on Government to work with all \nbodies \ninvolved in \nthe \nfuture delivery of \nlocal transport \nprojects to address this to ensure that any proposed developments are not burdened from the start by confusion.\n&#xa0;\nIn our response, we \nhave focused on the areas in which we believe we can add the most value. We trust that you find our comments helpful and that they will be taken into consideration.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Rationale&#xa0;\nThe 2010 Coalition Agreement clearly set out the current Government’s localist intentions and the Localism Act devolved decision making powers from central government to individuals, communities and councils.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2010 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) w\nere announced taking over the role of Regional Development Agencies in terms of promoting local economic growth.\n&#xa0;\nCECA believes that good transport is key to local economic growth and acknowledge\ns\n \nt\nhe view that only local \nbodies\n \ncan identify transport need\ns \nin their area \nand deliver \nappropriate \nsolutions. \n&#xa0;\nOver the past few years \nresponsibility\n for funding and decision making for \nlocal major transport schemes \nand the regional rail network \nhave been devolved. T\nransport has \nplayed a key role in the City Deal\ns and funding for transport majors is being devolved \nto Local Transport Bodies\n via \nLEPs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Advantages and disadvantages&#xa0;\nCECA believes that the introduction of Local Transport Bodies \n(LTBs) \ncould play a key role in improving \ndecision-making on local \ntransport expenditure\n. LTBs remove \nthe need for a centralised bidding process and monetary\n bidding thresholds and ensure\n \ndecisions are made locally\n rather than introducing centralised \nand one-sized fits all \nsolutions\n from Westminster\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, CECA remains concerned that the proposals to devol\nve funding for transport to \nlocal bodies\n \nmay lead to a lack of strategic decision-making in local communities. CECA supports the proposal for local communities to be able to make decisions in relat\nion to their \narea. However we remain concerned about a potential lack of collaborative working between LEPs\n and other local bodies\n to deliver significant projects across their geographical boundaries.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAre there better models?&#xa0;\nGiven that \nLTBs are not yet\n in full operation\n, it is hard to tell whether \nthey will be effective solutions\n. However, CECA notes that there \nare already some \nexamples of how local decision making on transport expenditure is proving to be a success. \n&#xa0;\nLondon transport is perhaps the best example of effective local decision making. In London all transport \npolicy and funding \nis decided by the Mayor’s Office and put into place by Transport for London (TfL). Transport policies developed by TfL have improved\n services, reduced journey times and reduced congestion within Greater London. \nHowever, it is important to note that London is the only city in the UK to have developed such an integrated, locally focused and locally delivered transport system. \n&#xa0;\nDesk based research has suggested that the model adopted in Barcelona is a good \ninternational \nexample of organisation and innovation. In this case governance takes the form of a joint management board and joint executive committee with equal membership bet\nween the Catalonian Government and local authorities. Notably the Barcelona model is funded by the state government, the Catalonian government and by local authorities. As a result of collaborative working, Barcelona has gained a reputation for transport i\nnnovatio\nn. Furthermore, there have been i\nmprovements in customer satisfaction and passenger growth.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;CECA believes that while the bodies referenced above will have excellent knowledge of their individual organisation\nal challenges, they may need assistance in working together effectively \nas a\n delivery body. \n&#xa0;\nWe believe that local bodies are best placed to decide what the transport priorities are in their area, although they should be supported in their decision-making\n process through the availability of \nrobust\n evaluation models \nthat have been developed by the Department of Transport. This will build confidence that \nany decisions taken are evidence-based rather than politically motiovated. \n&#xa0;\nWhen it comes to the delivery of schemes \nmany local authorities \nface limitations on the resources available to them, with limited experience of the challeneges associated with the delivery of occasional lar\ng\ne projects\n, CECA proposes the creation of a trans\nport ‘Flying Squad’ to assist local bodies \nin\n the development of\n such\n major infrastructure projects. Such a group could include, for example, representatives from industry and central Government working in partnership with local bodies to ensure that the m\nost effective and beneficial projects are developed. The flying squad could also provide expertise on procurement practice to minimise cost and delay.\n&#xa0;\nAn example of collaborative working can also be found in the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots p\nrogramme.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBox 1: Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme&#xa0;\nThe Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme is a private-led partnership (comprising CECA, the Royal Town Planning Institute, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\n and local project co-ordinators). The partnership aims to progress stalled local infrastructure projects with potential to release economic growth by resolving barriers to progress.\n&#xa0;\nMultidisciplinary teams of experts (working on a pro-bono basis) nominat\ned by the partnership have been invited by local authorities to assist a small number of local projects in the first wave.\n&#xa0;\nThe partnership approach involves face-to-face interaction with local partners to uncover and understand barriers to progress. \nTypical barriers include local co-ordination and capacity issues as much as, or rather than, access to finance.\n&#xad;\n&#xad;\n&#xad;\n&#xad;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCECA’s primary concern with regard to the devolution of transport decision-making to local bodies relates to how such organisations deal with opportunities to invest in infrastructure where doing so crossed boundaries. \nEffective long-term planning with cro\nss-authority support and cooperation is essential to delivering projects to time and to budget. \n&#xa0;\nA case in point can be seen in the Atlantic Gateway redevelopment in North West England which highlights the need for greater integration at local and regiona\nl level. The redevelopment project crosses three LEP areas and over a dozen local authorities. A small steering group has been established, but CECA feels that its focus is more on promoting the project rather than programme management, funding, co-ordinat\nion, joining up employment and training. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn order to further ensure delivery of cross-boundary projects, CECA calls on Government to intervene when it becomes apparent that local bodies are not working together effectively. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The effectiveness of collaborative working varies across the UK. To ensure that these variations do not continue after 2015, CECA calls on Government to ensure th\nat LEPs in partnership with local bodies give and demonstrate real consideration as to what will be best for their local community. \n&#xa0;\nIt is essential that the right evidence based approach is adopte\nd for all\n local decision making. Transport solutions must \ncome from solid, independent, research rather than tailoring evidence to\n develop a project\n. In this regard, CECA recommends that local communities continue to work closely with the Department for Transport \n(DfT) \nto develop an approved evidence collection a\nnd transport solution model. \n&#xa0;\nCECA would not wish to see a scenario where local bodies attempt to ensure that every areas gets its “share” of funding if this stands in the way of delivering the most economical and socially beneficial projects. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe way that Government funds major local transport projects will radically change from 2015 when major transport scheme \nfunding is devolved to LEPs as part of the Single Local Growth Fund.\n&#xa0;\nThe funding, taken from existing Whitehall funds will enable LEPs to bid for funding from a “single pot”. CECA believes that the funding, if used effectively, has the potential to rebala\nnce the economy through the development of ambitious local transport schemes and \nwill enable LEPs and Local Transport Bodies to show what real added value they can bring. CECA anticipates that if the devolution of funding is successful, more will follow fo\nr further projects. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, we remain concerned that money allocated through the Growth \nFund for transport projects could be diverted to other, non-transport projects. C\nECA \nsuggests that once\n funding is\n allocated to a particular project, \nit \nremains ring\n-fenced specifically for that project. \nWe hope that clear guidance will be provided to those in receipt of Growth Deal funding. \n&#xa0;\nThe provision of major project funding devolution and the Single Local Growth fund opens up the potential of improved visibility of future investment. \n&#xa0;\nClear pipeline visibility is essential to ensure that cross boundary transport schemes are delivered ef\nfectively. Significant benefits and efficiencies will arise where greater forward visibility is available to the supply chain in terms of future investment. The key benefits associated with pipeline visibility are listed below, but CECA remains concerned t\nhat there is no pipeline visibility for local transport after 2015. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFor these reasons we believe that a condition should be placed on those receiving Single Local Growth Fund  that they publish and maintain \na forward pipeline of the infrastructure investments that they anticipate supporting. In doing so they will ensure the best possible response from industry, securing efficient delivery and local job creation.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
