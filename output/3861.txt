[[[Written evidence submitted by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association (ILPA) (JRR 0024)]]]&#xa0;…it is fundamental to the rule of law that every citizen, perhaps above all the poor, the vulnerable, the disadvantaged, should be able to go to court to vindicate their rights or to defend themselves, whether to challenge excesses of Executive power, to protect private rights, to be compensated for wrongs, to secure family rights, or to defend themselves if prosecuted. Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court &#xa0; … [judicial review] can be characterised as the rule of law in action… Ministry of Justice &#xa0;

[[[SUMMARY]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In this response: we consider the evidence that has been provided by the Government. We invite the Committee to ask the Government for such evidence as it holds on the likely effect of the proposals, the data that has been collected from legal aid funding applications, the data on judicial reviews that settle pre and post permission, the outcomes of judicial reviews and the extent to which the Government concedes allegedly unmeritorious cases and in what circumstances. &#xa0;We set out how the Immigration Bill foregrounds and increases reliance on judicial review and on human rights and the limitations of this approach, taken alone and in conjunction with the cuts to legal aid. Human rights set important limits to the powers of the State, but cannot bear the full weight of the constitutional settlement. We highlight the implications of attacks on judges and lawyers for the rule of law.  No Government department gains greater protection from challenge under the proposals to “transform” legal aid than the former UK Border Agency and these proposals would further insulate the former Agency from challenge.  We discuss the Bill, ranging more widely than the appeals provisions over other areas where the only challenge will be by judicial review. We draw attention to drafting that could preclude the bringing of human rights appeals out of country and ask the Committee to enquire when the Bill will be amended.  We ask the Committee to clarify whether eligibility for legal aid will lapse when a person leaves the UK because they are remove, as proposed in the Bill, before their appeal has finally been determined. &#xa0;We go on to discuss standing and third party interventions providing examples from the field of immigration including the Joint Committee’s own work on what became the HSMP Forum case. &#xa0;We consider costs of judicial review being “at risk” in cases funded by legal aid and invite the Committee to revisit Lord Justice Jackson’s proposals that qualified one-way costs shifting be introduced in judicial review cases and that non-governmental organisations bringing challenges in the public interest be eligible for qualified one-way costs shifting.  We discuss the former UK Border Agency’s conduct as a litigant and how this affects costs.  We touch on wasted costs.  We address protective costs orders and suggest that the Committee ask for information about the costs incurred by claimants and defendants in Aarhus Covention cases. &#xa0;We review the question of procedural as opposed to substantive defects in decisions with reference to asylum cases and invite the Committee  to ask the Government to explain what is proposed to be included within ‘procedural defects’.&#xa0;We examine the question of the public sector equality duty.&#xa0;Finally we address proposals for leapfrogging, with reference to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the Committee’s work on it. 

[[[INTRODUCTION]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Evidence Base]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;For example, there is little or no consideration of the fact that significant numbers of judicial review claims settle pre-and post-permission, suggesting that far from being unmeritorious, or deliberate “delaying” tactics, the claims were properly and responsibly brought and conducted, and that the parties managed to achieve a resolution of the claim without using further court time and resources. Comprehensive statistics, identifying this class of case discretely, should be collated and provided.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]…wants to be sure that there are not also cases where the respondent concedes simply because they are unwilling to face the delays and costs that prolonged legal battle can involve. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]We are aware that there has still been no systematic review by the Government of the exercise by the Upper Tribunal of its judicial review jurisdiction generally, and there is therefore no evidence before Parliament of how the Upper Tribunal is performing that significant judicial role. We urge the Government to consider amending the Bill to insert additional safeguards ensuring that immigration and nationality cases in which human rights such as life, liberty or freedom from torture are at stake continue to be decided by high court judges.

[[[HUMAN RIGHTS, LEGAL AID, JUDICIAL REVIEW, THE IMMIGRATION BILL AND THE RULE OF LA]]]

[[[W]]]&#xa0; “The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.”  Henry the Sixth, Part II, Act IV, Scene ii&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Human rights]]]&#xa0;“…it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.” &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Independence o]]]

[[[f the judiciary and of lawyers]]]&#xa0;The historic justification, and primary duty, of any civilised government is to ensure the defence of the realm from foreign threats and the rule of law at home …If it cannot provide those timeless and fundamental features, a government is not worthy of the name… Securing the rule of law at home requires, amongst other things: a high quality and independent judiciary; an accessible and effective court system; and an accessible, high quality, independent legal profession.&#xa0;… [judicial review] is not a promotional tool for countless Left-wing campaigners. So that is why we are publishing our proposals for change. We will protect the parts of judicial review that are essential to justice, but stop the abuse. &#xa0;

[[[Legal aid]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The Immigration Bill]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;HE.18 Substantial force had been used in one case to take a pregnant woman resisting removal to departures. The woman was not moved using approved techniques. She was placed in a wheelchair to assist her to the departures area.&#xa0;When she resisted, it was tipped-up with staff holding her feet. At one point she slipped down from the chair and the risk of injury to the unborn child was significant. There is no safe way to use force against a pregnant woman, and to initiate it for the purpose of removal is to take an unacceptable risk.&#xa0;&#xa0;The UK Border Agency would prefer that pregnant women, vulnerable adults and under 18s who form part of family groups in Cedars left the UK voluntarily and compliantly. It would not be practical to consider a blanket ban on the use of physical intervention on pregnant women and under 18s as this might encourage non-compliance and render the Agency unable to maintain effective immigration controls. &#xa0;We are concerned that the policy position set out in that response [the government’s response, described above] directly contradicts the assurances which have been given to the Court and the parties in this action, which is now reflected in policy guidance published on the UK Border Agency’s website, and upon which the Claimants have been invited by the Home Secretary to withdraw their claim for judicial review.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;…however well administered the present [immigration] control may be, it is fundamentally wrong and inconsistent with the rule of law that power to take decisions affecting a man’s whole future should be vested in officers of the executive, from whose findings there is no appeal… The safeguards provided by such a procedure serve not only to check any possible abuse of executive power but also to private individual a sense of protection against oppression and injustice, and of confidence in his dealings with the administration which are in themselves of great value.  We believe that immigrants and their relatives and friends need the same kind of reassurance against their fears of arbitrary action on the part of the Immigration Service.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;..struggles with the volume of its casework, which has led to historical backlogs running into the hundreds of thousands; the number of illegal immigrants removed does not keep up with the number of people who are here illegally…the agency has been a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008, and its performance is not good enough.…it has conflicting cultures and all too often focuses on the crisis in hand at the expense of other important work; the second is its lack of transparency and accountability; the third is its inadequate IT systems; and the fourth is the policy and legal framework within which it has to operate. … The agency is often caught up in a vicious cycle of complex law and poor enforcement of its own policies, …UKBA has been a troubled organisation for so many years. ..it will take many years to clear the backlogs and fix the system ... &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“…human rights claim” means a claim made by a person to the Secretary of State at a place designated by the Secretary of State that to remove the person from or require him to leave the United Kingdom would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) (public authority not to act contrary to Convention) as being incompatible with his Convention rights."&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“The fact is that, especially but not only where credibility is in issue, the pursuit of an appeal from outside the United Kingdom has a degree of unreality about it. Such appeals have been known to succeed, but in the rarest of cases. The reason why the Home Office is insistent on removal pending The reason why the Home Office is insistent on removal pending appeal wherever the law permits it is that in the great majority of cases it is the end of the appeal.&#xa0;“78. In its Annual Report of 2001/02, the Council on Tribunals stated that the introduction of non-suspensive appeals was "capable of leading to unfairness and injustice". The Council highlighted some of the "considerable practical problems" that may result: &#xa0;"The requirement to conduct appeals from abroad will make it more difficult for adjudicators to assess the evidence of appellants. It will also make it more difficult for appellants to have face-to-face discussions with their advisers and to present their cases satisfactorily. Costs will inevitably be greater. And there could be serious problems with regard to the status and safety of tribunal users in the countries form which they are appealing."[70] […]79. Mr Justice Richards has also described non-suspensive (out-of-country) appeals as "plainly a very serious disadvantage as compared with an in-country appeal."[71] As many asylum appeals turn on questions of credibility, it is particularly disadvantageous for the applicant to be absent from the oral hearing. …&#xa0;Success rate&#xa0;80. In its memorandum to this inquiry, the DCA stated: "As of 17 April 2003, provisional IAA figures show that 56 out-of-country appeals had been lodged with the IAA. 42 of those have so far been dismissed and one withdrawn. None has been successful."[73] &#xa0;81. We recommend that the Government investigate the fairness of the non-suspensive appeal system, given the extremely low success rate of appellants' appeals under that system. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The question is whether the Secretary of State was entitled to conclude that "there is in general [in Jamaica] no serious risk of persecution of persons entitled to reside" there. Bearing in mind the proportion of the population affected, the fact that the entirety of that sector of the populace is at risk, and the failure of the state to offer sufficient protection, even making full allowance for the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the Secretary of State, I do not consider that she was. […]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“(2)A State to which this Part applies shall be treated, in so far as relevant to the question mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as a place—.(a)where a person’s life and liberty are not threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion,.(b)from which a person will not be sent to another State in contravention of his Convention rights, and.(c)from which a person will not be sent to another State otherwise than in accordance with the Refugee Convention.&#xa0;..,for the purposes of the determination by any person, tribunal or court whether a person who has made an asylum claim or a human rights claim may be removed—.(a)from the United Kingdom, and.(b)to a State of which he is not a national or citizen.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.      European Union law precludes the application of a conclusive presumption that the Member State which Article 3(1) of Regulation No 343/2003 indicates as responsible observes the fundamental rights of the European Union. &#xa0;Article 4 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that the Member States, including the national courts, may not transfer an asylum seeker to the ‘Member State responsible’ within the meaning of Regulation No 343/2003 where they cannot be unaware that systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum seekers in that Member State amount to substantial grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of that provision.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“(a) make provisions enabling proceedings before the Commission to take place without the appellant being given full particulars of the reasons for the decision which is the subject of the appeal,(b) make provision enabling the Commission to hold proceedings in the absence of any person, including the appellant and any legal representative appointed by him,(c) make provision about the functions in proceedings before the Commission of [a special advocate], and(d) make provision enabling the Commission to give the appellant a summary of any evidence taken in his absence.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;After listening to the evidence of the Special Advocates, we found it hard not to reach for well-worn descriptions of it as 'Kafkaesque' or like the Star Chamber. The Special Advocates agreed when it was put to them that, in the light of the concerns they had raised, 'the public should be left in absolutely no doubt that what is happening…has absolutely nothing to do with the traditions of adversarial justice as we have come to understand them in the British legal system.' Indeed, we were left with the very strong feeling that this is a process which is not just offensive to the basic principles of adversarial justice in which lawyers are steeped, but it is very much against the basic notions of fair play as the lay public would understand them.&#xa0;“It is one of the Special Advocates’ most important functions to ensure that as many as possible of the documents relied upon by the Home Secretary are disclosed to the appellant, whether in whole or in part or in gist form.”&#xa0;“We do not consider that the existence of one case in which the detainee’s appeal was allowed demonstrates, as a general proposition, that the use of Special Advocates makes it “possible... to ensure that those detained can achieve justice”. Nor should it be thought that, by continuing in our positions as Special Advocates, we are impliedly warranting the fairness of the SIAC appeal process. We continue to discharge our functions as Special Advocates because we believe that there are occasions on which we can advance the interests of the appellants by doing so. Whether we can “ensure that those detained achieve justice” is another matter. The contribution which Special Advocates can make is, in our view, limited by a number of factors – some inherent to the role and others features of the current procedural regime.”&#xa0;If the special advocate thinks there is an error of law in the closed judgment, he gets permission to say, to pass the message out to the other team to say ’ I think that you should be appealing, I can’t tell you why’. … So there is a sort of open appeal. ‘We think there is something wrong but we don’t know what it is.’ And then the court goes into closed session, so it is antithetical to every [institute] of due process and open justice.&#xa0;&#xa0;It might have been benign at the outset to use a specially cleared advocate…to be able to have access to closed material – it has been acknowledged by Strasbourg that there are legitimate security concerns. However, what is in place now is not what was envisaged then. At least then, in article 3 [of the European Convention on Human Rights] cases concerning a national security issue against the individual, if argument was about risk on return then that would be able to be played out in open court with an advocate quite properly representing their client. Since then much has changed. The reality now is that the Government’s changes are taking the real argument into a closed arena. There is no basis for or justification whatsoever for arguing about risk on return on the basis of diplomatic assurances made in closed session.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]20. In an article 8 case ... the ultimate question for the appellate immigration authority is whether the refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where the life of the family cannot reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking full account of all considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental right protected by article 8. If the answer to this question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must so decide. &#xa0;The search for a hard-edged or bright-line rule to be applied to the generality of cases is incompatible with the difficult evaluative exercise which article 8 requires.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“.. a relatively recent case in which the reiteration of the court's earlier approach to immigration cases is tempered by a much clearer acknowledgement of the importance of the best interests of a child caught up in a dilemma which is of her parents' and not of her own making”.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[STANDING AND THIRD PARTY INTERVENTIONS]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Public law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts have always been alive to the fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issues or outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for leave, the court’s only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive.&#xa0;…it would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group… or even a single public-spirited tax payer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of locus standi from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law and to get the unlawful conduct stopped.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Individual concern]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Intervention]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;...I can think of at least two cases in which interveners who had made written submissions in fact turned up at the hearing. In one case they filed helpful additional written submissions as a result of listening to the debate: this was the Coram Children’s Legal Centre in H(H) v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa [2012] UKSC 25, [2013] 1 AC 338 (the case about the interests of children whose parents face extradition). In another they made brief additional oral submissions: this was only last week in Preddy v Bull (the case about Christian hotel keepers who refused to let double-bedded rooms to unmarried couples).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[COSTS]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Costs on permission at risk subject to discretionary awards]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“[T]he proposal would deny payment in a case with real merit but that just failed to get permission. … The proposal carries the danger that it will act as a barrier to access to justice as lawyers and other advice providers will err on the side of caution where the appeal is ambitious but not one with little or no merit – perhaps only bringing cases with a predicted 70/30 or more prospect of success, when the proposal intends to remove funding only where the case fails at 51/49 or less.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[…]]]especially in the early stages, the defendant is likely to have more information to enable it to assess the merits of a claim. Indeed, most of us have had experience of being instructed to defend government decisions despite advising that the prospects of doing so are considerably below 50%. Sometimes we will have been proven wrong. No one has ever suggested that, in such cases, government bodies should be barred from defending a claim for judicial review. To take such an approach would quickly make the work of government impossible. Government lawyers do not undertake their work on the basis that they will only be paid if they have accurately predicted the outcome of the litigation. To require this of those acting on legal aid is, in effect, to severely cut their rates.&#xa0;Since the majority of successful claims are conceded pre-permission, to use permission as the test for whether payment is made may well reduce real rates even further. We are also concerned that the proposal will be counter-productive; there will be many more disputes about pre-permission costs, which will require substantial public money to resolve.  &#xa0;The superficially attractive reason is that it will inhibit the making of long-shot or speculative claims at public expense, but it is supported by no evidence, and the argument advanced in support of it – that the claimant’s lawyer ‘is in the best position to know the strength of their client’s case’ – displays a depressing degree of ignorance about how judicial review works. More often than not, it is the defendant authority which holds most of the relevant cards, and in many cases it holds on to them for longer than it is supposed to, either because there is too little time for proper disclosure of documents or because sitting tight affords the best hope that the claim will go away. The departmental calculation is that indigent claimants’ lawyers will be deterred from taking on all but sure-fire claims. In proposing that other claimants can be left to their own devices without injustice, the paper makes no attempt to confront the consequences: a plethora of claims made by litigants in person, clogging up the courts as judges try to discern arguable points in the chaos of paper, and costing public authorities large sums in irrecoverable costs as they attempt to respond to such claims. &#xa0;[I]t is vital for the Ministry to appreciate that any changes which are made to reduce legal aid and cut the cost of litigation are likely to have a knock-on effect on the cost of the courts. Less legal aid means more unrepresented litigants and worse lawyers, which will lead to longer hearings and more judge-time.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The requirement that a claim can only be funded where it meets a merits test already imposes a significant discipline on claimant lawyers which is not, at least in any formal sense, imposed on defendants to judicial review. The figures quoted at paragraphs 3.65-8 of the Consultation Paper do not suggest that legal aid is being granted in significant numbers of unmeritorious cases, and that is not our experience as Treasury Counsel defending such claims. ….&#xa0;&#xa0;“I agree with my noble friend that no area is more complex than the whole business of the Immigration Rules and the procedures surrounding them.”&#xa0;Once again, I was concerned to find that the Agency had a backlog of cases amounting to 14,000 requests from applicants to re-consider decisions to refuse them further leave to remain. This had been growing by approximately 700 cases a month. In addition, there were a further 2,100 cases where people were awaiting an initial decision on their application for further leave to remain. Some dated back nearly a decade. This is completely unacceptable…&#xa0;5.50 … the Agency had, as part of its reasoning, stated that the applicant could return to their country and apply for entry clearance and therefore any interference would be proportionate. … Given the House of Lords’ judgment, which envisaged that it would be relatively rare for such a requirement to be proportionate, we were concerned to find that the Agency had felt it appropriate to adopt this approach in 20% of the relevant cases in our sample, particularly as two of these cases involved a child.  &#xa0;8.12 Data provided by the Agency showed that between April 2011 and March 2012, the majority of people whose application had been refused appealed against this decision. According to data from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service, over 50% of applicants who appealed against the refusal of their application were successful…&#xa0;8.13. … The Agency needs to improve the quality of its initial decision-making, to avoid the cost of unnecessary legal challenges and to reduce the proportion of allowed appeals where its refusal decisions are challenged. Better initial decisions would also remove the uncertainty and associated stress placed on applicants and their families while an ultimately successful legal challenge is on-going. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;…the consultation paper has nothing to say about public authorities which play the judicial review system at public expense. Most defendant authorities whose lawyers tell them they are in trouble will settle a claim; but others, given the same advice, will take a chance on opposing the grant of permission to proceed, in the hope that a judge will take their side. It would be straightforward to propose that a public body which unjustifiably resists the grant of permission in a viable case should pay the costs of doing so; but the consultation paper has nothing to say about this, or about penalising late disclosure, or about other ways of saving public funds.&#xa0;

[[[Wasted costs]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Protective costs orders]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]As a general rule, organisations which intervene in the public interest should neither have to pay the other parties’ costs or be paid their own, unless they have effectively been operating as a principal party (rule 46): if they behave properly, the principle that costs follow the event should not apply to them. But of course there will be some additional costs caused by the parties having at least to read and think about what the interveners have to say, so responsible moderation is called for.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[PROCEDURAL AS OPPOSED TO SUBSTANTIVE DEFECTS]]]

[[[ IN DECISIONS]]] &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;[i]n considering whether the complainant’s representatives would have made any difference to the outcome the court may unconsciously stray from its proper province of reviewing the propriety of the decision-making process into the forbidden territory of evaluating the substantial merits of a decision.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;As everybody who has had anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is strewn with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered; of inexplicable conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change. &#xa0;It is…absolutely basic to our system that justice must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done. If justice was so clearly no seen to be done, as on the afternoon in question here, it seems to me to be no answer to the applicant to say: ‘Well, even if the case had been properly conducted, the result would have been the same.’ This is mixing up the doing of justice with seeing that justice is done.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[THE PUBLIC SECTOR EQUALITY DUTY]]] &#xa0;[T]he court [has] the constitutional role and duty of ensuring that the rights of citizens are not abused by the unlawful exercise of executive power” - it “must not shrink from its fundamental duty to ‘do right to all manner of people.We consider that the proposals in the Consultation Paper will undermine the accountability of public bodies to the detriment of society as a whole and the vulnerable in particular.&#xa0;&#xa0;Although the number of Judicial Reviews (JRs) brought under the PSED is low, it is still a significant proportion of the overall number of JRs and there have been several high profile cases. In all the cases we have seen, the PSED is just one of a number of grounds, which suggests that these JRs would have arisen even in the absence of a PSED... &#xa0;&#xa0;The regulatory bodies and inspectors also felt that some sectors cut corners as they were unlikely to be challenged. While fear of Judicial Review was thought to encourage compliance (or displays of compliance) in some areas, this was not thought to be the case in most sectors, as Judicial Reviews are rarely brought. It was thought this was possibly down to a lack of knowledge among citizens of the legal options available to them.&#xa0;Lawyers had found that threat of litigation alone could have a powerful effect in ensuring equality issues were effectively addressed by decision makers, negating the need for legal action.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[LEAPFROGGING ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[CONCLUSION]]]&#xa0;4.16 …These proceedings… represent a crucial way of ensuring that state power is exercised responsibly.&#xa0;4.97 In our view, proceedings where the litigant seeks to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because they are the means by which citizens can seek to ensure that state power is exercised responsibly. In addition, the issues at stake themselves in public law challenges can be of very high importance where they are used to address serious concerns about the decisions of public authorities. For example, a decision by a public authority to detain someone without sufficient reason would be a very important issue as the case concerns the litigant’s liberty. …&#xa0;4.98 In general, we do not consider that the class of individuals bringing these proceedings is likely to be particularly vulnerable, although they may be where the judicial review concerns mental health or community care. However, where alternative forms of dispute resolution, such as complaints procedures or referral to an ombudsman, have not succeeded we do not consider that there are further appropriate alternative forms of advice or assistance to justify the withdrawal of legal aid. 4.99 We therefore consider that legal aid for most public law challenges is justified on the basis that they enable individual citizens to check the exercise of executive power by appeal to the judiciary, often on issues of the highest importance, and we propose that it be retained….&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
