"              \n              \n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from NHS Confederation (UEC0004)&#xa0;Executive summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. How the NHS is tackling winter pressures this year&#xa0;1.1\n F\nigures published in \nNHS England's winter health check\n&#xa0;\nsh\now that the percentage of patients spending under\n&#xa0;\nfour hours in A&amp;E \nslightly \nimproved over the Christmas period \ncompared to\n previous years.\n \nPerformance was 95.5 per cent\n&#xa0;\nin week ending 22 December and 96.4 per cent\n&#xa0;\nin week ending 29 December, both weeks hi\ngher than 2012. Attendances at A&amp;E have fallen, particularly in week ending 29 December, where attendances were lower than expected.\n \nThis is testament to effective planning \nat a local level \nand hardworking NHS staff. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nHowever, figures also show that t\nhe A&amp;E target was narrowly missed in the week ending 5 January 2014. 94.29%\n of patients\n were seen in 4 hours or less, with 5,105 patients subject to waits of between 4 and 12 hours, the highest number since April\n 2013\n. While performance\n on the target\n is up\n on the same week \nin 2013\n \n(\nwhere the proportion was 93.04%\n)\n,\n the fact the target was missed continues to demonstrate the significant pressures felt in urgent and emergency care\n,\n which are in turn symptomatic of pressures \nexperien\nced across all parts of the NHS. \nThe 4 hour target also needs to be viewed in context -\n so far \nthe weather this winter \nhas been relatively mild.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nOur report \nEmergency care: an accident waiting to happen? \npublished in September 2013 set out the \nfindings of a survey we conducted with our members\n. This report found considerable concern amongst our members about the forthcoming winter, with only 45.7 per cent of respondents saying they were likely to hit the 95% four hour target throughout the wint\ner. \n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nAs part of responding to this inquiry, we have spoken with some of our members to get a \"snap shot\" of the situation \nin the health service \nover the last few weeks. \nAnecdotally\n,\n \nthe overall sense is \nof\n winter so far being \"\nchallenging but manageab\nle\"\n (Chief Executive, Community Health services provider). \nIt can be\n difficult to establish a common pattern, because experience\ns\n vary across the country and\n,\n sometimes\n,\n within the same trust\n: \n\"The number of patients attending medical wards is roughly the\n same [if compared with last year]\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nHowever, there is noticeable variation between week and week-end days, and variation between each week-end, up to 30%\" \n(Clinical Director, Acute NHS FT)\n&#xa0;\nSome providers are finding the period very difficult. One communi\nty provider told us:\n\"Our local a\ncute (providers)\n have come under intense pressure in the post-Christmas period.\n&#xa0;\n In part this is because community and social care services are still not available and responsive at scale 24/7 and the default to A&amp;E is stil\nl sometimes the only option\".\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nSome members have\n also\n raised concerns with us about demoralised staff. One\n acute provider \nstated\n:\n \n\"Front line staff are tired and demoralised – they do not see improvement or change and this is now urgently required\".\n&#xa0;\n1.\n4 \nMany of the issues which we, the Committee and other\ns\n highlighted last year have remained \nproblematic\n. These include difficulties with recruiting and retaining emergency medicine clinicians, \nlack of seven day workin\ng\n, handover delays\n and \nthe need for \ngreater clinical\n input in\n 111 services in some parts of the country\n. \nSome among our \na\nmbulance \ns\nervice providers highlighted that:\n\"\na\nmbulance \ns\nervices are generally coping, and providing safe services for patients. (...)The handover delays have been slightl\ny less than last year, but we have been fortunate to have a \n&#xa0;\nmild winter to date which has not realised some of the activity we may have expected at this point in the season. NHS 111 may have also had a greater benefit on the wider health economy, had it b\neen implemented fully in all areas to the original timescale, and been embedded fully before winter arrived, with the appropriate advertising undertaken\n\"\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nT\nhe NHS has been proactive in tackling these pressures - we know of a considerable amount of inno\nvative work which is being done by our members to resp\nond to these concerns. These include\n a different use of staff roles to support patient flow, such as Patient Flow Support Officers, d\neployed in some hospitals from \nmidday\n until 10pm\n \non days w\nh\nere higher influx is registered; the use of rapid assessment and treatment teams, bringing together health and social care professionals; and \ngreater support for\n clinical staff decision making, for example through training and deploying Paramedic Practitio\nners to divert pressures from \nemergency departments, \nsupport managing patient flow and mitigate delays in handovers. \nProfessionals are also being\n used to improve links between sectors, such as mental health liaison psychiatrists. \n1.6 \nMany of our members tell us that good planning and better joint working \nat a local level \nhas helped ensure the NHS is coping with winter pressures more\n effectively than\n in past years. One comm\nunity provider we spoke to said:\n\"Winter thus far feels less fra\nught than last year. Locally we think this is because of a number of factors but importantly includes us seeing the benefit of work implemented earlier in the year to help with winter.\"\n&#xa0;\nJoint working across different sectors, in response to urgent and eme\nrgency care pressures, seems to have improved. Some \namong the \nacute and community health \nproviders which we consulted mentioned increased multi-disciplinary planning and service\n delivery as having a \npositive impact on reducing urgent and emergency care pre\nssures\n: \n\"Better collaborative working has created more capacity outside of hospital, so we have achieved more timely discharge, which has helped enormously\".\n(Chief Operating Officer, Acute Trust)\n&#xa0;\n\"The whole economy began planning for winter in June of \nlast year and agreed a number of additional schemes that would be implemented. (...)The system is working in a much more integrated and collaborative way at ground level than ever before demonstrating benefits to the whole system and increasing staff moral\ne as they are jointly achieving, and partnerships are being cemented\"\n(Chief Executive, Community Health Trust)\n1.7 \nHowever, our members \ncontinue to\n express\n serious concern\ns about lack of capacity, par\nticularly in terms of staffing. \nMany \nexpressed the view\n that urgent and emergency care is on a knife edge. \nWhile the situation feels under control at the moment, there is anxiety about the consequences of a sudden change in the weather, given how mild winter has been so far. A cold spell could lead to greatly \nincreased pressure on our members when there\n is little slack in the system:\n&#xa0;\n\"\nIt is important to remember that (acute trusts) do not have an army of clinical staff waiting to be called in for action, or additional bed capacity to be spared for moments of c\nrisis. The fundamental change (needs to be in) the way in which resources are used. Improving patient flow, especially at week-ends, will allow for efficiency gains, which in turn will create additional capacity, allowing the system to 'flex' when experien\ncing spikes in demand\"\n \n(Medical Director, acute FT)\n&#xa0;\n1.8 \nAs part of effective joint planning, t\nhere is an opportunity to work better with the independent sector. Where the NHS does not have enough capacity and the independent sector is able to help alleviate this pressure, it would seem like a good option to involve independent providers. As NHS Eng\nland begins planning for winter pressures for next year the NHS Confederation's NHS Partners Network, which represents independent sector providers, will look to work with NHS England to ensure there is better engagement with the sector in urgent and emerg\nency long term planning. \n&#xa0;\n1.9\n \nOur urgent and emergency care forum will be publishing a report later this year highlighting in more detail some of the \ninnovative work being done\n. \nThe release of winter money has been welcomed by our members\n. \nIn some areas \ni\nt \nhas helped fund innovations including better use of telemedicine to tackle pressures. \nOne community provider, for example, has funded \n\"a virtual ward\" where medically stable patients were discharged from hospital earlier and have access to the ongoing ca\nre they need within the comfort of their own homes\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.10\n \nAmbulance Services have also received \nan additional \n£14 million \nfunding, allocated in December 2013, which was very welcome. Predominantly, this is now \n\"being used to increase staffing on the front\n line to place more \ne\nmergency \na\nmbulances on the road to respond to patients and maintain a safe, efficient and effective service. \n&#xa0;\nHospital \nA\nmbulance Liaison Officers have also been increased to manage effective and smooth handovers at \ne\nmergency \ndepartments\"\n (Chief Executives and Senior Operation Managers, several A\nmbulance Service provider Trusts and FT)\n&#xa0;\n1.11\n \nHowever, our members are \nstill \nconcerned about the relatively late rel\nease of winter pressure funding. This \nmakes planning and st\naff recruitment very difficult, and \n\"it would be beneficial to have (such) funding sooner so that recruitment into the additional capacity could commence at an earlier date\" (Community Health Service provider)\n. \nWe argue in our report, \nEmergency care: an ac\ncident waiting to happen? \nthat local commissioners should be given a clear steer on funding \nwhich will be available \nat the start of the financial allocation cycle so the local NHS can develop \nlong term \nplans on how best to use this money\n and \nprepare\n for peak periods of demand, \nsuch as\n difficult winters. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.12\n \nWhat all of our conversations with members tell us is that an approach which takes into account all parts of the health service is essential in tackling this. \nIn particular, shifting resources\n into community\n based \nservices\n, while ensuring sustainable provision of care for those patients who require treatment in acute and emergency settings, remains paramount:\n&#xa0;\n\"Unlike previous years where very little investment has been made in community servic\nes over the winter period, \n&#xa0;\nthis year a third of the winter monies were spent directly on schemes within community health with further investment in additional social care capacity, which I believe has made a significant impact on the ability of the system\n to flex and deliver\"\n(Chief Executive, Community Health Service provider)\n&#xa0;\nWith many future challenges facing the NHS, we must continue to examine how best we can deliver healthcare to communities, ensuring that A&amp;E is only for those requiring urgent medi\ncal attention.\n&#xa0;2. Responding to the Keogh review on urgent and emergency care2.1 \nSticking plaster solutions for emergency care \nare\n not a \nsufficient\n \nresponse\n to the long-term problems the system faces.\n \nAs outlined above\n the winter pressure money recently allocated by the Government is welcome as it will help ease pressures in the short term\n. However,\n on its own it will \nnot \nbe \nenough\n.\n \n2.2 \nWe need to radically change the way we provide care to address pressures on urgent \nand emergency services and improve patient care. As we set out in our\n Emergency care: an accident waiting to happe\nn\n?\n \nreport, \nand our previous submission to the Committee\n,\n this means more emphasis on prevention and more investment in pri\nmary, community and\n social care, an approach that n\needs to be supported by \ngetting the right \nincentives in \nplace across \nthe system. Reshaping the urgent and emergency care system will \ninvolve fostering\n new ways of working, for example \nbuilding on the greater role being playe\nd by ambulance trusts in helping to reduce demand for care. \n  \n2.3 \nWe are \ntherefore \nvery positive about \nBruce Keogh's review\n,\n as it reflects what our members have been telling us and delivers a vision for sustainable emergency care of the future. \nThe \nissues around urgent and emergency care are complicated and the\nre are no easy answers. However,\n the Keogh review helps to move\n the debate \nconcerning\n urgent and emergency care \naway \nfrom a focus on\n crisis\n,\n to\nward\ns\n a serious conversation about potential\n \nlong\n-\nterm, sustainable \nsolution\ns\n to the extraordinary pressures our members face\n.\n2.4 \nThe r\neview's narrative is \nalso \nvery much in tune with our own \n2015 Challenge\n campaign\n, which calls on all political parties to create the space for change in the NHS so that patients can receive the care they need at the right time and in the right place. We welcome Sir Bruce's recognition that not all \nemergency departments\n are the same an\nd that the status quo is not sustainable. We believe there is a vital role for politicians in helping communicate this to the public\n, as part of a broader conversation about the future of the health service\n. \n2.5 \nThere are some areas where the NHS is worki\nng \nclosely with \nlocal partners \nto\n put in place effective solutions \nto tackle pressures. \nI\nt is important to note that\n certain solutions work well in some areas but not in others. For example, centralised models, such\n as\n \nthe \nreview's \nmajor emergency centres\n,\n \nmodelled on major trauma units, \nmay \nwork well in urban settings but \nbe\n difficult to implement in rural areas\n and could destabilise existing arrangements that benefit patient care\n.  \nNHS England\n must \ntherefore \nensure \nthe implementation of the review allows \nlocal flexibility\n, takes into account the interactions between urgent and emergency care and other sectors,\n and \ndo\nes\n not disrupt the innovative work already being done in some parts of the NH\nS. A one-size fits all approach will not be \nhelpful in ensuring l\nocal areas have solutio\nns tailored to the needs\n \nof their \ncommunity\n. \n2.6 \nA key problem for urgent and emergency care is the complicated\n,\n and in some places\n,\n fragmented system\n we currently have\n. The different sectors which provide urgent and emergency care\n \nstill too frequently\n work in isolation. It is vital there is greater \ncollaboration\n between all parts of the\n system in order to join up work to improve unscheduled care for patients.\n \nOur members have emphasised the importance of local leadership \nin\n bring\ning\n together the different parts of the urgent and emergency care system\n and this could be provided by nominating a \"lead\" agency in a local area\n. \nWe would\n \nwelcome \n clarity from NHS England \non where\n it \nsee\ns\n this leadership coming from\n as part of \nthe implement\nation of\n the review\n. \n2.7 \nThe Keogh review \nlooks at\n \nthe \nrole urgent and emergency care networks can play in bringing a local system together. \nIn our view, t\nhere is potential for these networks to play a key role in bringing the local system together and pr\noviding leadership on urgent and emergency care. \nIf this is the case\n,\n  w\ne need to be clear on how they will work in practice. It will be particularly important \nto clearly set out \ntheir role\n and \nresponsibilities\n in relation to strategic direction, day to da\ny delivery, performance monitoring and accountability. \nIn addition\n,\n we will need to know if the networks \nwill have a prescribed model set out by NHS England\n or \nif \nthey\n \nwill \nbe established by local initiative and \nalso \nwhere the leadership of the networks will sit. \n2.8 \nOur understanding is that\n the networks will be different from the Urgent and Emergency Care Grou\nps \n(previously known as boards) \nwhich already exist. We need to be clear \nabout whether\n the groups and the ne\ntworks will operate as separate entities\n,\n or \nif\n one will be absorbed by the other. \nSince the main objective of the Keogh review is rightly\n a\n \nsimpler\n, \nmore \ncoordinated system, this potential duplication \nmust\n be addressed by NHS England. \n2.9 \nOur members' e\nxperience of how effective the g\nroups ha\nve\n so far \nis \nvariable. \nSome of our members tell us that they have \nbrought \nmuch needed coordination to the system. However, other members have expressed concerns, including in some places limited engagement with primary care. \nSome of our ambulance members have found it difficult\n to engage with the boards\n,\n as the boards\n cover a \ncl\ninical commissioning group\n area\ns while ambulances services operate on a regional level\n. \nI\nn some places \na single \nambulance trust ha\ns\n had to engage with over 20 urgent and emergency care boards. \nNHS England must learn the lessons from these groups when imple\nmenting the recommendations of the review. \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\nAbout usThe NHS Confederation\n represents all types of organisations that commission and provide NHS services. It is the only membership body to bring together and speak on behalf of the whole of the NHS.\n \nOur \nurgent and \nemergency forum \nlooks\n  to inform and influence members, stakeholders, the media and parliament about the issues associated with responding to, and managing the rise of, unscheduled care. The forum \nbrings together a wide range of members and partners, in order to share knowledge and\n&#xa0;\ngood practice. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n  \nWinter health check\n, NHS England, January 2013\n \n \nEmergency care: an accident waiting to happen?\n \n, NHS Confederation, September 2013.
