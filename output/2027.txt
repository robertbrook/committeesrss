[[[G P Cooper – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by G P Cooper (Mr), a private individual who is a member of The Ramblers and the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA)&#xa0;1.   I wish to add my voice to that of the PDGLA and other like minded bodies in calling for deregulation of unsurfaced roads and tracks as follows:      - classifying as restricted byways all unsealed unclassified roads (UUCRs) (ie green lanes)      - downgrading all existing unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) to restricted byway         status      - providing the right of appeal against refusals by highway authorities to make Traffic        Regulation Orders excluding motor vehicles from green lanes.&#xa0;This would bring the appropriate legal framework relating to such routes into the modern era, and dispense with the anachronism that permits the abuse by off-road vehicles of what are now recreational pathways for walkers, cyclists and horse riders.&#xa0;2.  The existing classification and regulations were presumably first devised when there was NO motorised transport, with the only wheeled vehicles being carts pulled by horses. Even though these would no doubt have produced ruts in soft conditions, the intensity of their use would have been a fraction of that to which off-road cars and motorcyclists subject these increasingly fragile environments. In addition to erosion of not only the route itself but at some points a wide area to one or both sides, some of the drivers of these vehicles put other users of the routes at risk by exhibiting a total lack of concern for their safety.&#xa0;3.   Although now living in Cheshire, I spent a number of years in the 1990's living in south Oxfordshire, and enjoyed being able to go walking on the downs. However during that time there was a perceptible increase in the number of  four wheel drive vehicles driving along the Ridgeway; they rapidly turned it into an assault course for those on foot, with ruts up to eighteen inches in depth. &#xa0;4.   It is my strong belief that laws which allow those with no morality other than that of self-interest to systematically destroy the beauty of ancient routeways and effectively deny their use by those who are able to appreciate their character and sense of history, demean us as a society and I urge the committee to seize this chance to redress the imbalance.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
