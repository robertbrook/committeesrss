[[[IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists)]]]

[[[ (WRT 016)]]]&#xa0;The IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) directly influences the driving and riding of more than 135,000 UK road users every year (full members, associates and commercial clients).  &#xa0;Established in 1956, the IAM is best known for the advanced driving test and the advanced driving course.  The IAM has grown to become the UK’s largest road safety charity, dedicated to raising driving standards, engaging with the road-using public and influencing road safety policy.  IAM Drive and Survive also provides a range of occupational driver training courses to the commercial market.  In January 2007, the IAM Policy and Research division was established to undertake consultation responses, campaigning and research to assist in the understanding of road safety issues.&#xa0;Our response is laid out below in the paragraph numbers supplied.

[[[Overview]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The IAM welcomes this independent review and believes the vast majority of road users, householders and businesses would like to exercise their sense of personal responsibility when dealing with weather related issues.  The role of government, central and local, should be to allow them to make informed decisions and safely contribute to keeping the country moving. In summary our key suggestions are;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The approach to winter resilience – highways]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              What has been the experience of your authority, organisation of the winter 2009-10, and what are the lessons you have learned?  If you have conducted a formal review we would be pleased to see a copy.                            Not applicable&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2              What has been your own practice about salt stocks, and your experience of the salt supply chain?  What views do you have about the operation of the Salt Cell?  &#xa0;The IAM believes that a ‘just in time’ approach (i.e. only holding a 7 day reserve) to something as crucial as salt stocks is not appropriate.  Stock should be held to deal with extreme weather conditions even if this requires the provision of more storage facilities alongside the road network. We recognise that there is a holding cost but a full cost benefit analysis should be undertaken.&#xa0;Salt Cell should come into play earlier based on forecasting and support local planning.&#xa0;2.5              What action would you like to see taken by others – whether in relation to salt supply and use or to other matters? &#xa0;The IAM supports the provision of more local salt bins and salt supply points to allow drivers to clear their own drives and local roads.  Salt should be freely available and supplied in suitable bagged containers.  It is not acceptable that salt is made available but often must be collected in your own container.  Salt bins at key locations should be replenished on a more frequent basis during periods of heavy use.&#xa0;The health and safety legislation surrounding the clearing of paths and roads must be clarified.  Many believe that by taking responsibility for clearing snow and ice they become liable to prosecution for any resulting injuries or accidents on the area that they have cleared. This is stopping communities helping themselves. &#xa0;2.6              Should further action or powers be taken by central government or its agencies to assure salt supplies or winter resilience generally?  &#xa0;Prepare for the worst and have salt stock levels to cover this so that stocks don’t reduce to the levels they fell to last winter.  Existing powers, good planning and additional storage facilities should avoid the need for any additional powers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Weather forecasting and communications - highways]]]&#xa0;3.1              How accurate have you found the available short, medium and long term weather forecasting in predicting extreme winter weather, and how have you acted on the forecasts?                            See below&#xa0;&#xa0;3.2              How could the system be improved?   &#xa0;Weather forecasting is accurate but remains too high level to be useful in the very localised conditions found in many parts of the UK.  The general public should have free access to short term weather forecast and other ice condition information (such as ice alert temperature detectors) being used to inform gritting decision making.  The public pays for this information to be collected by public bodies and the IAM can see no reason why it should not be available in a suitably understandable graphic and standardised form on the internet.  Forecasting and road condition information must be consistent no matter what the source – police, road operators, or Met office.&#xa0;

[[[The consequences and economic impacts of severe winter weather ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1              How does severe winter weather impact on critical aspects of people’s daily travel needs, and on the mobility of goods and services?  What lessons have been learned in business, public service and other organisations about forecasting and mitigating the transport effects of severe winter weather?  How effective have winter resilience measures been, and what other measures should be taken?         &#xa0;In our view last winter’s snow and ice had little prolonged or major economic impact.  &#xa0;But, extended periods of snow and ice will almost certainly have a high cost associated with it in terms of disruption and lost productivity.  The UK grinds to a halt at the first fall of snow and that is an unacceptable outcome.&#xa0;More research is needed on the individual and societal costs of bad weather delays.  Until loss of earnings, damage to vehicles, crashes and loss of output can be fully quantified by research we will not have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits involved.&#xa0;Any analysis should include the cost of daily impact on travel, finding alternatives, if available, and the delays and disruption caused by cancellations, traffic jams etc.&#xa0;Critical functions should be prioritised such as daily care of the elderly, NHS patients, and heat and power generation. Over a prolonged period food production and distribution would assume more importance and priority. &#xa0;Organisations must include bad weather issues in their disaster recovery and Business Continuity planning.  Best practice guidelines should be prepared by leading trade associations for each sector and the Government should ensure they are widely disseminated and adopted including within the public sector.  The cascading of decisions to close offices, allow staff home or to remain at home is critical and should be tested and updated on a regular basis in a similar way to fire or evacuation drills.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.2              What major areas of economic cost and benefit arise from the transport and travel aspects of: &#xa0;              More research is needed in this area&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; being prepared for, and dealing with, severe winter weather? &#xa0;The IAM believes that keeping traffic flowing is a key economic and safety function of road authorities and budget constraints should not have a part to play in winter maintenance decisions.  British drivers already pay sufficient tax on their motoring to fund a winter maintenance operation geared up to the worst conditions.  &#xa0;Current training offerings are focused on ‘stopping’ but our experiences from the public is that the main problem is actually ‘how do we get going, how to we keep going, should we be travelling, what is the best method and how do we prepare ourselves and our vehicles’&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; failure to deal adequately with such weather?        &#xa0;The main costs of delays due to bad weather accrue to individuals, drivers and companies and more research is needed to better quantify them in relation to the expense of an up rated winter maintenance operation or proposals to fit different tyres etc.  The IAM can see no case for the compulsory fitment of snow chain as our winter maintenance procedures are not based on driving on hard packed snow.  Winter tyres can offer extra traction but the ‘hassle and cost’ of changing tyres on a seasonal basis is too high for most occasional bad weather episodes.  The tyre industry should continue to explore new rubber technology to give its all year tyres more useful winter properties.&#xa0;6.3              During the recent winter weather large parts of the country experienced icy footpaths and icy conditions on minor roads for longer periods than usual.  What were the consequences of this, in terms of traffic accidents, higher-than-expected injuries due to slips and trips?  Should the public and local communities be able to take a more pro-active role (eg in clearing public and private paths and minor roads) and what issues are raised by this?        &#xa0;The IAM has no information on injuries and the number of incidents.  &#xa0;Many local authorities actually met their published targets for snow clearance but the public as a whole have little understanding of winter maintenance priorities and often felt helpless and abandoned.   &#xa0;Councils must be more explicit on how long they will take to clear side roads and footpaths and what the priorities are and the ‘order’ of clearance.  &#xa0;Poor footpath clearance can lead to pedestrian injuries, isolation and less inclination to attempt journeys which may actually be possible if main roads are accessible.  &#xa0;A new approach which encourages more personal responsibility for footpath cleaning by local residents/shopkeepers/businesses, combined with a higher priority for local salt bins and a clearer timetable of footpath clearance would be the most effective way forward.  Urban myths regarding the law on personal liability due to snow clearing should be addressed as a matter of priority and local guidelines agreed and communicated to house holders and businesses.&#xa0;&#xa0;6.4              What can we learn from the experience of and approach taken by other nations who have similar weather to the UK, in terms of planning and managing winter resilience?                   &#xa0;The UK climate is relatively unique.  &#xa0;The latest developments in Ice alert, snow clearing equipment and chemicals should be monitored but the IAM is unaware of any new thinking in winter maintenance policy as a whole that would revolutionise our approach.  In our view the most important area for technological advances would be techniques that do not require the passage of traffic to ‘work in’ salt and the ability to clear roads and deal with large numbers of stranded motorists at the same time.&#xa0;Road user behaviour in Scandinavia does suggest that additional training in dealing with ice and snow can lead to over confidence and a rise in serious collisions. &#xa0;Quick, reliable and personalised/localised information in an often fast changing weather situation is the key.  Access to more CCTV cameras off the trunk road network would help to give real time information on what is actually happening at key pints on the network.&#xa0;As a member of the FIA, the ability to survey motoring clubs across Europe we would be happy to do this as part of the winter resilience review.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Communications and public expectations]]]&#xa0;7.1              What can the public reasonably expect in terms of the winter resilience of roads and transport services, and communication about this in severe weather?    &#xa0;The public must be allowed to exercise a higher degree of personal responsibility and be encouraged to play a more positive part in the safe use of roads in the winter.  Information is the key and it is not yet tailored to the individual needs of drivers.  Blanket warnings about ‘essential’ journeys are of little value without a full definition of ‘essential’.  Highways authorities should actively encourage feedback from drivers on local trouble spots and micro climatic conditions.  The government should zero rate or exempt from VAT products directly linked to snow and ice clearance such as rock salt.&#xa0;&#xa0;7.2              Are there ways of enabling the public to be better prepared for future severe winters?       &#xa0;The IAM does not believe that compulsory training in snow and ice driving is feasible, deliverable or would actually reduce delays or crashes.  Current training is geared to controlling skids or stopping safely as opposed to how to start on slippery roads, maintain momentum up hills or how to make informed decisions about which conditions make travel impossible.  However, practical tips on how to cope with snow and ice can be useful and the IAM is well positioned and willing to deliver such advice through the media.&#xa0;&#xa0;The IAM supports the idea of an informal ‘contract’ between drivers and authorities to clarify each role and agree who should do what, by when and for whom.&#xa0;&#xa0;For example;&#xa0;

[[[Highway Authorities ]]]would agree to;&#xa0;Drivers make no distinction between road operators and one operator (e.g. the Highways Agency) suggesting roads are open when local routes are still poor is a recipe for confusion and unnecessary trips.&#xa0;&#xa0;Roads will remain choked with traffic attempting to make what they see as their own ‘essential’ journey until drivers have access to comprehensive real time travel information, know what their employers policy is on staying away from work and can have ‘trust’ that the authorities are doing their utmost to keep roads and pavements clear.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Long term weather trends]]]8.1              Recognising the uncertainties and probabilistic nature of weather forecasting, what further information or assessment is available about the likely trends in UK winters – their nature, duration and severity - over the next 10-15 years.  And how might these most effectively be communicated to those who may need to act on them?&#xa0;Most climate commentators predict an increase in extreme and unpredictable weather events over the coming decades.  The IAM would welcome a wider debate on extreme weather provision and the policy relating to it.&#xa0;October 2013  &#xa0;
