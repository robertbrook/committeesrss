defaultThe widespread use of antibiotics over the last 60 years has improved the treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial infections, saving millions of lives and alleviating much human misery. However, increased use of antibiotics and other agents that co-select for antibiotic resistance (AR) (e.g. biocides, heavy metals, environmental pollutants) has eroded the efficacy of many antibiotic classes to a point where many drugs have been compromised and multi-resistant pathogens are common. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current dogma is that increased AR has primarily resulted from greater antibiotic use in medicine and agriculture, which has progressively selected more AR strains. However, this perception is very naive and does not account for broader environmental influences that  are accelerating and exacerbating AR dissemination. Data are growing that shows AR proliferation is being significantly fueled by inadequate waste management and inconsistent sanitation around the world. These data show that local mismanagement of wastes is causing the environmental resistome to change (i.e., the global genetic capacity of the environment to contribute to resistance in any microorganism, including pathogens), which has increased the potential for AR genes to be transmitted from “nature” to 
defaultorganisms of medical and agricultural importance.

defaultHow has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?

defaultOur research implies four primary causes are apparent:

default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?
default&#xa0;
defaultOur major gap in knowledge is not what we know, but who knows it. Almost all documents on increasing AR have been prepared by experts from the medical and agricultural communities. This has resulted in almost no recognition of the role of the broader environment in AR proliferation. “Environment” is often mentioned in documents and statements, but nothing is said that shows an understanding of environmental causes or how reducing AR proliferation can be aided through environmental solutions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, environmental experts on AR must be included in decisions, especially experts in technologies that are available to reduce AR pollution on larger scales (via improved waste management). Knowledge linking environmental cause and effects is urgently needed, but most importantly, those data must be included in the discussion about AR proliferation. AR will continue to increase unless both medical/agricultural 
defaultand
default environmental considerations are included in the solution. Doing one without the other will be a waste of time and money.

defaultIs there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?
default&#xa0;
defaultSee above. The answer is no, but it is not necessarily the fault of the companies. An economic incentive is needed to develop new drugs and without solving the gross sanitation problems in developing and emerging countries, drug development will never occur. Even if it does, those new drugs will fail. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe key behaviour change is among decision makers, although reducing self-prescription in some key countries would be very helpful. Pathogens acquire resistance based on exposure. If the resistome has increased, the probability of acquired also increases. Therefore, increased awareness among the medical/agricultural community is needed to include water quality and improved sanitation in hot spot locations to reduce AR around the world. Within the locations, greater information/education is needed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. However, both reduced antibiotic use 
defaultand
default improved sanitation are essential to solve the global AR problem.   
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?
default&#xa0;
defaultMuch greater investment is needed in helping improve sanitation and water quality in the emerging and developing world. This has intrinsic and altruistic value in itself, but our data imply the majority of serious multi-resistance develops in such locations. Therefore, by assisting in solving such problems, we also are serving the UK medical/agricultural  community by reducing the probability of multi-resistance migrating to the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso, the inclusion of environmental engineers in “the solution” to increasing AR is essential. My group works in India, China and locations in Latin America, and our experience is that local AR problems are largely related to poor waste management and water quality coupled with some sort of inappropriate social behaviour. Therefore, “informed” engineers that solve water quality problems, especially those who understand the microbiology of acquired resistance in pathogens, must be included in the solution. They can bridge technical methods for improving water quality with other required actions, such as improved control of antibiotic use in such locations.

defaultWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe fact that an AR strategy has been developed is excellent. However, the current strategy is weak on the role of environmental drivers of AR proliferation. Environment is mentioned, but the comments are too general and no solutions are provided. Further, although international and cross-boundary influences are recognised in the strategy, water quality and poor waste management around the world is not. People forget that humans are almost 80% water. Everyone 
defaultmust
default have water, therefore excluding water quality and waste management is a huge flaw in the strategy. This problem is not unique to the UK, but the UK can become a standard bearer for inclusion of water in their strategy and I would be happy to assist.
