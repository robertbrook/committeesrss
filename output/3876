defaultThese submissions deal with government proposals to overturn carefully thought out rules and approaches developed over decades by the independent judiciary and to restrict civil society organisations from using the law effectively to protect those who are 
defaultunable to protect themselves

defaultThe 
defaultproposed 
defaultchanges to
default funding and standing for
default judicial review will be a disaster for
default penal reform, civil society and
default the safety and rights of 
defaultthose in contact with the law whether as defendants or victims, including c
defaulthildren
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFounded in 1866, the Howard League for Penal Reform is the oldest penal reform charity in the world. The Howard League has 
defaultsome 
default7,000 members, including prisoners and their families, lawyers, criminal
default justice professionals and academics. The Howard League has consultative status with both the United Nations and the Council of Europe. It is an independent charity and accepts no grant funding from the UK government. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Howard League campaigns for less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. We achieve these objectives through conducting and commissioning research 
defaultand investigations aimed at revealing underlying problems and discovering new solutions to issues of public concern. The Howard League’s objectives and principles underlie and inform the charity’s parliamentary work, research, legal and participation work 
defaultas well as its projects.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2002 the Howard League has provided the only legal service dedicated to representing children in custody. We also provide a dedicated legal service for young adults in prison (under 21
default years of age
default) and, where appropriate, 
defaultcomment on the particular considerations that are required to ensure that this age group is dealt with fairly and appropriately.

default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultThis submission illustrates the grave consequences of the proposal by providing an in depth analysis of the impact of a
default judicial review brought by the Howard League for Penal Reform in 2002, 
defaultThe Queen (on the 
defaultApplication of the Howard League) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Department of Health
default [2003] 1 FLR 484
default [‘The 
defaultChildren Act
default case’]
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe proposed restriction on standing would have prevented the Howard League for Penal reform 
defaultfrom b
defaultringing this case.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultAs 
defaultset out below
default, there is considerable evidence that the impact of this case was wide-ranging and important. 
defaultWhere there is a genuine public interest, it can only be right and proper 
defaultin
default a civil
default society that
default organisations have the o
defaultpportunity to bring these pivotal cases to court. The judiciary must be allowed to exercise their constitutional function to provide 
defaultjudicial scrutiny of important issues brought to the
defaultir att
defaultention by organisations as well as individuals.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe issues in t
defaulthe 
defaultChildren Act 
defaultcase
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultIn this case, the Howard League for Penal reformdefault challenge
defaultd
default the legality of the Secretary of State's policy guidance on the treatment of children
default under 18 years of age held in Young Offender I
defaultnstitutions. The Secretary of State 
defaulthad asserted in Prison Service Order No 4950
default, which governed the regime for children detained in Young Offenders’ Institutions,
default that the
default Children Act 1989 
defaultdid not apply in respect of such children. 
defaultWe argued that 
defaultpolicy guidance was wrong in law. The main 
defaultissues for determination were the extent to which the 1989 Act applied to children in 
defaultY
defaultoung 
defaultO
defaultffender
defaults’
default 
defaultI
defaultnstitutions, the legality of the Secretary of State's treatment of juveniles in 
defaultYoung Offender I
defaultnstitutions 
defaultand whether child protection work in 
defaultY
defaultoung 
defaultO
defaultffender
defaults’
default 
defaultI
defaultnstitutions should be led by local authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultThe judicial review was successful.  The Court held 
defaultthat although the 
default1989 Act did not confer or impose any powers or obligations on the Secretary of State or the Prison Service, the duties o
defaultwed by a local authority to juveniles under s
defaultection 
default17
default (duties towards ‘children in need’)
default and s
defaultection 
default47
default (duties towards children at risk of serious harm)
default of the Act did not cease merely because a juvenile was in a young offender institution. However, a local authority's powers and duties under the Act took effect and operated subject to the necessary requirements of imprisonment.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThis meant that chi
defaultldren in prison were not offenders to be treated differently from children in the community
default,
default but children who were entitled as a matter of law to full rights under the Children Act 1989.  This meant that if they were in need and appeared to the local autho
defaultrity to require help to prevent the any further impairment to their health and development, the local authority was required to provide it under s
defaultection 
default17 of the Children Act 1989.  Similarly, if there was reason to believe a child was at risk of serious 
defaultharm, the local authority where the prison was based was required as a matter
default of law to investigate this.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4. default              defaultImpact of the case on policy, practice and children’s livesdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe judgment itself identified the specific vulnerabilities of children in prison
default (
defaultparagraph 10)
default:
default&#xa0;
default“
default[Children in custody] are, on any view, vulnerable and needy children. Disproportionately they come from chaotic backgrounds. Many have suffered abuse or neglect”. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a result of this 
defaultruling, the law changed as reflected in a raft of pol
defaulticies and 
defaultreferences
default to the case in government guidance.  For i
defaultnstance, following the case, Prison S
defaultervice 
defaultO
defaultrder 4950 was 
defaultamended so that Governors/D
defaultirectors of 
defaultYoung Offender Institutions
default 
defaultwere required to ‘have regard to the policies, agreed by the Prison Service and the 
defaultYouth Justice Board
default for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of chil
defaultdren held in custody’ (‘Working T
defaultogether
default’
default, 2006:12)
default.  As a result every single 
defaultYouth Offender Institut
defaulte
default 
defaultmust
default have a child protection protocol
default and mechanisms to ensure child protection and the welfare of children in custody
default.  
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to the Working Together guidance
default (2006) these arrangements include, amongst other things, the following measures: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn due course, social workers were introduced into 
defaultYouth Offender Institutes
default to assist in compliance with duties under the Children Act 1989.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultrelationship between 
defaultthese changes 
defaultand the 
defaultChildren Act
default case 
defaultare outlined on the Ministry of J
defaultustice’s website as follows:
default“On 29 November 2002, Mr Justice Munby judged that the Children Act (1989) should apply to children detained in young offender institutions (YOIs), that duties owed by local authorities continue to be owed to children in YOIs a
defaultnd that human rights legislation, particularly the Human Rights Act (1998), applies to children in custodial facilities.
default“
defaultThe report, 
defaultThe Application of the Children Act (1989) to Children in Young Offender Institutions
default&#xa0;
defaultexamines the application of the 
defaultChildren Act to children in custody, in light of this judgement.
default“
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultNational Children’s Bureau
default 
default(NCB) has produced a document entitled
default&#xa0;
defaultTell them not to forget about us
default a guide to practice with looked-after children in custody. Aimed primarily at children’s services authorities, this guide will also be of use and in
defaultterest to secure estate and YOT staff as it outlines roles and responsibilities for all partnership agencies.
default“
defaultThe revised
default&#xa0;
defaultWorking Together
default [guidance] provides further detail on how secure establishments and local authorities should discharge their statutory duties. Importantly, agreed procedures must be in place between secure establishments and those local a
defaultuthorities (in particular the LSCB) that have secure establishments in their area, outlining how to deal with and undertake child in need assessments and child protection allegations. LSCBs will have oversight of the safeguarding arrangements within secure
default settings in their area.
default“
defaultIn discharging these duties, local authority children’s social care services should consider seconding social workers to work in secure establishments and establish effective links with a child or young person’s home local authori
defaultty. The home local authority and YOT have continuing responsibilities to children and young people in custody.
default“
defaultThe Working Together document includes further details for secure providers on how to effectively work with young people who are looked after as
default well as arrangements for successful transitions between custodial establishments and community services.”
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt should be noted that Working Together is statutory guidance that must be followed in relation to child protection issues.
default 
defaultThese changes represented a sea change in the way in which children in prison were considered.  In 
defaulta report
default by the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Local Government Association and the Youth Justice Board,  
defaultThe Application of the Children 
defaultAct (1989) to Children in Young Offender Institutions
default (2003) at page 2 it was noted that prior to the judgment:
default“
defaultonce inside a prison, it appeared that children lost the entitlement to services under the Children Act 1989, to health provision from local he
defaultalth authorities, and to education services from local education authorities…It seemed to be a case of “out of sight, out of mind.”’

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the judgment, the case has been cited in over 20 other cases
default 
defaultand has become a key case in the interpretation of children’s rights.  This is because in passing judgment Mr Justice Munby affirmed that 
defaultin his view the rights contained in the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child and t
defaulthe European Charter 
defaultcan ‘
defaultproperly be consulted insofar as they proclaim, reaffirm or elucidate the content of those human rights that are generally recognised
default throughout the European family of nations, in particular the nature and scope of those fundamental rights that are guaranteed by the European Convention
default’ (para

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the point wh
defaulten the charity brought this claim, it did not provide legal services to young people, as it now does.  However, the charity carefully considered in liaison with expert counsel whether or not this challenge should be brought 
defaultinstead 
defaultof 
defaultby 
defaulta child affected. 
default The charity decided to bring the case as an organization in order to ensure a thorough review of the principles 
defaultin
default issue.  A claim on behalf of an individual child may or may not have arisen
default – that was not an issue that the charity had any control of.  Ho
defaultwever, it would have appeared 
defaultwrong in principle to wait for a child to be at real risk of failures by the system to protect his or her welfare and there would have been a real danger that the litigation would become focused on that individual 
default‘
defaultrisk child
default’
default rather than the systemic issues that affected all children in custody.

default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn any event the Court was in 
defaultno 
defaultdoubt as to the appropriateness of the charity bringing these important issues to its attention.  Mr Justice Munby stated:
default&#xa0;
default “
defaultThe proceedings have been brought by The Howard League for Penal Reform whose history and credentials need no introduction. It undoubtedly is, as it claims to be, the leading non-governmental organisation in this country concerned with penal issues and pol
defaulticy. Here I need only to note that in the last decade or so it has had a particular focus on children and young people in the criminal justice system. 
default“
defaultIt is not disputed by the defendant that the Howard League has a “sufficient interest” in the matter so
default as to give it locus to make the current application: 
defaultR v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex p World Development Movement Ltd 
default[1995] 1 WLR 386 and 
defaultR v Somerset County Council ex p Dixon 
default[1998] Env LR 111.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the judgment, the 
defaultHoward League for Penal Reform legal service has developed and now represents many individual children and young people in or affected by the criminal justice system every year. Where appropriate, we have represented individual children and young people in
default judicial reviews concerning issues that directly affect them, as well as raising issues of public importance.  Many of these cases have relied and built on the principles set out in the judgment. Whilst it is recognised that there will only be rare occasi
defaultons when it is appropriate and necessary for an organisation such as the Howard League for Penal Reform to bring a legal challenge in its own right, it is essential that such an approach remains an option

default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the proposed regime, the Howard 
defaultLeague for Penal Reform would have been unable to bring thi
defaults judicial review to court. Even if the 
defaultsafeguarding policies and promotion of safety across the entirety of the secure estate
default had been introduced as a matter of good practice, it would not have ha
defaultd a statutory footing.  Children
default would not be 
defaultentitled to be protected and assessed under the Children Act 1989 while in detention.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe opportunity facilitated by the Howard League for 
defaultPenal
default Reform for the Court to consider these important issues and to c
defaultlarify the law had a major impact on the development of law, policy and practice in 
defaultthis important area.  Any rules to restrict the ability of the Court to determine important issues of law raised by 
defaultorganis
defaultations such as the Howard League for Penal Reform
default should be resisted.  The Courts are best placed to determine these issues and to continue to exercise their discretion wisely and appropriately.
