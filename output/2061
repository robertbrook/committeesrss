defaultCatherine Law &amp; Bevis Hughes – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultTo defaultThedefault Joint Committee appointed to discuss the July 2013 Draft Deregulation Billdefault&#xa0;defaultspecificallydefault regarding Land Use and Public Rights of Waydefault&#xa0;
default              
default&#xa0;
defaultOur Experience/ Submission of Evidence:default&#xa0;defaultWe are users and supporters of the Public Rights of Way (
defaultPRoW
default) network and are particularly interested in the sections within the Draft Deregulation Bill related to this.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have a 
defaultPRoW
default at our family home where we live with 3 small children. We have had personal experience of being on the receiving end of 
defaultPRoW
default legislation, policy and procedure and we make our submission as evidence of this. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are the lives of the people who live under the “
defaultlines
default” on the Definitive Map that are so wantonly and recklessly marked down and amended. History books are 
defaultclear,
default it is the drawing of lines on maps that has the most serious of consequences for 
defaultpeoples
default lives and society’s wellbeing. The task of marking lines on a map should not be undertaken lightly or encouraged to be done unfairly. Unfortunately this is exactly what is happening.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current 
defaultPRoW
default system is dangerously out of control, and tighter control of the existing regulation must be undertaken. We strongly urge the Committee to heed the warnings from our evidence as we were not consulted with or represented in the drafting of the recommendations in this Draft Deregulation Bill. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBeing users and supporters of 
defaultPRoW
default we positively purchased a property with a 
defaultPublic Footpath 
defaultin 2007. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Footpath was confirmed to be recorded on the Definitive Map, and although the seller of our property also legally declared a Public Footpath in the property sales conveyance, she later fell into dispute with us and set about canvassing to change the path to a Bridleway. She filled in the first evidence forms for herself and on behalf of other people and submitted them 
defaultfor
default the application. The Authority ignored our property deeds and legal conveyance and made a legal Order to amend the Definitive Map and change the Footpath at our property to a Bridleway. This would result in bringing dangerous traffic to the garden and front door of our family home that we would be unable to avoid. We were Statutory Objectors to the Order, as were the Parish Council, along with six other longstanding local members of the community also formally objecting. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis resulted in a 
default4 day public inquiry
default with the Inspector finally concluding 
defaultnot
default to confirm the Authority’s Order and that the claimed use of the path was 
default“riding with permission”
default. The wasted public and personal costs for this is a shameful scandal.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the application entered the public domain we have faced regular anonymous horse and bike riders thundering through our property with zeal and knowledge of their wrongdoing, but with relish knowing that we cannot stop them. Often with comment to us of what 
defaultfun
default they are having - just for added provocation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn a national scale Authorities are happily condoning this trespass and anti-social behaviour as it aids the claiming of new routes by “
defaultuse
default”, providing themselves with desk jobs. The situation is quite sickening and utterly shameful. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt does not sit in British Society that we should have our public office being nourished by 
defaulttheir own
default encouragement of aggravation and discord in our otherwise peaceful and civil society.
default&#xa0;
defaultClaims for use of the path by the public have to be without secret and unchallenged, so if the owner of the land does not confront and challenge the user then this is considered to be dedication by acquiescence. 
defaultDamed
default if you do and damned if you don’t
default.
default There is no way out of the hell.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have been vilified for 
defaultfor
default our good intention of investing in a property with a 
defaultPRoW
default. 
defaultFor the 
defaultPRoW
default Network to prosper people should not be dissuaded to live amongst it, but should be supported, otherwise 
defaultPRoW
default and its surrounding landscape will be full of conflict resulting in further bureaucracy.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current 
defaultPRoW
default legislation and policy is undemocratic, and unfairly balanced against the homeowners and owners of property. Our submission is given as evidence to highlight that it does not work, and the situation will be exacerbated if the proposals set out in this Bill are implemented, and measures are not taken to correct the current failings.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would like to make a verbal contribution to the committee and hope that we are invited to do so to expand on our evidence on being at the receiving end of the current legislation regarding 
defaultPRoW
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummary of Issues and Recommendations:default&#xa0;default1]default 
defaultThe existing Public Rights of Way (PROW) system is currently confusing and extremely complicated. default&#xa0;defaultIt is a gross waste of public money which is administered to unfairly disadvantage home and property owners.
default&#xa0;
default2] defaultLegislation requires Authorities to have defaultPRoWdefault Improvement Plans which has caused policy and decisions to be weighted by Pro-access campaign groups who have infiltrated defaultLocal Access Forumsdefault and all the way up through Public Office.default default&#xa0;defaultPro-Access Campaign Groups are fervent “
defaultlobbyists
default” in favour of as many 
defaultPRoW
default as possible, and have helped draft and support the recommendations in this Bill. It has therefore presented an unbalanced view. 
default&#xa0;
default3] defaultAlarm bells should be ringing by the fact that these proposals have come fromdefault&#xa0;defaultDefradefault via thedefault&#xa0;default"Stepping Forward Report" compiled by their own funded defaultQuangodefault "Natural England".default default&#xa0;defaultWith the associated access campaigners, these are the very people who wish to preserve the workload and consequential paycheque that their departmental way of life depends on, and who are attempting to smokescreen their practices that this Bill should rightly scrutinise.
default&#xa0;
default4] defaultThe current legislation is being used by defaultPRoWdefault Access Campaigners to encourage trespass and anti-social behaviour at defaultpeoplesdefault homes and private property so as to aid a claim for a defaultPRoWdefault. default&#xa0;defaultThis obviously needs to be stopped. Landowners are expected to manually/verbally challenge users of a claimed path or be considered to have dedicated it by 
defaultacquiescing
default its use. This causes conflict and discord within communities and great stress for individuals whose homes are 
defaulteffected
default by these claims. The legislation needs to prevent this need for confrontation, and trespass should not be encouraged by the legislation.
default&#xa0;
default5] defaultThis Draft Deregulation Bill does not simplify the present PROW procedure.default&#xa0;defaultThe proposals are contrary to its title, attempting to 
defaultlegislate
default 
defaultadditional
default Regulation, which will further disadvantage owners of property against claims for 
defaultPRoW
default. 
defaulte.g
default. Reducing advertising of Orders, allowing Authorities to select which objections should be passed on to the Secretary of State, and allowing authorities to 
defaultchose
default what they consider to be 
default“administrative errors”
default to amend as they desire. These proposals are undemocratic. 
default&#xa0;
default6] defaultTo cut administration this Bill proposes to default“reduce the number of applications that are opposed”default.default&#xa0;defaultInstead, this Bill should be looking at reducing the number of applications being 
defaultmade
default and 
defaultaccepted
default, before they are objected to, thus reducing the burden on the taxpayer.
default&#xa0;
default7] defaultThe Draft Bill mixes the issues of default“Public Rights”default and default“Private Rights”default which is completely incompatible with defaultPRoWdefault legislation. default&#xa0;defaultNeighbour
default disputes are commonplace and it would be injudicious to provide legislation for public office to engage 
defaulttaxpayers
default resources on private disputes. A rush of vexatious and spurious 
defaultRoW
default applications would be sure to follow if this were allowed; and therefore objections to Orders. 
defaultClearly 
defaultthis should be discouraged and the legislation should 
defaultonly
default allow claims that can show a genuine use by the “
defaultpublic
default” - not 
defaultneighbours
default or those 
default“with an interest in the land”
default.
default&#xa0;
default8] defaultAlldefault of the “defaultEvidencedefault” relevant to a claimed defaultPRoWdefault should be included with the application at time of submission. default&#xa0;defaultApplications should not be allowed to evolve 
defaultpiecemeal
default, and they should not subject the Authority to research evidence at public expense. Ever expanding the 
defaultPRoW
default departmental workload has been their practice for many years, and now reducing it should be the central focus of this Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe application process for 
defaultPRoW
default is ridiculously 
defaultslack,
default it is far too easy to be made on a whim. Applications must be made with conviction and submission of all the relevant and “proper” evidence. And there should certainly not be any encouragement to 
default“reduce the burden on the applicant”
default as this Bill proposes.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs applications are too easy Authorities at present find themselves with a backlog of which they are unable to process. Once accepted the responsibility of investigation is at present picked up by the Authority.  This is how the 
defaultPRoW
default departments have managed to grow to near breaking point, straining under the weight of the applications they and the legislation has encouraged. Clearly this is the centre of attention for the matter of deregulation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should certainly not be the purpose of the Bill to recommend applicants take the Authority to the magistrate if there is a delay in processing an application, but this shows the disingenuous motives of its authors to 
defaultup
default their departmental workload and pay-grade. 
default&#xa0;default9] defaultMore stringent measures are needed for Applications to dissuade vexatious, frivolous and unnecessary PROW claims being submitted and accepteddefault. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne such way to do this:
default&#xa0;
default10]default 
defaultProperty legal sales conveyances should be accepted as a default“Statutory Declaration”default to show that a landowner did not default“intended to dedicate”default any defaultPRoWdefault if none is legally declared at point of sale.default&#xa0;defaultAt present this is not the case and it undermines every house purchase in the country. We along with many other people are evidence to this.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll property sales in the UK are subject to legal conveyance which passes through the two parties solicitors (seller and purchaser) and legally records the knowledge by the seller of any 
defaultPRoW
default at the property.  
default&#xa0;
defaultSection 31 Highways Act 1980 (HA1980) should include a subsection inserted in regards to dedication of a 
defaultPRoW
default to ensure legally recorded declarations made within property sales conveyance are taken into account. This would clarify that the seller 
default“had no intention during that period to dedicate it” 
defaultas stipulated 
defaults.31(
default1) HA1980, thus saving administration on countless, unjustified claims.
default&#xa0;
default11]default 
defaultLegal sales conveyance is regulation already taking place in the private sector which should be utilised to drastically reduce the need for public office administration in regards to investigating claims for defaultPRoWdefault.default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf applications continue to be allowed to be claimed on a period of 20 years crossing over different owners of the property in question, then all purchasers continue to be compromised by the prospect of being held to ransom from an untrustworthy seller who would be willing to support/instigate an application should the purchaser not meet their demands. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe situation is such that claimants for 
defaultPRoW
default are being encouraged to lie in wait for a property to be sold before they apply for it, as this will aid their application, as the onus of proof will be on the new landowner to show that there was an intention 
defaultnot
default to dedicate in a time before their knowledge. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is what has happened to us and many others, and is increasing by the day; encouraging trespass to homes, discord to communities and much wasted public administration. 
default&#xa0;
default12] defaultApplications for defaultPRoWdefault which are based on a claimed period of 20 year use under s.31 default1980HA,default should defaultnotdefault be accepted if they pass through the point of sale of the property.default&#xa0;defaultPoint of sale effectively being a 
default“prescribed event”
default or 
default“trigger event”
default which would allow sellers to declare unrecorded 
defaultPRoW
default, and encourage claimants to apply before change of 
defaultownership.
default If the claim has not been made, then the Public have effectively acquiesced to there being any: 
defaultie
default none exist.
default&#xa0;
default13]default 
defaultTown and Village Greens applications (TVGs) also follow the same principle of 20 years default“as of right use”default by the public as stipulated in s.31 HA1980 and are subject to refusal if a default“trigger event”default has occurred on the land effected by the application. default&#xa0;
defaultThe Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 (GIA2013), which received Royal Assent 25 April, made a number of significant changes to the law on registering new TVGs under the Commons Act 2006 (CA2006). Section 16 of the GIA2013 inserted new Section 15C and Schedule 1A into the CA2006 which took effect 25 April 2013 and excludes applications for TVGs on land where a prescribed event or 
default“trigger event”
default has occurred in relation to the land 
defaultie
default a planning application.
default&#xa0;
defaultA similar approach needs to be taken and amendments to the legislation made so as to stem the epidemic of 
defaultPRoW
default applications that are being made across the country on 
defaultpeoples
default homes and peaceful private property.
default&#xa0;
defaultDue to the increasing number of TVG applications and the significant costs impacted on Authorities, leading to delays due to lack of resources, the GIA2013 also contained a provision for claimants contributing to the cost for determining applications. Authorities should also subject applications for new 
defaultPRoW
default to a similar cost. Landowners are subject to costs for applications to divert paths, so why not applicants for new paths? 
default&#xa0;
default14] defaultA “Set-fee” charge would serve to encourage more genuine applications;default&#xa0;defaultThis would act as a deterrent to the many frivolous applications, as well as 
defaultcovering administration costs 
defaultrelieving the taxpayer from the burden of paying for it all.
default&#xa0;
default15] defaultLegislation for Deregulation already exist in regards to the default“2026 cut-off”default date in the CROW Act 2000 which is the deadline for the defaultmasqueradedefault that is applications for supposedly “defaultlost routes”default; paths not recorded on the Definitive Map prior to 1949. default&#xa0;defaultThis cut-off date is deregulation legislation already in place and it is contrary to this Bills purpose to remove or amend it. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 2026 cut-off date will help prevent public office from continuing the administrative madness that results in the very real living nightmare of those who face such claims.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation to rewrite the 2026 cut-off date so as to only effect applications to stop-up/delete (and therefore also divert 
defaultPRoW
default), 
defaultand yet
default to
default&#xa0;
defaultcontinue to allow the recording of 
defaultnew
default “lost” routes on the Definitive Map past 2026,  would only offer a one-way door.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis would be utter folly. Routes would be claimed indefinitely, spreading like a cancer until every inch of land in the country would be coloured in by the lines drawn on the Definitive Map. With no 
defaultcut-off
default point it would have to be renamed 
default“The Indefinite Map”.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy 2026 there will have been 77 years for any 
defaultPRoW
default overlooked to have been claimed. This is more than ample time. Or is it suggested that the job of 1949 Definitive Map recording was done incorrectly? If so then some paths will need to be deleted because they have been put on in error.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere should not be 
defaultany
default amendment made to the 2026 cut off date. 
default&#xa0;
default16] defaultThe foreword to the draft Bill suggests that its intention is for, default“defaultMaking life easier for individuals and civil society”default.default&#xa0;defaultHowever it will not.
default&#xa0;default17] defaultRather than default“devolving decisions on defaultPRoWdefault to a local level”default as proposed it would be far more efficient to move defaultPRoWdefault to a central legal arena, as in other aspects of land use, such as the Land Registry where proper legally trained staff could be deployeddefault. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis would bring consistency to the administration process, where currently Authorities across the country use various approaches to the legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy administrating through the Land Registry this would facilitate the 
default“appropriate fee”
default to be charged for applications for amending the Definitive Map.
default&#xa0;defaultIf applications were administered through the Land Registry only formal applications in the prescribed form would be accepted, with applications being cross referenced with property deeds and involvement with the landowner thus clearing up any issues from the onset. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no need for unprocessed applications or informal claims sitting on file. It is only fair that potential property owners should be aware of exactly what they are legitimately 
defaultpurchasing,
default this could be highlighted when Land Registry searches are made at time of property conveyance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe existing 
defaultPRoW
default legislation and procedure is already confusing and complicated. It requires the need to understand and cross reference 3 existing legislations: The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW Act 2000), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 2001 (WCA 2001) &amp; The Highways Act 1980 (HA 1980).These legislations are already abused and misinterpreted due to the confusion of having 3 legislations partially crossing over each other.
default&#xa0;
default18] defaultEvidence should be submitted on oath.default&#xa0;defaultThe making of Orders should be determined by a proper court under a legally qualified 
defaultPRoW
default Judge and witnesses and evidence should be under oath. At present so called “
defaultevidence
default” is submitted and not tested under the proper legal scrutiny, and yet it is considered acceptable for the making of a legal Order. This is wrong. It is encouraging the worst kind of standard in public life and office.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe land owner and the public should be notified of all applications which are accepted and the criteria fully explained in writing prior to a court hearing. All witnesses should be declared to any opposing party and have provided a statutory declaration of their alleged use prior to the hearing if they are to be called as witnesses. This is presently not a requirement and is undemocratic.
default&#xa0;default19] defaultApplications being processed and decided through a proper legal court would save huge amounts of public money and needless bureaucracy.default 
default&#xa0;defaultAt present once a 
defaultPRoW
default application is submitted to an Authority it stays there on file; even after passing through Committee, Public Inquiry and through the Courts. When a claim goes into the public domain it remains there waiting to resurface, to return again and again and again, building up “piecemeal” until the landowner and opposition are fatigued, financially drained and are finally defeated. Meanwhile communities and lives are pulled apart whilst public office use resources and taxpayer’s money pursuing and assisting claimed paths.
default&#xa0;
defaultPRoW
default applications are
default “Zombie Orders”;
default waiting for the time to rise again from the dead.
