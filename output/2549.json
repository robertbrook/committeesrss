"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Stuart Taylor [OLS0040]&#xa0;&#xa0;FIRST:  Congratulations, this is an excellent enquiry, and I wish and pray for your every success in it and that God may honour \nyour endeavours.\n&#xa0;WHO: \n              \nA) \nI write primarily as a parent / householder who has\n, with my wife, had the experience and responsibility of bringing up three sons and two daughters, seeking to teach them \n‘the good and right \nway’\n  (\n1 Sam 12 v 23)\n in view of marriage and the setting up of their own households.\n&#xa0;\nB) \nI also write as a Chri\nstian \nholding the Holy Scriptures \nas being the Word of God, affording all the guidance needed to protect our children.  \nIsaiah 7 v \n15\n  ‘that\n he may know to refuse the evil and to choose the good.’  \nRomans 16 v 19\n ‘to be wise as to that which is good, and s\nimple as to evil.’\n  \n1 Tim 5 v \n22\n  ‘keep\n thyself pure.’  \n2 Tim 2 v \n22  ‘\nbut\n youthful lusts flee.’\n&#xa0;\nPARENTS:  The prime responsibility to protect our children rests with the parents.  We are responsible to care for them physically, morally and financially, a\nnd instruct them as to purity before marriage.  Quoting the words of a Church Leader, ‘the greatest thing a man can do is to preserve his household [\neg\n children]’.  \nActs 16 v \n31\n  ‘Believe\n on the Lord Jesus and thou \nshalt\n be saved, thou and thy house.’\n&#xa0;\nYou\nng people have naturally inquisitive minds and every possibl\ne effort should be taken to hinder the promotion of\n devices or circumstances which would leave them vulnerable or exposed.\n&#xa0;\nAs parents, along with other Christians, we set up our own schools in 19\n93 to endeavour to protect our children from the sadly declining activities and conversations amongst teenage children.  We also supplied them with computers which are limited and blocked from the defiling, corrupt and damaging materials which could normal\nly be accessed.  I know from bitter experience that contact with unclean literature can damage you for life.  I personally know a Peer who always videos programmes before his children view them, taking out the harmful sections.\n&#xa0;INDUSTRY:  As employers, we\n would be selective of areas and buildings which we would work in and would personally \nbe\n proactive in protection of our trainees and sub-contractors.  The conditions of engagement include that no pornographic material or means of accessing it is taken on \nsite.\n&#xa0;\nGOVERNMENT:  The government does have a responsibility to protect hum\nanity and should be seen to be \na terror to evil.  \nRomans 13 v \n3\n  ‘For\n rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil one.’\n  Filth is evil.\n&#xa0;\nI would fully support that is sh\nould be mandatory for Government to impose strict sanctions where licensing for publications are granted with a penalty in place where these are not adhered to.\n&#xa0;\nSUGGESTIONS:  Your suggestion of default blocking facilities on all marketed internet devices \nis excellent. \n&#xa0;\nThe introduction of passwords or filters, such as declaration of age\n \nor a ‘general knowledge’ question, the answer to which would be unlikely to be known by anyone under the age of 18\n, before access can be obtained is another suggestion.\n \n&#xa0;\nAnother possibility may be to link all licensed sites to national records such as registration of birth certificates / national insurance numbers / driving licence number, so that if a person’s details entered cannot be matched, access is denied.\n&#xa0;\nThank yo\nu for the opportunity of contributing to this enquiry.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
