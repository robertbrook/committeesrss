[[[Response Summary]]]

[[[Combatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of Competent People:]]] The creation of one consumer facing quality mark for all competent electricians, underpinned by a list to allow consumer marketing to align across all electrical scheme providers should help to increase consumer awareness of competent people. The additional requirement in the DCLG conditions of authorisation will also help combat this issue: The scheme operator shall advertise the scheme, explaining its purpose and benefits, to encourage potential members to join and use by customers.

[[[Combatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of]]]

[[[ Building Regulation Requirements:]]]

[[[ ]]]the complexity of conveying work that is and is not notifiable coupled with a lack of enforcement of building regulation compliance result in consumer awareness being low. If all electrical work which warrants an electrical certificate required notification under Part P, and the number of routes to notification was reduced to two, CPS registered electrical installers or DIY signed off by LABC, the message would be a lot easier to convey and understand. This approach coupled with giving Local Authorities greater powers, such as the ability to issue on the spot fines, for non-compliance or lack of necessary notification would also help raise awareness.

[[[dequacy of the review of those carrying out electrical works to which building regulations apply:]]] If those carrying out work to building regulations are registered with a Competent Person Scheme (CPS), their installation and testing work, health and safety measures, indemnity and liability insurance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documents, complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring of subcontracting staff are inspected annually to ensure compliance with scheme requirements and building regulations.

[[[The ]]]

[[[extent of training of those carrying out electrical work under CPS: ]]]NAPIT do not agree with the Qualified Supervisor model, requiring only one person within an enterprise to meet the required standard set out in the EAS document. The removal of the phrase 

[[[‘]]]

[[[or adequately supervised’]]] at clause 11.1 in the EAS 2012 document would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve overall safety levels in the industry. 

[[[Effect of C]]]

[[[ompetition on standards and review of electrical work:]]] The introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high standards set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain.

[[[Adequacy of Supervision by DCLG of accreditation schemes: ]]]Supervision of scheme providers will be significantly improved under DCLG’s new Conditions of Authorisation which involve rigorous inspections by UKAS an independent committee for each scheme operator and an increase in reporting to the Department.

[[[About NAPIT Registration]]]NAPIT Registration is authorised by DCLG to operate a Competent Person Scheme. The scope of our authorisation enables us to register a variety of tradespeople as competent to self-certificate their own work, including: electricians, plumbers, heating specialists, ventilation/ air conditioning and building fabric installers. NAPIT is currently the second largest registration body for electrical contractors, with over 9,000 electrical enterprises registered.

[[[the ex]]]

[[[tent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Competent Person Scheme]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The issue of the lack of consumer awareness of ‘Competent People’ was raised as early as 2009 by DCLG. It was also emphasised during the consultation stage preceding the April 2013 changes to Part P of the Building Regulations. In response to these concerns, the Government agreed to introduce new provisions which required scheme providers to promote and publicise the benefits of Competent Person Schemes and raise public awareness of their responsibility to comply with the Building Regulations.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; NAPIT have adhered to this requirement. We have always invested in the promotion of our members via NAPIT but, in the past 18 months, we have gone one step further and have invested in significant marketing efforts and a considerable amount of money in advertising to promote the use of 

[[[all]]] competent registered electricians via the ElectricSafe Register. 1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; NAPIT accept that awareness is still low but have reason to believe that recent marketing efforts have gone some way to improving this. Our consumer facing promotion has been considerable, including: a local radio campaign, reaching 29 stations; a local newspaper campaign featured in 80 newspapers on a quarterly basis; a roadside billboard campaign with advertisements in 50 prominent roadside sites across the country; and a London underground marketing drive saw tubecar posters displayed inside 500 trains.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; There have recently been concerns expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consumers as there is more than one register that references electrical firms registered under Part P of the Building Regulations. In order to overcome these concerns we have recently held a meeting with ECA, Certsure and the Electrical Safety Council and have agreed to seek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electrician to do electrical work in their home.&#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; It is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline, and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).  We along with the above mentioned organisations have written to the Parliamentary Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard1.6&#xa0;&#xa0; The combined resources of all electrical CPS providers should go a long way to improving awareness of electrical safety in the home and the importance of using competent, registered electricians.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Awareness of the Building Regulations]]]1.7&#xa0;&#xa0; Awareness of the Building Regulations requirements also remains low. A survey commissioned by ElectricSafe, highlighted that only 28.40 per cent of respondents knew what the term “Part P registered electrician” meant and a worrying 41 per cent of householders were not aware that it was their responsibility to ensure notifiable electrical work complies with the Building Regulations. &#xa0;1.8&#xa0;&#xa0; This is likely to be due to the complexity of the different notifications routes available and the technical nature of the distinction between notifiable and non-notifiable electrical work (made more complicated following the recent changes to Part P which came into force in April 2013). 

[[[We therefore propose that all electrical work which warrants a ]]]

[[[. ]]]This would make the message to consumers a lot easier to convey.&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the problem is not just one of complexity. Lack of enforcement also undermines the Competent Person Scheme provider’s ability to raise awareness among the general public. Householders are currently responsible for compliance but, due to Local Authorities’ lack of resources and reluctance to bring sanctions against people with an understandable lack of electrical knowledge, are rarely penalised for non-compliance. There is also no legal requirement for homeowners to have regular electrical safety checks, meaning unsafe work can often go unnoticed until an accident occurs.

[[[the same level of skills;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Adequacy of training requirements]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Historically, the entry training requirements demanded by scheme providers have been variable. NAPIT’s competency requirements have always been high.  In the past, we have required the following qualifications and experience from those wishing to register on the full scope electrical scheme:2.2&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2012 the Government set new Conditions of Authorisation for CPS self-certification schemes following the recommendation of a previous Select Committee. These conditions mandate much more precise and uniform standards. 2.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Among these new conditions is the requirement that all CPS providers achieve and maintain UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 (or latest equivalent). UKAS deliver accreditation to this standard by ensuring all CPS providers comply with the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification (EAS). The EAS interprets and applies the generic standards set out in the latest conditions of authorisation mandated by DCLG and sets out the minimum requirements to be met by an Enterprise for them to be recognised as technically competent by a Registration Body. 2.4&#xa0;&#xa0; EAS 2012 is a significant improvement on its predecessor (2010). For example the route to being deemed competent without prior experience is no longer available under EAS 2012. This effectively closes the route to “competency” previously referred to within the trade as the “five day wonder” (an electrician deemed competent after only a short course). NAPIT have never just accepted such minimal training criteria but it is a positive step for the industry as a whole that this loophole in previous competency requirements has been closed. The entry requirements now specify the exact qualifications required, leaving no room for misapplication.2.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Correct application of these specifications will be adequate in preparing those applying to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations. Moreover, because all CPS providers will be required to assess the qualifications and experience of their members in line with these robust criteria from 2014, steps have already been taken to improve the standard and enforcement of training requirements which should be allowed to take full effect before they can be evaluated for success.

[[[The extent to which all those work]]]

[[[ing for a company are brought up to the same level of skills]]]2.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Though NAPIT broadly support the requirements of the EAS, there is one aspect of this document we do not agree with; the documents’ reference to “assessed enterprises” and “qualified supervisors” (QS). 2.7&#xa0;&#xa0; In the EAS document, the term QS means that CPS providers are only required to assess the competency of one individual within each registered enterprise. The QS model may allow “electricians” who may be neither properly trained nor genuinely monitored to carry out electrical installations. Qualified supervisors are ultimately responsible for confirming the safety and compliance of these installations but, as part of a busy electrical contracting firm, perhaps supervising multiple individuals, their ability to adequately check electrical works at all stages of the installation process is questionable. The removal of the phrase 

[[[‘or adequately supervised’ ]]]at clause 11.1 in the EAS 2012 document  would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve safety levels in the industry.2.8&#xa0;&#xa0; NAPIT have never subscribed to this model. Our current application form requires the applicant to declare that they provide evidence of training and or experience for all operatives carrying out installation work. We require the person who takes responsibility for the inspection, testing and certification to be qualified and to be the

[[[ ]]]competent person (often resulting in numerous competent people within a company). This doesn’t necessarily mean that every individual within a company must be assessed every year, but that the same amount of inspection effort can be refocused to look beyond this single QS individual and see how competent work is delivered by other individuals.&#xa0;

[[[Individual licence to practice]]]&#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0; In our 2012 submission to the CLG Select Committee, we made the case for an individual licence to practice. An individual license to practice would mean that every electrician undertaking work which requires an electrical certificate would need to be registered and assessed as competent in order to carry out electrical work. We emphasised that this was widely supported by electricians, highlighting an industry wide consultation that showed 78 per cent of our members supported the case for individual licensing. &#xa0;2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Though a licence to practice would require new legislation, we noted that it would remove the need for local authority inspection and create a clear marketplace for the consumer which would improve understanding and awareness. Requiring a licence to work on notifiable electrical installations has the very real potential to significantly reduce dangerous work carried out by un-registered tradespeople, simplify the process of enforcement, ensure sufficient training is undertaken by all those being paid to undertake electrical work and push rogue electricians to the periphery.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[tions apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations; ]]]&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; If those carrying out work to building regulations are registered with a Competent Person Scheme (CPS), their work, working practices, compliance with health and safety, accounts, insurance, safety and testing equipment and staff documents are inspected annually to ensure compliance with scheme requirements and building regulations.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; NAPIT’s annual assessment checklist is comprehensive and includes; demonstrating suitable installation work to verify technical competence and compliance; demonstrating that risks have been assessed and appropriate controls are put in place where required; the access to and use of correctly calibrated equipment; and demonstrating their knowledge of regulations and fundamental principles. &#xa0;

[[[The adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The assessment NAPIT carries out on its registered full scope electricians does not just include the inspection of electrical work carried out by the registrant, it also requires that they demonstrate; compliant health and safety measures, adequate indemnity and liability insurance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documents, a complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring of subcontracting staff etc. 4.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Updated technical assessment criteria, with which compliance will be mandatory from June 2014, are set out in section 15 of the EAS 2012 document.  We feel these requirements are adequate and reflect those historically required by NAPIT. 4.3 In a recent survey, the NAPIT Trade association found that 86.4% of full scope electrical members thought that the review of electrical work carried out by us is adequate. 4.4 In surveys carried out over the last four years over 4000 consumers have been asked if they were satisfied with the quality of work carried out by the NAPIT member involved and 99% have said that they were satisfied with 96% saying that the would recommend the electrician to others.4.5 The number of complaints we receive about our members is also a useful indicator of the quality of their work and therefore the adequacy of our review procedures. NAPIT’s complaint ratio is currently 1 compliant in every 5000 jobs (or 0.5 complaints a year per hundred members). &#xa0;

[[[s]]]

[[[tic electrical work; ]]]&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Competition between accreditation bodies has a number of effects. Lowering standards to compete is not something NAPIT have subscribed to as we believe that many competent electricians reject this approach. 5.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Any tendency to lower standards is already being counteracted by the condition that all CPS providers adhere to the revised EAS document (2012) which includes higher standards. NAPIT believe this will mitigate any opportunity for standards to be lowered, as those who do so after June 2014 will have their DCLG authorisation revoked. 5.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Another negative aspect of competition which has been seen in the past was “scheme provider hopping”, where a member of a scheme could be excluded, but then join another scheme and carry on working even though they were not deemed to be able to do so by a previous CPS provider. This is already being addressed by CPS providers in line with point 14 of DCLGs new conditions of authorisation.5.4&#xa0;&#xa0; The other side of this argument is that competition gives electrician’s choice. If they are unhappy with a particular aspect of a scheme, they are able to vote with their feet and move to another.  NAPIT believe this is very positive for the provision of the competent person scheme in general as it prevents providers from becoming complacent and encourages them to provide an efficient service that also represents value for money. This has encouraged scheme providers to offer their members more services and was one of the factors that influenced NAPITs Complete Solution approach, an approach which enables our members to more easily and cost effectively notify work across multiple work areas which they have demonstrated competence in. 5.5&#xa0;&#xa0; The introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high standards set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain. 

[[[f) T]]]

[[[he adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes. ]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; DCLG has responded to the concerns about the adequacy of the supervision of CPS providers by introducing standardised  Conditions of Authorisation which all scheme must comply with by June 2014.6.2&#xa0;&#xa0; The conditions of authorisation mean all scheme providers are now required to gain UKAS accreditation. UKAS now assess NAPIT several times each year. In 2013 to date UKAS have spent 17 person-days with NAPIT both at the headquarters and witnessing NAPIT at work assessing scheme members. This far exceeds the degree of monitoring that the Department was conducting prior to accreditation.6.3&#xa0;&#xa0; All the CPS providers are also now required by DCLG to submit a detailed report on the English and Welsh provision of the Competent Person Scheme, including details of; marketing, complaints and membership statistics. UKAS also report their findings to the Department. This gives DCLG a lot more insight in to the way CPS providers are operating.6.4&#xa0;&#xa0; One key element of accreditation is that EN45011 requires an independent committee (sometimes called an impartiality committee, in NAPIT’s case its Governing Board) who independently review the operations of a scheme operator, make recommendations as they see fit, and have the power to report the scheme operator to UKAS or the Department if their advice is not followed. DCLG require this to be in place by June 2014 but NAPIT’s Governing Board has been in place since 2009 and has been found to be of great value in helping us to identify and deliver real improvements to the benefit of scheme members, consumers and the government.23 November 20132&#xa0; IET (October 2012).
