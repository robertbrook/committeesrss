"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Bail for Immigration Detainees (JRR 0014)&#xa0;Bail for Immigration DetaineesBID is an independent charity \nwhich\n provides immigration detainees with\n free legal advice, information and\n representation\n to secure their release from detention\n. \nFrom 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013, BID assisted 3367 people held in immigration detention.  \n \n&#xa0;\nSummary The Government’s proposals would place severe restrictions on immigration detainees’ access to judicial review, which is a crucial mechanism for safeguarding individual rights and preventing unlawful government conduct. \nIntroduction &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStanding and third party interventions&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Public law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts \nhave always been alive to the fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issue or the outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public\n power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for [permission to bring judicial review], the court’s only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive” (Sedley J in R v Somerset County Council, ex p Dixon \n[1998] Env LR 111 at 117-121)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\"Judicial reviews are brought by groups who seek nothing more than cheap headlines\"\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThird party interventions&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Case study: child detention &#xa0;In January 2011, following judicial review proceedings in the ‘Suppiah’ case,\n the Administrative Court found that two families had been detained unlawfully. Liberty \nintervened in this case, and BID provided detailed evidence to support their intervention. In his concluding remarks, Justice Wyn Williams found that: \n&#xa0;‘The Claimants \nwere detained unlawfully from the time that they were taken into custody until their release. Their rights under Articles 5 and 8 ECHR were infringed in the manner described earlier in this judgment; their rights under Article 3 were not infringed. The Def\nendant's current policy relating to detaining families with children is not unlawful. There is, nonetheless, a significant body of evidence which demonstrates that employees of UKBA have failed to apply that policy with the rigour it deserves. The cases of\n the two families involved in this litigation provide good examples of the failure by UKBA to apply important aspects of the policy both when the decisions were taken to detain each family and when decisions were taken to maintain detention after removal d\nirections had been cancelled.’\n&#xa0;\nAt paragraph 111, \nJustice Wyn Williams stated: \n&#xa0;\n‘On the basis of the evidence adduced by the Claimants and Liberty, no one can seriously dispute that detention is capable of causing significant and, in some instances, long \nlasting harm to children. That emerges with clarity from the observations of HM Inspector of Prisons, the Children's Commissioner, Members of Parliament, the Independent Inspector of UKBA and the detailed evidence of Mr Makhlouf.’ \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCosts arising from the involvement of third party interveners and non-parties &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCosts &amp; financial incentives &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhere payment is discretionary it probably won’t be made: evidence from the Exceptional Funding Scheme&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“In total the [Legal Aid Agency] had received 213 applications for non-inq\nuest cases.  Of these, 146 were in family law and 63 in immigration.  There had been only two grants of funding: one in an immigration case concerning EU law and one in a family case.  In the [one] immigration case, funding was only granted after a pre-act\nion protocol letter was sent”\n&#xa0;Examples of cases which would be affected &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChallenging delays in Home Office decision-making &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnlawful detention claims: family separation &#xa0;&#xa0;\nJudicial reviews to challenge removal from the UK&#xa0;&#xa0;\nCase study&#xa0;\nFaith was detained with her partner for 206 days after serving a prison sentence. Her four children were aged between one and eleven when she went to prison; the eldest child was a British Citizen. The children were extremely distressed, and some of them d\neveloped behavioural and health problems.  \n&#xa0;\nThree months into her detention, the Home Office wrote to Faith and her partner informing them that they intended to remove the parents and children together. The family had been separated for two years and five\n months. The Home Office noted the need for the children to “re-establish their relationship with their parents before remova\nl,”\n and envisaged that this might happen at Heathrow Airport. It is extremely concerning to see that the Home Office thought it wou\nld be appropriate to reunite these extremely distressed children with their parents during the course of their forced removal. \n&#xa0;\nThis removal attempt was cancelled, and the Home Office arranged a new date for the family to be removed using the same method,\n but this was prevented by a judicial review application. The parents were subsequently released from detention and granted leave to remain in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nJudicial reviews challenging maltreatment of detainees &#xa0;&#xa0;\n“She said her body was covere\nd in bruises after the incident..\n an independent doctor warned that putting the woman on the plane without adequat\ne monitoring while she was bleeding could lead to premature labour and ruptured membranes”’ \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProtective costs orders &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The residence test&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Interaction of the residence test and judicial review reforms &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Immigration Bill and judicial review reforms&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nImmigration Bill: Clause 12 &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nImmigration Bill: Clause 14 &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 November 2013\n \nMinistry of Justice 6/09/2013, Impact Assessment Number 210:  Reforms to Judicial Review \nhttps://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-review\n \n \nMinistry of Justice, (September 2013), ‘\nJudicial Review: Proposals for further reform’\n, p3.\n Available at \nhttps://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-review\n See: \nWL (Congo) 1 &amp; 2 v SSHD; KM (Jamaica) v SSHD\n [2011] UKSC 12\nR (on the application of) Reetha Suppiah and others v SSHD and Interveners\n [2011] EWHC 2 (Admin)\n See for example Chapter 45 of the Home Office’s \nEnforcement Instructions and Guidance \nhttp://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/policyandlaw/guidance/enforcement/\n Cabinet Offic\ne (May 2010) \nThe Coalition: Our Programme for Government\n, p21\n Public Law Project, (26 September 2013), ‘\nWritten evidence to the \nJoint Committee on Human Rights enquiry into the implications for access to justice of the Government’s proposed legal aid \nreforms’\n \nFigures from Refugee Council, (2012),,\n’Not a minor offence: unaccompanied children locked up as part of the asylum system’\n, a\nvailable at t\nhttp://www.refu\ngeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0002/5945/Not_a_minor_offence_2012.pdf\n,\nThe Poppy Project, (2008), ‘\nDetained: prisoners with no crime - detention of trafficked women in the UK’.  Available at \nhttp://i2.cmsfiles.com/eaves/2012/04/Detained-c1f762.pdf\n See for example:\n HM Inspectorate of Prisons and the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, (December 2012), ‘\nThe effectiveness and impact of  immigration detention casework’\n \nAvailable at \nhttp://bit.ly/UBdHRN\nMXL, R (on the application of) &amp; Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n [2010] EWHC 2397 (Admin) and  NXT, R (on the application of) &amp; Ors v Secretary of State for the Home D\nepartment [2011] EWHC 969 (Admin)\n The Guardian, Friday 11 January 2013 , ‘UK Border Agency rejects calls to stop us\ning force on pregnant detainees’\n \na\nvailable at \nhttp://\nwww.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/11/uk-border-agency-rejects-force\n HM Inspector of Prisons (2012) \nReport on an announced inspection of Cedars Pre-Departure Accommodation\n See for example: House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee (2012) \nThe work \nof the UK Border Agency (April–June 2012) Eighth Report of Session 2012–13\n \nThe Ministry of Justice has conceded that applications for release from detention on bail or temporary admission, and judicial reviews challenging the legality of detention would \nbe\n exempt from the residence test (Ministry of Justice September 2013 \nTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps, Annex B: Response to consultation, \nParagraph 125). \nHowever, civil claims for compensation \nand damages \nfor periods of unlawful detention, made after re\nlease, would be subject to the residence test.
