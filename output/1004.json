"VEP 0005\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by the Howard League for Penal Reform in Scotland (VEP 0005)&#xa0;Summary of our position\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Howard League for Penal Reform in Scotland \n&#xa0;\nThe Howard League for Penal Reform in Scotland \n(‘Howard League Scotland’) \nseeks to promote just responses to the causes and consequences of crime.\n \n&#xa0;\nHoward League Scotland \n(HLS) \nbelieves that it is time for criminal justice policy and systems to take a different direction, a direction with much more reliance on effective community approaches to reducing crime and dealing with criminality. A direction with much greater chance of success in reducing crime. A direction that has already been successfully taken by many of our Northern European colleagues.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst still committed to Penal Reform — the improvement of prison conditions and the promotion of rehabilitation — \nHLS\n is convinced that a steady reduction in the numbers of people committed to prison is essential and achievable. Howard League Scotland members have extensive experience across all aspects of the criminal justice system in Scotland. They have no rosy-eyed view either of the effects of crime nor of the nature of criminality, even in its most drastic forms. HLS shares these views with many others, not just in Scotland but across the UK. \n&#xa0;\nHLS does not represent individuals nor provide services, nor does it plan to. It is a fully independent body, representing an enormous amount of experience and active engagement — with members (including Committee members) at all stages of careers. It seeks to draw from the wisdom of this experience and engagement to promote realisable goals for Scotland’s criminal justice system and help promote effective pathways to achieving those goals — which include a sustained reversal of the increase in prison numbers.\n&#xa0;\nWhy Voting Matters\n&#xa0;\nThe universality of the franchise is important not only for nationhood and democracy. The vote of each and every citizen is a badge of dignity and personhood. Quite literally, it says that everybody counts.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nconstitutional court of South Africa\n in a decision on prisoners’ voting rights (1999)\n&#xa0;\nThe creation of a universal franchise is one of the great political achievements of the past 150 years: we should never take it for granted.  How much care we exercise when we decide to remove voting rights is a token not just of how we value fellow citizens, but of how much we value voting itself. \n&#xa0;\nIn many countries, the vote is seen as an inalienable right that cannot be taken away as a punishment.  We think that is a powerful position which better represents the values of a modern democracy, than the current position in the UK, which has its roots in the mid-nineteenth century relationship between voting and property ownership, and the forfeiture of property for certain crimes.  \n&#xa0;\nThe European Context\n&#xa0;\nAs the Committee will be aware, the UK is unusual in Europe in implementing a blanket ban and the only European countries with which the UK keeps company in not allowing any convicted prisoners the right to vote are Armenia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Russia.\n&#xa0;\nThe ban is often defended on the basis that those sentenced to prison have broken their contract with society, in a substantially different way from the many other offenders who are given non-custodial sentences or fines, and that this must mean that all convicted prisoners should lose their vote while they are held in prison.  \nWhen so many of our fellow democracies reject that logic, we should stop and consider it again.&#xa0;\nThe international position underlines that respecting the rights of victims, as we should, does not require the removal of the vote.  We are not aware of any evidence that it functions as a deterrent. Indeed, we find the idea that prison should automatically carry a penalty of “civic death” at odds with the agendas for rehabilitation and reintegration which have been a welcome part of Scottish political debate in recent years.   We believe effective rehabilitation is central to addressing the needs of victims of crime.\n&#xa0;\nThe way we use prisons \n&#xa0;\nAs a society, we expect the criminal justice system to punish offenders appropriately and reduce the risk of reoffending. Prisons will always be an essential part of that system. \n&#xa0;\nDecisions about imprisonment are often not clear-cut, however: \nthere is not a straightforward divide between the types of offences which attract imprisonment and those which do not. In Scotland in 2011-12, 28 per cent of \nshoplifting\n convictions, 54 per cent of house-breaking convictions, and 61 per cent of convictions for serious assault and attempted murder ended in a custodial sentence.  The remaining cases were dealt with using non-custodial measures. \n&#xa0;\nScotland's rate of imprisonment is higher than in most other European Union countries, although similar to that of England and Wales. The sentenced prison population is around 25 per cent higher than it was ten years ago. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice, \nhas noted that\n: “In Scotland, we still have too many short-term prisoners. In Scotland, a higher proportion of offenders—15 per cent—are sent to prison than in England and Wales”.\n&#xa0;\nThe rise in the prison population over the past five years or so is set against a backdrop of relatively stagnant or falling levels of recorded crime. Statistical analysis has revealed that among the  drivers behind the increase in prison population over the past couple of decades is an\nincrease in the number of convicted offenders getting custodial sentences for lower level crimes and offences.\n&#xa0;\nInquiries into prisons and offending commissioned by the Scottish Government in recent years tell a consistent story about the over-use of imprisonment in Scotland, in particular for those from the most deprived and vulnerable backgrounds.  One study indicated that half of our prison population comes from the poorest 15 per cent of Scotland's council wards.  Another recent enquiry found that for women who have been repeatedly convicted of committing lower level offences, offending is often the result of significant underlying issues, such as drug or alcohol addiction and mental health problems, that could be better addressed in the community. It also found that female prisoners have higher lifetime incidences of trauma, including severe and repeated physical and sexual victimisation, than either male prisoners or women in the general population. \n&#xa0;\nInquiries have also \nraised concern that there is evidence \nthat similar cases are sentenced very differently in different courts - and even by different judges in the same courts.\nThe evidence is compelling that being sentenced to imprisonment alone should not be regarded as providing a strong enough justification for removing a person’s right to vote and that the current ban impacts disproportionately on the most deprived and vulnerable.  As in other developed European democracies, if we are to remove the vote at all, we should set a higher bar.\n&#xa0;\nReferendums \n&#xa0;\nWe understand that t\nhe Bill deals only with the franchise for elections and the franchise for any particular referendum is by custom set in the specific legislation for the referendum. \nBy their nature, referendums tend to be reserved for matters of lasting constitutional importance.   \nThat makes it more important for prisoners to have a vote in these, not less.  &#xa0;\nChange here should be guided by what ought to be done, not what must be done.  \nThe Committee will want to be aware that w\ne are making these arguments to the Scottish Parliament as it considers the legislation governing the franchise for the referendum on Scottish independence.\n&#xa0;\nWe support the view expressed in the submission by the Electoral Commission to the Ministry of Justice consultation on prisoner voting in 2009, which stated, in response to q\nuestion 12 (Do you believe that prisoners should be entitled to vote at local elections and referenda?): “We agree that prisoners should be allowed to vote at all elections. Once it has been established that certain prisoners can vote, they should be able to vote in all of the types of election that their nationality and deemed place of residence would allow them to were they not imprisoned”.\n&#xa0;\nVoting and rehabilitation\n&#xa0;\nWe do not want to suggest that voting by itself will make a large difference but we do believe that \nparticipation in democratic decision-making could contribute to the process of rehabilitation and send a strong message to prisoners that they remain part of wider society and have a stake in its future. Excluding them sends the opposite message and if it has any effect, will reinforce their sense of being separate from, and rejected by, mainstream society. This will work against successful rehabilitation.\n&#xa0;\nThe relevance of ECHR\n&#xa0;\nWe make this as a moral case, not a legal one.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion: Options for ending the ban\n&#xa0;\nWe would welcome a broad debate on whether to follow the model of many other developed democracies, and allow most or all prisoners to vote.  If there are to be any exclusions, models based on removing the vote for a limited range of defined offences or as a specific decision by the court in any case offer the most coherent and defensible approach.  However, we assume that such models would take longer to develop and agree than the proposals in the Bill.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore\n, in the interim any extension of the franchise would be an improvement on the current position and we would wish to be recorded as supporting both of the options which are in the draft Bill which do that, with a preference for including all short-term prisoners, up to 4 years, as the option which does most to lift the ban. If time-based rules are being applied, there is also a case for seeking to include those nearing the end of a sentence and being prepared for release.  \n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n&#xa0;\nSources\n&#xa0;\nPrison statistics and \npopulation projections Scotland\n 2011-12:\n \nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00396363.pdf\nScotland’s Choice – Report of the Scottish Prisons Commission: \nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Review/spc\n&#xa0;\nCommission on Women Offenders: Final Report\nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Review/commissiononwomenoffenders/finalreport-2012\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
