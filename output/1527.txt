[[[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]]]

[[[1.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Consumption of energy for heat in the home is on a downward trend with promising new technologies offering further efficiency gains and the prospect of reducing household fuel bills whilst keeping us on course to our 2050 carbon emission targets and offering a measure of protection against power cuts post 2015.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Government, now joining the growing weight of scientific opinion and environmental campaigners, considers biomass not to be sustainable. Moreover, biomass emissions carry a social cost of £4343m in terms of premature death and extra morbidity. The downsides of biomass apply equally in domestic or industrial combustion.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The sustainability criteria of biomass are weak, rely on the honesty box principle and take no account of carbon debt or emissions from indirect use of land change. They provide no safeguard against increased net carbon emissions.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Tests to date on installed heat pumps show many failing to qualify as renewable.  Failures would not count towards our renewables target and could either completely waste or forfeit subsidy. Many heat pumps, when installed, do not do what they say on the tin, and no amount of taxpayer’s subsidy can draw a veil over that. Air Source Heat Pumps emerge from independent testing as a bust technology undeserving of taxpayer support.&#xa0;

[[[king in reducing demand for h]]]

[[[eat?]]]1.1. In the past 10 years the average Calor central heating customer has reduced his or her fuel usage by over 20% on a weather adjusted basis. This is in line with the recent analysis published by the Office of National Statistics which covered natural gas demand in urban areas. Perhaps demand for heat has fallen because of better insulation standards and more efficient equipment, but it is hard to disentangle this factor from energy price rises depressing consumption.1.2. The good news is that gas technology still has an enormous amount to offer in maintaining this downward trend. For example, two thirds of properties still have older non-condensing boilers and therefore still have significant savings available at relatively low cost. We are also seeing a raft of exciting new technologies coming on to the market which will further accelerate the decline in energy consumption and carbon emissions. These new technologies can be used in off gas grid areas and are able to utilise legacy heating systems such as radiators and circulating pumps. These include Flue Gas Heat Recovery, mCHP (micro combined heat and power) and Gas Absorption Heat Pumps – all low carbon or renewable gas technologies which can be readily retrofitted on to a home’s existing central heating system.

[[[What are the lock in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solutions?]]]2.1. The Energy Networks Association in their report “Gas Future Scenario Project” (November 2010) stated: “There are credible and robust scenarios in which gas could play a major ongoing role in the GB energy mix while meeting both the 2050 carbon targets and the 2020 renewable energy targets”. “Pathways with ongoing gas use could offer a cost-effective solution for a low-carbon transition relative to scenarios with higher levels of electrification.” The report shows potential savings of almost £700bn over the 2010 to 2050 period – about £20,000 per household or £10,000 per person “with consequential benefits for consumers, the economy, and the competitiveness of GB industry”.  The report points out that the low-carbon technologies all, “Involve significant investment in new technology, with its associated risks” and concludes that, “There appears to be significant value in retaining the option for a ‘high gas’ future”.               2.2. For urban areas, it points to the value of enjoying the sunk costs in the gas mains: “The costs of maintaining the existing gas transmission and distribution networks are relatively small in comparison to the other system costs associated with a low-carbon transition. Together these findings suggest a compelling economic rationale for maintaining the operation of the GB gas transmission and distribution networks for the foreseeable future”. &#xa0;2.3. Projects are underway to decarbonise gas (deploying biomethane or biopropane) but meanwhile we can make the fossil fuel work harder by deploying micro-generation – if decarbonised gas comes down the pipeline then lock-in disappears as a problem because we are dealing with bridging technology rather than a temporary fix. mCHP involves the use of gas to generate both heat and electricity. It is a low cost solution delivering secure low carbon electricity. One possible component of the domestic heating scenarios contemplated in DECC’s “Pathways Analysis” is mCHP – reaching up to 90% of the technology mix in one illustrated case, and with a maximum penetration of 36 million households by 2050. &#xa0;2.4. Owners of compliant mCHP units can sell electricity back to the grid. So, mCHP will lower, not raise, household energy bills and could be an antidote to fuel poverty.&#xa0;2.5. mCHP units are  compatible with existing grid infrastructure. What is more, mCHP benefits security of supply because the electricity is generated at or near the point of use, and when it is needed. This obviates losses in transmission (accounting for about 7% of all power generated), reduces the demand for electricity from the grid and the need for investment in central generation and the transmission and distribution network, thus lessening the otherwise crippling cost of the energy strategy (estimated at £376bn by 20301). mCHP also enhances protection against the risk of power cuts occurring after 2015, since the majority of the electricity needed by a typical home will be generated on site, and mCHP can support grid generation at times of peak demand. Indeed, mCHP tends to generate more power at times of peak demand (evenings and winters) and insofar as it is deployed will lessen the need to operate very expensive fossil-fuel peaking plant.  A financial benefit has been calculated of 6.2p/kWh of electricity generated from avoided capacity, energy and emission costs provided there is widespread mCHP deployment2.&#xa0;2.6. Significant reliance on fossil fuel capacity is dictated for decades to come to compensate for the intermittency of wind, and the slow modulation of nuclear (if indeed it can be financed and built in time to meet demand). It is this peaking and balancing fossil plant that mCHP displaces so delivering carbon savings. As long as there is fossil plant in the grid mCHP delivers carbon savings.&#xa0;2.7. The world energy scenario has changed almost beyond recognition in the last decade. Assumptions about “peak” oil and gas now look risible in light of the transformative effects of unconventional oil and gas  on the US energy market and economy, and the US has also shown that it is perfectly possible to enjoy the economic growth as a result of this new cheap and secure supply whilst driving down carbon emissions overall. mCHP can help exploit this bounty with supreme efficiency.&#xa0;

[[[ What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture? There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1. There has been a steady shift in attitude to the use of biomass within the scientific community, the European Commission, and now, detectably within the Government itself. The downsides of biomass in electricity generation or in combustion in the home are shared: the differences are mainly of scale, except that at the domestic level there is no third party control of emissions through the stack. All too often the social cost of these emissions – in terms of early death and disease – is ignored. This social cost has been computed at £4343m by DECC3.3.2. The Chartered Institute of Water and Environmental Management recently commented: “The encouragement of biomass boilers in urban areas has added new sources of pollution, where there is often existing poor air quality…Burning…biomass emits NOx and PM. The PM is largely composed of black carbon, which is now thought to be responsible for the cardiovascular health effects and premature mortality due to both short term (24 hour) and long term (annual) exposure. It is also important with respect to climate change (NOTE: black carbon is a potent global warming agent, second only to CO2 in its overall impact worldwide). The current regulations on emissions from combustion plant of less than 50MW …are inadequate and for those of less than 20MW, it is almost non-existent” (“Clearing the Air”, July 2013).3.3. The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution estimated that the 2008 burden level of particulates cost an “associated loss of total population life of 340,000 life-years…a greater burden than the mortality impacts of environmental tobacco smoke or road traffic accidents”4). Remarkably, this figure is exactly the level of extra burden of mortality to have been inflicted on the UK atmosphere by 2020 under the previous Government’s policy on biomass, with its target of 38TWh by that date. No wonder Government has resiled from a specific target. The last Government was aware biomass boilers deteriorate as they age so proposed an annual MOT test on domestic biomass boilers – all mention of such an annual MOT test on boilers has since been dropped.&#xa0;3.4. There are growing doubts about the sustainability of biomass as a technology. The EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting, for instance, states that the assumption that burning biomass is carbon neutral is incorrect: “Using land to produce plants for energy typically means that this land is not producing plants for other purposes, including carbon otherwise sequestered.” If biomass production replaces forests, reduces forest stocks or forest growth, which would otherwise sequester more carbon, it can increase carbon concentrations net. The RSPB, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace comment that DECC’s flawed emission accounting on biomass has led to a situation where, “Burning whole trees in power stations would make global warming worse, undermining goals of reducing our greenhouse gases by 2050”.3.5. Using logged trees as a bioenergy source – replacing fossil fuel – carries the risk of first increasing CO2 emissions before reducing them. It could in fact take up to 100 years before emissions begin to decrease. Using crop residues or wood waste does not have this downside, or to a lesser extent. If felling were to increase to provide more energy through biomass, this could hinder rather than help achieving CO2 targets. This is the main conclusion from the analysis ‘Climate effects of wood used for bioenergy’ (august 2013), released by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency in cooperation with Alterra Wageningen UR.3.6. The Government recently made an announcement that after 2027 payments to biomass conversions will end “in line with Government’s longer-term sustainability objectives as set out in the Bioenergy Strategy”. Belatedly, HMG has realised that biomass is not the sustainable hero it purported it to be. As Robert Harrobin commented on the Today Programme on 17th July 2013: “Ed Davey told me that they do accept that this is not a sustainable solution to the UK electricity problems”. Why the 2027 cut off? It’s just as unsustainable before as after that date. What is not sustainable for burning in power plants is not sustainable in domestic situations where the controls are effectively “non-existent”.&#xa0;3.7. We are not satisfied that the proposed sustainability criteria are sufficiently demanding. Wastes and residues are not subject to sustainability criteria. In theory, giving waste a free pass appears appealing, but what is “waste” and what are “residues”? The OFGEM guidance is remarkably vague and clearly capable of being exploited: “It is not possible to lay down definitive or absolute rules as to when particular materials will be considered as waste materials or not”. We fear that this complexity of definition could provide the unscrupulous with a loophole to exploit.&#xa0;3.8. OFGEM effectively points to the weakness of the process of operators verifying the information they supply on sustainability: “Under the Orders, operators of generating stations for solid and gaseous biomass are not required to verify the information they provide to us in order to be eligible for ROCs”. Reporting of sustainability criteria appears to rely too much on the honesty box principle, particularly in the context of “weak governance structures” identified in the “Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on sustainability requirements for the use of solid and gaseous biomass sources in electricity, heating and cooling” (2010).3.9. The Government issued new biomass sustainability standards on 22nd August 2013.  The Chief Scientist at Greenpaece commented, “The loopholes in these sustainability standards are big enough to drive a logging truck through...The government has ignored the latest scientific research and produced standards that will take a potentially sustainable industry and transform it into one more way to greenwash environmental destruction”5. Keith Richter, speaking for Friends of the Earth said, "It is incomprehensible that under the new rules the burning of trees in power stations will be counted as "carbon neutral" despite the preliminary results of DECC's own research showing that it can be worse for the climate than burning coal”5. Other critics pointed out that emissions from indirect land use change and carbon debt received no consideration in the new standards. We conclude that in answer to the Committee’s question of whether the biomass sustainability criteria go far enough is a resounding, “NO”.

[[[Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?]]]&#xa0;4.1. It’s not the fault of the RHI, but the fault of the pumps as installed. Leaving aside questions of their expense to install, and the disruptiveness of their installation, all too often they do not work properly. A study of installed heat pump performance published by the Energy Saving Trust on the 8th September 2010 – “Getting Warmer: a field trial of heat pumps” revealed that the actual performance of heat pumps installed in the UK was surprisingly poor. The study was financed by the heat pump industry and based on a sample of sites where pumps had been installed pre-selected by the industry. The study showed that only 1 of the 22 properties with Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) achieved the implicit minimum EU Directive CoP of 3, and only 9 of the 47 sites with ASHPs achieved the standard. Similar results prevailed in the Rowntree Foundation study in York. The Association for the Conservation of Energy calculates Coefficients of Performance for Air Source Heat Pumps from international data of between 2.15 and 2.7. On that basis, they all fail the renewable test.4.2. DECC is well aware of the problem: “We are aware that systems installed in the past have not always worked as well as they should” (Para. 199, DECC Consultation on the RHI, 20th September 2012) and again: “It is a common feature in field trials and assessments that there is a significant gap between expected and actual performance” (para. 1.23, Microgeneration Strategy Consultation, DECC, 22nd Dec, 2010). DECC is currently monitoring 150 heat pumps and preliminary results show that most heat pumps operating on a mild Spring day were achieving below the required performance levels - some significantly below. Far from backing a winning horse, DECC is backing a flop but it has been coy in admitting it, confining itself so far to admit: “We think it is likely that on average the results will still be a long way off the high-performing systems that are consistently being measured in Germany”. &#xa0;4.3. The Energy Savings Trust has now published Phase 2 of its testing on pumps (“The Heat is On”, May 2013). The bulk of this work involved a series of interventions on 32 of the failing Phase 1 sites over a three year period. In 12 cases the “interventions were “major”. In 10 cases, the interventions involved the complete replacement of the pump systems. Even with all this no doubt expensive intervention: “Some sites did not improve, even with major and medium interventions”. The deficiency in performance was especially marked for ASHPs with 6 out of 15 still failing to make the renewable grade. From this we deduce that there is no case for continued taxpayer subsidy to ASHPs since even after extensive and costly intervention by experts an unacceptable proportion could not be made to work properly. They would be ruled out as renewable by the EU and energy they generate would not count towards the UK’s renewable targets. The average performance of ASHPs was under the bar of being counted as renewable.4.4. To be fair, after all this desperate effort over three years, most GSHPs did work properly. How much all this extensive and expensive remediation would cost, and who would bear that cost – the installer or the householder – is a question for bitter experience in the market, but we draw a strong conclusion from this that type-rating technology to a standard is a long way from actual installed performance. Let the buyer beware – and let the taxpayer beware of pouring subsidy into a technology that does not make the grade. Government should pay out subsidy only on those pumps tested as having delivered to minimum performance standards after installation.4.5. These conclusions echo other studies. Johnson, for instance,  in Energy Policy, 2011, vol. 39, issue 3, pages 1369-1381 finds that at UK efficiencies heat-pump footprints (in kg CO2e emitted per kWh delivered) are comparable or higher than footprints of gaseous fuels used in heating. Compared with fossil fuel gas they don’t save carbon.4.6. The Green Alliance  lobby in favour of heat pumps but even they have admitted, “Heat pumps have performed badly in the UK…UK heat pumps have suffered from poor quality technology…bad installation…incorrect use…high running costs…Despite poor installations, heat pump installers aren’t being struck off for malpractice (“Switching the UK onto heat pumps”, 29th May 2013)”. Time after time heat pumps simply do not do what they say on the tin. &#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
