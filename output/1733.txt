[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Post Office Limited is pleased to respond to the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee’s call for evidence for their short inquiry into the Government’s proposals for the privatisation of Royal Mail. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Post Office and Royal Mail are now separate businesses. The conditions in which The Post Office operates were defined in the Postal Services Act 2011 which was in turn based upon the independent Hooper Review. &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Act, which included the separation of Post Office and Royal Mail also ensures that Post Office Limited remains in public ownership but paves the way for possible future mutualisation of the Post Office. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government policy position for the Post Office to 2015 was outlined in the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills policy document, Securing The Post Office Network in the Digital Age, published in November 2010. The document stated the Government’s aims for The Post Office, which included that The Post Office is not for sale, there will be no programme of closures, while there will be funding of £1.34 billion to maintain and modernise the network.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government policy stated that there would be a minimum nationwide network of 11,500 post offices and that the network would meet the national and local Government access criteria.  &#xa0;&#xa0;4.1 Prior to the separation of the Post Office and Royal Mail an historic long term commercial agreement between the Post Office and Royal Mail was signed ensuring that a strong link remains between Royal Mail Group and the Post Office to continue to supply Royal Mail products and services through its network. At the same time separation has also enabled Post Office Limited to focus more on its wider business priorities such as the growth of financial services, including mortgages and the launch of the post office current account.   &#xa0;4.2 Post Office Limited and Royal Mail are committed to the relationship with Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene describing The Post Office as ‘the best and strongest network in the country, by any yardstick.’ This was reaffirmed in 2011 when she said ‘There is already a very strong and enduring commercial relationship between the Post Office and Royal Mail. It is clearly in the interests of us all that this strong relationship is maintained in the future.’&#xa0;4.3 The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Dr Vince Cable MP, has confirmed that while the two companies are separate, The Post Office and Royal Mail will work together on a commercial basis.&#xa0;‘The Post Office and Royal Mail will continue to work closely together. Each company needs the other. Post offices carried out over 3 billion mail transactions for Royal Mail last year. The two companies are closely linked in the public mind, and are bound together by an overwhelming commercial imperative. There is currently a long-term contract in place between the two companies, and there will continue to be a long-term commercial contract in place. The chief executive of Royal Mail has said that it would be “unthinkable” that there will not always be a strong relationship between the Post Office and Royal Mail.’&#xa0;4.4 The Post Office is clear that mails services remain a very important part of our business.   Paula Vennells, Post Office Limited, Chief Executive says ‘we are absolutely committed to our relationship with Royal Mail which is demonstrated by the 10 year agreement that we have in place’. Indeed we have been working closely with Royal Mail to develop new products including UK’s largest ‘click and collect’ network, which will ensure that both businesses are well placed to benefit from the rapidly growing parcels market, which is at the centre of Royal Mail’s growth strategy. &#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government’s actions to strengthen Royal Mail’s future and enable access to private capital are designed to assist Royal Mail in maintaining and developing its market and services. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The background context for Post Office Limited includes – &#xa0;&#xa0;5.3 The provision of mails services on behalf of Royal Mail is a key element of the Post Office business and the conditions are in place to ensure that this remains the case. It is important to Post Office Limited to have a strong Royal Mail as that can only assist our business and support the nationwide network of Post Office branches.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; BIS, Securing The Post Office Network in the Digital Age, November 2010, p. 3-6, link Hansard, Postal Services Public Bill Committee, 9 November 2010, col. 18, link Hansard, 12 January 2011, col. 355, link Vince Cable MP, Hansard, 27 October 2010, cols 354 – 355, link The Post Office press release, 30 May 2013, link
