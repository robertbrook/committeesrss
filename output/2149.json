"&#xa0;\nSarah Simmonds – Written evidence&#xa0;I am writing to support the proposals of the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) to add provisions to the Bill.  The Friends of the Ridgeway have submitted a letter pointing out the additional protection proposed for National Parks and AONBs should be extended to World Heritage Sites.  The \nAvebury\n half of the Stonehenge and \nAvebury\n World Heritage Site lies within the North Wessex Downs AONB but the Stonehenge landscape \ndoes\n not.  \n&#xa0;\nThe UK, as a signatory to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO, 1972) is obliged to protect and conserve the Site’s significance or outstanding universal value (OUV) and appropriately present and transmit this to future generations. \nThe\n extra protection \nc\nould be most welcome in assisting us in part\n with\n this role\n in the Stonehenge and \nAvebury\n World Heritage Site\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe \nUNESCO \nStatement of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV) outlines the reasons for the Site’s inscription on the WHS and acts as a guide to what we need to protect and how this will be achieved. The SOUV underlines the fact that “\nr\noads and vehicles also cause damage to the fabric of some monuments while traffic noise and visual intrusion have a negative impact on their settings.”  \n&#xa0;\nThe\n most recent Stonehenge \nand \nAvebury\n World Heritage Site Condition Survey (Wessex Archaeology, 2010) points to evidence of damage by off road vehicles.\n  In the \nAvebury\n half of the World Heritage Site, “d\namage from the use of a monument as a \nrouteway\n was recorded on the \nHerepath\n and The Ridgeway. The condition of these latter routes are both of considerable concern, as\n \nboth are suffering from their on-going use by vehicles, including recreational\n \noff-road vehicles and quad bikes. It is recommended that \nefforts are made to\n \nrestrict traffic using these routes and that remedial action be taken to stabilise\n \nthe worst of the erosion caused.”  The survey indicates similar problems in the Stonehenge\n half of \nthe World Heritage Site where there are 31 instances of ongoing impacts of vehicle damage.\n \nD\namage on BOATS account for nearly \n20% of all vehicle impacts within the Stonehenge area but represent 50% of the most severe level of vehicles damage. \nPolicy 5c of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site Management Plan (2009) states that \nvehicular access to Byways within the World Heritage Site should be restricted apart from access for emergency, operational and farm vehicles.\n   \nObjective T of the \nAvebury\n World Heritage Site (2005) aims to \nprevent increasing physical damage caused to monuments and public rights of way by the impact of visitor pressure,\n and \nrestore\n \nthe areas significantly affected.\n&#xa0;\nShould the PDGLA provisions be enacted, it would be most beneficial if they could be extended to encompass the Stonehenge and \nAvebury\n World Heritage Site.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSarah \nSimmonds\nAvebury\n World Heritage Site Officer\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
