[normal]TUC – Supplementary written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Draft Deregulation Bill [bold]Thank you again for inviting me to give evidence on the above Bill on 21 October 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At that session I was asked to provide further information on the extent of bogus self employment in the construction industry. In this regard I draw the Committee’s attention to two reports:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mark Harvey and Felix 
[normal]Behling
[normal] (2008) 
[normal]The Evasion Economy: False Self-employment in the UK construction industry 
[normal]available at
[normal] 
[normal]http://ucatt.infobo.co.uk/files/publications/UCATT%20Report%20Evasion%20Economy.pdf
[normal]. See especially chapter 2.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DWP (July 2009) 
[normal]One Death is too 
[normal]Many
[normal]: Inquiry into the Underlying causes of construction fatal accidents,
[normal] available at: 
[normal]http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/one-death-is-too-many.pdf
[normal]. See especially paragraphs 89 to 101. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Harvey and 
[normal]Behling
[normal] report estimated at page 23 that some 400,000 workers in the construction industry are in false self-employment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further, I would also like to draw the Committee’s attention to the TUC position on apprenticeships as it arises under the Bill, (but which was not a part of the evidence session). On the issue, the TUC believes that training for apprenticeships should reflect the longer term needs of the apprentice, employer and industry as well as employee rights and responsibilities. Such standards should therefore be drawn up in full consultation with all the key 
[normal]partners
[normal] including employers, unions, providers and the government, through industrial partnerships where appropriate. Similarly, the OECD has recommended that the UK adopt a model of social partnership with regard to apprenticeships, which already exists across much of Europe and was called for in the Richard Review of Apprenticeships. Specifically, the Richard Review says: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]the
[normal] Government could set up and facilitate a panel, with representatives from industry, trade unions and further education to assess which are the best standards, according to Government criteria. This could have some similarities with model used in Scotland to approve new and revised Modern Apprenticeship frameworks. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is done by the Modern Apprenticeship Group, which brings together partners from Government Departments, employer representative bodies, trade unions and other organisations to review frameworks.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this further information is of assistance.
