[normal]Dear Ms Salmon Percival
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance has asked me as Chairman of the Arncliffe Parish meeting and personally to write regarding the forthcoming Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With these sorts of Bills, clauses can get added which get lost in all the jargon.  These lanes should be preserved in perpetuity and ask 
[normal]that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as 
[normal]NOT
[normal] being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways
[normal],
[normal] to be a clause in the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These Green Lanes are very much part of our heritage and were originally made for means of access between Parishes and remain so for those on foot, horse or pedal cycle.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sheila Foster
[normal]Chairman, Arncliffe Parish
