defaultDear Ms Salmon Percival
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance has asked me as Chairman of the Arncliffe Parish meeting and personally to write regarding the forthcoming Deregulation Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith these sorts of Bills, clauses can get added which get lost in all the jargon.  These lanes should be preserved in perpetuity and ask 
defaultthat all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as 
defaultNOT
default being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways
default,
default to be a clause in the Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese Green Lanes are very much part of our heritage and were originally made for means of access between Parishes and remain so for those on foot, horse or pedal cycle.
