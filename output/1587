[normal]The Energy Technologies Institute (ETI), a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering firms and the UK Government, believes 
[normal]that 
[normal]CCS
[normal] 
[normal]will be
[normal] 
[normal]a critical part of an
[normal]y
[normal] affordable, secure and sustainable
[normal] low carbon
[normal] 
[normal]UK 
[normal]energy system in the 
[normal]future.
[normal] 
[normal] However, it is important that the right steps are taken to ensure the cost of carbon reductions are affordable in the context of sustaining UK economic growth and industrial development.
[normal]CCS 
[normal]may be the single, most cost effective lever for reducin
[normal]g UK greenhouse gas emissions.
[normal]  
[normal]Its potential
[normal], because of its flexibility of use,
[normal] extends beyond the electricity sector and is central to a national strategy to meet carbon targets cost-effectively
[normal] by
[normal]: 
[normal]ETI’s analysis of the UK energ
[normal]y system shows that deploying CCS to its full potential can reduce
[normal] the cost
[normal] of meeting carbon targets by up to 1% of GDP (
[normal]compared 
[normal]to the
[normal] 
[normal]costs if
[normal] no CCS were deployed)
[normal] – equivalent to
[normal] a saving of around £1000 on average household bills for energy and transport costs in 2050.  These savings arise because spending on more expensive alternatives for cutting emissions 
[normal]would be
[normal] avoided
[normal].
[normal]The key technologies 
[normal]needed
[normal] to deploy CCS (CO
[normal]2
[normal] capture
[normal], compression, pipelines and geological injection
[normal] and storage
[normal]) have been successfully applied in a range of contexts.  T
[normal]he
[normal] next step is to assemble and deploy these proven components at scale in a number of full chain projects.  
[normal]We believe the
[normal] technical ch
[normal]allenges are surmountable in engineering terms, but require the strategic will and investment to de
[normal]-
[normal]risk, drive down costs and 
[normal]build a network of
[normal] CO
[normal]2
[normal] transport and storage infrastructure.
[normal]CCS will require upfront investment 
[normal]to create
[normal] strategic infrastructu
[normal]re and prov
[normal]e
[normal] storage sites, so the costs for early projects are likely to be h
[normal]igh when measured on a simple £ 
[normal]per
[normal] 
[normal]MWh basis.  
[normal]T
[normal]his does not mean CCS is uncompetitive.  
[normal]Our
[normal] work suggests that net benefits (in terms of savings 
[normal]compared to implementing 
[normal]more e
[normal]xpensive alternative
[normal]s
[normal]) start to flow by the late 2020s, if the UK deploys CCS effectively.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our work shows that the 
[normal]total investment out to 2050 is estimated at around £60 to £80 billion on capture, 
[normal]transportation, storage
[normal] plant and infrastructure.  This s
[normal]cale of investment is significant, but deliverable within a supportive policy environment, and would quickly start to yield returns, in the form of avoided decarbonisation costs
[normal], 
[normal]job creation and safeguarding 
[normal]the position 
[normal]of key industries in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t 
[normal]is 
[normal]challenging to deploy 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]in a market economy.  It requires large scale investment
[normal] in complex new value chains
[normal], the returns on which are entirely
[normal] 
[normal]dependent
[normal] on 
[normal]long term 
[normal]policy 
[normal]certainty.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Attracting
[normal] the
[normal] private investment 
[normal]needed to
[normal] develop
[normal] 
[normal]the sector 
[normal]will depend on 
[normal]creati
[normal]ng
[normal] confidence that it will command strategic support from policy-makers
[normal].
[normal]There are three
[normal] fundamental approaches to captur
[normal]ing
[normal] CO
[normal]2
[normal] from fossil-fuelled power generation: 
[normal]We believe IGCC has 
[normal]significant
[normal] potential
[normal] 
[normal]for the future
[normal], because of its performance and the opportunity to produce hydrogen as an energy vector.
[normal]C[bold]ompression[bold] and 
[normal]transport[bold] of CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]represents relatively mature technology, with significant experience in Enhanced Oil Recovery applications i
[normal]n North America.  
[normal]Storage[bold] in a UK setting will be 
[normal]offshore 
[normal]in 
[normal]depleted oil and gas reservoirs 
[normal]and 
[normal]saline aquifers.  
[normal]Significant work is required to fully appraise storage sites before CO
[normal]2
[normal] storage takes place
[normal].  
[normal]ETI has 
[normal]completed an assessment of UK storage
[normal] appraisal prospects
[normal] and the results of this are 
[normal]now available under license from the Crown Estate and BGS
[normal] – at 
[normal]www.CO2Stored.co.uk
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] ETI have 
[normal]also co-funded 
[normal]the UK’s first
[normal] 
[normal]saline aquifer appraisal drilling 
[normal]project with National Grid.
[normal]ETI ha
[normal]ve
[normal] announced over £50m of CCS
[normal] technology
[normal] projects
[normal].
[normal]  In addition to the 
[normal]four
[normal] mentioned above 
[normal]we 
[normal]are investing 
[normal]in 
[normal]development of measurement, monitoring and verification techniques for 
[normal]offshore storage sites and 
[normal]desk top too
[normal]ls and studies for assessing and designing CCS systems.
[normal]ETI has
[normal] 
[normal]created a
[normal]n internationally peer reviewed
[normal] 
[normal]modelling c
[normal]apability for the UK energy system 
[normal]known as ESME 
[normal]– the Energy System Modelling Environment
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] This allows us to model the UK’s pathway to decarbonisation 
[normal]by 2050 
[normal]under a range of scenarios, taking 
[normal]into 
[normal]account the underlying costs, engineering properties an
[normal]d inter-dependencies of key energy technologies. 
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]work robustly demonstrates that taking a system-wide approach substantially reduces the economic cost of decarbonisation. 
[normal]Our
[normal] 
[normal]modelling points to a critical role for 
[normal]CCS
[normal] 
[normal]both within and outside the el
[normal]ectricity sector. 
[normal] 
[normal]It suggests that if we do not successfully develop CCS in the UK, the annual cost of meeting carbon targets is likely to increase by over 1% of GDP by 2050. 
[normal] I
[normal]t also highlights the potential economic benefit of applying CCS in combinatio
[normal]n with biomass, as a means of generating negative carbon emissions. 
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]would
[normal] mak
[normal]e
[normal] it possible to meet carbon budgets and continue using fossil fuels in some applications where low carbon alternatives are particularly costl
[normal]y
[normal]. 
[normal]A coherent strategy for developing CCS 
[normal]means
[normal] taking account of the costs and benefits across the entire energy sector
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he electricity sector 
[normal]is the
[normal] obvious starting point for developing CCS, as it is least exposed to international trade, can demonstrate 
[normal]and de
[normal]-
[normal]risk the full value chain at scale and through EMR has a reward mechanism available. However
[normal], our
[normal] work also points clearly to t
[normal]he longer term importance of CCS 
[normal]in industrial and biomass applications
[normal] – where it is possible to maximise the impact of r
[normal]esources by taking account of these broader decarbonisation benefits in decisions on contract pricing, allocation and contract design
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] substantial reduction in the cost of the 
[normal]overall 
[normal]national energy system
[normal] (1% of GDP by 2050)
[normal] is likely to be the most important benefit to the UK economy
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Spending on energy currently represents about 9% of 
[normal]GDP.  
[normal]Containing th
[normal]is cost burden
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]both industry and consumers
[normal] 
[normal]by deploying 
[normal]CCS to
[normal] deliver low carbon energy 
[normal]cost-
[normal]effectively, 
[normal]would have a major impact on national economic competitiveness
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]h
[normal]elp to generate and safeguard jobs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]We have
[normal] commission
[normal]ed
[normal] work to assess the scale of the 
[normal]wider 
[normal]economic benefits associated with deployment of CCS.  
[normal] 
[normal]A number of studies have also assessed the direct economic impact of CCS projects, on regional employment and value added, often in challenged regional economies
[normal].  The creation of a significant new CCS sector would create new employment opportunities and enable the UK to build exportable skills
[normal] (e.g. particularly in established strengths such as process and offshore engineering)
[normal] and expertise relevant to an emergi
[normal]ng global CCS industry.  The CCS T

[normal]inno
[normal]vation in CCS can help create a UK industry with the potential to contribute further economic value of £3-16bn to
[normal] 2050.
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]development of CCS could 
[normal]also 
[normal]prolong the life of UK oil fields, through the application of captured CO
[normal]2
[normal] in enhanced oil recovery
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]there could be 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential to re-use some 
[normal]existing North Sea oil and gas infrastructure (e.g. platforms or pi
[normal]pelines) enabling
[normal] a
[normal] significant deferral of expensive decommissioning obligations
[normal].  
[normal]Our initial estimates show there is 
[normal]enough storage capacity under UK waters to offer 
[normal]the potential to provide storage not just for the UK but for other European countries 
[normal]without a similar resource.  
[normal]CCS 
[normal]also 
[normal]offers the only route to directly address emissions from 
[normal]some key high emitting 
[normal]indust
[normal]ries
[normal] which would help
[normal] 
[normal]the UK remain an attractive location and maintain employment in industrial sectors 
[normal]such as
[normal] 
[normal]refining, in futur
[normal]e decades, as carbon prices become a growing part of their cost base.
[normal]CCS offers 
[normal]a 
[normal]unique potential to enable a genuinely economically viable transition to a low carbon economy.  But its strategic characteristics 
[normal](large-scale, complex new value chains, dependence on policy for returns
[normal], its cost str
[normal]ucture with
[normal] economies of scale and scope
[normal], and the long-term nature of risks and liabilities
[normal]) 
[normal]mean there are a range of ba
[normal]rriers and challenges that 
[normal]need to be overcome.  
[normal]These include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are safety issues 
[normal]associated
[normal] 
[normal]with any form of pressurised gas system and 
[normal]CCS
[normal] is no different
[normal].
[normal]These safety issues can in part 
[normal]be reduced 
[normal]through site selection.  Offshore storage of CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]minimises
[normal] the impact of any leakage from a store or the 
[normal]offshore 
[normal]pipeline and the select
[normal]ion of onshore pipeline routes needs to consider the potential impact of a containment failure. 
[normal]The plant and pipeline operators should be responsible for the safety of their operation which should be subject to regulation and planning approvals.
[normal]In Norway and Algeria
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]CCS
[normal] has been applied to high CO
[normal]2
[normal] gas field developments for many years and similar projects are 
[normal]under developme
[normal]nt elsewhere
[normal],
[normal] including the Gorgon 
[normal]gas field
[normal] 
[normal]in Australia.  These developments are typically mandated by the field development plan approval process, either by the operating companies own standards or 
[normal]national or 
[normal]state
[normal] 
[normal]legislation.  
[normal]CCS has also played an
[normal] integral role in onshore Enhanced Oil Recovery 
[normal](EOR) 
[normal]in the US
[normal]A.
[normal]   
[normal]Other
[normal] 
[normal]countries are developing technologies and purs
[normal]u
[normal]ing commercial scale demonstration of CCS in the power 
[normal]and industrial 
[normal]sector
[normal]s
[normal].  None are yet operational, although the Boundary Dam
[normal] project 
[normal]in Canada 
[normal]is nearing completion
[normal].  
[normal]China has committed to cutting the carbon intensity of its economy and has launched an experimental, cap-and-trade pilot program
[normal]me
[normal].  Recent press coverage suggests that China may commit to cap its emissions by 201
[normal]6, which would represent a major escalation of commitment, and the government has ordered firms in heavy-polluting industries to cut emissions by 30% by 2017.  In April 2013, the National Development and Reform Commission
[normal] 
[normal]detail
[normal]ed
[normal] the way in which China wo
[normal]uld promote CCS pilot and demonstration program
[normal]me
[normal]s
[normal] as an 
[normal]important task in 
[normal]China’s
[normal] 12th Five–Year greenhouse gas control plan. 
[normal]The CCS Roadmap
[normal] set out at a high level the steps needed to enable CCS deployment in the UK.  However
[normal],
[normal] there have been delays in delivering the roadmap, notably in the CCS Commercialisation programme.  
[normal]ETI’s 
[normal]work on 
[normal]private sector 
[normal]financing suggest there is considerable 
[normal]scepticism about the UK’s long term commitment to carbon targets.  Industry and investors are looking to
[normal]wards
[normal] Government to demonstrate
[normal] a
[normal] long term commitment to CCS and to provide further details of how it will do 
[normal]so
[normal].  
[normal]Emerging economies are likely to remain dependent on fossil fuels use for decades to come, and CCS is vital to enable 
[normal]these
[normal] economies to continue to grow
[normal] while containing emissions. 
[normal]T
[normal]he International Energy Agency highlighted the importance of CCS
[normal] in
[normal] 
[normal]its Energy Technology Perspectives 2012
[normal] when
[normal] 
[normal]it
[normal] stated that “CCS is the only technology on the horizon today that would allow industrial sectors (such as iron and steel, cement and natural gas processing) to meet deep emissions reduction goals.”
[normal]The UK is particularly well-placed to play a leading role
[normal] in develop
[normal]ing
[normal] CCS 
[normal]due to
[normal]:
[normal]ETI 
[normal]modelling
[normal] 
[normal]suggests that if CCS 
[normal]is not successfully developed 
[normal]in the UK, the annual cost of meeting carbon targets is likely to increase by 
[normal]1%
[normal] of GDP by 2050.  
[normal]This impact is felt across all sectors.
[normal]Our modelling suggests that:
[normal]In the transport sector[bold] this will require the abolition of liquid fuels and 
[normal]replacing the
[normal] entire car fleet 
[normal]with zero
[normal] carbon vehicles
[normal] (electric and hydrogen)
[normal], which would 
[normal]be extremely
[normal] costly and difficult.  
[normal]With CCS
[normal] introduced
[normal], approximately half the fleet could remain liquid fuelled
[normal] with the remainder plug-in hybrid
[normal], with increasing efficiencies and use of biofuel blends.
[normal]  Infrastructure investments would be 
[normal]more limited and also incr
[normal]emental,
[normal] as the transition progresses.
[normal]  
[normal]In the buildings sector[bold] no gas w
[normal]ould
[normal] be permissible for home heating and all buildings w
[normal]ould
[normal] need to be retrofitted with zero carbon t
[normal]echnologies such as heat pumps,
[normal] 
[normal]district heating 
[normal](but not gas fired) 
[normal]or biomass boilers.  
[normal]W
[normal]ith CCS, gas boilers could be retained in difficult to retrofit houses
[normal],
[normal] or for use in retrofitted houses during peak demand periods during cold weather snaps and 
[normal]if the
[normal] electricity supply is reduced due to intermittency of renewables
[normal].
[normal]The impact in both the buildings and transport sector
[normal] would
[normal] increase the peak demand for 
[normal]electricity [bold]sharply
[normal] and t
[normal]his increase
[normal] 
[normal]would have to be 
[normal]met from a combination of nuclear and renewables.  Because of the intermittency of renewables
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the possibil
[normal]ity
[normal] that peak demand from both the buildings and transport sectors coincides with low supply from renewables
[normal],
[normal] considerable back up supply 
[normal]would be
[normal] needed.  Overall, the impact on the electricity sector is that 
[normal]without CCS 
[normal]the 
[normal]required 
[normal]total installed 
[normal]UK ge
[normal]neration 
[normal]capacity is 
[normal]increased by 
[normal]more than 
[normal]50%
[normal] higher.
