defaultThe Energy Technologies Institute (ETI), a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering firms and the UK Government, believes 
defaultthat 
defaultCCS
default 
defaultwill be
default 
defaulta critical part of an
defaulty
default affordable, secure and sustainable
default low carbon
default 
defaultUK 
defaultenergy system in the 
defaultfuture.
default 
default However, it is important that the right steps are taken to ensure the cost of carbon reductions are affordable in the context of sustaining UK economic growth and industrial development.
defaultCCS 
defaultmay be the single, most cost effective lever for reducin
defaultg UK greenhouse gas emissions.
default  
defaultIts potential
default, because of its flexibility of use,
default extends beyond the electricity sector and is central to a national strategy to meet carbon targets cost-effectively
default by
default: 
defaultETI’s analysis of the UK energ
defaulty system shows that deploying CCS to its full potential can reduce
default the cost
default of meeting carbon targets by up to 1% of GDP (
defaultcompared 
defaultto the
default 
defaultcosts if
default no CCS were deployed)
default – equivalent to
default a saving of around £1000 on average household bills for energy and transport costs in 2050.  These savings arise because spending on more expensive alternatives for cutting emissions 
defaultwould be
default avoided
default.
defaultThe key technologies 
defaultneeded
default to deploy CCS (CO
default2
default capture
default, compression, pipelines and geological injection
default and storage
default) have been successfully applied in a range of contexts.  T
defaulthe
default next step is to assemble and deploy these proven components at scale in a number of full chain projects.  
defaultWe believe the
default technical ch
defaultallenges are surmountable in engineering terms, but require the strategic will and investment to de
default-
defaultrisk, drive down costs and 
defaultbuild a network of
default CO
default2
default transport and storage infrastructure.
defaultCCS will require upfront investment 
defaultto create
default strategic infrastructu
defaultre and prov
defaulte
default storage sites, so the costs for early projects are likely to be h
defaultigh when measured on a simple £ 
defaultper
default 
defaultMWh basis.  
defaultT
defaulthis does not mean CCS is uncompetitive.  
defaultOur
default work suggests that net benefits (in terms of savings 
defaultcompared to implementing 
defaultmore e
defaultxpensive alternative
defaults
default) start to flow by the late 2020s, if the UK deploys CCS effectively.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur work shows that the 
defaulttotal investment out to 2050 is estimated at around £60 to £80 billion on capture, 
defaulttransportation, storage
default plant and infrastructure.  This s
defaultcale of investment is significant, but deliverable within a supportive policy environment, and would quickly start to yield returns, in the form of avoided decarbonisation costs

defaultThese include:

defaultThere are safety issues

defaultCCS
default is no different
default.
defaultThese safety issues can in part 
defaultbe reduced

defaultThe CCS Roadmap
default set out at a high level the steps needed to enable CCS deployment in the UK.  However
default,
default there have been delays in delivering the roadmap, notably in the CCS Commercialisation programme.  
defaultETI’s 
defaultwork on 
defaultprivate sector 
defaultfinancing suggest there is considerable 
defaultscepticism about the UK’s long term commitment to carbon targets.  Industry and investors are looking to
defaultwards
default Government to demonstrate
default a
default long term commitment to CCS and to provide further details of how it will do 
defaultso
default.  
defaultEmerging economies are likely to remain dependent on fossil fuels use for decades to come, and CCS is vital to enable 
defaultthese
default economies to continue to grow
default while containing emissions. 
defaultT
defaulthe International Energy Agency highlighted the importance of CCS
default in
default 
defaultits Energy Technology Perspectives 2012
default when
default 
defaultit
default stated that “CCS is the only technology on the horizon today that would allow industrial sectors (such as iron and steel, cement and natural gas processing) to meet deep emissions reduction goals.”
defaultThe UK is particularly well-placed to play a leading role
default in develop
defaulting
default CCS 
defaultdue to
default:
defaultETI 
defaultmodelling
default 
defaultsuggests that if CCS 
defaultis not successfully developed 
defaultin the UK, the annual cost of meeting carbon targets is likely to increase by 
default1%
default of GDP by 2050.  
defaultThis impact is felt across all sectors.
defaultOur modelling suggests that:
defaultIn the transport sectordefault this will require the abolition of liquid fuels and 
defaultreplacing the
default entire car fleet 
defaultwith zero
default carbon vehicles
default (electric and hydrogen)
default, which would 
defaultbe extremely
default costly and difficult.  
defaultWith CCS
default introduced
default, approximately half the fleet could remain liquid fuelled
default with the remainder plug-in hybrid
default, with increasing efficiencies and use of biofuel blends.
default  Infrastructure investments would be 
defaultmore limited and also incr
defaultemental,
default as the transition progresses.
default  
defaultIn the buildings sectordefault no gas w
defaultould
default be permissible for home heating and all buildings w
defaultould
default need to be retrofitted with zero carbon t
defaultechnologies such as heat pumps,
default 
defaultdistrict heating 
default(but not gas fired) 
defaultor biomass boilers.  
defaultW
defaultith CCS, gas boilers could be retained in difficult to retrofit houses
default,
default or for use in retrofitted houses during peak demand periods during cold weather snaps and 
defaultif the
default electricity supply is reduced due to intermittency of renewables
default.
defaultThe impact in both the buildings and transport sector
default would
default increase the peak demand for 
defaultelectricity defaultsharply
default and t
defaulthis increase
default 
defaultwould have to be

default,
default and 
defaultthe possibil
defaultity
default that peak demand from both the buildings and transport sectors coincides with low supply from renewables
default,
default considerable back up supply 
defaultwould be
default needed.  Overall, the impact on the electricity sector is that
