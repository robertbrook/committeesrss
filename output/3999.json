There is a \n93\n per cent\n participation rate of eligible members\n. The current \nfunding level \nis around \n90\n per cent\n.\n&#xa0;2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFIDUCIARY DUTIES&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fund’s \nfiduciary responsibility \nis to act \nin the best \ninterest of its members. T\nhe Fund \nmanagement \nrecognises that financially material environmental issues, e.g. climate change\n,\n can adversely impact on the Fund's financial risks and investment returns and thus should be taken into account in the investment strategy. Accordingly, the Fund has integrated the consideration of environmental, social and governance \n(ESG) \nissues throughout the funding and investment decision making process.\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nENABLING FINANCIALLY ROBUST RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEarly on we identified a need to be clear about our approach and what would enable us to both have quality financial returns and be confident \nthe Fund takes proper account of ESG issues.\n We became the first Local Government Pension Scheme signatory of the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment (UNPRI).  The principles reflect the view that ESG issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios and therefore must be given appropriate consideration by investors if they are to fulfil their fiduciary duty.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefore we must:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStrategic asset allocation3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe undertake a triennial valuation of our liabilities and review the investment strategy in response to that review.  In 2010 we partnered with other asset owners globally, as part of the Mercer-led research, considering the implications of climate change scenarios on strategic asset allocation. We integrated the findings into our own review of our strategic asset allocation to inform the development of a robust portfolio, where the investment strategy is positioned to reduce risk and maximise investment opportunities presented by climate change.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn April 2013 we allocated £250 million investment \nfor \nreal assets covering real estate, infrastructure, forestry and agricultural land to Townsend group.  The mandate\n place\ns\n a high priority on long term responsible investment\ns\n that me\ne\nt our financial targets.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are currently engaging with the market on sustainable equities with a view to go out to tender toward the end of the year.\n&#xa0;\nInvestment strategy design3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur Pension Committee \nhas \nadopted a more flexible approach to the Active Fund future investment strategy and asset allocation so that we can respond responsibly and robustly to both the changing global economic environment and impacts of climate change. \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have set a target that \nby 2015 some 25\n per cent \nof the fund will be invested in sustainable and green economy\n activities\n.  \nAs at 31 March 2013, \n13\n per cent of the fund was invested in \ncompanies which are principally engaged in the field of alternative energy\n,\n with an additional 10 per cent in \nbroader\n, but strongly sustainably\n themed investments\n, giving a\n total \nof \n23\n per cent\n.  \n&#xa0;\nFund manager selection3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012, w\ne recognised that our increased allocation to emerging markets \nto maximise the returns to the fund, \nwould increase the ESG \nrisk \nprofile of the fund.  In designing the investment mandate\n,\n it was critical to find a manager with strong ESG credentials to manage\n these risks\n \neffective\nly.  The quality of ESG\n integration formed 25% of the selection criteria for the manager selection.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ability of managers to comply with \nour policies on Responsible Investment and our Environmental Overlay Strategy\n is assessed as part of the appointment process. The environmental assessment criteria include the relative quality, integration and impact of environmental research and information in external managers’ investment management and performance reporting\n processes.\n&#xa0;\nFund manager monitoring and reporting3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur fund managers are also expected to assess the impact of any financially material \nESG \nissues\n \nin relation to future prospects of investee companies\n or debt\n, and to take this into account in their decision-making processes. When appropriate, such issues should also be addressed in our managers’ regular contact and engagement with the senior executives of companies in which the Fund’s assets are invested.\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEach fund manager is required to submit a quarterly compliance report to outline any \nESG\n considerations or analysis that have arisen, and to explain any controversial investments, as well as any engagement and voting on \nESG\n issues that it has conducted with investee companies. Each active equity and bond manager is also required to assist the Environment Agency in assessing the annual environmental footprint of the Fund\n.\n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRISK MANAGEMENT AND MOINITORING&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnvironmental and carbon foot\nprinting of the active equities and bonds looks at companies’ environmental impacts\n. F\nor example, how efficient they \nare \nin the amount of raw materials, water and energy used, the waste produced and carbon emitted.  The footprint for each equity manager, in relation to the Fund, is compiled by allocating a proportion of the environmental impact of each company, relative to the amount of stock that is held. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly, we have evaluated the environmental impact of our combined active\nly managed\n equity holdings compared to the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI)\n \nfor 2013\n. This is \nthe \nstock market index\n maintained by \nMSCI Inc.\n \n(\nformerly Morgan Stanley Capital International\n)\n that \nincorporates both developed and emerging countries\n.\n \nHistorically the benchmark was MSCI World Developed Countries Index but as a result of the changes to our investment strategy, most notably a significant increase in our exposure to emerging markets, we have changed the benchmark for 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Fund's environmental footprint for combined active\nly managed \nequities was 4.7 per cent more efficient than the benchmark and the Fund’s carbon footprint was 26\n \nper cent more efficient than the benchmark on 31 March 2013. Our \noverall footprint for actively managed \nequities \nbeen reduced \nby 39 per cent since 2008.  \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor active UK bonds the portfolio was 42 per cent (\ne\nnvironment) and 51 per cent (\nc\narbon) more efficient than the IBOXX benchmark, the\n \nbond market indices\n comprising liquid investment grade bond issues\n.  \n&#xa0;5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWORKING WITH OTHERS&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n will normally act through partnerships and alliances with other institutional pension funds, shareholder bodies, and asset owner organisation\ns, but we reserve the right to act independently.\n This will include the UNPRI, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIF).  To further support the integration of environmental governance, we are \nsignatories to the Investor Statement on Climate Change, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and its sister projects, the Water Disclosure Project (WDP) and the Forestry Footprint Disclosure Project (FFDP).\n&#xa0;\n6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nREPORTING AND DISCLOSURE&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe publish regular updates on voting and engagement, research reports and articles on our website \nwww.EAPF.org.uk.  Each year we publish a summary of our progress in implementing our responsible investment strategy in our annual report and accounts.   In 2012 we published our second Responsible Investment review, providing a comprehensive detailed of how we have implemented \nResponsible I\nnvestment across all the asset classes.  \n&#xa0;\n7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNEXT STEPS&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Fund officers continue to research and \nanalyse responsible i\nnvestment approaches to ensure our approach to \nESG\n issues remains in the best financial interest of Fund members. Currently, officers are undertaking a full analysis of the fund in terms of climate risk and this will be a key area for communication with members and other stakeholders. We expect to publish this work in early 2014. This, alongside the recommendations in the Green Light Report\n:\n resilient portfolios in an uncertain world  (produced by ShareAction and referred to by \nCatherine Howarth, Chief Executive of ShareAction\n during the Environmental Audit Committee session 12 November 2103),\n \nwill help inform the refresh of our responsible investment policies and processes. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013&#xa0;\n"
