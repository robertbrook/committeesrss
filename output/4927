defaultis grateful for the opportunity to respond to this 
defaultcall for ideas and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss our response in more detail

default&#xa0;
defaultCall for evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultDefining geographical areasdefault&#xa0;defaultThe views and evidence provided below is based on 
defaultlearndirect’sdefault experience as a national training and employment services provider delivering on a local level to meet the needs of employers, individuals and communities.
default 
default Through our contracts with a range of funding bodies at national and local level, we have successf
defaultully integrated employment and skills provision, improving the experience and outcomes 
defaultfor
default our customers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current local landscape for employment, skills and welfare services is too complex, 
defaultwith a plethora of agencies and organisations involved in the
default planning and delivery of services, often with conflicting priorities.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe different sub-regional geographical boundaries which are in existence can also be confusing for all parties involved in the delivery of services
default.  There is often overlap across 
defaultthe 
defaultboundaries 
defaultlisted below 
defaultwhich would benefit from being more aligned with a consistent approach to the commissioning of skills, employment and welfare services
default, for example
default:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA 
defaultsimplified structure, with a reduced number of different geographic boundaries
default 
defaultis needed.  Contract areas for commissioning purposes should be aligned to existing local boundaries such as Local 
defaultA
defaultuthorities o
defaultr
default Local Enterprise
default Partnerships, whether individual or clustered, as appropriate to factors such as population density etc.
default  This would encourage shared objectives and understanding of respective priorities.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA local default‘defaultvdefault’default national approachdefault&#xa0;
defaultlearndirect defaultsupports
default localisation which is essential if we are to meet the needs of local economies and local employers.  However, a pur
defaultely
default local approach can create barriers for large, national employers and service providers which span regional and sub-regional boundaries. 
default In 
defaultldefaultearndirect’s defaultexperience as a national training and welfare services provider
default,
default 
defaultlarge 
defaultnational organisations prefer to have a single point of contact.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recognise the importance of local programmes but only where they add value to the national program
defaultmes and where provision builds on best practice and lessons learnt, thus focusing valuable resources and funds on activity that will deliver their intended objectives. We would expect local commissioners to have adequate expertise, knowledge and capacity t
defaulto professionally conduct procurement exercises, and would argue for national support/partnerships in this regard.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAny local commissioning process must be fairly executed.  The commissioning body must be impartial, for example in Scotland a co-commission
defaulting process has been put in place where Employability Fund applications are scored nationally by Skills Development Scotland and then scored by the Community Planning Partnership.  However some members of this partnership are also provides, eg the Local Au
defaultthority and Colleges, therefore the scoring process is not truly impartial. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBased on 
defaultlearndirect’sdefault experience working at local level to meet local priorities, we are concerned about the 
defaultvarying
default capacity and expertise 
defaultwithin
default some LEPs and other local agen
defaultcies/partnerships to manage the commissioning processing
default and supply chain management
default, particularly 
defaultas the 
defaultcommissioning of public s
defaultervices is resource intensive.  All parties involved in the commissioning process would need to ensure they have 
defaultappropriately skilled, professional staff.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, c
defaultonsideration should be given to ensuring appropriate parity of access to essential services of a high quality to avoid 
defaultcreat
defaulting

defaultn unfair
default ‘postcode’ lottery as seen in the 
defaulthealth service

default for individuals, e
