"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from Unite the Union (HCS0008)&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe death of four offshore oil and gas workers returning from the Borgsten Dolphin platform\n,\n after their helicopter transfer ditched in the waters off the south Shetland coast on the evening of August 23\nrd\n 2013, provoked further questions into the safety o\nf helicopters serving offshore installations on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS).  \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the immediate aftermath of August’s tragedy Unite was inundated with the concerns expressed by our offshore membership regarding their confidence in the safety of the \nUK \noffshore oil and gas sector \nhelicopter fleet, specifically regarding the \nvarious \nSuper Puma types manufactured by the French firm Eurocopter. \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a direct\n response to this, Unite launched our ‘Back Home Safe’ campaign calling on Oil &amp; Gas UK (OGUK) to \naddress t\nhe \nlack of confidence in \nthe serving\n helicopter fleet\n through the implementation of the following demands: \n              \n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn conjunction, \nUnite \nalso \nconducted an extensive consultation with our membership a\nnd the wider offshore workforce; a \nsurvey of over \none thousand\n offshore oil and gas \nemployees (\nthe results of \nwhich will be \npresented in this submission) on the issue of helicopter safety.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough the extensive nature of our consultation we \nbelieve\n that our findings accurately reflect the concerns and views of offshore workers across \nthe UK offshore oil and gas sector \nwith regards to helicopter transfer safety. \n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result, \nUnite is \nvery clear\n that any \ndetailed \nreview of UK helicopter safety \n- particularly offshore helicopter commercial transfers - \nmust \nincorporate the views of the offshore workforce and we believe this submission should compel Committee Members to begin that process.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApproximately 75 helicopters serve the UKCS for offshore commercial transfer purposes with three main operators: Bond; Bristow; and CHC, collectively operating upwards of 50,000 flights a year. There are two key manufacturers providing helicopters to the i\nndustry; Eurocopter and Sikorsky. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Eurocopter Super Puma AS332 L type, AS332 L1 type, AS332 L2 type and EC225 type provide approximately 50 per cent of the service provision.  The remaining 50 per cent are Sikorsky S-92 type helicopters. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAugust’s di\ntching was the fifth such incident in four years and the death of four people raised the total number of fatalities to twenty, with sixteen people having perished off the Aberdeenshire coast in April 2009\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince February 2009 there have been five major incidents involving the transfer of offshore workers \nto or \nfrom installations in the UKCS: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur comparative offshore helicopter safety record with our North Sea neighbour Norway makes for unfavourable reading\n and t\nhe disparity in safety records between the UK and Norway is often cited by offshore \nworkers as a long-standing concern\n. This is more than justified.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the last decade, since 2002, the UK offshore oil and gas industry has suffered \n38 fatalities involving offshore helicopter transfers. There have been \nzero \nfatalities attributed to \noffshor\ne \nhelicopter transfers in Norway over the last decade with the last such incident in 1997, claiming 12 lives.\n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeading academics, like Andrew Watterson, Professor of Health Effectiveness at the University of Stirling, has suggested the Norwegian success c\nan be attributed to occupational health and safety structure laws developed in 2000, specifically the Norwegian \nWork Environment Act\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnite believes that in the wake of these recent fatalities and against the backdrop of the last decade\n \nthe industry\n should follow the Norwegian example,\n given the obvious environmental similarities due to its geographical proximity, \ndriven by the\n objective of \ncreating \na world leading safety record on offshore helicopter safety. \n \n&#xa0;\n2.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ‘Back Home Safe’ Campaign will act\n as a driver for this, amplifying the collective voice of Unite’s offshore members and also the wider workf\norce to ensure both industry and government does more to protect the industry’s most important asset – \nits\n people. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe sample3.1.1\n              \nOver 1,100 workers were interviewed representing a cross section of the offshore workforce. Responses were received from workers employed on over 100 different offshore installations.  \n3.1.2\n              \n62.1% of respondents were employed \non a permanent basis in the Oil &amp; G\nas Industry and\n 37.9% gave their employment status as ad-hoc, or non permanent.  \n3.1.3\n              \nRespondents\n had on average 12 years \nof employment\n in the industry.  Responders were both union members, 46.6% and non union members, \n53.4%. \n3.1.4\n              \nThe gender of those responding was not recorded. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe results3.2.1 \n              \nOverwhelmingly helicopters are the main mode of transport offshore,  99.1%. With the average number of flights undertaken annually \nper worker approximately \n28.6. The \nmajority fly less than 40 helicopter flights annually but a significant minority of workers fly more frequently with 188 workers taking over 40 flights annually.\n3.2.2\n              Two manufacturers, \nEurocopter and \nSikorsky, \nand \ntwo models of helicopter, Sikorsky S-92 \nand Eurocopter \nSuper Puma \nEC22\n5 dominiate the North Sea fleet – they \ncan accurately be described as the workhorses of the industry. \n3.3.3\n              When workers were asked, ‘\nWhich make and model of helicopter do you fly in most frequently?’ \nSikorsky S-92 was the st\nated by 57.0% of workers. The next most frequent response was Eurocopter EC225 42.7%. \nOther \nsignificant models and types stated were the Eurocopter AS 332 L1 &amp; L2 (7.1 &amp; 17.1%).\n3.3.              Worker confidence in offshore flights3.3.1\n              \nIn response to the \nquestion\n,\n ‘At the present moment how confident are you in the safety of offshore helicopter flight?’ over 45% stated they were not confident. This figure incresed to over 53% when those who did n\not give an opinion are excluded:\n3.3.2\n              \nWhen subsequently asked\n,\n ‘In the past 12 months has your level of confidence in helicopter flight offshore increased, decreased or stayed the same?’ \no\nver 77% of workers stated\n that their confidence had decreased. Less than 1% of the workforce said that\n their confidence had increased:\n3.3.3\n              \nWhen the confidence of workers is examined for each of the most commonly used \nhelicopters (\nTABLE 1). The results show significant different levels of confidence in each of the 5 most commonly flown in helicopters, (Sikorsky S-92s and Eurocopter EC225s, AS 332 L, L1s &amp; L2s). Workers have a higher level of confidence in the Sikorsky S\n-92s. It is only this make and model in which the number of workers confident is greater than the number of workers who are not confident, although even for the S-92s 41.1% are not confident. \nAt the present moment how confident are you in the safety of of\nfshore helicopter flight?\nTABLE 1Eurocopter EC225\nSikorsky S-92\nEurocopter AS 332L\nEurocopter AS 332L\n1\nEurocopter AS 332L\n2\nResponse Total\nVery confident\n2.2%\n3.1%\n2.9%\n3.9%\n2.2%\n2.9%\nConfident\n28.4%\n39.3%\n20.4%\n23.7%\n33.3%\n35.8%\nNo opinion\n14.4%\n16.5%\n11.7%\n10.5%\n15.6%\n16.0%\nNot confident\n54.9%\n41.1%\n65.0%\n61.8%\n48.9%\n45.3%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.4.              What changes do workers demand?3.4.1\n              \nWorkers were asked\n,\n ‘What actions they thought UK Oil &amp; Gas must now take to improve safety?’ \n \nThese questions involved changes \nworkers would like to see made to the helicopter fleet and als\no\n other methods for offshore transfers. Tellingly when asked about the use of both ships and fixed wing aircraft for offshore transfers a majority of the workforce did not support these options.\n (Transfers by ship 41.5%, transfers by fixed wing aircraft 46.6%). \n3.4.2\n              \nWhen asked about changes to the helicopter fleet the most popular demand from the workforce is for a larger offshore fleet , \nsupported by \n95.1% of workers, followed by c\nhanges to th\ne internal se\nat configuration of helicopters\n, \nsupported by \n92.9% of workers, followed by \nc\nhanges to the design of helicopters used for passenger transport offshore\n, supported by\n 92.2% of workers. \n3.4.3\n              \nThese three actions are futher demonstrated as being \nthe most important for the workforce as they were also the top three priorities when workers were asked to prioritise the actions that would\n improve offshore flight safety.\nWhat action(s) do you think the Oil &amp; Gas Industry must now take to improve offshor\ne safety?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the top 3 priorities for the Oil &amp; Gas Industry to improve offshore safety?\n (Highest priorities have the lowest number) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusions&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a direct result of this consultation \noffshore workers on installations throughout the UKCS are taking an active role and supporting the \n‘Back Home Safe’\n campaign.  \n&#xa0;4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnite strongly believes the issues highlighted by \nthe workers and the support for the four key demands emphasise \nthe \nlegitimate and genuine concerns among the workforce regarding \nthe safety of \nhelicopter transfers.  Both government and the wider industry have an obligation to address these concerns. \n&#xa0;4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nthe same vein, there should be no surprise in either the industry or in government to the responses received via our consultation \nas \nthese concerns have been growing and exacerbated with each major incident. \nThe problem is further compounded when workers l\nook at their Norwegian counterparts and compare the respective safety records. \n&#xa0;4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reality is that helicopter transfers are the most efficient, effective and in all likelihood, the safest means of commercial transfer to and from \noffshore installations. H\nowever, that does not mean that changes to improve these transfers ca\nnnot be undertaken immediately.\n&#xa0;4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe oil and gas industry is our growth sector for the next thirty years but it is also at a crossroads as we move into what the industry refers to as the next phase of the UKCS. This is emphasised in the recently published Wood Review Interim Report, which\n has recommended the fast-tracking of measures aimed at maximising the economic benefit of the remaining UK offshore capacity. \n&#xa0;4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, while the industry and government speed are at pains to maximise the remaining profits of the UKCS, this pursuit \nmust \nbe matched by an improved and robust health and safety agenda to protect the industry’s most important asset – its people. \n&#xa0;4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result, Unite urges the committee to take on board these initial findings from our Back Home Safe Campaign as a highly represe\nntative sample of opinion from across the UK oil and gas workforce and help to address these clear concerns\n with offshore helicopter safety with the utmost haste. \n&#xa0;December 201\n3\n8\n&#xa0;\n Sunday Herald, ‘Probe to compare UK safety record in North Sea with other countries’, 31\nst\n August 2013 \nhttp://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/probe-to-compare-uk-safety-record-in-north-sea-with-other-countries.22027761\n"
