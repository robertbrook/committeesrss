[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 RTPI Trustees consider that realistic CE salary to be important to attract
[normal] the best candidate to further the work of the Institute and Charity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 RTPI Trustees are well aware of their Charity requirements regarding making best use of money.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 CE salary levels should remain within the control of Trustees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]Evidence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 
[normal]T
[normal]he third sector is growing both in size and (in my view) influence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is increasingly being relied on to deliver core services on behalf of the public sector, is very active in research and is commissioned by the pri
[normal]vate sector to do work for it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Althou
[normal]gh they operate within charity law, charities are not these nice fluffy organisations like they maybe once were â€“ they are multi-million pound businesses operating in the charity sector which are massively important to the nation emotionally and to the eco
[normal]nomy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 The RTPI went through the process of appointing a new CE about 3
[normal] years ago and has therefore has
[normal] recent experience
[normal] to share
[normal]. The Trustees spent some 
[normal]considerable 
[normal]time consid
[normal]ering the type or candidate we
[normal] were looking for and the positioning of t
[normal]he Institute going forward. This work helped to define the search criteria and provided guidance to the 
[normal]Appointment
[normal] Panel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 The Trustees decided it was important for our CE to have profile, both as an individual but also in terms of the Institute. It w
[normal]as important that the new CE was able to work with the highest levels of government (both officials and politicians), business
[normal], across the UK and internationally and also relate to our wide membership base.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 The Trustees were well aware of the requirem
[normal]ent to provide a realistic salary which could attract such a candidate. Being based in London also has an impact on the cost of living and the need for an attractive overall package.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]We went through two recruitment exercises before being able to appoi
[normal]nt an excellent CE, Trudi Elliott CBE. Trudi came to us with experience of national, regional and local government. As the previous Director of the West Midlands Regional Office she had the necessary standing, contacts and profile we were looking for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal] While Trustees are well aware of their obligations and the need to ensure value for money they agreed that it was important for the Institute to be both realistic and flexible in its approach. It is important to have a 
[normal]well-
[normal]run Institute 
[normal]if we are to get 
[normal]maximum value (financial and social) out of what 
[normal]we
[normal] offer, and 
[normal]it is important that there should not be any
[normal] artificially constrain
[normal]t on
[normal] sala
[normal]ries if those donating and the T
[normal]rustees are 
[normal]content
[normal] they can justify the salaries they are paying.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7 
[normal]Salaries of
[normal] CEs are a deregulated matter for T
[normal]rustees
[normal] to consider taking into account their legal obligations.
[normal]&#xa0;
