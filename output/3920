default1.1 RTPI Trustees consider that realistic CE salary to be important to attract
default the best candidate to further the work of the Institute and Charity.

default1.2 RTPI Trustees are well aware of their Charity requirements regarding making best use of money.

defaultEvidence
default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultT
defaulthe third sector is growing both in size and (in my view) influence.
default&#xa0;
default It is increasingly being relied on to deliver core services on behalf of the public sector, is very active in research and is commissioned by the pri
defaultvate sector to do work for it.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthou
defaultgh they operate within charity law, charities are not these nice fluffy organisations like they maybe once were â€“ they are multi-million pound businesses operating in the charity sector which are massively important to the nation emotionally and to the eco
defaultnomy.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 The RTPI went through the process of appointing a new CE about 3
default years ago and has therefore has
default recent experience
default to share
default. The Trustees spent some 
defaultconsiderable 
defaulttime consid
defaultering the type or candidate we
default were looking for and the positioning of t
defaulthe Institute going forward. This work helped to define the search criteria and provided guidance to the 
defaultAppointment
default Panel.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 The Trustees decided it was important for our CE to have profile, both as an individual but also in terms of the Institute. It w
defaultas important that the new CE was able to work with the highest levels of government (both officials and politicians), business
default, across the UK and internationally and also relate to our wide membership base.
default&#xa0;
default2.4 The Trustees were well aware of the requirem
defaultent to provide a realistic salary which could attract such a candidate. Being based in London also has an impact on the cost of living and the need for an attractive overall package.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultWe went through two recruitment exercises before being able to appoi
defaultnt an excellent CE, Trudi Elliott CBE. Trudi came to us with experience of national, regional and local government. As the previous Director of the West Midlands Regional Office she had the necessary standing, contacts and profile we were looking for.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default While Trustees are well aware of their obligations and the need to ensure value for money they agreed that it was important for the Institute to be both realistic and flexible in its approach. It is important to have a 
defaultwell-
defaultrun Institute 
defaultif we are to get 
defaultmaximum value (financial and social) out of what 
defaultwe
default offer, and 
defaultit is important that there should not be any
default artificially constrain
defaultt on
default sala
defaultries if those donating and the T
defaultrustees are 
defaultcontent
default they can justify the salaries they are paying.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.7 
defaultSalaries of
default CEs are a deregulated matter for T
defaultrustees
default to consider taking into account their legal obligations.
