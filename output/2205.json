"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Sports Journalists’ Association [WAS0014]&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Submission1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe SJA was formed in 1948\n and \nthe first British sports awards were introduced in 1949, making them the oldest in Britain.\n  \nTen years later the sportswoman of the year a\nw\nard was added\n to that of sportsman of the year\n, in hindsight an avant garde decision \nto acknowledge sporting excellence no matter the gender.\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSports journalism \nhas traditionally\n been a predominantly male occupation, mainly because football, rugby\n, cricket\n, motor sport, boxing, \nracing, \ngolf \nwer\ne\n historically\n only \nplayed by men and, therefore, reported on by men.\n The perceived wisdom was that men read the sports pages and women \nwere simply not interested. \n \n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe membership of the SJA would have reflected thi\ns.\n \n There has only been one woman chairman – Pat Besford in 1976, who was also British Olympic press attaché for 11 years and president of the swimming commission of AIPS 1981-88.\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWomen’s sports were, in essence, school sports – netball, hockey, lacrosse\n,\n rounders\n.  Girls did not grow up wanting to be footballers; in fact they were not allowed\n by the FA\n to play football.\n&#xa0;\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, in sports where gender does not matter – tennis, swimming, athletics\n, \nequestrian\n events – there have always been elite sportsw\nomen. \nSome of these elite sportswomen turned to writing and broadcasting after they retired and can be regarded as the fore-runners of today’s generation of female sports journalists. \n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnita Lonsbrough\n, who won an Olympic gold in the 200m breaststroke in 1960, became the Daily Telegraph’s swimming correspondent. Baroness Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, who led England to victory in the inaugural women’s cricket World Cup, similarly wrote for the Telegraph while 1\n957 French Open champion Shirley Brasher reported on tennis for the Observer.\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhese remained niche sports and the coverage was largely restrict\ned to broadsheet newspapers, which\n had the space to devote column inches to “minority” sport.  The trio named ab\nove would not have been seen as trend-setting, but simply as former elite spo\nr\ntswomen \nand \nexperts in their own field.\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUntil the \n1970s it was unthinkable that a woman journalist would report on men’s sport. Football is Britain’s national game, \nand, as such\n, is probably a good\n barometer by which to measure the progress of women in sports journalism\n and compare it to media coverage of women’s sports today\n.  \n&#xa0;\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nForty-four years ago \nJulie Welch was a football fan and a journalist. She was also the first woman to\n write seriously about football\n, covering her first match for The Observer in 1969. She recalls that the opposition to her presence in the press box was so great that she was even assaulted with a chair by a male reporter.  In contrast, she was accepted by\n footballers and football managers.\n*\n&#xa0;\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 1980s saw the emergence of a few \nmore female sports \nprint \njournalists and there was a spell in the 1990s where nearly every paper employed one “token” woman\n, sometimes with little or no experience of reporting sp\nort. \nMs Welch’s sports editor at the time labelled them “the \nfluffies\n”\n \n—\n an accurate indication of how women were viewed in the sports department.\n*\n&#xa0;\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\nre\n \nwas, however, a small\n but committ\ned group of women who wished\n for no special treatment and who wante\nd to be judged purely on their journalistic ability. \n \nAnother of the forerunners was Sue Mott, who was working at the Sunday Times by the 1980s. \n&#xa0;\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShe recalls that she asked Julie Welch for advice and was told “wear a cap and swear a lot.” She was also \ninformed by a hugely influential football writer (male) at the time that women playing football was as unnatural as dogs walking around on their hind legs\n.*\n*\n&#xa0;\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom the mid 1990s onwards\n, \nthere were other national newspaper \nwriters; \nJanine Self (The Sun),\n \nVikki Orvice (The Sun), Alyson Rudd (The Times), Louise Taylor (Guardian), Amy Lawrence (Observer) were all press box regulars and accepted as such.\n \n&#xa0;\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nToday the membership of the Football Writers’ Association \n[FWA] \nis believed to be 4% female. There has n\never been a woman chief football correspondent.\n&#xa0;\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn tandem\n with the print industry, f\nemale voices were heard reporting \non football on \nBBC\n radio\n. Eleanor Oldroyd was the first woman to present Sports Report in 1995 and can talk knowledgeably about rugby, cr\nicket etc too, \nwhile Charlotte Nicol was \nsenior football producer\n for many years and is now a sought-after freelance.\n&#xa0;\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe tv breakthrough, helped by the launch of Sky, saw the likes of Gabby Logan (formerly Yorath), Kelly Cates (formerly Dalglish), Rebecc\na Lowe, Jill Douglas, Sonja McLaughlan, Clare Balding, Hazel Irvine, all emerge as top-notch sports presenters\n on terrestrial channels\n. \n&#xa0;\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe late Helen Rollason presented Grandstand. Football, c\nricket, rugby, motor racing\n, racing\n are\n no longer\n seen as\n an all-male preserve.  Women were being accepted, if still in the minority. Sue Mott believes the problem starts in the class room when girls decide they do not like sport\n.*\n*\n&#xa0;\n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, she cites the \ncompetitive nature of the industry and the \npractical\nity of a woman covering major sporting events. She once \nwent to t\nhe French Open \n[\ntennis\n]\n with two small children, one husband, one nanny and 11 pieces of luggage and her daughter slept in a suitcase. This tends not to be a problem for men, who leave their \nfamily at home\n.*\n*\n&#xa0;\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJacqui Oatley found herself on the news pages when she became the first woman commentator on Match of the Day. Oatley had another claim to fame.  She was a former footballer, forced to retire early through injury, and a massive supporter\n of\n the women’s game while equally an expert on the men’s version.\n \nOver the years she has continued to bang the drum on behalf of women’s football. \n&#xa0;\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe London 2012 Olympics appears to have been a watershed moment \nfor women’s football \nas far as mainstream\n media is concerned. The Great Britain team was given extensive coverage in print, on radio, on television, on the internet and on social media like Twitter. \n&#xa0;\n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe crowds flocked to the matches, \nwhich\n were reported on by recognised football journalists of \neither gender – a significant advance on the original theory that women had to write about women’s sport because men did not want to “lower” themselves.\n&#xa0;\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The knock-on effect was that the BBC announced live and extensive coverage of this summer’s European \nChampionships, featuring England. When England went crashing out of the tournament, there was serious debate and the head coach lost her job.  \nHope Powell may not appreciate th\ne significance of the sack\n but it \nillustrated \nhow the status of women’s football\n has been elevated.\n&#xa0;\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEqually this summer has seen the England women’s cricket team take on Australia\n in the Ashes, while a 15-year-old girl golfer called Charley Hull emerged as the star of the European Solheim\n Cup team and Laura Robson briefly became the darling of Wimbledon. All were reported on.\n&#xa0;\n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLast year’\ns Olympic Games\n produced many female sporting heroes, from heptathlete Jess Ennis, cyclists like Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott, to rowers Katherine Gr\nainger and Anna Watkins\n to dressage gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin\n. They were afforded the same attention, the same respect as their male\n counterparts. \n&#xa0;\n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, it is a fact that none of the sports named above would continue to attract similar column \ninches outside a major event/tournament/championships. This applies equally to men – Mo Farah, S\nir Bradley Wiggins, etc.\n&#xa0;\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Dec\nember 2012, the SJA hosted its\n annual sports awards lunch at the Tower of London. \n Jess Ennis, Sarah Storey and the rowing pair \nof Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins were all winners. In recent years the SJA has recognised weightlifter Zoe Smith, taekwando star Sarah Stevenson and ironman Chrissie Wellington.\n&#xa0;\n27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn March 2013, the SJA held its annual sports journalism awards dinner.\n  Not surprisingly, winners in recent years have been predominately male but times are changing. Clare Balding became the first woman winner of the broadcaster of the year award, which has been running since 2005.\n \nThe Mail on Sunday’s Martha Kelner was nam\ned young sports journalist of the year, following in the footsteps of Emma John in 2008.\n \n&#xa0;\n28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSports journalism continues to be dominated by men, rather like fashion journalism continues to be dominated by women.  However, since Lo\nndon 2012 there have been ot\nher, significant, \nbreakthroughs.\n&#xa0;\n29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlison Kervin, a respected rugby writer and author, became the first sports editor of a national newspaper when she was appointed by the Mail on Sunday earlier this year\n&#xa0;\n30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe power of Twitter cannot be discounted either. T\nhe Women’s Sport Trust provides scholarships/grants to aspiring sportswomen and \nsupport\n all women’s sports in the UK while the Women’s Sports Net provides a complete service of reports and results on women’s sports. \n&#xa0;\n31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA new magazine, entitled Women in Spor\nt, has just been launched.\n&#xa0;\n32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAIPS, which represents national sports journalist associations worldwide, is about to set up its first commission on women’s sport. The SJA have nomi\nnated vice chair Janine Self as a representative.\n&#xa0;\n33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC\n \nhave announced a commitment to women’s sports while BT Sport, new players in the broadcast market, cover women’s sport and have a Women in Sport section on their website.  \n&#xa0;\n34\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe days when women’s sports were regarded almost as an embarrassment are long gon\ne.\n  Tabloid newspapers still have a tendency to be “laddish” in their approach, especially in their choice of photographs.  Equally, glamour shots of an elite sportswoman could encourage \nschool girls into participation if they believe sporty = sexy.\n&#xa0;\n35\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBroadsheet newspapers have the opportunity to project women’s sport because they have more space. A good story is a good story, regardless of gender, and stars like Ennis, Robson, Serena Williams, Paula Radcliffe, \ncommand\n column inches whenever they speak.\n Virginia Wade’s Wimbledon triumph in 1977was given the same profile as Andy Murray this year.\n&#xa0;\n36\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNothing in Britain \nwill supplant men’s\n football, \nparticularly the \nEnglish \nPremier League. \nLittle boys grow up wanting to be David Beckham or Wayne Rooney or Gar\neth Bale.\n \n \nMen’s sport has had a head star\nt of over a century and newspapers will continue to reflect that, regardless of whether the writer is a man or a woman.\n&#xa0;\n37\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, there has\n clearly\n been a gradual \ngroundswell in terms of interest in women’s sport, \nfuelled perhaps by the Olympics, and \nmedia coverage has reflected this.\n&#xa0;\n38\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n In conclusion, therefore, the \nS\nJA does\n not believe that media coverage in the last 13 months has had a \ndetrimental effect on women’s participation in sport.\n*\n              \nObservation by Julie W\nelch, the first woman football writer\n** \n              \nObservations by Sue Mott, sports journalist, broadcaster and author\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
