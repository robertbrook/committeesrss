&#xa0;Written evidence from ADEPT (SRN 019)How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?The key advantages to be gained will be through consistent investment planning, offering a much firmer short to medium-term programme of infrastructure improvements than under the current system.  As well as creating efficiencies through better resource planning, and a lack of abortive work on schemes that have no realistic chance of delivery, this will also have advantages through a better ability for the Highways Agency to be able to co-ordinate its infrastructure planning with both infrastructure investments and development projects at a local level.Continued and more effective working with local authorities, particularly on highways and planning issues, will be vital to ensure that these policies are achieved and that new barriers to delivery are not created.  Good progress has been made recently, not least in the areas of interface between local and strategic roads, where closer working has led to more efficient use of (combined) resources and, as a consequence, better outcomes for the travelling public.The changes planned in HA contract forms, allied to mounting revenue resource pressures on local authorities could lead to a situation where these closer working arrangements come under pressure – it is vital, not least in terms of public credibility for both organisations (national / local) that this harmonised approach at domain boundaries is maintained, if not enhanced.How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?While the intention of the Government’s policy is for planning of the strategic road network to be planned in a similar way to the rail network, the direct interface between the two is limited, as most journeys involving both modes will also require use of the local road network.The principal ways in which integrated thinking between modes takes places are at local level, where Local Transport Plans have a statutory duty to include policies for all modes of travel within their area, and through Local Plans where transport planning is integrated with land-use planning to ensure that a cohesive and consistent approach to infrastructure investment is presented.  There are many good examples of this nationally in which the Highways Agency has been a key player under the existing arrangements, and it is important that this close relationship continues.However, there is a need for investment planning on the strategic road network to become more responsive to change circumstances at local level, and be able to give a timely response to initiatives such as Enterprise Zones, where the current arrangements of a scheme needing Secretary of State endorsement are not capable of rapid evolution.  There is similarly a need to ensure that the infrastructure planning regime can respond quickly to funding opportunities, which often requires development of ‘bottom-drawer’ schemes in advance of funding opportunities being known.There have been good examples of this approach operating in practise, not least through the recent, successful ‘pinch point’ programme, where HA and local authorities have worked together to both make a strong economic business case and enable delivery of important schemes in a compressed time scale.&#xa0;How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?&#xa0;Given that most journeys on the strategic road network will both start and finish their journeys on the local road network, there is an inherent flaw in the ability to deliver the forecasts as in many areas the local road network will be unable to accommodate growth on the scale envisaged.There is a need to ensure that planning of the strategic road network and the local road network are undertaken in parallel and that the interface and interplay between the two is recognized.There is also a need to recognize that any national forecasts are inherently that, and represent an ‘average’ situation, which will be subject to significant variance at local level.  For example, where towns have several access to the strategic road network, new development is likely to be concentrated on one or more particular junctions rather than distributed evenly across the whole.In consequence, continued close working with local authorities through the Local Plan process is essential to ensure that forecasting and infrastructure proposals are as effective as possible in such circumstances, even where the key city-to-city flow forecasts are derived at a higher level.It is also important that development of the strategic road network is consistent with, and supportive of, the growth ambitions of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), as reflected in their emerging Strategic Economic Plans (SEPs).  The strategic road network is a vital component, and potential barrier, in the local growth agenda.   Close cooperation between the ‘new’ HA and the LEPs, along with their Local Transport Boards (LTBs) is going to be vital if transport is to play the essential underpinning role to growth that intuitively it should.&#xa0;How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?While the provision of information about incidents on the strategic road network has improved significantly in recent years, there is a need to make this information more widely available, particularly before people access the SRN.  Local authorities have significantly improved their communication arrangements with local residents and road users, not least through increased use of ‘real time’ social media channels such as Twitter.  Closer cooperation between local highway authorities and the strategic agency in this area will help to i9mprove the quality and consistency of information provided to the travelling public, many of whom do not recognise the difference between locally and nationally managed elements of the road network (motorways excepted)There is also need to improve the rapid response to incidents, which currently often relies on a key person to make individual contract with various agencies.  There is a need to ensure that response is both available at key locations and that there is effective interface with local highway authorities to ensure that a joined up service is offered and that there is no conflict between the solutions being taken to incidents on the two networks.What mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK? Road pricing is not necessarily the answer and is only one of the mechanisms.  There is a need to examine the widest possible range of funding sources, including private sector and pension funds, and accept that for many infrastructure investments there will be no single answer with regards to funding.There is a need to examine recyclable funds in local government such as Northamptonshire County Council’s Revolving Infrastructure Fund which looks at the various sources of funding available and takes a holistic approach to break down the barriers between funding sources caused by different timescales, priorities and agenda, and enables funding to be delivered up-front and repaid from funding sources as they become available.How should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?We support the achievement of the outcomes detailed in the Cook Report, with the Highways Agency being replaced by a more autonomous and commercial entity engaging in conversations with local authorities that produce a different and more innovative solutions to project delivery than would be the case at present.&#xa0;Particularly, we are keen that the Highways Agency has more involvement at the achievement of a sense of place in local communities.  It needs to link the development of the strategic road network more closely with that of the local road network and give better recognition to the interface and interplay between the two so that a joined-up highway and transport solution is delivered for communities.&#xa0;In the longer term, we would welcome consideration to the principle of sub-national devolution of some of the decision making aspects of the proposed strategic roads organisation, possibly adopting some of the principles of the current rail devolution process.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
