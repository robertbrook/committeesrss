default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Electrical Safety Council (ESC) welcomes the opportunity to submit 
defaultwritten evidence to the Communities and Local Government Committee inquiry into the Building Regulations certification of electrical installation and repairs in dwellings.
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs the 
defaultUK
default’
defaults
default only
default charity committed to reducing electrical fires and electricity-rel
defaultated injuries at home and at work
default,
default our remit is to promote and encourage
default public awareness of issues surrounding electrical safety. We
default therefore
default have a
default particular interest in ensuring consumers 
defaultknow how and where to find a c
defaultompetent, qualified electrician. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultOur submission focuses on:

default&#xa0; 
defaultW
defaulte
default are
default also
default currently working with industry partners to address concerns
default expressed by the Committee
default over the existence of two registers, and to reach a solution 
defaultthat best meets
default the interest of consumers.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe wish to reaffirm our commitment to Part P, which 
defaultis
default vitally important 
defaultto
default regulat
defaulte
default industry
default and ensure 
defaultconsumer 
defaultsafety
default. We have argued strongly in f
defaultavour of Part P, and were supportive of the Committee’s recommendation that it should be retained.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that the Competent Persons Scheme remains the best and most cost
default-
defaulteffective 
defaultway to maintain standards amongst electrical contractors
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, we
default have seriously
default considered
default the written evidence of individual contractors who expressed concern
defaults over the existing system
default,
default and have sought 
defaultin this response 
defaultto address
default the points they made.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultPart P is
default a cost
default-
defaulteffective way for government
default to
default ensure
default 
defaultthat electrical work in new and existing homes is carried out 
defaultto a standard that minimises
default 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth and safety risks 
defaultassociated with electric shocks and electrical fires
default.
default Its importance is likely to grow as the 
defaulttype of electrical work carried out in the home continue
defaults
default to change
default and broaden
default;
default supporting Government policies on renewables, electrical vehicles and smart meter
defaults by ensuring that electrical installation work in dwellings is 
defaultcarried out
default competently
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultCompetent Persons Scheme
defaults (CPS) licensed under Part P
default ensu
defaultre
default that all 
defaultregistered
default electricians are trained to a high standard and assessed regularly. Though 
defaultCPS 
defaultmembership is voluntary, 
defaultover 4
default0,000 firms had chosen to register as 
defaultof
default February 2013.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultSince the introduction of Part P, 
default27,000
default more contractors carrying out electrical installation work in dwellings have 
defaultbeen inspected on a periodic basis
default than was previo
defaultusly the case. 
defaultThe Part P Impact Assessment stated that the number of properly qualified individuals and firms represents a “strong proxy” for the quality of electrical work undertaken.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultConsumers have benefited as a result. Whilst they may not be aware of
default Part P specifically, the existence of re
defaultgulation has deterred ‘
defaultcowboys’ and provides consumers with confidence about the work they are paying for.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultPart P prevents approximately 2.6 fatalities and 421 injuries per year due to electric shock, 
defaultand 2.8 fatalities, 10 serious injuries and 77 minor injuries due to electrical fires
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultRespondents to the Government’s 
defaultrecent 
defaultconsultation supported the view that Part P has had a positive impact on the quality of electrical installation
default work
default; of those w
defaultho had a view
default,
default 64% 
defaultstated 
defaultthat the standard had improved, including 96% of t
defaulthe building control bodies that gave an opinion
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultA 
default2011 
defaultsurvey of nearly 4,000 
defaultelectricians, 
defaultregistered 
defaultacross
default the three main Part P Competent Person
defaults
default Schemes
default,
default found that 
default53%
default believe
defaultd
default the standard of electrical work ha
defaultd
default improved as a result of the implementation of Part P. This 
defaultoutcome 
defaultwas supported by a separate but less wide-ranging study 
defaultcommissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government and conducted 
defaultby
default bu
defaultilt asset consultancy
default EC Harris
default 
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultCrucially, through 
defaultCertsure
default, consumers
default now
default have a way to follow up any deficient work and a guarantee that applies to the work even if the company undertaking the work has ceased to exist
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne submission made to the 
defaultCommittee and published on 9 October questioned the ESC’s use of statistical data in our original evidence from February 2012, stating we had claimed there had been a drop in fires when in fact there had been an increase since Part P came into force. This 
defaultmisrepresents what ESC stated. From 2004-2008, there was a 17.5% drop in the combined number of fault fires associated with two categories of data that we 
defaultbelieved to be
default 
defaultmost relevant to the operation of Part P, ‘Mains Wiring: After Meter’ and ‘Mains Wirin
defaultg: Before Meter’ (Relevant data tables, as provided to ESC by the Department for Communities and Local Government, are set out in appendix 1). 
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince this time, the category used to record such fires has been broadened to ‘Electricity supply - Wiring, cab
defaultling, plugs’. This effectively collates three former categories into one, making a direct comparison – as cited by the respondent in order to prove ESC’s error – impossible. However, as the data used to inform the 
defaultsubmission
default had not at the time of writing 
defaultbeen made available, we have been unable to fully corroborate this view.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst there is significant 
defaultevidence of the value of Part P
default,
default its impact could be greater
default and more ne
defaulteds to be 
defaultdone to raise consumer awareness
default – which according to our latest poll is 14%
default. We welcomed the Committee’s earlier
default recommendations to Government 
defaultand 
defaultare pleased 
defaultthat th
defaulte
default issue again features in this inquiry. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultChanging consumer behaviour and raising awareness of important safety issues takes a long time and substantial investment. 
defaultAs the industry’s only consumer-focused organisation, the ESC is committed to promoting and encouraging public awareness of issues su
defaultrrounding electrical safety. 
defaultOver the last 7 years we have invested 
default£7.89 million
default in consumer awareness campaigns and 
defaulthave an important role to play in ensuring that consumers know how and where to find a competent, qualified electrician.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe ESC spent
default 
default£1.42
default million
default 
defaulton consumer awareness campaigns focussing on electrical safety in 2012/13. By the end of 2013/14 the ESC will have spent a further £978,000 on similar consumer campaigns.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultOver the last 5 years, the ESC has provided over £1million to communit
defaulty groups across the UK in direct grants to help raise awareness of electrical safety and improve electrical installations in vulnerable people’s homes.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to regular annual campaigns to boost awareness of the importance of electrical safety, the 
defaultESC has over the last year funded four campaigns focussed on Part P and the importance of using a competent, qualified electrician. Audience research shows that these consumer campaigns have been seen or heard by consumers 204.5 million times this year. A 
defaultfull breakdown of audience reach for each of these campaigns is below:
default&#xa0;
defaultFebruary campaign
default– 
default 
default32 million
defaultJune campaign
default– 
default 127 million
defaultAugust campaign 
default– 
default 40 million
defaultNovember campaign
default – 
default5.5 million
default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultConsumers will further benefit 
defaultfrom the new conditions
default of license for competent person scheme operators, which will require them to spend a 
defaultdefined 
defaultamount on public awareness activities. This condition will be effective from June 2014.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe th
defaulte
default system 
defaultis
default robust 
defaultand there is significant evidence 
defaultto prove this, which we have set out below
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultW
defaulte have
default also
default seriously
default considered
default the written ev
defaultidence of individual contractors who expressed concern
defaults over the existing system, 
defaultand have asked the relevant Competent Persons Scheme
defaults
default to
default address the detail within their submissions. 
default 
defaultOur submission provides a brief overview of the overall system. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn its report into Building Regulations applying to electrical and gas installation and repairs in dwellings (March 2012), the Committee described the “stringent criteria” which must be met by organisations wishing to establish a Competent Persons Scheme. 
defaultThose organisations must set an appropriately high standard of competence for members, and commit to testing members to that standard. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn turn, prospective electrical contractors must undertake an accreditation process in order to become members of 
defaulta
default Com
defaultpetent Persons Scheme.
default Contractors must complete a minimum of 224 guided learning hours in order to gain the qualifications necessary to 
defaultbe considered for accreditation
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultA further advantage to the current system is the focus on 
defaultimproving 
defaultstandards year-on-year. 
defaultWe are pleased that 
defaultthe Minimal Technical Competence (MTC) to apply for Part P certification has been gradually raised since the introduction of the regulations in 2005. As of April 2013, those 
defaultwishing to register with a Scheme must
default demonstrate competence equivalent to a Level 3 qualification.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultNor is accreditation guaranteed. The average first time pass rate of the accreditation process is 81.4%.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultOnce qualified, electrical contractors are subject to regular assessment as members o
defaultf the Competent
default Persons Scheme. Contractors are inspected at least once a year by an appointed supervisor
default w
defaultho records
default a range of 
defaultindicators
default,
default including the quality of their workmanship and the state of their equipment
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultSelect Committee’s original 
defaultreport concluded that 
defaultan “expected benefit” of 
defaultthis system of stringent accreditation and regular assessment had 
defaultwould be
default higher quality workmanship, and a fall in the number of installations by poorly qualified contractors
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe process of assessment 
defaultis
default 
defaultunder constant review
default, with improvements made as necessary
default. 
defaultFor example, a
defaults a result of the Part P Impact Assessment
default,
default the principle of “risk-based inspection” has been introduced
default.
default 
default This means
default, for example,
default that members with poor customer complaints records can be inspected more often, and those with exemplary records less.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Committee has made clear its reservations over the 
defaultexistence of two registers of electrical contractors and the potential for confusion amongst consumers. Reasons for the development of two registers were discussed at length in the course of oral evidence to the Committee on 2
defaultnd
default September 2013. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, 
defaultwe recognise the Committee’s concerns and in order to address the
defaultm
default 
defaulthave
default held meeting
defaults
default&#xa0;
defaultwith Certsure and NAPIT
default, 
defaultagree
defaulting
default to seek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians, tha
defaultt provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electrician to 
defaultcarry out
default work in their home.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new schem
defaulte requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline
default (June 2014)
default, and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).
default&#xa0;
default We
default,
default along with the above mentioned organisations
default,
default have written to the Parliamentary
default under
default Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe are keen to 
defaultwork 
defaultclosely 
defaultwith 
defaultboth the 
defaultComm
defaultittee and the Department on the develo
defaultpment of a new register
default,
default to ensure that it meets the objectives of policy makers,
default and will keep all parties
default informed of
default on
default-
defaultgoing
default developments.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn light of the Committee’s on
default-
defaultgoing inquiry focused on the building 
defaultregulations, t
defaulthe ESC 
defaultwould like to raise its concern regarding proposals for 
defaultthird party inspection and testing
default. 
defaultWe believe that
default, by allowing professional electricians the opportunity to sign off the work 
defaultof their peers, the new scheme undermines the self-
defaultcertification principle of Part P and thus could lead to significant numbers of electricians de
default-
defaultregistering in favour of having their work signed off by others. If this scheme does lead to mass deregistration, it would also mean a fall-back in the number o
defaultf electricians being inspected and tested every year 
defaultand resultant safety implications.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to avoid the outcome above, we
default 
defaultrecommend that third party inspections exclude work carried out by means of trade
default. This mirrors requirements for gas 
defaultinstallations and would, in our view, mean that the system does not have the unintended consequence of encouraging electricians to renege on their C
defaultompetent 
defaultP
defaulterson 
defaultS
defaultcheme
default membership. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe ESC is a UK-wide charity 
defaultcommitted to reducing electrical fires and elec
defaulttric
defaultity-related injuries at home and at work.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultEvery year over 20,000 domestic fires are caused by faults and misuse of electrical appliances and installations throughout Great Britain. A further 2.5 million U
defaultK adults experience a mains voltage electric shock each year and around 70 people die from electrical accidents in the home.
