"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru [FBB0069]&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;Introduction 1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTeledwyr Annibynnol Cymru (TAC) is the trade association representing the interests of the Welsh independent production sector. \nWales\n has had an independent TV production sector since 1982, when Channel 4 and the Welsh language broadcaster S4C began broadcasting.\n Today, w\nith over 40 companies turning over £\n200\nm\n,\n \nthe\n sector is \nnow \na thriving creative industry that makes a wide range of c\nontent – drama, \nfactual, \nanimation, music and entertainment, live events, current \naffairs\n,\n lifestyle and so on. There is also an \nindependent\n radio production sector in \nWales\n \nproducing for BBC Radio Wales and Radio \nCymru\n.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWelsh producers make programmes \nnot\n only for BBC Wales and S4C but also for \nthe UK\n–wide channels\n,\n for example\n:\n \nthe award-winning \n‘\nThe Indian Doctor’ made for BBC1 by Rondo \nMedia\n;\n \n'Helicopter Rescue' by Cwmni Da was broadcast on network BBC1 after first broadcast on BBC Wales\n; and ‘Arctic \nwith Bruce Parry’ made by Indus Films for BBC2\n; \nand\n \nTelesgop’s ‘Turner and the Thames’ for BBC4.\n \nProductions for \nUK\n commercial PSBs include\n \nAvanti’s documentary on \nBritain\n’s Got Talent finalists Jonathan and \nCharlotte\n for ITV1 and Rondo’s ‘My Tattoo Addiction’ for Channel 4.\n \nWelsh producers are also working with companies overseas to create \ninternational co-productions\n.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC clearly has an important part to play in \nWales\n, as does fellow broadcaster S4C\n which\n \nsince 2\n01\n3 \nhas mainly been funded by the Licence Fee. There are major decisions to be made in the \nnext BBC \nCharter to ensure\n that\n public service \nbroadcasting in \nWales\n continues to be diverse, vibrant and sufficiently well-funded to ensur\ne that this \nUK\n nation has \na con\nt\nin\nuing \nand thriving \ncreative sector\n.  This sector must be\n ab\nl\ne\n to reflect\n its voices\n, creative\n talent a\nnd stories to its own population \nand also \nto the rest of the \nUK\n and beyond.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this context TAC greatly welcomes the Committee’s decision to hold its inquiry into \n‘T\nhe Future of the BBC\n’\n. We \nhope \nthat \nthe Committee will find \nthe\n perspective and\n proposals \npresented \nhere of interest and would be grateful for the opportunity to appea\nr before the committee to \nexpand upon them\n.\n \n \nWe will briefly address each of the Committee’s areas of interest, before turning to concentrate on the future of the Licence Fee and the BBC’s relationship with S4C.\nAnswers to the Committee’s Specific QuestionsWhat should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC should continue to provide content which \nis\n \nnot easily \navailable \ni\nn the commercial space\n,\n \nand content\n \nwhich adds creative competition to commercial \nbroadcasting\n. It \nplays a \nvital role \nin \nprovid\ning\n a wide range of challenging and enlightening content without which our society would be poorer.\nHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nBBC has provided a wide range of content \nand provided some exciting new services – the i-Player is an unqualified success, as \nis \nits news content and also \nits \nbig audience items such as ‘Strictly’. A\nlso,\n its wildlife \nu\nnit remains one of the best in the wor\nld. \nIt continues to provide high quality and popular drama and high standard of current affairs and factual output. \n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nH\nowever while it has sought to increase production capacity in some areas outside London – eg Salford – it has not \nsufficiently \nmaintained \nits commitment to the nations\n,\n including Wales, w\nhere\n budgets\n have\n decreas\ned significantly, \nwith\n significant reduction in budgets for services like Radio Cymru and Radio Wales (though \na service like Radio 4 was \nexempt from such cuts\n in the DQF\n) and in the \ncost of provision of Welsh language content for S4C. \nAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere should be a greater emphasis on encouraging \nUK\n creativity and innovation, as well as greater diversity of content for \nL\nicence Fee Payers\n, via ind\nependently produced content. \nWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC should ensure that the nations of the \nUK\n are having their stories told and lives reflected both in the\nir\n own areas and across the \nUK\n. \nDespite the BBC having a major drama cen\ntre in \nCardiff\n \nBay\n, there remain\n very \nfew programmes that are \ndistinctively Welsh in character \nwhich are \nshown on the UK-wide BBC networks.  \nOf equal importance is output and volume made in \nWales\n which has a UK-wide and international perspective and appeal. \nWhat balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?10.\n&#xa0; \nMoving \n forward there will be an \nincreasing \nneed for the BBC to be flexible\n, whilst not allowing for \nitself to be outpaced by technological\n advancements\n and conve\nrgence-related change. For this reason a BBC which is more slimline in structure, \nless bureaucratic and top heavy, \nwith\n a healthier balance between in-house and externally produced content\n would make sense\n.  T\nhis will also allow it \nto \nprovide a greater ran\nge of content to the \nLicence Fee Payer\n and to better reflect audiences all around the \nUK\n.\n11.\n&#xa0; \nThe Committee will know that the UK TV production sector has benefitted greatly from interventions undertaken by previous governments, firstly to set up Channel 4 and\n S4C as PSBs which, as publisher-broadcasters, commissioned wholly from the UK indie TV sector, and secondly introduced the 25% independent production quota. The addition of a Window of Creative Competition by the BBC \nin 200\n7,\n along with the protection of indie companies’ IP rights in the 2003 Communications Act, has resulted in a hugely successful international industry. It has also given the Licence F\ne\ne Payer access to a wider range of innovative ideas and fresh talent.\n12.\n&#xa0; \nTAC w\nas encouraged to hear BBC Creative Director Alan Yentob talk at the Edinburgh TV Festival in August of the possibility of the 50% in-house guarantee for BBC in-house producers being removed within five years. TAC hopes this reflects a general understanding\n in the BBC that,\n \nwith TV indie producers winning between 75%-80% of commissions competed for by both in-house and indies, the way forward is to allow more such competition. A good next step might be\n \nfor BBC TV\n to move to a 50% WoCC, and TAC would welcome \nsuch a recommendation being made by the Committee.\n13.\n&#xa0; \nIn radio, indie production has less scope, with only a 10% quota and additional 10% WoCC in operation. TAC’s producers involved in radio have noted that in the first year of its operation, the radio WoCC s\naw 80% of the hours on offer won by indie radio companies. This is a clear sign that BBC Radio could benefit from additional competition. TAC would therefore support the independent radio production sector in its call for a 25% quota and 25% WoCC to allow \nthe sector to grow and provide more creative competition, again for the benefit of the Licence Fee Payer and the \nUK\n economy.\nHow have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?14.\n&#xa0; \nIt is fair for the BBC to be able to maximise the value of the content it produces – revenue from international sales, secondary channel deals\n, DV\nD\ns\n,\n downloads \nand so on \ncan be used to increase the content budget. Of course the BBC should always have an eye to whether\n or not\n it is adversely affecting commercial organisations through \nsuch activity. It should also not use the fact that it owns the\n IP to in-house produced content as a reason \nto restrict \nopen\ning\n up its commissioning to competition from independent producers.\n The more successful and high-quality BBC programmes are, the more revenue they can sometimes generate, meaning everybody – the BBC, the indie producer and the Licence Fee Payer – benefits.\nWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?15.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important for the BBC to make sure it has its content \non whatever platform the LF payer chooses to access it \n– eg online, on mobile \nand\n so on. However in doing so it must always ensure it is allowing the producers of that c\nontent to benefit from the use of their intellectual property\n.\n \nHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?16.\n&#xa0; \nAs long as there is a fundamentally flexible nature to the BBC’s structure it should be able to deal with new changes and challenges within the current Charter system\n.\n17.\n&#xa0; \nTAC believes it is very important for the Secretary of State to have ultimate responsibility for the Public Service broadcasters – for this reason we are unhappy with \nthe BBC Trust ha\nving\n the power to \nwithdraw \nits \nf\nunding of S4C\n ‘in extremis’\n.\n It is also o\nne of the reasons why the continued direct grant from DCMS to S4C is important, as this dual funding mechanism provides greater stability in terms of S4C preserving its editorial and operating independence. \nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? \nIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?18.\n&#xa0; \nTAC’s opinion is that the TV Licence Fee has provided a very useful way of funding PSB broadcasting in the \nUK\n in a way that has successfully augmented the commerci\nal PSB services, in addition to the growing range of pay-channels.\n19.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst the landscape has undoubtedly changed, TAC still believes that the TV Licence Fee provides a\n valuable and\n unique way \nof\n funding additional programming and services which is of benefit to the \nUK\n citizen and\n which\n allows creative entrepreneurs to \nproduce \na wider and greater range of PSB content.\n20.\n&#xa0; \nPrior to the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010, S4C \nhad\n an index-linked publ\nic grant from\n t\nh\ne\n Department for Culture \nMedia\n &amp; Sport. In 2010 this stood at just over £100m.\n \nAs part of the 2010 CSR, this arrangement was altered by the DCMS. The new arrangement meant that S4C had its budget reduced in real terms by some 36% - the main\n part of its continuing funding was to come from the TV Licence Fee, with a remaining c£7m to be a continuing grant from DCMS. \nIts other \nsources\n of funding are from \nadvertising\n and\n from\n programme and format sales, although it obviously shares \nthe proceeds \nof\n the latter with the \nindependent\n \nproducers\n who originate the content\n,\n tale\nnt and ideas\n.\n21.\n&#xa0; \nSin\nc\ne this initial large cut, S4C has been subject to further cuts: \na\ns part of the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement in 2012, the DCMS announced a further round of \nfunding reductions for S4C of 1% in 2013-14 and 2% in 2014-15. Following the Chancellor’s Spring Budget Statement in 2013 further cuts were announced of 1.09% in 2013-14 and 1.06% in 2014-15.\n Lastly, the BBC Trust then included S4C’s non-content costs with\nin the BBC’s own cost-cutting exercise. S4C’s budget \nwas \ntherefore \neffectively \nunder attack \nfrom both the BBC Trust and the Government\n.\n22.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhis situation caus\ned\n difficulty in terms of S4C being able to plan ahead\n,\n and commission content and services in the wa\ny \nthat other \nc\nommercial or PSB \n broadcasters\n are able to do. \nTAC\n,\n a\nlongside\n \nseveral \nother\n stakeholders and organisations, \nconsistently argued\n that\n this \nconstant\n \nstream\n of cuts should be ceased. \nAs a result the DCMS announced in the CSR earlier this year that the Government grant to S4C would not be the subject of any further cuts \nuntil at least 2016\n. \n Though a positive result in the short term, this h\nowever\n l\neaves\n many \nunanswered\n \nquestions\n: \nW\nhat \nwill happen to the \nGovernment\n grant post-\n2016\n? How can\n \nS4C be \nprotected \nf\nro\nm further cuts imposed on it by the BBC Trust, in the latter’s \nposition\n as ‘guardian of the Licence Fee’?\n23.\n&#xa0; \nTAC also made a strong case regarding the Operating Agreement which \ndefines\n the new ‘partnership’ between the BBC and S4C. \nThe\n Agreement is between the BBC Trust and the S4C \nAuthority\n, \nthe\n latter of which is the \ngoverning\n body for S4C.\n24.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst several \nchanges were\n made to the Agreement which clarified the \nrelationships\n and further \nprotected\n S4C’s editorial\n, \noperational and \nmanagerial independence\n \nsome areas remained of concern,\n.  These included\n t\nhe fact that, as stated above, the BBC Trust was inflicting upon another broadcaster cuts agreed by the Trust for the BBC spe\ncifically\n \nand \nsecondly, t\nhe power for the BBC Trust ‘in extremis’ to withdra\nw \nits \nfunding from S4C altogether. \nI\nt is\n TAC’s \nview\n \nthat\n \nthis \npower should \nultimately \nlie with the \nsponsoring\n Government \nd\nepartment\n – the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport\n, \nwhich also continues to provide funding for S4C\n \n&#xad;\n– alongside the statutory duty to ensure sufficient funding for S4C, which is included in the Public Bodies Act\n.\n25.\n&#xa0; \nS4C is a unique broadcaster and not \nin any way \npart of the BBC\n. \nIt plays a unique role in the everyday lives of the people of \nWales\n as well as making a progressive and key contribution to \nWales\n, its economy, and the Welsh language.  \nIts publisher-broadcaster model means \nthat \nit commissions all of its content externally\n, from \nthe\n Welsh independent production sector. \nIt also has a remit of its own to commission programming that meets with the unique requirements and taste of a particular audience namely the people of \nWales\n, be they fluent Welsh speakers, learners or those\n who aspire to learn\n the language\n.  This includes high-level content focusing, issues of great concern to the people of Wales, from the Welsh language to heritage, culture and music, Wales’ agricultural heritage as well as factual programmes,\n sport,\n high-q\nuality drama or reflecting the issues specific to different parts of Wales.  \nIt provides invaluable and unique provision for children – \nfrom pre-school to teenagers \n(content originated and produced in \nWales\n) and it also provides content for Welsh language \nlearners. As a national broadcaster it has been vital in enabling a creative sector to be based all around \nWales\n – in the capital city \nCardiff\n and also in Caernarfon, in \nSwansea\n and in Llanelli. \n26.\n&#xa0; \nThe Committee will be \na\nware that one of the arguments in fav\nour of a number of PSB and commercial broadcasters is that \nUK\n citizens \nare provided \nwith\n a richer and \nmore\n diverse range of content thanks to this plurality \ncombined\n with stated public purposes.\n27.\n&#xa0; \nTherefore it is \nimportant\n that \nWales\n as a nation with its own\n language and cultur\ne\n \n(\nbut which sits within the\n wider \nUK\n)\n should have a \nplurality\n \nof\n \nbroadcasters\n. \nIt is also important for the \ncontinuing\n \ngrowth\n \nof the\n \nUK\n creative \nsector\n as a whole. \nHaving a production sector in \nWales\n, and encouraging \nWales\n to have its own outlook and stories t\no\n tell, is a reason why \nWales\n has been able to pr\noduce \nY Gwyll / Hinterland\n. T\nhis drama series, which has\n met with much critical acclaim\n, made use of Welsh cultural touchstones as well as the unique landscape\n in and ar\nound Aberystwyth\n to make compelling television that \nis already\n succeed\ning\n internationally as well in the rest of the \nUK\n.\n A second series has already been commissioned on the back of the success of the first\n. \n28.\n&#xa0; \nCo-produced by the Fiction Factory with S4C, \nTinopolis, the S4C co-production fund and All3Media International\n, Y\n \nGwyll\n has already produced strong audience numbers on S4C and this will grow when it is aired on BBC Four and BBC Cymru Wales in 2014. Its \nhigh\n quality\n, reminiscent of shows such as \nThe K\nilling\n, has been demonstrated by the fact that the Danish network which was responsible for The Killing has bought the series to show on its own network. \n29.\n&#xa0; \nAs an \nindependent\n \nbroadcasting\n \norganisation\n, which simply \nhappens\n to share the \nsame\n funding source as the BBC, S4C’s\n \nbudget should not automatically be cut every time the BBC reduces costs across its service\n. \n \nS4C has its own business model \nand\n needs to have the \nindependence\n of management and security of funding to be able to deliver it \neffectively.\n30.\n&#xa0; \nTAC \nconsiders\n it essential that:\n31.\n&#xa0; \nIf the plurality of Welsh PSB broadcasting, along \nwith the Welsh language and the independent production sector are to be allowed to flourish, the above measures are essential. If it is not possible within the current arrangement to ensure this editorial and operational independence, TAC believes that the\n Committee should examine whether or not it would be preferable to allocate a specific proportion of the TV Licence Fee directly to S4C, entirely separately from the Licence Fee money that is the \nresponsibility of the BBC Trust. This would have the added a\ndvantage of restoring full operational and managerial independence to S4C.\n32.\n&#xa0; \nTAC is very aware of the contrasting arguments on the merits of such 'top-slicing’ and is not necessarily saying it would support this proposal as a first option, but it is importan\nt to make sure above all else that S4C continues to be able to operate effectively as a separate entity with sufficient guaranteed funding to fulfil its objectives.\n \nIf it cannot do so within the current arrangement then \nother arrangements including top-sli\ncing the Licence Fee ought to be considered\n.\n \n33.\n&#xa0; \nA plurality of broadcasting is as important in \nWales\n as it is elsewhere. S4C also contributes greatly to the Welsh economy – an independent report published earlier this year showed that every pound spent in th\ne Welsh creative industries generated nearly £2 worth of economic growth\n. S4C provides high-quality programmes unique in its character and content. It must not be allowed to be damaged by the lack of a sustainable funding arrangement or risk of losing its\n editorial and managerial independence.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n “\n1.4 The Agreement ensures the editorial, managerial and operational independence of the S4C Authority and the S4C \nServices provided by it”.
