"&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOAR0018Written evidence submitted by the LGA&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and \nimprove local government.\n&#xa0;\nWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issue\ns that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.\n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFurther Education&#xa0;\nCouncils have \nduty to secure suitable education and training provisi\non for all young people aged 16-\n19, and to encourage enable and assist young people’s participation, and a responsibility to promote local growth.\n&#xa0;\nOfsted has, in two consecutive years, highlighted the \npoor responsiveness of further education provision to local economic conditions,\n and the limited attention paid to \nequipping young people with the skills and experience to take jobs\n. This has serious repercussions for employers, young people and, at an an\nnual public investment of £7.78 billion, the taxpayer.\n&#xa0;\nCouncils regularly identify the skills system as one of the greatest barriers to local growth. It is a structural issue created by the national lagged \nlearner \nnumber funding system that financially re\nwards providers for passing high numbers of qualifications, rather than for helping young people towards a job or helping employers \nmeet their \nskills needs. \n&#xa0;\nThis has led to skills mismatches, where far too many young people put their effort into courses \nunlikely to lead to a local job. Our research has shown that, in 2011/12 post-16 providers trained 94,000 hair and beauty technicians for 18,000 jobs. Meanwhile the construction sector, which has since identified significant skills shortages, providers tra\nined around123,000 people for around 275,000 advertised jobs.\n \n&#xa0;\nA\n nationally controlled funding system \nwill struggle to remedy this\n \nbecause\n \nthe\n national economy\n is\n a composite of\n many different local economies. There are 2.23 million local business units \nacross England, 99 per cent of which employ fewer than 100 people and the majority operate in local economies. It is our concern that, without reform, the evolving public service landscape will struggle to \nwork \ncoherently with employers in ways that help y\noung people. Our analysis suggests there are three reasons for this:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAround the country local authorities are seeking to work wi\nth providers to ensure young people are trained for jobs in the local economy, identified through quality local labour market information or through linking to local investment plans and developments. Examples are available in our Hidden Talents report, in\ncluding some City Deals, Community Budgets and many council led initiatives. Local models have real impact, and been better able to join-up with employment provision and other services, attract additional private sector investment, and trial payment by res\nults models.\n \n&#xa0;\nGood practice exists in spite of the system rather than because of it\n; i\nn many places the national funding and performance incentives discourage collaboration and innovati\nve\n practice that responds to local need.\n In our recent survey, almost\n 90 per cent of councils felt that they do not have sufficient influence to ensure \nthe \nfunding enables young people \nto \ngain \nthe \nskills \nneeded \nto \nsecure\n jobs in the local area. More than 60 per cent felt that the Education Funding Agency was driven \nmore \nby \nthe concerns of providers, than by employers or young people.\n&#xa0;\nWe want local partnerships - including providers, employers and enabled by councils - \nto\n become accountable for creating and leading a coherent and responsive mix of skills provision focused o\nn supporting young people’s transition \nto\n the local labour market. \n&#xa0;\nSignificant progress in this area cannot be achieved without reform to \nthe \nfurther education funding system. We are therefore keen to discuss with the \nEducation C\nommittee:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe principles of \na locally led\n approach have been \nchampioned\n \nin\n a range of significant contributions\n from \nthe Heseltine Review, the Social Mobility Commission led by Alan Mi\nlburn, and also the Work Foundation, London School of Economies, the Institute of Public Policy Research\n among others.\n&#xa0;Local authority tracking of young people&#xa0;Local authorities have a responsibility to track young people as part of their statutory duties to encourage and support participation, and improve outcomes for young people.  \n&#xa0;\nOfsted’s Annual Report references the percentage of young people unknown to lo\ncal authorities, which is on average 4 per cent of 16 and 17 year olds. It \nstates that\n ‘in some \nl\nocal authorities the percentage is as high as 23 per cent’. This is misleading. Only 7 councils have more than 10 per cent of young people unknown, only 2 coun\ncils \nhave \nabove 15 per cent and only 1 council \nhas \nabove 20 per cent. Furthermore, in the last year, the percentage of young people unknown \nto local authorities \nhas fallen in \neach of \nthese 7 councils\n by as much as 13 per cent.  This \nimprovement \nis \nnot refe\nrenced by the report. \n&#xa0;\nNevertheless\n,\n we are keen to support councils wanting to improve further, and the\n LGA\n recently launched a Tracking Guide and Planning Toolbox, which builds on the innovative practice in some ‘expert’ local authorities for \nthose \nwant\ning to improve how they track young people\n. In undertaking this \nwork,\n it \nbeca\nme clear that local authority success is dependent on the contribution \nof\n an increasingly fragmented market of providers in their area, accountable to national programmes. \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n1\n&#xa0;\n Annual Report on Education, Children’s Services and Skills, Further Education and Skills, Ofsted, 2013\n Skills mismatch analysis, Local Government Association / Inclusion, 2012\n Going in the Right Direction?
