[[[Written evidence from ]]]

[[[a resident of Jersey (Resident A)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1 I am a resident of Jersey who is concerned about abuses in our Legal and Parliamentary system as well as the Police. .I understand that my evidence is the property of the Committee but I would respectfully ask that my evidence is not published on the Internet as I am a States worker and fear losing my job if my name is known.  I have discussed this with my political representative.&#xa0;2 There are about 300 lawyers in Jersey who have a privileged minority status.  It is from this group that the Bailiff and Law Officers are selected and appointed and it seems to me that they still dominate the proceedings of government, the judiciary and the administration of so many aspects of island life. They survive apparently despite the recommendations contained in the Sir Cecil Clothier and Lord Carswell Reports.              3 An example of this is a former magistrate designate, jailed for fraud, who despite having not worked since 2008 only resigned in January this year.  My understanding is that his salary cannot be reclaimed. &#xa0;4 The behaviour of former Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache since 2010 has highlighted problems in the prevailing system, by which I mean a concentration of power in few hands.&#xa0;5 Even whilst serving as Bailiff, Sir Philip was active in politics and had an agenda for an “independent” Jersey.  This seems to me to be driven by elite who wish to avoid accountability for their actions.  If what I read on the local internet Blog sites is correct, the people do not want it. I feel it relevant to mention at this point that these Blogs are increasingly trusted over the Main Stream Media.&#xa0;6 Since retiring as Bailiff he has been elected as a Senator and now sits in the States as a political representative “of the people”.  His plan for States Reform (removal of Senators and larger constituencies formed the main part of his successful election campaign as a Senatorial candidate in 2011.&#xa0;7 The recent (24 April) Jersey Referendum, which the politically dominated Electoral Commission which he chaired, attracted a minimal public participation of around 26% which does not suggest confidence on the public’s part in the democratic process.  Voter apathy is a problem in Jersey.&#xa0;8 If this gains the approval of the States Assembly and the Privy Council, will be for reduced and less democratic representation of the public, my concern is that it will make our system of government even less compliant with international standards than before.&#xa0;9 Sir Philip has ambitions to make Jersey independent of the British Crown and to be our Foreign Minister. This proposition has not been put to the electorate. Any conflicts with UK Government will, in my view become more acute as the Island drifts towards “independence”  asserting an international identity of its’ own, if there is no scrutiny of Jersey’s institutions and Government. &#xa0;10 That Jersey’s economy is now so dominated by the so called “Finance Industry” is a specific aspect that needs to be considered critically and its affects, both within and outside the Island, examined. There are questions as to the sustainability of this&#xa0;11 The ongoing problems relating to the Dean of Jersey have revealed gaps and obscurities in the arrangements for his appointment and discipline. It seems to me that the “Crown” aspect is not fully understood by Islanders and it is not certain where responsibility and power lies.  Indeed, there are two inquiries (under Dame Heather Steele and Bishop John Gladwin) ongoing.&#xa0;12 That the laws and usages of Jersey are so little understood in the Island is not a new complaint, but it is evident that the ignorance extends to relationships with UK institutions and Government.              &#xa0;13 Our Home Affairs Minister has failed to take any effective action, where he has been advised that serving police officers have been perverting the course of justice.  He has requested the amendment of Standing Orders to prevent a Deputy asking questions about this.   14 The loss of evidence from police custody relating to child abuse (Haut de la Garenne) and which is highly relevant to the States Compensation Scheme for victims of abuse.  Events at the home came to light in 2008 and only now is a Committee of Inquiry getting underway.15 The collusion of civil servants and politicians to remove a Minister from Office over his concerns about our Child Protection Policy. This was revealed by a former Chief of Police, who was suspended from his job with no explanation or resolution.  In my view this is against natural justice.   16 The working of the legal aid system which means that ordinary citizens have almost no chance of getting any justice in the legal system.  It is means tested and funded by lawyers.  The allocation of a lawyer from a rota system means that justice can be compromised by the allocation of an unsuitable lawyer for the case at hand.&#xa0;17 Jersey lacks anti-discrimination laws and many other progressive measures.  It appears that the small, powerful legal profession is responsible for blocking these things from happening&#xa0;18 I wonder why the UK Government is more committed to Sark’s good governance when it has a population of 600.  Jersey has around 99,000.&#xa0;19 Residents do not know how to invoke good governance (which is ill-defined) in Jersey in order to resolve and prevent abuses.  &#xa0;20 The ultimate responsibility of the UK government also needs to be considered, as do any failures to intervene. The UK must take seriously the responsibility it has under the ECHR towards the good governance of the Crown Dependencies.&#xa0;July 2013&#xa0;
