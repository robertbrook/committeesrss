defaultThe BBC is there to supply public service broadcasting, and in my 
defaultopinion does this admirably.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is respected throughout the world.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default It is a difficult task to cover ‘Drama, Comedy, Arts, Sport, Current Affairs, 
defaultScience, Natural History, News, and the public are fortunate that they have access to such a wide spe
defaultctrum at such a small cost.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTelevision plays a great part in people’s lives, across all ages, particularly the older generation, the size of which is inc
defaultreasing.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Some programmes, such as Natural History, take a great deal of time and money, and brilliant talent, to make and deliver to the public, and most commercial companies wouldn’t bother as they would not cons
defaultider it financially viable.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC th
defaulterefore offers programmes that other
defaults do not make.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultApart from the entertainment value, many programmes are great learning tools for the population, particularly the young.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default My own young grandsons are testimony to that.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default The News is valued, and more im
defaultportantly trusted.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default If ever there is a disaster, or big event in the world, viewers seem to naturally turn to the BBC News for their information.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that the Independent sector has added considerable value to the BBC, both as to the diversity 
defaultand talent of their programmes, but also in recognising cost control, and their ability to obtain co-production value with other countries, and increase the export value of their programmes to the advantage of the BBC and the UK generally.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default At the moment
default the Independent sector are guaranteed 25% of output (with certain exclusions), BBC in
default-
defaulthouse 50%, with 25% to be shared according to acceptance of ideas.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default I believe it would be to the advantage of the BBC if the programme output w
defaultas shared 50/50 between 
defaultin-
defaulthouse and Independents, which would contribute not only creatively, but more importantly to the financial benefit of the BBC.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have recently been in America and watched a lot of their Network television with interest – and disma
defaulty.
default&#xa0;
default I dread the day whe
defaultn the standard of our British television would sink so low to p
defaultlease the common denominator.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC is unique in supplying programmes that cover so many viewers’ interests, some of them even niche viewing.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease let the BBC have the opportunity 
defaultto 
defaultcontinue with proper support, respect,
default&#xa0;
defaultand understanding of their achievements.
