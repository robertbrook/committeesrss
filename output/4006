[normal]The BBC is there to supply public service broadcasting, and in my 
[normal]opinion does this admirably.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is respected throughout the world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is a difficult task to cover ‘Drama, Comedy, Arts, Sport, Current Affairs, 
[normal]Science, Natural History, News, and the public are fortunate that they have access to such a wide spe
[normal]ctrum at such a small cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Television plays a great part in people’s lives, across all ages, particularly the older generation, the size of which is inc
[normal]reasing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Some programmes, such as Natural History, take a great deal of time and money, and brilliant talent, to make and deliver to the public, and most commercial companies wouldn’t bother as they would not cons
[normal]ider it financially viable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC th
[normal]erefore offers programmes that other
[normal]s do not make.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Apart from the entertainment value, many programmes are great learning tools for the population, particularly the young.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] My own young grandsons are testimony to that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The News is valued, and more im
[normal]portantly trusted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If ever there is a disaster, or big event in the world, viewers seem to naturally turn to the BBC News for their information.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe that the Independent sector has added considerable value to the BBC, both as to the diversity 
[normal]and talent of their programmes, but also in recognising cost control, and their ability to obtain co-production value with other countries, and increase the export value of their programmes to the advantage of the BBC and the UK generally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] At the moment
[normal] the Independent sector are guaranteed 25% of output (with certain exclusions), BBC in
[normal]-
[normal]house 50%, with 25% to be shared according to acceptance of ideas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I believe it would be to the advantage of the BBC if the programme output w
[normal]as shared 50/50 between 
[normal]in-
[normal]house and Independents, which would contribute not only creatively, but more importantly to the financial benefit of the BBC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have recently been in America and watched a lot of their Network television with interest – and disma
[normal]y.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I dread the day whe
[normal]n the standard of our British television would sink so low to p
[normal]lease the common denominator.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC is unique in supplying programmes that cover so many viewers’ interests, some of them even niche viewing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please let the BBC have the opportunity 
[normal]to 
[normal]continue with proper support, respect,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and understanding of their achievements.
