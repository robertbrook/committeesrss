[[[Written evidence submitted by the Combined Heat and Power Association (HOT50)]]]The Combined Heat and Power Association (CHPA) welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry on heat. The CHPA is the leading advocate of an integrated approach to delivering energy services using combined heat and power and district heating and cooling. The CHPA’s response sets out key elements of the heat sector and highlights immediate issues where policy focus would be of value. We would also welcome the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Committee. Accounting for half of UK energy demand, heat is central to the energy debate. If we are to achieve our decarbonisation commitments, reducing emissions from heat must be at the heart of energy policy. DECC’s creation of a heat directorate in 2011, and the publication of Heat Strategies in 2012 and 2013 demonstrates Government’s growing recognition of the importance of heat. 

[[[Heat policy ]]]

[[[must focus on the needs of the consumer]]]While power is a standardised commodity, heat is highly specific to the consumer’s requirements. For example, homes and offices need low-temperature heat for heating and hot water, while industries need high temperature heat for industrial processes. The difficulty of transporting heat over long distances ensures heat generation is always generated locally and, therefore, involves a close relationship with the final user. Heat policy, therefore, requires a more decentralised and user-orientated approach. With such an approach, it becomes clear that there is no one solution for decarbonising UK heat. Rather a suite of technologies is needed, each tailored to specific users’ needs. 

[[[An integrated systems approach controls costs for consumers]]]With an increased use of electricity for energy needs, including heat and transport, there is a pressing need to consider how different energy needs interact. The 2013 Heat Strategy recognises the energy system’s complex nature and recognises that a more cost-effective system will arise when all energy uses are better integrated. By using tools such as thermal stores, a more integrated energy system can help reduce overall costs by better managing electricity demand and supply. Without considering heat and power together, the UK risks creating a very expensive, inefficient energy system.

[[[Energy efficiency links key ]]]

[[[options ]]]

[[[for decarbonising]]]

[[[ heat]]]There are many technologies which can offer low carbon heat including generation technologies like heat pumps, solar thermal, combined heat and power (CHP). However, whatever generation solution is deployed, energy efficiency across generation, delivery infrastructure, and final demand is key. Currently, the high temperatures required by industrial processes are mostly provided by individual gas-fired boilers or CHP, but with an increasing role for bioenergy. The relatively high cost of electricity makes it prohibitively expensive for widespread industrial heat generation. Electrically-generated heat is needed for some processes such as iron and aluminium smelting where the high temperatures required cannot be readily achieved by other means. 

[[[Energy efficiency sits at the heart of industrial heat]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[decarbonisation]]]

[[[ ]]]For medium temperature industrial heat needs, fossil and bioenergy will remain the key sources for cost-effective heat in the medium term. But these energy options pose challenges as well. The biomass supply chain is immature, creating security of supply concerns for industry. Users of fossil fuels are exposed to price volatility. Carbon capture and storage remains a future option, but is currently too expensive for industry in the medium term. A focus on energy efficiency is therefore vital to reduce emissions from industrial heat. The key efficiency technology that is underexploited in UK industry remains combined heat and power, which delivers a reduction in fuel use of up to 30%. Combined heat and power (CHP) is sourced from gas, biomass, biogas and energy from waste.

[[[ ]]]As an energy efficiency technology, CHP reconciles major issues including: Please see the CHPA’s response to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s Gas Generation Strategy inquiry for more detail on CHP benefits.

[[[gas CHP ]]]DECC estimates an economic potential for more than 18 GW of CHP in the UK, almost triple current capacity. However, the Heat Strategy recognised that gas CHP requires a policy mechanism for it to achieve its potential in decarbonising the UK energy system. The Strategy therefore made the welcome commitment to develop a bespoke gas fired CHP policy to support CHP’s deployment.CHPA members are working closely with DECC on its analysis of policy options for its ‘bespoke policy’. Industry currently regards options to either incentivise CHP for the energy savings it delivers, or a feed-in tariff for efficiently generated CHP-produced electricity heat, as having the greatest potential.

[[[faces challenges]]]The proposed CHP policy is specifically limited to supporting new CHP capacity, and does not recognise the Government’s £110m to £165m annual tax rise on CHP operators created by the early removal of CHP’s LECs. At the time of the LECs decision, the Government indicated a solution would be found, but no action was taken to return this value to existing CHP operators. The impact of this decision, which was implemented in April 2013, is now starting to hit British industry and undermine the competitiveness of CHP sites. Some CHP operators are reducing their CHP generation because, with the removal of LECs and the addition of Carbon Price Support, it is no longer economical to operate. 

[[[Damaged investor confidence limits new]]]

[[[ CHP]]]

[[[ investment]]]Much of the expected investment for new CHP installations will likely come from those companies which operate existing CHP. The CHPA is aware of a number of companies who are hesitant to invest in CHP again because of the Government’s decision to remove LECs. For example, E.ON has stated that the removal of LECs has not given “much encouragement to take further investment”. If investors attach higher risks to CHP projects, it will raise the cost to industry, business and taxpayers.

[[[2011 commitment.]]]Current support levels for renewable CHP-generated heat appears to be sufficient to bring forward new investment, but the Government has not introduced a mechanism to allow investors to ‘lock in’ the value of the RHI payments when investments reach financial close. Without such a mechanism, called Enhanced Preliminary Accreditation, more than £1.5 billion in renewable CHP investments are ‘very unlikely’ to come forward, according to a survey of CHPA members.

[[[risk. ]]]High-temperature heat, as used by industry or power stations, can often be re-used for low-temperature demands, such as housing. Either on the same site or via a network, processes requiring high temperature heat can pass lower temperature ‘waste’ heat to a secondary user.

[[[More than half of energy wasted in power generation]]]Power generation wastes most of its heat through cooling towers, losing valuable efficiency and savings, and even the most efficient gas power plants waste half of the energy they consume. CHPA analysis found power stations waste more energy from their cooling towers than the total UK gas demand for heating.Across Europe, the amount of waste heat from thermal power generation is substantial. One academic study estimates waste heat from thermal generation adds up to nearly 2,000 TWh annually (enough to meet total UK heat demand two and a half times over), with only 17% of that energy captured and recycled. 

[[[Challenge of]]]

[[[ industrial heat to demand]]]Despite improving the efficiency of industrial processes, reducing and reusing waste products, there is often low temperature heat (below 100°C) which has no further industrial application. Total potential recoverable industrial heat in Europe is estimated at over 580 TWh annually, or about 80% of total UK heat demand.In an integrated energy system, this waste heat from power production and industry can be supplied to a community heat network for local homes, public and commercial buildings at low cost and zero carbon, as occurs in Dunkirk, France. Crucially, Dunkirk’s scheme design was championed by city leaders and without similar coordination, waste heat opportunities are lost. For example, we are aware of UK cases where housing developers install individual gas boilers rather than access available waste heat from local industry.

[[[ecoverable heat ]]]

[[[assessment welcome, but coordination is key]]]We welcome DECC’s commitment to assess the technical and economic potential for re-use of recovered heat and to explore incentives for use of recoverable heat. However, there are a number of institutional challenges to linking this heat to demand. Recovering waste heat requires partnerships which do not naturally or currently exist between industry, local authorities, and housing developers.

[[[More ambition needed for industrial steam networks policy]]]Aggregating industrial energy users into clusters can allow steam networks to serve multiple sites, increasing efficiency and competitiveness. Vitally, industrial clusters would allow future carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure to be concentrated at key sites with costs shared among several users. These industrial clusters may also serve to attract new industry through reduced energy costs.

[[[how to develop this policy further. ]]]Householders, businesses and public sector organisations need affordable heating, hot water and, increasingly, cooling in commercial buildings. Currently, individual gas-fired boilers predominate but this will need to evolve as villages, towns and cities decarbonise.For lower density areas individual heating solutions are more appropriate. The starting point should be considering building efficiency and then generation technologies including individual heat pumps, microCHP (gas, LPG and eventually biogas) and wood boilers. Large public sector and commercial buildings are increasingly turning to small-scale CHP, which allow them to save carbon and reduce waste. The number of CHP schemes below 10MW increased nearly 50% in the last four years, from 1,257 in 2008 to 1,860 in 2012. An example is the 1.1MW CHP plant installed in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital in June 2008 which saves £650,000 annually and reduces CO2 emissions by 8,000 tonnes per year. High density urban areas are characterised by space restrictions and high land values. Air quality and noise regulations limit the suitability of individual solutions such as heat pumps or biomass boilers. Higher densities, however, make community solutions servicing households, commercial and public sector buildings potentially more cost-effective than individual ones.Whilst it is vital to seek to reduce heat demand, it is also critical to look at the efficiency of heat supply. Heat networks are pipe infrastructure that deliver heating or cooling, generated communally, to homes and businesses, rather than generating heat at individual properties. This network infrastructure facilitates gains in economies of scale in heat generation and is efficient, flexible and easily upgradeable.Heat networks can incorporate a range of different heat sources, including heat pumps, solar thermal, boilers (both renewable and fossil fuelled), CHP (both renewable and fossil fuelled), geothermal, waste heat or energy from waste – some options of which cannot be harnessed at an individual building level. 

[[[Benefits of district heating to consumers]]]The UK Committee on Climate Change recognises that district heating, using low carbon generation or waste heat in high density areas, is one of the most cost effective forms of carbon abatement, and academic studies have found that in urban areas, district heating is a cheaper solution than other options. This cost effectiveness means a lower cost for consumers and taxpayers. Whether serving public or private rented sector or owner-occupiers district heating is steadily growing, in cities like London, Sheffield and Nottingham, saving carbon and combating fuel poverty. Heat networks also remove the need for the property owner to maintain, and ultimately replace, a boiler.

[[[Industry protecting consumers with proposals for independent regulation ]]]Recognising that heat customers should be afforded protection of comparable levels to those in the regulated gas and electricity sectors, the CHPA, on behalf of the district heating industry, is facilitating the development of an Independent Heat Customer Protection scheme for domestic and micro-business customers. An independent steering committee, with representatives from consumer groups, government and the district heating industry, are developing proposals and after public consultation, aim to establish a scheme in 2014.The Government’s Heat Strategy ruled out regulation for heat networks and announced that Government “will seek to endorse an industry-led consumer protection scheme”. DECC’s support will be a critical component of the Independent Heat Customer Protection scheme’s success.

[[[ernment recognises key role of local authorities]]]Local authorities are central to the development of new district heating networks, acting as brokers between key agencies, owning critical heat demand, and through Planning and street works permissions. Developers are unlikely to risk initiating city-wide schemes, so local authorities’ long-term strategic view of heat, developing heat masterplans to facilitate interconnected networks, are important. We therefore welcome the commitment to launch the Heat Network Delivery Unit (HNDU), a ‘hand-holding’ service for local authorities.However, we have outlined four other key measures which would help stimulate heat network development, both in the short term and long term, below.Once the development stages of a project have been undertaken and a project is deemed viable, it may still be difficult to secure adequate funding at appropriate interest rates. Whilst the low but steady returns a heat network can deliver are well suited to low-risk investors such as pension funds, district heating schemes can be too small to meet these funds’ minimum investment thresholds.

[[[future heat networks]]]The Government’s Heat Strategy recognised the role of district heating as a route to decarbonise heat where suitable heat density exists. DECC modelling estimates an economic potential of 20% of domestic heating and hot water demand met by heat networks in 2030. District heat scheme investments are made on 60-year timetables, and if the Government’s aim to significantly expand the amount of heat delivered through networks is to be realised, it will require a step change in deployment levels and more long-term thinking.
