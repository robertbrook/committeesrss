"The testing will generally prove the working of\n the changes \nto the \nEPM 2010\n system\n after the SP1 update, such as the EPM configuration settings\n and \nany possible changes to the EPM system and\n the way users will work with the system, e.g. changes in the user interface.\nTesting will also perform basic functionality checks, to prove that the fundamental features can be accessed \nas before (Pre SP1 update\n).\nData validation and integrity checks will also be performed:\nTesting will not be formally applied to standard, out-of-the-box functionality of MS Project and EPM, except where it is explicitly covered in the user guide.\nTesting will take place at various points, in the developm\nent cycle, first proving that the SP1 update along with the June 2011 cumulative update works, resolves known issues without any adversities within Pre Production. \n PED \n(validation)\n as\n \nwell as PICT \nChange Advisory Board approval will\n be sought, moving towards \nverification that everything actually works in the final, \nupdated production EPM\n system.\nThis forms the main approach \nto testing the EPM 2010 SP1 update \nand signing it off as ready to go-live.\nRun All Check Point reports                              \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nRun Major Projects Overview report  \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nExport all current EPM users to Excel and save \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nScreenshot\\Copy EPM field and Look up Table lists \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nScreenshot\\Copy top level EPM site permissions  \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSave PED templates as MPP files (backup) \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nRun All Check Point reports                              \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nRun Major Projects Overview report  \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\nExport all current EPM users to Excel and save \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCheck that users can’t gain access to EPM 2010 (stop WWW services and Project Server queue)              Notes:\n&#xa0;\nPerform data integrity checksNotes:\n&#xa0;\nExport all current EPM users to Excel and save \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCheck Server log files to ensuring the Services pack 1 has been applied – This can be removed Notes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCheck Server application versions via Control Panel&gt;Programs – This can be removed \nNotes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTest Formulae custom fields work as they should (lessons learnt) Notes:\nUpdated and publish a project (Test Baseline – PE55555) and reviewed the following calculated fields:\nNextCP\nNextCPPlan\nNextCPFcast\nCPnStatus\nCPnStatusData\nCheck out projects in MS project clients and undertake updates (look at changes) \nNotes:\nUpdated and published PE55555 successfully.\nUndertook schedule updates using PWA schedule as well as updated all three PDP pages successfully.\nHowever, When I attempted to make changes in the schedule PDP page – project task dates (CP date milestone) the PWA schedule pa\nge doesn’t refresh with this new\n data until you click edit.

However, although assigning team members via the PWA works, for some reason the security permissions related to team members does not apply. This is the same as pre SP1 and is not the cause of the SP1 update. Further investigations about this will be undertaken as a BAU issue (as project/team member assignments continue to be used)\n \n– Working as before.\n&#xa0;\nCreate a new Project plan from PED templatesNotes:\nWorking\nRun all reports accessed via quick linksNotes:\nWorking\nAccess Project ProjectSitesNotes:\nWorking\nCheck PDPs are correct (against field list)Notes:\nWorking\nCheck other configuration changeNotes\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPre Production Virtual Client machine:I.P for 09p:\n 10.201.31.24, \nI've added \nSpireen\n 10 and your PPE admin account. \n&#xa0;\n"
