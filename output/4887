defaultEvidence on Counter Terrorism - re: oral evidence default12th defaultNovember default2013 defaultrelatingdefault defaultto Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed ('CC')default&#xa0;
defaultWe regret that we did not have immediate sight of the transcript of the above evidence
default 
defaultgiven to the Committee. We hope nevertheless as the issues are of continuing
default 
defaultimportance in public debate it may still be of assistance for us to provide clarification of
default 
defaulta number of points on which the factual evidence presented to the Committee has, we
default 
defaultbelieve, been incorrect or is deserving of further supporting material for a full
default e
defaultxplanation.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe represented Mr Moha
defaultmed as his solicitors following his arrival in the UK on 14 March 2011, after he had been removed against his will from Somaliland to the UK (as opposed to Somalia where he lived with his wife and child) and was upon arrival placed under a Control Order and required to live in Ipswich.
default&#xa0;
defaultA number of legal challenges came to be made on Mr Mohamed's behalf. All of these have far wider significance than for his case alone. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe central issues on which the courts had to decide were
default:
default&#xa0;
default1
default. 
defaultThe legality of the Control Order imposed on 'CC' at the airport when he arrived in the UK on 14 March 2011.
default2. The subsequent legality of the TPIM (Control Orders having given way to
default 
defaultTPIMs in January 2012). (The challenges to these two orders were
default 
defaultconjoined in proceedings in the High Court.)
default3. The lawfulness of the Schedule 7 examination of CC at Heathrow Airport.
default4. The evidence that supported an allegation of "tampering" with the G4S/GPS
default 
defaulttag worn by him between 19th April and 16th May 2013.
default5. The sequence of the allegations of breaches of the Control Order and the
default 
defaultTPIM and their treatment by the courts.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe start with the period of time in which Mr Mohamed was imprisoned for breaches of
default 
defaultobligations placed upon him by first the Control Order and then the TPIM.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe sequence of the allegations of breaches of the Control Order and the TPIM and their treatment by the courts.
default&#xa0;
defaultMr Moha
defaultmed was arrested, as the evidence given to your Committee by Charles Farr
default 
defaultcorrectly stated, for breaches of the Control Order between August and October 2011.
default 
default(Thereafter he was charged with breaches of the TPIM.) The evidence on this issue
default 
defaultgiven to the Committee, came in answer to questions from Michael Ellis MP
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultQ. "Despite 14 allegations of a breach of a Control Order and 6 allegations of
default 
defaulta breach of TPIMs, he keeps on being re-admitted to bail from custody by
default 
defaultthe courts ... ?" [Further evidence related to a third accusation, concerning
default 
defaultalleged tamper with his tag in relation to which he was released in August
default 
default2013. We comment on this separately.]
default&#xa0;
defaultQ. "If cases of these breaches had not been stayed (pending the High
default 
defaultCourt's consideration of the legality of the Control Order and TPIM),
default 
defaultwould he have been in prison?" "Almost certainly serving a sentence of
default 
defaultmore than a year in prison?"
default&#xa0;
defaultA. (Charles Farr) ''That is correct.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ. "He played the legal system?"
default&#xa0;
defaultA. "I can't comment on that".
default&#xa0;
defaultQ. "No I can".
default&#xa0;
defaultThe comments we would make are these;
default&#xa0;
defaulta) Mr Moha
defaultmed, remanded in custody for the 14 and 6 breaches, had at
default 
defaultthe time of his respective releases on bail, already served over 8 months
default 
defaulton remand in prison. It had already been acknowledged by the
default 
defaultprosecution by the time of his release on 6th August 2013 for the third
default 
default"tamper" allegation, that even if he had been convicted of the previous
default 
defaultbreaches at a subsequent trial, he would have already served more than
default 
defaulthis sentence for those breaches by reason of the time he 
defaulthad already spent in prison
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultb) The context of the 14 and 6 breaches was this; Mr Mohamed had been
default 
defaultseized in what later emerged as a joint "operation" with UK agencies by
default 
defaultforces in Somaliland. The description he subsequently gave was of
default 
defaultsevere ill treatment for two months by Somaliland officers including
default 
defaulttreatment categorised as constituting torture for two months 
defaultâ€“
default the
default 
defaultquestions put to him while detained focussed on information relevant to
default 
defaultthe UK. At the conclusion of his detention in Somaliland, instead of being
default 
defaultreturned as he had asked to Somalia where he had resided for many
default 
defaultyears with his wife and child, he was forcibly removed to the UK.
default 
defaultImmediately on arrival he was placed under a Control Order and required
default 
defaultto live in Ipswich where he knew nobody. He was not only traumatised
default 
defaultfrom his experience beginning on 14th January 2011 (of which medical
default 
defaultevidence was available to the courts) but was entirely isolated in Ipswich.
default 
defaultFor that reason and others, a number of the severe regulations upon him,
default 
defaultimposed by the Control Order were breached by him. At the time of his
default 
defaultarrest, for a second set of breaches, he commented that he preferred to
default 
defaultbe in prison, as at least he would be with other people.
default&#xa0;
defaultc) We feel it necessary to bring to your attention two earlier and not
default 
defaultdissimilar cases of breach of Control Orders, both cases involving
default 
defaultabsconsion (of 
defaultCeri
default 
defaultB
defaultullivant and 'AN') which ended in both cases with
default 
defaulttheir acquittal - in the case of 
defaultCeri
default 
defaultB
defaultullivant by a jury who accepted that
default 
defaulthe had reasonable excuse because of his despair at the crushing of any
default 
defaultnormality of existence for him (the Control Order was subsequently
default 
defaultrevoked by the High Court in any event). Mr 
defaultB
defaultullivant had absconded
default 
defaultfrom the address at which he was required to live, but subsequently
default 
defaultreturned and handed himself in to the police, was arrested, charged and
default 
defaulttried. In the second case 'AN', a Londoner, who was a victim of torture
default 
defaultwhen a student in Syria, was placed on his return to the UK under a
default 
defaultControl Order in Leicester (into a similarly isolated existence). He also
default 
defaultabsconded, was arrested, and spent a lengthy time on remand in
default 
defaultBelmarsh prison. The criminal prosecution against him for breach was
default 
defaultultimately dropped and he was formally acquitted when the Control Order
default 
defaultwas quashed (following a decision in the House of Lords and subsequent
default 
defaultdecision by the High Court that the Control Order was void 
defaultab
default initio
default).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe evidence that supported an allegation of "tampering" with the G4S/GPS tag
default 
defaultworn by him between 19
defaultth
default April 2013 until 16
defaultth
default May 2013
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultd) The third allegation against Mr Mohamed, made on 25th July 2013, was
default 
defaultas Mr Farr correctly stated in evidence based on claims by G4S that he
default 
defaulthad "tampered" with a GPS tag (on the 16th May 2013). The
default 
defaultcircumstances of his being granted bail on that allegation (almost
default 
defaultimmediately) deserve separate attention.
default&#xa0;
defaulte) By the date that he was charged with the alleged tag tamper (as we set
default 
defaultout above) he had served any potential sentence for the outstanding
default 
defaultbreach allegations. Moreover when Mr Mohamed was charged with this
default 
defaultoffence, there were separately before the Central Criminal Court identical
default 
defaultallegations made by G4S in relation to two other unconnected TPIM
default 
defaultwearers of GPS tags, 'TP' and 'CE'. All were granted bail by very
default 
defaultexperienced Old Bailey judges on the basis that the growing statistical
default 
defaultimprobability of tampering by a significant number of TPIM subjects all
default 
defaultwearers of the GPS tag was exceptional.
default&#xa0;
defaultf) On 22nd October 2013 the prosecution communicated formally with this
default 
defaultfirm that it would no longer pursue this tampering case against Mr
default 
defaultMohamed. Simultaneously the prosecution communicated the same
default 
defaultdecision in relation to the other two cases ('CE' and 'TP'). Police at the
default 
defaultsame time indicated to a fourth individual under a TPIM, bailed to return
default 
defaultto the police station on the same allegation, that no further action was to
default 
defaultbe taken in relation to him. A similar approach, to our knowledge, is
default 
defaultcurrently being taken in relation to other cases where the tags are
default 
defaultcracking or malfunctioning in very similar ways. This extraordinary
default 
defaultsituation has we believe been brought about by the following accidental
default 
defaultsequence of events.
default&#xa0;
default(
defaulti
default) By accident of historical representation, this firm was already
default 
defaultrepresenting a number of individuals on TPIMs who were
default 
defaultwearing the new (introduced in or around April 2012) GPS
default 
defaultsatellite tag. A growing number of arrests took place of
default 
defaultseparate individuals, not known to each other all of whom
default 
defaultexpressed astonishment at the allegation by the monitoring
default 
defaultcompany G4S, that they had deliberately interfered with their
default 
defaulttags. (Solicitors representing a further individual reported that a
default 
defaultsimilar allegation had been made in his case.)Two reports of
default 
default"tampering" for two separate individuals came when they had
default 
defaulton separate occasions, in separate cities, been praying in a
default 
defaultmosque.
default&#xa0;
default(ii) Over a period of a year, this firm had already expressed clearly
default 
defaultin writing to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service our
default 
defaultbelief that there was a malfunction of the tags, and that
default 
defaultindividuals were being arrested and prosecuted when the
default 
defaultfailure emanated instead from G4S's faulty equipment and/or
default 
defaultinadequate research. In this regard we attach a note for your
default 
defaultconsideration summarising the position of the evidence within
default 
defaultCC's prosecution and others for the same offence.
default&#xa0;
default(iii) The Committee's attention is drawn to the opinion of Ross
default 
defaultAnderson of Cambridge University (Professor of Security
default 
defaultEngineering at Cambridge University) who raised a very real
default 
defaultconcern that the damage to the tag could be caused by
default 
defaultrecurrent stress fractures (of the kind that for example caused
default 
defaultComet aircraft to be grounded in the past). It appeared to the
default 
defaultindependent experts consulted by the defence that G4S had
default 
defaultplaced the large GPS tag introduced in April 2012 on the same
default 
defaultstrap tested for use only on the much smaller previous tag, with
default 
defaultadditional strain inevitable. It should be noted that no testing,
default 
defaultdespite repeated requests that this issue be considered, to our
default 
defaultknowledge, was done of a further likely cause of strain
default 
defaultinevitably caused by praying five times a day. Requests by
default 
defaultdefence experts to conduct tests and to 
defaulthave access to test
default 
defaultresults to establish (or refute) these clearly stated propositions
default 
defaulthad not been met when the cases were all suddenly
default 
defaultdiscontinued by the CPS.
default&#xa0;
defaultg) On 1st November 2013 this prosecution against Mr Mohamed was
default 
defaultformally discontinued (the prosecution against TP and CE had been
default 
defaultdiscontinued at an earlier hearing on 30
defaultth
default October 2013). We requested
default 
defaultfrom the Prosecution both in writing and orally at the Court the forensic
default 
defaultreasons behind the prosecution's decision to discontinue the cases. The
default 
defaultCourt had expressed itself as sympathetic to the defence request, but as
default 
defaultyet the prosecution have provided only a general answer that there was
default 
default"insufficient evidence to proceed". The same explanation was given by
default 
defaultthe Home Secretary in her reply to your raising of the same question in
default 
defaultthe debate on 4th November 2013;
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultI urge her to look at the role of the G4S and the tags that have been
default 
defaultprovided
default".
default&#xa0;
defaultThe adequacy of the Secretary of State's answer is one with which we are
default 
defaultbound to take issue;
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultthe police believe that in this case the tag functioned exactly as it should
default 
defaulthave done ..... he referred to the court case. The issue was not about the
default 
defaulteffectiveness of the tags, but about weakening the evidence threshold for
default 
defaulttaking a criminal prosecution in relation to the operation of the tags
default".
default&#xa0;
defaulth) No answer given to date has provided any satisfactory explanation as to
default 
defaulthow three entirely separate individuals came to be arrested and
default 
defaultprosecuted on the basis of claimed "scientific evidence" and how it was
default 
defaultthat all three prosecutions came to be discontinued following a direct
default 
defaultchallenge in advance of any trial by the defence to the reliability of the
default 
defaultG4S tags.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaulti
default) Our concern regarding the issue of tags remains, following the evidence
default 
defaultof David Anderson QC at your Committee's hearing on 12th November
default 
default2013. The impression may have been left that no one now accused of
default 
defaulttampering with their tag can be prosecuted. This is very far from the case.
default 
defaultThere have been many prosecutions in the past and no doubt ongoing for
default 
defaulttampering allegations relating to the smaller tag. No doubt also there can
default 
defaultand will be in the future prosecutions for damage or interference with the
default 
defaultlarger GPS tags. What is the issue here in these particular cases is very
default 
defaultspecific, that without evidence that the individuals had actually tried to
default 
defaultremove their tags evidence of strain on the tag strap was repeatedly
default 
defaultinterpreted as deliberate "tampering". The claimed scientific opinion on
default 
defaultwhich each prosecution relied can be summarised thus: that there was no
default 
defaultinnocent explanation for the strain.
default&#xa0;
defaultj) We note that the Committee received private evidence from G4S about
default 
defaultthe tags. We do not know the reasons for this. Clearly we have a
default 
defaultconcern that at present no one, including the Committee knows why Mr
default 
defaultMohamed's case, and others, were discontinued. This is not intended to
default 
defaultconstitute an abstract quest for information. Not only did the individuals in
default 
defaultquestion spend time in prison before bail (unusually) was granted by
default 
defaultjudges at the Old Bailey in each case, on the basis of these allegations,
default 
defaultbut the G4S GPS tags are still being used. The question relates of course
default 
defaultfurthermore to matters concerning the public purse. (In the accompanying
default 
defaultnote we refer to the report by NAPO of June 2012, identifying concern as
default 
defaultto "technical failures" of electronic tags generally, not limited to the larger
default 
defaultGPS model.)
default&#xa0;
defaultk) We would welcome making available any further material that might
default 
defaultassist to the Committee should it wish to conduct further examination of
default 
defaultthis issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe lawfulness of the Schedule 7 stop
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn his arrival at Heathrow airport on 14 March 2011 Mr Mohamed was detained and
default 
defaultquestioned for 6 hours under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. Approximately 118
default 
defaultquestions were prepared and submitted by the Security Service to the Counterterrorism
default 
defaultUnit of the Metropolitan Police Service for this examination. Furthermore before the
default 
defaultSchedule 7 interview the interviewing officers were instructed by email in the following
default 
defaultterms:
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultWe would be grateful if you would NOT be drawn into any discussion with MOHAMED
default 
defaultregarding HMG [Her Majesty's Government] involvement in his arrest. You should be
default 
defaultaware that any such write up is likely to be disclosable in any future civil proceedings.
default"
default&#xa0;
defaultThe above evidence was given in the court proceedings that followed the imposition of
default 
defaulta control order on Mr Mohamed at Heathrow airport. In separate judicial review
default 
defaultproceedings brought on behalf of Mr Mohamed to examine the legality of the stop,
default 
defaultCollins J found his detention and questioning under Schedule 7 to be unlawful. The
default 
defaultquestioning was not being conducted for the purpose of the Act, namely to establish
default 
defaultwhether or not he was involved in acts of terrorism, as the SSHD already was claiming
default 
defaulthe was, and had made a Control Order on that basis even before he had been
default 
defaultdetained in Somaliland (explained below)). Instead it was argued, the stop was being
default 
defaultconducted for an unlawful purpose, of getting information from Mr Mohamed that was
default 
defaultnot tainted by torture in Somaliland. We provide the decision of Mr Justice Collins
default 
defaultdated 20 December 2011. This judgment is of importance, beyond Mr Mohamed's
default 
defaultcase, defining the breadth of Schedule 7 powers. The fact of the Schedule 7 stop links
default 
defaultwith the further issue canvassed below as to the British authorities' knowledge of Mr
default 
defaultMohamed's detention in Somaliland and his treatment there, and in turn to the wider
default 
defaultissue of the UK's alleged complicity in unlawful acts outside the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Legality of the Control Order
default/
defaultTPIM
default&#xa0;
defaultThe legality of the Control Order
default/
defaultTPIM itself was in question throughout after Mr
default 
defaultMohamed was notified of its existence at Heathrow Airport on 14th March 2011. That
default 
defaultissue is at present listed to be considered by the Court of Appeal on 23rd January 2014.
default 
defaultThe appeal, due to be heard together with a second linked case CF, will consider very
default 
defaultserious allegations regarding the potential complicity of the UK Government (and its
default 
defaultagents) in unlawful acts including the arrest, detention, torture in Somaliland and
default 
defaultsubsequent unlawful deportation of both CC and CF. It has been argued, that but for
default 
defaultthe unlawful actions of the UK, Mr Mohamed would not have been within the jurisdiction
default 
defaultto be the subject of a Control Order.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are aware that you already identified the fundamental question; i.e. why was Mr
default 
defaultMohamed in the UK at all? He at no time, we confirm, wished to be. We observe that
default 
defaultthe Committee was not provided with a considerable amount of evidence available to
default 
defaultthe Home Office, on the record within previous court hearings, that could have provided
default 
defaultthe answer to your question.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe sequence of the events leading up to Mr Mohamed's arrival in the UK on 14 March
default 
default2011 was as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultUp until his arrival Mr Mohamed had lived in Somalia since 2007, with his wife with
default 
defaultwhom he had a child. His wife was pregnant with their second child. Mr Mohamed had
default 
defaultno intention of returning to the UK. Nevertheless on 13th January 2011, whilst he was
default 
defaultoutside of the jurisdiction in Somaliland, the Secretary of State for the Home
default D
defaultepartment sought and was granted permission from the High Court to make a non
default-
defaultderogating
default 
defaultControl Order, i.e. a UK executive measure that can be applied 
defaultonly to
default 
defaultpersons who are within the UK
default. On 14th January 2011, 
defaultthe day after
default the Control Order
default 
defaultwas made, Mr Mohamed was arrested and detained in Somaliland in what was
default 
defaultdescribed by the local media as a 
defaultâ€œ
defaultJoint security op
defaulteration of Somalil
defaultand and British
default 
defaultintelligence
default". 
defaultMr Mohamed subsequently reported that during the two months of his
default 
defaultdetention in Somaliland that followed he had been tortured and subjected to inhumane
default 
defaulttreatment without any recourse to legal due process. On 13th March 2011, he was
default 
defaultremoved from Somaliland, despite requesting that he be returned to Somalia to his wife
default 
defaultand child, on a one-way travel document provided by British officials in the British
default 
defaultEmbassy in Addis Ababa. On his arrival at Heathrow airport, he was detained and
default 
defaultquestioned unlawfully, as the High Court held, under Schedule 7 TA 2000. The
default 
defaultquestions mirrored those asked when he was interrogated in Somaliland, including
default 
defaultunder torture.
default&#xa0;
defaultSerious questions concerning the UK's complicity in Mr Mohamed's treatment in
default 
defaultSomaliland were directly raised within Mr Mohamed's Control Order
default/
defaultTPIM challenge.
default 
defaultWhilst part of the proceedings were conducted in secret session, nevertheless
default 
defaultevidence was disclosed in open session that supported Mr Mohamed's contentions
default 
default(and those of "CF"). That open evidence we suggest must cast considerable doubt on
default 
defaultthe evidence given to the Committee on 1
default2th
default November 2013 in which the Home Office
default 
defaultwitness Mr Farr stated (in response to your question as to why Mr Mohamed was in the
default 
defaultUK) that the British Government had, "
defaultan obligation .... to arrange his removal back to
default 
defaultthe UK
default'.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe full background necessarily underscores very serious questions; the degree of
default 
defaultknowledge and involvement of the British authorities in Mr Mohamed's arrest, treatment
default 
defaultand forcible return back to this country, with the intention of placing him on a Control
default 
defaultOrder (at cost not only to him but to the public purse), that Control Order having been
default 
defaultmade some two months before his arrival on UK soil. The impression the Committee
default 
defaultmay have at present is that Somaliland had instigated the request for his return to the
default 
defaultUK after lawful detention there, and on their own volition, without the involvement of the
default 
defaultUK hitherto.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe hope that this letter may serve to demonstrate the complex and serious issues that
default 
defaultwere raised during the passage of the cases concerning Mr Mohamed.
