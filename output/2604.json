"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Gender Hub [WAS0041]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe report examined two key issues within the context of newspaper coverage during the London 2012 Olympics.\n&#xa0;\nFirst,\n \nthe\n interdependent relationship \nof mainstream media and certain sports and second, the gendering of\n sport and media.\n \n&#xa0;\nMedia platforms have over the past twenty years developed technologically and \nsome sports have benefited\n more than others from building relationships with media in general and in particular TV. The revenue from\n \nTV rights has been import\nant in the growth and global dominance of men’s football/soccer. G\nolf\n, boxing and cricket are\n \nalso \nwinners\n as are big events like the Olympics. \n&#xa0;\nMore than any other event the Olympics provides a platform for men and women athletes from many sports to deli\nver entertainment to global audiences. The sporting drama of failure and success, resilience and heroism, leadership and loyalty is spellbinding and for millions of people is a window into the sporting world.\n&#xa0;\nSuch media and sport \nrelationship\ns\n \nare unique, yet they have become a widespread benchmark for judging media approaches to different sports and sporting events. Alongside this benchmark is often an argument suggesting that media should be more open to a model of fairness which means shared \ncoverage \nand as such greater access to financial success.\n&#xa0;\nThe Gender Hub who undertook this research believe gende\nr, sport and media are a nexus\n which together can effect greater understanding about the value of social change \nand serves to diminish\n social\n inequalities. In order for such change to be realised sport and media organisations have an important role\n that\n can be enhanced by engaging with gender specialists who work in these sectors.  \n&#xa0;\nWomen are increasingly breaking down barriers in business, ar\nts, science and sport\n. W\nhile superficially numbers are greater in all areas, structural change is slow.  Drawing on the analysis of newspaper data (over 2000 pages) collected during four weeks in 2012 when the London Olympics were held\n we want \nto encourage\n more sophisticated debates\n. Such debates could include professionalism and grassroots sport, resource allocation of finance and media, leadership and governance of sporting bodies and the influence of gender in all aspects of sport.  We want to\n facilitate\n more effec\ntive and inclusive strategies that can\n be employed by \nsporting bodies and media owners to deliver a broader and deeper menu of men’s and women’s sport\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
