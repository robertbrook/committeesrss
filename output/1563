[normal]Introduction.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]First
[normal] it has about a 20% higher efficiency (about 80% achievable double that of thermal coal) and second carbon (or carbon fuels) are much easier to store than hydrogen. 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The waste product fro a DCFC is a stream pure CO2 so no additional capt
[normal]ure technology is required, although 
[normal]compression and storage are still required. 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide a mechanism for massive energy storage combined with on demand power generation which can support renewable power generation.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide a more effic
[normal]ient power train for large scale transport (e.g. shipping) that could include carbon capture to reduce, possibly eliminate, carbon emissions.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide a much cleaner and much more efficient waste to energy conversion from non-recyclable waste plastic compar
[normal]ed to incineration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In short the DCFC is a disruptive technology for clean power generation[bold] form carbon, or carbon based, fuels.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About [bold]DCFC[bold] Technology[bold]&#xa0;
