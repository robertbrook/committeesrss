EIS 01[bold]Written evidence submitted by Dr Teal Riley representing the British Antarctic Survey[bold]I am the senior geologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and although mineral and hydrocarbon extraction are forbidden in Antarctica (south of 60°S) as a consequence of the Antarctic Treaty, I still feel BAS has a role to play in the future planning of mineral activities in the Arctic and sub-Antarctic.
[normal]Although the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is not directly involved in the mineral resources and extractive industry sector, it has a very broad knowledge base, combined with current expertise and modern surveying platforms (ships, aircraft).  This knowledge and expertise extends to the Arctic and sub-Antarctic regions. Mineral resources activities in the Antarctic region are currently prohibited under the Antarctic Treaty.
[normal]BAS is increasingly playing a significant role in the Arctic region as a result of the Natural Environment Research Council defining the scientific and research remit of BAS to encompass both Polar Regions. Our geologists have involvement in initial surveys in southern Greenland to assess rare earth element (REE) deposits and a project is underway to develop the use of airborne surveying equipment to remotely identify REE deposits as a precursor to detailed field surveys.
[normal]I n the Southern Ocean, we have field geologists who have worked on sub-Antarctic islands, including the Falkland Islands, and have compiled geological maps of the region. Our primary research ship, the RRS James Clark Ross, has compiled multiple seismic and bathymetric surveys of the Scotia Sea.
[normal]Although mineral resource activity is prohibited in the Antarctic, BAS has compilations of geological maps and data of British Antarctic Territory acquired over the last 50 years.
