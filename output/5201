[normal] 
[normal]Gatwick
[normal] 
[normal]planned
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]response
[normal] 
[normal]accordingly
[normal] 
[normal]alongside
[normal] 
[normal]its 
[normal]airport
[normal] 
[normal]partners.
[normal]2.2
[normal] 
[normal]However
[normal] 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]4:15am
[normal] 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]24 December
[normal] 
[normal]Gatwick
[normal] 
[normal]received
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]flood
[normal] 
[normal]warning
[normal] 
[normal]call
[normal] 
[normal]from
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Environment
[normal] 
[normal]Agency warning
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]River
[normal] 
[normal]Mole
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] 
[normal]burst
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]banks
[normal] 
[normal]within
[normal] 
[normal]30
[normal] 
[normal]minutes
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]first
[normal] 
[normal]time
[normal] 
[normal]since
[normal] 
[normal]1967.
[normal]2.3 This was the first
[normal] warning that the threat to the airport's
[normal] 
[normal]operations
[normal] 
[normal]was from severe flooding
[normal] 
[normal]as well as
[normal] 
[normal]high winds. This obviously
[normal] 
[normal]requires a very different sort of contingency planning. Overnight rainfall of over
[normal] 
[normal]68mm in the area significantly
[normal] 
[normal]exceeded Met Office foreca
[normal]sts causing the worst flooding in the airport's living memory.
[normal]2.4 Gatwick issued its first passenger communications via twitter at 4:29am about possible
[normal]      
[normal]disruption.
[normal]2.5
[normal] 
[normal]As
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]result
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]rain
[normal] 
[normal]two
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]six
[normal] 
[normal]switch-rooms
[normal] 
[normal]located
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]North
[normal] 
[normal]Terminal
[normal] 
[normal]flooded,
[normal] 
[normal]knocking
[normal] 
[normal]out 
[normal]much
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]power.
[normal]2.6 Simultaneously on the airfield three substations flooded and the Runway Instrument Landing System was
[normal] 
[normal]disabled. This is a known
[normal] 
[normal]and understood risk and the contingency
[normal] 
[normal]worked with the backup generators kicking 
[normal]in to provide
[normal] 
[normal]continuity of power.
[normal] 
[normal]The South Terminal continued
[normal] 
[normal]to operate as normal and the airfield remained operational throughout.
[normal]2.7 However by 7:30am it was clear that the damage to the North Terminal switch-room
[normal] 
[normal]was severe and 
[normal]that 
[normal]full power
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] not be reinstated to the North Terminal on Christmas Eve.
[normal]2.8
[normal] 
[normal]By
[normal] 
[normal]9:00am
[normal] 
[normal]we
[normal] 
[normal]had
[normal] 
[normal]issued
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]statement
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]all
[normal] 
[normal]media
[normal] 
[normal]outlets
[normal] 
[normal]about
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]situation
[normal] 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]airport.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.[bold] [bold] [bold]Performance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal] 
[normal]With
[normal] 
[normal]Christmas
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]mind
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]imperative
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]get
[normal] 
[normal]passengers
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]their
[normal] 
[normal]destination
[normal] 
[normal]rather
[normal] 
[normal]than
[normal] 
[normal]cancel
[normal] 
[normal]all 
[normal]flights
[normal] 
[normal]from
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]North
[normal] 
[normal]Terminal,
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]decision
[normal] 
[normal]was
[normal] 
[normal]taken
[normal] 
[normal]jointly
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] 
[normal]airline
[normal] 
[normal]partners
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]move
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]majority 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]these
[normal] 
[normal]flights
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]South
[normal] 
[normal]Terminal.
[normal] 
[normal]This
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]logistically
[normal] 
[normal]very
[normal] 
[normal]challenging
[normal] 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]best
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]times.
[normal]3.2 66 
[normal]additional
[normal] 
[normal]back office staff were deployed into the Terminal buildings to assist passengers.
[normal]3.3 Overall on 24 December of the originally scheduled 258 departures, 186 departed the airport, albeit some with delays.
[normal]3.4 However 67 of the North Terminal depa
[normal]rtures were ultimately cancelled, many of them quite late in the day.
[normal]3.5 A rapid recovery enabled Gatwick to fly a full schedule on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and onwards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] [bold] [bold]Flood [bold]Preparations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 Since the change of ownership
[normal] 
[normal]in 2009, Gatwick has, 
[normal]with the full backing of its new shareholders, invested over £1bn with the end aim of transforming Gatwick into a world-leading airport
[normal] 
[normal]capable of competing successfully.
[normal]4.2 This investment programme included over £20 million in mitigating and alleviating
[normal] flood risk.
[normal]4.3 The majority of this investment
[normal] 
[normal]has been focused on the South Terminal, which had been assessed as having a 1 in 20 year risk of flooding. These works were successful in preventing flooding of the
[normal] 
[normal]South Terminal during the recent exception
[normal]al weather.
[normal]4.4 The North Terminal had been assessed in 2008 as being at a low risk of flooding- less than a 1in 100 year risk.
[normal]4.5 Gatwick will be working with the Environment
[normal] 
[normal]Agency to reassess all flood modeling, and provides
[normal] 
[normal]an unqualified assurance th
[normal]at all necessary further
[normal] 
[normal]investment will be carried out as a matter
[normal] 
[normal]of urgency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold] [bold] [bold]Passengers[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 Despite the lack of warning and despite the flooding
[normal] 
[normal]and the subsequent loss of the switch rooms at the North Terminal it is clear that there is a lot more
[normal] Gatwick could ·and should · have done with
[normal] 
[normal]its airport partners to help make the disruption as painless as possible for passengers.
[normal]5.2 Gatwick did attempt to communicate
[normal] 
[normal]with passengers via twitter, issuing over 300 tweets
[normal] 
[normal]on the day. It also issued thre
[normal]e media statements
[normal] 
[normal]which were sent to key news rooms and media outlets
[normal] 
[normal]as well as briefing local and national media throughout the day.
[normal]5.3 As an Airport
[normal] 
[normal]Gatwick sets itself very high standards in performance and customer service. It 
[normal]has worked hard along 
[normal]with its airport
[normal] 
[normal]partners to achieve a good reputation for dealing with disruptions. On this occasion Gatwick's actions and those of its airport
[normal] 
[normal]partners fell short.
[normal]5.4 Gatwick has offered
[normal] 
[normal]each passenger whose flight was cancelled £100 of high street vouc
[normal]hers as a goodwill gesture. The McMillan review {see 6.1) will focus in particular
[normal] 
[normal]on how Gatwick can learn the lessons for the future. At times like this passenger information and comfort must always be a priority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.[bold] [bold] [bold]Review[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 David McMillan, a Non 
[normal]Executive Director at Gatwick, is leading a comprehensive review of what happened, the lessons that can be learnt and what actions are required to avoid a reoccurrence.
[normal]6.2 David McMillan is Chair of the Board of Governors of the Flight Safety Foundation a
[normal]nd was Director
[normal] 
[normal]General of Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates air traffic
[normal] 
[normal]across 40 European states, from 2008 to 2012. Before that he was UK Director General of Civil Aviation and spoke for Europe on environmental issues at ICAO. Earlier in his career, he 
[normal]led for Government on the establishment
[normal] 
[normal]of the NATS PPP and was Secretary to the RUCATSE study on airport
[normal] 
[normal]capacity in South East England. David started his career in the Diplomatic Service and is a fellow
[normal] 
[normal]of both the Chartered Institute of
[normal] 
[normal]Transport and th
[normal]e Royal Aeronautical Society.
[normal]6.3 The Review will be published in February.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold] [bold] [bold]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1 There is never a good time for something like this to happen but Gatwick Airport recognises that Christmas Eve is probably the worst with so many passengers tr
[normal]avelling to be with their families over the festive period.
[normal]7.2 Gatwick Airport
[normal] 
[normal]will learn the lessons, make any additional
[normal] 
[normal]investment required
[normal] 
[normal]and continue
[normal] 
[normal]to do everything it can to give its customers the quality of service they should expect.
[normal]7.3 Gatwic
[normal]k Airport's Chief Executive extends a sincere apology to those whose travel plans were disrupted.
