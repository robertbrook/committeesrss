"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nAlan White\n (CYS0022)\n&#xa0;\nI have been cycling regular for many years mostly in the Midlands. I do voluntary work to support cycling through \nSustrans\n and the CTC. Through this work I talk to many \npeople and especially would be cyclists. I have assisted with adult cycle training. The message I hear over and over again particularly from would be cyclists is \"I would not cycle on road - \nits\n too dangerous\". I used to spend a lot of time trying to refut\ne this argument, but sadly I am afraid I am beginning to believe them myself. My own perception is that cycling has become significantly less safe and consequently I am now much more selective over when and where I cycle.\nThe recent deaths in London are a \ngreat sadness \nto me, but I also feel \nenormous frustration because at the strategic level the problems are well understood and the answers known. These were articulated in the Get Britain \nC\nycling\n \nR\neport\n which received unanimous support in the commons.\n I\nQuit\ne simply you need segregation between a 100kg cyclist \ntraveling\n at 10mph and cars and \nlorries\n with a mass 20-300 times greater, perhaps \ntraveling\n 3 times as fast.\nWhilst this situation prevails, talk about education, training, \nbehaviour\n, helmets\n, headphone\ns \netc. is just whistling in the wind. I am frustrated that the media and politicians focus on cyclist \nbehaviour\n normally citing jumping of red lights. Whilst I agree this is unacceptable it p\nai\nls\n into insignificance compared with motorists who speed, pass \ntoo close to cyclists and generally drive without due care and attention. Cycling in cities has become an extreme sport only to be attempted by the young confident and fit. \nIt doesn't have to be like this. One only has to look overseas to Holland. Here cy\ncling is a normal activity carried out daily by young and old. Cyclists are not kitted out in body \narmour\n, but they do have a proper segregated infrastructure. \nThe Dutch reap enormous benefits from this infrastructure by providing a viable way to travel w\nhich reduces congestion and make cities more \nliveable\n .\n In turn this benefits the environment and the nation's health. This vision cannot be achieved overnight it requires vision, it requires leadership and it requires investment. Sadly I see none of these\n.\nAs I cyclist myself for more than 30 years I have witnessed cycling becoming increasingly dangerous. I now very carefully choose when and where I cycle. There are very few segregated cycle routes available to me and even these are in a poor state of repa\nir.\nThe strategic solution will not happen overnight, so I would suggest the following tactical changes\n:\n- make 20mph the default speed limit where people live;\n- equip lorries with sensors\n to cover blind spots\n- ban \nhgvs\n during rush hour\n- more traffic in\nfringement enforcement \n- more cyclist awareness training for motorists . \n- \nmore\n cycle training particularly for adults\nI must stress that these are tactical, and must not been seen as a substitute for a fit for purpose infrastructure.\nDo not on any accou\nnt make helmets compulsory or ban cycling in any way. This is not solving the problem, but admitting defeat.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
