[[[Who we are]]]

[[[ and where our perspective comes from.]]]&#xa0;Revolution Consulting Limited (“Revolution”) has operated exclusively in the arena of local government commissioning and procurement since 2006. &#xa0;Our lead consultant has been involved in the Children’s Homes sector since 2000, having gained experience as Managing Director of the largest provider of Children’s Homes in England at the time. He also created a completely new specialist Children’s Homes business between 2007-2012.&#xa0;In parallel with that experience of providing Children’s Homes services, Revolution Consulting has worked on a variety of projects, each involved in the commissioning of services for looked after children.&#xa0;Since 2006 Revolution has therefore gained experience through delivery of consultancy and support projects in the sector including:&#xa0;&#xa0;Our lead consultant in this area is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants with a substantial range of commercial experience in several sectors. It is the commercial and financial aspects of procurement for looked after children that are the core of our work, with a particular focus on the interaction of the commercial aspects with the professional childcare and education.&#xa0;Revolution produces publications on the financial performance of provider sectors, initially under the auspices of the Commissioning Support Programme and more recently on an independent basis. &#xa0;These analyses add weight to our view that commissioning and procurement in the looked after children services sector is sub-optimal both for the young people and for efficiency and further development. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[“A wider perspective]]]

[[[.]]]

[[[”]]]&#xa0;The abuse of even one Children’s Home resident is shocking.&#xa0;We need to set aside whether we are from government, private sector or charity and work together to stringently understand how we can bring about improvements in the way we care for looked after children so as to do everything we can to avoid such instances.&#xa0;Those with insight into the way that the systems work within local authority and children’s homes, but who have not seen details of investigations into the cases in Rochdale and elsewhere can only think about how we ourselves have operated and how we might have prevented the abuse. We can only therefore begin to offer the inquiry the questions it may need to ask of the Department for Education to ensure that the most experienced minds have been applied to analyzing the fine detail of how the cases came about.&#xa0;There would appear to be some worthwhile regulation and systems enhancements being proposed that specifically target some areas where weaknesses may be present. &#xa0;It is our view however that a wider perspective is needed. &#xa0;The current marketplace of children’s homes services has evolved without strategic vision related to need at a national, regional, or even sometimes at a local level. &#xa0;The relationships of purchasers and providers do not currently create an environment that attracts investment or innovation, and instead has considerable financial pressures that add to tensions between parties who should be working together. The risk is therefore that such pressures (or just the perception that there may be such pressures) may impinge upon the paramount need to act promptly in the best interests of the children placed. This is the case on both the part of the provider and of the purchaser.&#xa0;We need a children’s homes system where the very staff in daily contact with the young person are empowered to keep that young person safe, come what may. &#xa0;We need a system where the adults involved are skilled and professional enough to remove the pressures of financial constraints and private vs. public sector tensions, so that the child receives a focused, responsive and excellent service at all times.&#xa0;It’s about people not just about process.

[[[. Our responses to the specific questions raised]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[a. Are the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes appropriate and sufficient?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The Department for Education’s work in the area of Children’s Homes is, as stated in the consultation documents themselves, a response to the terrible cases of abuse in Rochdale.&#xa0;Since the investigations that followed those investigations there have been similar cases reported elsewhere in the country. Reports are shocking and demands for action are understandable.&#xa0;However, in such times of heightened focus it is important to maintain a measured and informed approach, as to react in wide ranging ways may cause unforeseen problems elsewhere.&#xa0;There are difficulties from the outset because some of the information about the instances of abuse is not in the public domain. Rightly, some information is undoubtedly confidential to protect victims. However, the questions that come to mind based on only what has been published in the public domain are:&#xa0;How many of the abuse cases in Rochdale, and elsewhere, involved children placed in Children’s Homes? It would appear that there were some, but they were a small minority of cases? Let us be clinically factual wherever we can.&#xa0;Is sufficient attention being given to address the protection of the other cohorts involved? (e.g. Children not in care, children in foster care, children in residential special schools?). i.e. Is this not a wider set of issues than Children’s Homes? Where in the wider policies and practices of local authorities and police forces will the Children’s Homes specific proposals fit?&#xa0;In the cases involving Children’s Homes, have serious case reviews or other investigations been performed to identify the issues that contributed to the abusers gaining continuing access to the abused?&#xa0;It is our experience that there are many safeguards that can prevent this type of abuse, including:&#xa0;Appropriateness of placement – matching needs to those of other residents, to the strengths of the staff group at the specific home and organizational strengths. Has a dispassionate review been carried out as to whether the children abused in Rochdale and elsewhere appropriately placed in those homes in the first place?&#xa0;There are then factors that a good provider would have had in place:&#xa0;Appropriateness of location – our experience as providers of services for the most vulnerable young people is to do some of the most common sense things. Obvious amongst these is to open homes in more rural, out of town places. This reduces the risks associated with more urbanized areas, can act as a disincentive to absconding behavior, and allows close management of the most vulnerable. &#xa0;Appropriateness of staff skills and procedures to distract and divert from absconding – good providers have skilled and experienced staff who use a range of interpersonal skills to try distract young people from attempting to abscond. Whilst Children’s Homes cannot lock young people into the home, a really good staff group, aware of the young person’s likely behavior, will have developed a number of strategies to try to keep the young person otherwise engaged and occupied. &#xa0;Even where a young person does manage to leave the home, a good provider, aware of the risks, should have procedures in place respond immediately themselves. Whilst these are likely to include prompt notification to the local police (under protocols agreed locally well before the home becomes operational), it can also include practical and immediate response from the staff themselves. We have had experience of homes where the staff has access to a “grab bag” containing mobile phone, waterproof clothing, snacks and drinks, which allows them to grab the bag and follow the absconding person immediately. The presence of a staff member following an absconding young person can be a huge disincentive to those looking to harm a young person. &#xa0;Good homes assiduously and promptly report and follow up absconding incidents. Social workers within the home and from the authority need to urgently address the causes of the behavior and to agree interim action plans to try to manage future risk.&#xa0;In cases where the assessment is of continuing risk of the behavior, and risk management is not sufficiently possible, then commercial drivers must be set aside in favour of a removal of the child to another, safer location and placement. Good providers must always put the young person’s interests ahead of commercial implications. We have experience of the placing authority not being responsive enough in such a situation and as a provider having to proactively serve notice to end placements where we felt unable to keep the young person safe.&#xa0;There are similarly practice issues on the placing authority side to be examined:&#xa0;Did the homes involved in Rochdale et al, proactively call on social worker and IRO for reviews if absconding was an issue?How responsive and proactive were the professionals from the local authority in dealing with the cases?&#xa0;How well were the authority monitoring the placement?&#xa0;How well were the placing authorities monitoring the home and organisation under their placement contract?&#xa0;How well were Ofsted monitoring the home?&#xa0;&#xa0;What we don’t know about these cases is where any of these protections failed. &#xa0;Can the DfE assure us of a clear linkage in their suggestions and proposals to the specific areas of weaknesses? &#xa0;Are any of the proposals in danger of being the momentum of the focus and getting too far ahead of the actual problems?&#xa0;Is there a danger of “Sledgehammer to crack a nut”?&#xa0;Are the problems in fact rooted in with wider practices of the social care system, in operational failings of social work and procurement practices in some authorities?&#xa0;&#xa0;There is assumption in the consultation that the fact that some of the young people involved were placed away from their “home” authority is a substantial issue. &#xa0;The out of authority issue has been a theme for over a decade, and whilst it may be related to the cases in Rochdale was it the major causal factor?&#xa0;How many out of authority placements are inappropriate?&#xa0;These questions need testing with an expert panel of social work professionals who have accumulated experience of the cohorts and of children’s homes placements. Let’s apply our best knowledge to properly analyse the situation at a detailed case by case level.&#xa0;This leads us to what we believe are possibly some of the most important underlying issues – failures in commissioning and procurement and monitoring practice. We have recently responded to another inquiry into Local Government Procurement in some detail, focusing specifically of the failings of commissioning in the children’s services arena (copies of our response are available upon request).&#xa0;These failures are harder to address as they involve performance of the whole care and education systems, but avoiding issues in the future may be better served by efforts here as well.&#xa0;A key theme of that response is that the solutions have to be people, not process focused. It is of course more difficult to prescribe what is meant by that, but a healthier partnership between purchasers and providers of children’s homes is required to properly protect the very young people both are supposed to be serving.&#xa0;With so much Children’s Homes provision now in the private sector there are issues needing to be addressed about the interface of public and private sectors in areas such as services for vulnerable people. A higher standard of cross-sector understanding and working is required to set clear boundaries between commercial pressures and delivery of services to meet needs.&#xa0;This area requires more debate and development than this response has the capacity for, but we remain committed to contributing our expertise to that work.

[[[ the reforms are likely to prove effective or further measures are needed]]]

[[[?]]]&#xa0;Some of the proposals and efforts may be worthwhile, and certainly many should be implemented if there is a chance they will improve things.&#xa0;But ultimately it’s a real time issue. The manager and staff at a children’s home need to be empowered to identify arising absconding and abuse issues, to deal with them in real time, to divert, to distract, to follow the young person where possible, and to involve police where there are suspicions, and ultimately if all of those fail then to insist on the local authority acting immediately to remove a child to a safer place elsewhere.&#xa0;Real life and circumstances are more volatile and changeable than risk assessments and monthly inspections and historical reporting can deal with.It’s not therefore always about changes in regulation and guidance, it’s about making sure the people dealing with the children day in day out are empowered and motivated to look after those children to the best of their abilities at all times, and that they are challenged to do so by outstanding homes and organisations working in close partnership with placing authorities and with police. &#xa0;Excellence in commissioning, procurement and monitoring allied to clear, informed national, regional and local strategies are the bedrock of creating long term sustainable and excellent children’s homes of the type most likely to be needed as close to where they are needed as possible given the overall population volatility. This is the environment which would be most likely to minimize the risks of Rochdale style abuse of a Children’s Homes resident in future. &#xa0;As mentioned earlier, we believe that developments are needed to significantly refine the interface between public sector purchasers and private sector providers where the services are for vulnerable children and young adults. Detailed work is needed in areas such as:&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013
