"Written evidence from the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies (LTC 32)This submission is made on behalf of the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies, a UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence established in 2008 and comprising a network of leading tobacco control researchers from \nten\n UK universities. \nA full list of the researchers involved in the Centre, and \nbackground information on the objectives and activity of the Centre\n,\n \nis \navailable at www.ukctcs.org.\n \nTobacco smoking is highly addictive and \nthe largest avoidable cause of ill-health, chronic disease and premature death in the UK. The adverse effects of smoking \ncontribute to the causation and/or exacerbation of all \nof the chronic conditions listed by the Select Committee in this call for evidence, \nwith the possible exception of epilepsy. Preventing smoking is crucial to the primary and secondary prevention of these chronic conditions. \nAs particular examples, smoking causes over 80% of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer in the UK\n,\n \nand smoking cessation is the only intervention that has a significant impact on disease progression in COPD. Around 20% of deaths from ischaemic heart disease, and 60% of those from aortic aneurysm,\n \nare attributable to smoking\n,\n \nand smoking prevention contributed more to the \ndecline \nin mortality from heart disease in the UK over recent decades than \nalmost \nall other interventions combined\n.\n \nSmoking among people with mental health problems accounts for the majority of reduced life expectancy of this group,\n and has been particularly neglected; in contrast to the progressive downward trend in smoking prevalence, to around 20%, in the general\n \npopulation, the prevalence of smoking among people with mental health problems has remained static at around 40% for the past two decades. \nAny strategy to improve and prevent morbidity and mortality from long term conditions should therefore have smoking prevention and harm reduction at its core. It is of particular importance to promote all population-level p\nreventive strategies, including the use of price, media campaigns, smoke-free policies, preventing direct and indirect advertising and promotion (for example through smoking in films marketed to children and young people) and pursuing harm reduction strategies by making alternative sources of nicotine available to the general population. At individual level, it is also essential to build smoking cessation and harm reduction into the delivery of routine care for all chronic and long-term conditions. This is especially important for those with mental health problems, for whom smoking remains culturally accepted and even facilitated by healthcare professionals, who should instead be providing treatments and support to help smokers to quit. \nA recent joint report by the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Psychiatrists\n, led by UKCTCS members but with contributions from over 30 experts,\n drew attention to the major impact that smoking has in reducing quantity and quality of life among people with mental health problems. Key conclusions include: \nRecent draft guidance published by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on smoking cessation in secondary care settings,\n and on tobacco harm reduction,\n provide the practical guidance necessary to ensure that smoking cessation interventions become properly integrated into NHS care delivery. We recommend that the Committee considers this guidance, and ways to ensure implementation, and particularly in relation to mental health settings, in its review of services for chronic and long-term conditions. \nPreventing smoking probably has more to offer in terms of preventing and ameliorating long-term conditions than any other measure. \nThe UKCTCS is an ESRC funded Investment.
