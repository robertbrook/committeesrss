[normal]My submission [bold]concentrates on some key statistics [bold]and [bold]on [bold]data that is either misleading or has been omitted [bold]by Ministers, HS2 Ltd and the Department of Transport [bold]in an attempt to hide the risks and flaws in the HS2 project[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.[bold] [bold]KPMG report[bold]A simple analysis in a paper by Trans
[normal]port Watch UK demonstrates how absurd the KPMG figure of £15bn is.

[normal]M
[normal]inisters
[normal], MPs and until recently the HS2 web site, equate HS2 to the spend on Crossrail.  The gr
[normal]aph below demonstrates how utterly false and misleading that comparison is.  The DfT only fund 40% of Crossrail  with a peak of £1.2bn and total 
[normal]contribution 
[normal]of £5.2bn (60% 
[normal]is 
[normal]paid by London businesses and other sources ) while the spend on HS2 has a peak 
[normal]of £5bn pa for several years and a total of £50bn, 
[normal]ten times the Crossrail spend[bold]!

[normal] 
[normal]in the rail network
[normal].  The large majority of the investment in the rail netwo
[normal]rk is routine maintenance and renewals not enhancing the network.  The spend on enhancements for the whole of the network is around £2bn pa while the spend on HS2 would for several years be £4bn or more.  Hence a more accurate statement is that HS2 will ta
[normal]ke 2/3 of the budget available to improve the network!

[normal]4. [bold]Capacity[bold] released [bold]for Freight[bold]How much extra capacity 
[normal]for freight 
[normal]on classic lines is actually released by HS2?
[normal]Nothing till at least 2026!
[normal]Then, from the 2013 strategic case, in 2033 it assumes the number of fast line paths used by passenger trains 
[normal]reduces from 13 to 12 leaving the capacity from 
[normal]ONE[bold] fast passenger path available per hour.

[normal]HS2 will
[normal] 
[normal]NOT[bold] [bold]relieve crowding 
[normal]over the whole of the rail network, so why do HS2 and the 
[normal]D
[normal]fT persist in giving data for the whole network 
[normal]when they have the data relating to the specific routes ie WCML that will be affected?[bold]Is passenger growth going to continue on the WCML?
[normal](b) Virgin [bold]Trains Key statistics[bold]In 2012/13 Virgin Trains passenger growth was only 0.66% (ORR data) and has been falling rapidly for several years!

[normal]rail 
[normal]travel for the whole 
[normal]network shows a marked downwards trend since the peaks of 2007.

[normal](d) Technology wedge[bold]Technology takes time to gain a hold and then  make
[normal] a wide impact on the existing market.  This can be seen with the lag between the start of significant use of the internet for communications and its impact on letter volumes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Video conferencing is only really just taking hold now.  As businesses str
[normal]ive to make a profit in an ever more competitive global market place, using increasingly reliable video conferencing wil
[normal]l
[normal] become the norm and expensive, time consuming long distance busine
[normal]ss travel will have to be very carefully justified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](e) Decline in [bold]trip rates[bold]There has been a steady decline in trip rates for the last fifteen years.  This may be partly due to technology but whatever the cause, has this been included in the HS2 demand models?
