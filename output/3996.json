"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Directory of Social Change [CEP0013]&#xa0;About the Directory of Social ChangeThe Directory of \nSocial Change (DSC) has a vision of an independent voluntary sector at the heart of social change. We believe that the activities of charities and other voluntary organisations are crucial to the health of our society.\nThrough our publications, courses and\n conferences, we come in contact with thousands of organisations each year. The majority are small to medium-sized, rely on volunteers and are constantly struggling to maintain and improve the services they provide.\nWe are not a membership body. Our public\n commentary and the policy positions we take are based on clear principles, and are informed by the contact we have with these organisations. We also undertake campaigns on issues that affect them or which evolve out of our research.\nWe view our role as th\nat of a ‘concerned citizen’, acting as a champion on behalf of the voluntary sector in its widest sense. We ask critical questions, challenge the prevailing view, and try to promote debate on issues we consider to be important.\n&#xa0;\nIntroductionRecent debate \nin the media on the matter of charity Chief Executive pay has not reflected the reality for the vast majority of charities in the UK. Nor has it been put into context with other organisations (for example in the public or private sector) and how th\ney remun\nerate senior managers for comparable levels of responsibility.\nIn fact, some of the statements made \nappear to be based on \na misunderstanding of the facts\n – for example the phrase ‘charity boardroom pay’\n is a misrepresentation\n. \nIn fact a miniscule number of\n trustees are paid for their role and probably well over 90% perform their duties on an entirely voluntary basis.\nThis\n debate \nis clearly of public interest but it is vital that it is \ninformed by facts\n, \nevidence,\n and context,\n not conjecture, speculation and\n media hype. Otherwise unjustified damage to public trust and confidence in \nall charities (not just those with ‘highly pa\ni\nd’ CEOs\n)\n may result. Below we draw together some key facts and information with the aim of informing discussion and debate about the i\nssue.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe nature of the charitable sector&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The role of trustees in setting Chief Executive pay“Look carefully and critically at the areas of highest risk – this will vary and will depend on the charity’s risk ass\nessment.”\n (CC25: Managing charity assets and resources: an overview for trustees, at paragraph E.)\n              \nAnd also,\n“It is a duty of the charity trustees to ensure that the charity’s resources are protected in order that the charity can fulfil its aims.”\n (CC8: Internal financial controls for charities, at paragraph B.)\n“Make the best use of staff by regularly reviewing what sk\nills and experience are needed, what recruitment methods it uses and its training and working conditions.” \n(CC25: Managing charity assets and resources: an overview for trustees, at paragraph\n H.)\n&#xa0;\nCharity transparency&#xa0;Conclusion&#xa0;\nThere appear to be two quite different and even contradictory \nnarratives emanating from Government and MPs on this issue at the moment.\n On the one hand the Government has \nlaunched its drive \ntowards pluralised and more localised forms\n of public service provision through the Open Public Services \nagenda\n, and has said th\nat it wants charities to participate in this.\nYet at the same time statements \nfrom some politicians as part of this debate \nsuggest that large and complex \ncharitable \norganisations should (and could) be run \nfor free, or that somehow charities should be able \nto attract the skilled leadership they need on a \npurely \nvoluntary basis.\nThe \npotential \ndamage\n caused\n to \nthe charitable sector \noverall\n by an uninformed debate\n is more concerning\n however, as only a small minority of charities will ever be in a position to \nta\nke on public service contracts\n. The public \nhave\n not been given the full \npicture \nin the debate \nover charity chief executive pay\n to date,\n but the headlines will likely have stuck in the popular consciousness. This is potentially very damaging to the trust wh\nich the\n public holds for charities, with consequences for the flow of donations of time and money.\nWe call on the Committee to \nconsider the evidence in the round during \nits investigations\n and subsequent reporting\n. \n&#xa0;\nSummary of a survey of charities in contact with DSCDSC is not a membership organisation but is in touch with tens of thousands of charities via its newsletter and the many services it provides. For this enquiry, we carried out a survey of charities on the question of charity CEO pay\n during\n November 2013\n. The responses are analysed below.\n&#xa0;\nSummary analysis: &#xa0;\nIn our \nsample - which was constructed on a voluntary, opt-in basis - the majority of respondents came from organisations which either had a CEO paid below £60,001 or they had no CEO at all (58%). \n&#xa0;\nThe majority noted that CEO pay had not been a barrier to fundrai\nsing. Compliance with publishing salaries in charitable accounts was high, and 12 organisations volunteered this information when there was no obligation \nfor\n them to do so.\n&#xa0;\nOne third\n of respondents\n reviewed their CEO’s salary at least once every three years, though often more frequently. Just under a quarter review their salaries on a more ad-hoc basis. There\n were also some examples of CEO\ns who had not received even a review in three or more years –\n in one case a respondent told us there had not been a review since the CEO was appointed 11 years ago.\n&#xa0;\nTh\nere were 1\n20 total respondents\n to the survey; of these \n106 had a CEO or general m\nanager with a similar function, and \n14 did not.\n&#xa0;\nDetailed findings:&#xa0;\nOf those respondents who di\nd have a CEO or similar post:\n&#xa0;\nMore than 53% of those who supplied a pay band for their CEO were in the £30,000 - £50,000 range.\n&#xa0;\nComments on the question of the CEO salary level varied:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPublishing information on salaries in the charity’s accounts&#xa0;\n4\n5 organisations \nsaid they \ndid not publish the CEO salary in their accounts, 36 did. Of those who did the majority were over £50,000 – 26 organisations. 12 \norganisations said that they published the salary even when they did not have to do so (\ni.e. \nwhen it was below £60,000). \n&#xa0;\n3 organisations who said they paid in the £70,001 - £80,000 band declared that they did not publish this figure in the accounts. We c\nan only assume that they were either incorrect or their organisation was not producing accounts to the appropriate standard.\n&#xa0;\nBeing refused funding on the basis of the CEO’s salary&#xa0;\n77 organisations said that they had not, to their knowledge, ever been ref\nused funding on the bas\nis of their CEO’s salary. 5 said they had been refused funding on this basis \nand one was un\nsure. For\n the 5 who \nsaid they \nhad \nbeen refused, \ntheir \nCEO \nsalaries ranged from £50,001 to over £100,000.\n&#xa0;\nFrequency of reviewing the CEO’s salary&#xa0;\n32 organisations reviewed their CEO’s salary annually. One carried out a biennial review and two others a triennial review. 25 reviewed on an ad-hoc basis. A few respondents did not know. One noted that their CEO had not had a pay review in eleven yea\nrs, despite requesting one. One other had not been reviewed in six years, another two for five years, another for four years and yet another for three years.  Two were tied to the NJC scale and one other received an inflationary rise.\n&#xa0;\nComments from respondents&#xa0;\nWe asked the respond\nents to comment on these issues, and below we include a selection of responses:\n&#xa0;\n“You must have someone in charge who can make the best use of the charity's resources. A really good CEO will do that - a really bad one will not. \nThe latter will waste way more resources of the charity's resources than the increase in salary r\nequired to employ a good one” (band £30,001-£40,000)\n&#xa0;\n“The premise of the question is entirely the wrong focus on what constitutes a very small minority of peo\nple - we are not talking bankers' sized-pay, here. The emphasis should be on low paid workers in the voluntary sector and an understanding that to get the best people, you need to pay the going rate - at ALL levels.”\n&#xa0;\n“This debate has been grossly distorte\nd by a few examples of large national charities based in Central London. I share the concern that in the public's perception it seems at odds with the concept of charity to have a Chief Exec being paid a six figure salary. Personally I'm uneasy at anything\n which takes the staff of a charity so far away from the lived experience of the people they work with. However, if you compare the charity CEO pay to what those people would earn in an equivalent sized organisation in the private sector, charity CEOs are \npaid a lot less. Perhaps the real argument is about whether the myth of the magical dynamic super-powered shaman CEO is what's at fault and the charity sector's biggest mistake is to be mimicking the behaviour of the private sector rather than modelling so\nmething more progressive?”\n&#xa0;\n“[The salary] varies +/- 20% by simply varying hours.  This is result of vagaries of funding.   She works more than full time regardless.”\n&#xa0;\n“I do not see why CEO's of small or large charities should be paid less than commercial \nCEO's - the job creates more social value than corporate CEOs and requires equal business skills and acumen as any other organisation.”\n&#xa0;\n“In small charities there has to be a common sense approach to pay and what can be afforded in comparison to what can b\ne spent on the front line. Small charities struggle every year in making ends meet and just because there is a CEO doesn't mean there is \nan\n extravagant approach to pay. Some years we have considered reducing pay across the board to make ends meet and that \nmeans setting an example from the top.”\n&#xa0;\n“Some charities are big businesses employing hundreds of people and impacting on thousands of lives.  The pressure is enormous and a CEO's responsibility is often overwhelming.  Their salaries are commensurate with \nthis.”\n&#xa0;\n“Charities should look closely at whether they could use the money more cost effectively by employing more staff at a lower levels.  My experience shows that now the charity is paying for a CEO some of its charitable work has had to stop because th\nere is not enough money left to pay staff at lower levels.”\n&#xa0;\n“It's way too low, the CEO wouldn't accept this level of pay (neither would any of the staff) except that they're financially able to -- given the qualifications of the CEO, s/he should be earnin\ng at least double this pay.”\n&#xa0;\n“This is the CEO reporting here, so I may be a little biased.  Considering my skills, and the size of the organisation, and my responsibilities, I consider myself to be underpaid.  I think there's a gender issue here - if I we\nre a man, I suspect that the board would have taken my request over 4 years ago (when things were better!) to have my pay reviewed would have been taken more seriously.  I instigated a review of the two next most senior officers, because their pay didn't r\neflect what they were doing and the market rate.  Their pay was upgraded, and rightly so, but nobody has paid any attention to mine, which is one of the key reasons why I'm now looking for a job with better pay and conditions.  Having said that, I believe \nsome CEO pay is too high, and I know of larger charities where the senior team awards itself a higher percentage annual rise than the rest of the staff.  That's just not acceptable.  And now that times are tougher, I would need to know that my lowest paid \nstaff are on an appropriate salary before accepting any raise.  There needs to be a balance, so that people are appropriately rewarded for their skills and energy, but proportionately, given that we're charities.”\n&#xa0;\n“Think the whole debate about CE pay is a\n storm in a tea cup. Too London and National charity focused. Does not affect 90% of VCS.”\n&#xa0;\n“CEO has 'reduced' hours in theory but not in practice to take a lower salary.”\n&#xa0;\n“I think it should be stressed that Charity CEO is an incredibly broad category, in\n terms of scale, remit, etc. We would not discuss \"Catering industry CEO's pay\" and group the CEO of McDonald's along with someone running a small cake shop (though perhaps we should!).     It seems odd that there is such a prejudice against paying Charity\n CEO's well for their work leading organisations focused on helping society.”\n&#xa0;\n“They are mostly not worth it.”\n&#xa0;\n“The amounts are becoming more and more ridiculous- the heart has gone! As long as \nit’s\n a CHARITABLE cause big salaries should null and void! Majority of these \"CEOs\" are clueless and wouldn't be offered half the money in the private sector!”\n&#xa0;\n“The charitable sector is no different from private sector - eve\nrything from a market stall to T\nesc\no and we can't generalise. Government can't make a strategic choice to contract out services to the sector and then complain about its professionalisation, slight conflict of interest here!”\n&#xa0;\n“All Charity CEO's pay should be made available to all current a\nnd prospective supporters of that charity so that can see where their donations are going.”\n&#xa0;\n“The salary should be entirely a matter for the Board. Much of public/media debate is uninformed. Why should charity chief executives be paid less than, say, senio\nr civil servants? There is a real risk to the sector that high quality individuals will be lost.”\n&#xa0;\n“We all need to take a hard look at pay because we can't afford to pay massive salaries. The gulf between rich and poor is far too wide. I have been a charit\ny CEO until very recently and was paid £40K. I have 2 degrees, more than 20 years’ experience and 10 years ago was earning 20% more than I am now. We all need to accept that working for a charity will not make us rich and more charities should move out of \nLondon to avoid London weightings. We exist to serve, not to get rich at others' expense! We should lead by example and we\n can all take a pay cut.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
