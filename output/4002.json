"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr. E.A.S. Linley (LCI0003)&#xa0;\nExecutive summary :\n&#xa0;\nThe absence of a strategy embracing all arms of government is making the delivery of low carbon innovation exceptionally difficult – and the current disconnect with polic\ny\n, exacerbated by \nexisting \np\noorly targeted\n \ninstruments, h\nave combined to un\ndermine the group\n’\ns achievements\n and business confidence\n in the low C sector\n. \n&#xa0;\nClimate change remains an inappropriate \n(and weak) \ndriver of behavioural change and innovation in businesses\n \nand \nhome\ns – and for the vast majority of people\n,\n needs to be interpreted in terms of \n‘\nenergy \nefficiency\n’ \n \nreducing costs, \n‘\nenergy security\n’ \n keeping lights and heat on and the UK infrastructure functioning (hospital, traffic lights etc.) \n&#xa0;\nBy intensifying the ‘bottom approach’\n to complement the current \ntop down approach\n, \nthe LCICG should \nengag\ne\n and mentor SME\n’\ns \nusing the substantial\n knowledge base in government \nto \nfacilitate \ninnovat\nion\n,\n through use of flexible\n and smaller \nvalue \nfunding mechanisms\n, the LCICG\n \ncould \nthen \ndeliver incremental but solid steps \ntowards innovating across all sectors\n. This could be \nbased on a ‘developme\nnt plan‘ \nfor each of the TINA priorities\n broken down into manageable steps\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nMany SMEs cannot contemplate taking on high risk projects but they can offer a\n desk\n in their company. I\nnvestment in paid interns could mobilise a graduate workforce with a common mission – mentored via web based tutorials. This would help companies to \ngather the information needed\n and help them to identify where the opportunities might be. \n&#xa0;\nIt’s important \nto acknowledge that innovation can be difficult and slow work – it is really only in extreme conditions of emergency / war / need that humans innovate \nad libitum\n as a survival strategy. Neverthel\ness,\n ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ \ncan be used to go\nod effect NOW \n to drive the low C innovation agenda\n, but it must be \ninterpreted in terms that businesses and homeowners will understand (ie. enlightened self interest). \n&#xa0;\nIn response to the specific questions posed : \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt may  - but a strategy is absolutely essential to engage all arms of government around this agenda in \na coordinated way – the \ncurrent \ndisconnect with policy (eg.\n \ndelay in \nEMR reform\n – and\n \nknock on effects for market pull) and \n \n‘warmist’ \n/ ambivalent \nrhetoric \nby government\n,\n \nare \nundermin\ning\n business confidence\n to the point where many are asking  - do the lights have to go out before government wakes up to the fragile state of our energy system\n \n?\n This has recently been compounded by the withdrawal of RWE from R3 Atlantic array\n which had the potential to bring £4\nbn investment to the SW and South Wales\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Low Carbon Innovation agenda needs to be framed differently in government\n \nto\n ensure policy and the LCIC\n group \nare pulling in the same direction.\nA\nt the moment \nfor too many UK nationals \n‘green\nness’ is \nanachronis\ntic \n–\n \nand mainly \nassociated with a failed \npolitical\n party \nand logically \n green deal\ns\n \n / \ngreen taxes = saving the \nenvironment \n= tree huggers = a luxury we can\n’\nt afford.\n \nThe vast majority of UK population \n(whether business or homeowner) are too remote \nfrom climate change \nto \ntake it seriously as a driver for innovation in their business - much less \nchange their own behaviour \n \n&#xa0;\nT\no\n \nengage people with the low C agenda, we \nneed to play\n to ‘enlightened self inte\nrest’\n \nie. energy security (\n=\nlight and heat stay on),\n resource and energy \nefficiency \n(=\nsaving money\n)\n, \nnew / \ngrowing innovative \nbusinesses\n =\n \njobs\n)\n and (by the way) also reduces C emissions\n =\n \nthe only \nresponsible \nway forward\n.\n&#xa0;\nMoreover \nLCICG urgently \nneeds a strategy which is future proofed \nagainst \nchanges in \n gove\nrnment\n – this is too important to be subject to whims of change in gov\nernemnt\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe LCIC group \nare doing a very good job but i\nt\n’\ns hard to judge whether \ncurrent \nmeasures are adequate\n or not\n  –\n dithering over\n EMR has had very serious consequences and the concern is that over the n\next few months we will see many\n \noffshore wind\n R3\n \nconsortia deserting the UK for more attractive investments overseas. The offshore wind sector is such a fantastic opportunity for the UK – where else \ndo we have the opportunity f\no\nr\n this sc\nale of investment at the moment ?\n \nit is particularl\ny galling to witness parliament justifying the \nUK \nslippage by\n reference to othe\nr European countries – which they claim are moving more\n slowly than the UK – not so - \nfour \nEU countries \nhave already reached the\nir 2020 renewables \ntarget\n !\n \n&#xa0;\nAs above the lack \nof joined up policy means that p\nolicy is working against the LC\nI\nC group\n \naims \nf\nor\n eg;  pricing \nof water and energy are \nprecisely the \nreverse of \nthose \nwhich would yield an immediate effect\n in terms of changing behaviour\n. \nAt the moment the more energy you use\n the less you pay - ! \nNor are t\nhe instruments which could be adopted in the commercia\nl and domestic housing sectors \nsufficiently \ntargeted\n or ambitious enough to effect real movement towards more energy efficient buildings. \nThe wealthy and \neven not-so-\nwealthy but employed \nmiddle classes \ncan currently easily afford their energy bills\n,\n so they \nneed to be mobilised vi\na legislation\n. T\nhis is the sector which has the potential to deliver \na high number of \n jobs \ninto the construction industry and \neven \na whole n\new industry around retrofitting our buildings stock for energy efficiency – and \nmuch \nmore quickly than any other sector\n because of re\nlatively low skill base required on the ground.\n    \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How \nshould its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success? \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe \nLCI\nC\nG needs to \nadopt a\nn expanded and more ambitious\n ‘bottom up’ approach to build confidence and \nintensify its engagement with SMEs –\n where \nafter\n all &gt;90% of \n innovation characteristicall\ny\n occurs (whether\n in UK, Mexico \n or Singapore\n)\n. \n&#xa0;\nNoting that \no\nnly 35 of the 170 applications from ene\nrgy entrepren\ne\nurs\n were funded\n by the LCICG\n, \nperhaps \nthe residue mer\nit fu\nr\nther \nscrutiny \n? a \nrelatively \nsmall amount of funding (£\n100k)\n \n can \nmake \na significant diff\nerence\n to \nthe \nability of\n SMEs to innovate esp\necially \n when collaborating with R\nesearch \nC\nouncils \n –\n \nas this is equiv\nalent\n to one year of post doc time\n / two years of post grad time\n.\n These amounts are also relatively low risk in terms of an SME\n’\ns \nability to take on additional staff\n / manage the risk\n, \nand \ndo not tie them up in extended periods of writing bids.\n The public sector needs to lead this activity at grass roots to ensure that \ninnovation is in line with strategic \nlow C innovation \npriorities and to provide adequate mentoring / practical support. \n \n&#xa0;\n \nW\nithout a \nlow C innovation \nstrategy document\n to refer to\n, \n \nit is not clear why\n,\n but\n the TINAs \nappear to \nhave omitted the environmental dimension from \nalmost \nevery aspect of driving the Low C innovation agenda for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy – to the point that consideration of novel (low C) materials, streamlined technologies for monitoring /\n assess\nment (sensors/ automated\n / satellite systems / multi use platforms \nare \nall \nomitted. This is\n despite the fact that they contribute \nvery significantly \nto reductions in energy use\n through reduction in \nship time\n, \ndematerialisation and \npotential removal of unsu\nstainabl\ne materials from supply chain, \nmaterial\n and resource efficiencies and reductions\n.\n \n \n     \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAre the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the l\nong-term?\n&#xa0;\nA\ns a general point the desertion of private investors wanting returns \nwithin 5 years from many \nrenewable projects\n,\n has highlighted the need for longer term sustained support as the sector gets to grips with technologies which a\nre cost effective to build, ar\ne reliable and deliver energy as predicted.  \n&#xa0;\nThe TINAs provide a clear indication \nof what is needed \nper \nsector –\n but \nit \nmay \nbe beneficial to break them down into manageable bite sized chunk\ns\n of work and to\n formulate a development plan f\no\nr each priori\nty – then \nto \nproactively engage prospective businesses around the issues rather than \nprogress via \nopen en\nded calls ?\n this saves time and ensures optimal use of  the knowledge base within the LCIC team in DECC.\n \n&#xa0;\nInnovation \nis \nnot always a linear process\n,\n \ndiversions and unconventional \ntrajectories\n towards the \nend game\n,\n which can have false starts as well as surprising results\n, mean that entrepreneurs and innovative companies \nbenefit \nsignificantly \nfrom flexible funding mechanisms\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment? \n              \nShort term funding timelines undermine\n business confidence – and make\n it \nalmost \nimpossible for ev\nen the most \ninnovative companies to \ncontemplate carrying \nthe \nrisk invol\nved \nif other aspects of their business are under strain \nor to \nplan how they might interact with public sector to achieve their potential. Essential that LCI team\n \nfacilitates confidence building as result of interacting with \nits team\n -\n \nmentoring proposals t\nowards \nachieving the desired \nend game should be a recognised role rather than simply as agency to procure the science. Engagement \nwill roll out to a larger pool of businesses and \nimprove \nsignificantly \nas businesses experience successful outcomes.\n \nTimescales to achieve effective outcomes need to be of the order of decades not 3 to 5years. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?\n&#xa0;\nBy adopting a \n‘\nbottom up\n’\n approach to complement th\ne \nmeasures \nin place at present. (Apologies if you are already doing these things\n but I do not have enough information\n)\n \n&#xa0;\n              \n(1) \ngo back to the 170 \n(less\n 35\n)\n \nenergy \nentrepreneurs projects not funded and check whether any \nof them cou\nld be re shaped and assessed to\n fit with TINA priorities\n \n- whilst noting that this is already a group of companies which have an appetite to innovate and carry the necessary risk in their business\n.\n \n(2) \nrun calls \nvia RCs \nin every TINA sector \naimed at achieving smaller \nbut \nsolid incremental steps\n in \nthe \npriorities identified\n,\n involving \nmore modest sums \nof money (not millions- perhaps £100 to 300k). Make sure these calls are supported by \nwebinars \nvia KTNs\n eg. the Energy generation and Supply KTN\n \n or other networks \nto \nensure wider \nengage\nment of\n the right businesses\n.\n \n(3) put as much as possible into paid internships –the demand is a bottomless pit;\n \nevery business \nis unique but could / \nshould have paid intern \nto investigate some aspect of business \nwhich needs\n improving / cost cutting\n, energy resource efficiency - \nplus\n interns often \nhave good ideas – there\n is no need for any \n‘good’ \ngraduate\n or post grad\n to be out of work\n. \nProgressing\n this workforce via web based mentoring would be very cost effective and efficient and facilitate group learning. \n(4) make the LCI\nC\n team much more visible and proactive – perhaps secondments into regional partner organisations, make sure \nall team are able\n to attend \n \nappropriate industry \nconferences / seminars\n regularly\n,\n are\n out talking to people / businesses to make sure that they have up to date intelligence from \npriority \nsectors and maintain an opportunities pipeline based on intelligence gathered from d\niscussions w\ni\nth businesses.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow is the \nGovernment maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?\n&#xa0;\n              \nG\novernment IS\n NOT\n maximising opportunities\n to learn within and beyond EU.\n There is much to learn from Denmark for eg. which \nas is \nnow \nwell known \nbuilt its wind industry on the back of UK lead – \n also for eg. \nthe Cornwall energy project in 1986 twinned villages in Denmark and Cornwall to map their energy resources – the Danish v\nillage is now self sufficient \nin en\ne\nrgy \nand earns income from its windmill whereas the Cornish village is still in the same situation as in 1986\n despite have energy resources for a town 30X its own population\n; Germany on the other hand has very strong \npolicy drivers through its commitment to a non nuclear future\n – this means they HAVE \nt\no succeed in the renewable\ns\n sector\n and this \nis a\n significant driver for innovation\n; South Africa has taken the lead as the \nnation with the \nfastest growing renewable\ns sect\nor\n - \nwhen \npersistent \npower cuts \nhit \nthe western Cape lead\ning \n to chaos in h\nospitals, traffic control systems \n etc.\n and threatened the future of\n its tourism industry\n SA \n, government finally acted !\n \n  \nCardiff city is already having to manage energy use acros\ns the city to minimis\ne the likelihood of black outs....\n  \n&#xa0;\nAt the moment \nwe have many approa\nches from international organisations\n \n(mainly government)\n \nwanting to learn from our research in offshore wind\n,\n wave and tidal sectors\n, and to build their own industries. \nUK consultancies have benefitted from the \nR&amp;D / consultancy \nexperience in UK and we currently have a narrow lead in wave and tidal internationally. It is imperative that we maximise our efforts to bring these sectors to\n fruition \nin the UK \nalongside\n other \nlow C \ninitiatives\n.\n \n  \n&#xa0;\nIt is incomprehensible that \nwe \nwould risk the opportunity to \nexploit\n UK \noffshore \nresources\n (eg. \nAtlantic Array ) to \nbring energy production within UK\n national \nboundaries\n. Why is it a \ngood idea to ‘save’ Grangemouth on the basis of fracked shale gas shipped in fr\nom the US ? and ‘feed’ Milford H\naven on the basis of shipped gas from the middle east ?  \n \n              \nFinally\n important to note that innovating can be difficult and \nslow wo\nrk –\n \nwe \nn\need to be patient – we are talking about re vitalising the innovative spirit \nin \na nation of box tickers \n! \nin our efforts to maintain the status quo we have\n stymied entrepreneurship and \ninnovation\n, \n so we h\nave to start with education, \nencouraging l\nateral thinking\n, rewarding innovative thought and left field thinking, by \n not straight\n - \njacketing youn\ng\n people by\n asking them to  regurgitate\n text book answers. \nThis will take time – so a long term strategy is essential.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
