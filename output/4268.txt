[[[Executive Summary]]]

[[[ and Recommendations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0; The University of York undertakes internationally recognized cross-disciplinary research in biology, environmental science and chemistry germane to food security. This expertise illustrates the improvements science and technology could deliver to UK agriculture. In particular, the combination of new DNA sequencing technologies, improved bioinformatics and advanced analytical methods has:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; revolutionised approaches to crop improvement;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; identified new routes to crop protection;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; increased our ability to extract value from food and agricultural waste; andd)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; greatly increased understanding of the complex interactions between crops, soil and their microbial communities, both beneficial and pathogenic&#xa0;1.2 The University of York recommends that:

[[[&#xa0;]]]a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the development of advanced plant breeding techniques to restore lost resilience to important food crops, increased investment should be made to shorten the time to translate new varieties from laboratory to full scale cultivation.&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Competition for food crops between the food and biofuel industries could be lessened if more efficient routes to convert woody agricultural and forestry waste into biofuels were available. Lignocellulose-degrading enzymes have been discovered and their exploitation should be accelerated.&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Biofumigation, the suppression of crop pests by co-cultivating plants that naturally produce chemicals detrimental to pests, is an exciting route to natural crop protection that warrants increased attention.&#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Considering food waste as a valuable source of energy and raw materials will aid the much-needed reduction in the amount of food thrown away. It is important that the investigation of novel strategies for the commercial exploitation of food and agricultural waste goes beyond current narrow organic waste reuse and recycling.&#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A greater understanding of the molecular and biochemical basis of the interactions between crops and soil biota, both beneficial and pathogenic, presents an exciting opportunity to increase yields. Exploitation of the latest meta-genomic and high throughput sequencing techniques make advances in this field particularly timely and they should be prioritised.&#xa0;

[[[2. Background]]]&#xa0;2.1 The University of York is one of the UK’s leading research universities, consistently ranked in the top ten in the UK&#xa0;and in the world top one hundred. York is ranked seventh in the world for universities under fifty years old (the only UK University in the top ten) and attracted over £200 million of funding last year. A member of the elite Russell Group of universities, it was ranked eighth overall in the UK’s most recent evaluation of research excellence. It has acknowledged research strengths in biology, the environment and green chemistry. Biology at York was ranked equal first among broad spectrum bioscience departments in the UK for research judged to be world-leading. The impact of the ecological and environmental science at York was ranked second in the UK and seventeenth in the world. &#xa0;2.2 York has several specialist research centres relevant to food security:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Centre for Novel Agricultural Products (CNAP) is an award winning, internationally recognised research centre delivering research with impact, focused on development of plants and microbes as green factories.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI) is a pioneering inter-disciplinary research partnership that spans the social, natural and physical sciences to provide the evidence for sustainable solutions to global environmental challenges.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Stockholm Environment Institute at York (SEI-Y) has strong links to global policy makers such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organisation.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Part of one of the top university chemistry departments in the UK, the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence is a world leading research centre, which aims to promote the development and implementation of green and sustainable chemistry and related technologies into new products and processes.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Biorenewables Development Centre provides industry with new processes to convert plants and bio-waste into high value products.&#xa0;2.3 In July 2013, DEFRA’s Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) in Sand Hutton, York, and the University of York announced a joint initiative in Agri-food Resilience. This brings together expertise on food and non-food crop production systems and addresses the key issues of food security and environmental sustainability. The aim of the initiative is to ensure the stability and integrity of agri-food supply chains in the face of climate change, declining resources and rapid socio-political transformations. Uniting the world-class research at York with FERA’s unrivalled expertise in applied science has created a research platform for researchers and companies in the agri-food supply chain to work together to understand and quantify the multiple challenges faced, to develop innovative solutions to those challenges, and to identify and exploit the commercial opportunities that arise in responding to them.&#xa0;2.4 This expertise and research excellence makes the University of York well placed to give evidence to this committee. &#xa0;

[[[The Challenge]]]

[[[s]]]&#xa0;3.1 Global and local agri-food supply chains face multiple challenges: economic uncertainty; a changing and more unpredictable climate; new pests and diseases; crop and commodity shortages; inferior, contaminated and adulterated food; and the drive to reduce inputs, increase yields and extract value from waste without compromising on food quality, crop pest and disease control, and biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. Furthermore, securing supply chains is proving difficult in an increasingly complex world.&#xa0;3.2 To ensure that food production is robust and resilient in the face of these challenges, we urgently need new crop varieties with higher yields, better nutritional and by-product value, resistance to drought and pests, lower external inputs, produced and harvested in ways that protect natural ecosystems and the services they provide. Increasing vulnerability due to climate change and more complex supply chains mean we need better strategies to deal with exotic pests and diseases as well as existing threats, including horizon scanning for biosecurity risks, models to predict their spread and new plant protection agents designed, discovered and tested.&#xa0;

[[[the more efficient use of resources]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1 Feeding a growing population in a warming world, whilst protecting biodiversity and the services it provides, requires innovative thinking, unprecedented collaboration between countries and academic communities, and a willingness to cross disciplinary boundaries. We need new ways to increase yields, but not at the expense of the agricultural environment and the ecosystem functions and services it provides. Nor can we neglect the need to conserve scarce resources: land, healthy soils, and adequate nutrients and water. Science, including advanced genetic techniques allied to traditional plant breeding, can - and will need to - play a significant role in growing more food from less land using less energy, less water, less fertiliser, and less and fewer pesticides. Increasing food security by maintaining yields in the face of reduced inputs and increased frequency of extreme weather events is a key goal for agricultural innovation, as is using resources, including waste, more efficiently. &#xa0;

[[[Breeding lost attributes back into modern crops]]]&#xa0;4.2 Agricultural crops will need to supply sufficient food to nourish around nine billion people by 2050 but climate change is expected to threaten this endeavour. Recently the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events was described by the President of the National Farmers Union as the greatest threat to UK agriculture,  whilst globally both high and low extremes in rainfall increasingly limit food production, particularly for the poorest farmers. Droughts and floods are predicted to occur more frequently under climate change, whilst the availability of water for agriculture will decline. Scientific innovations are required to create new crop varieties that are more resistant to such environmental stresses. &#xa0;4.3 Crop varieties commonly grown today were developed to maximise yield at the expense of other traits, and so have lost some of their resilience to extreme events such as droughts, floods and pest outbreaks. Traits providing resilience to these threats remain in the wild ancestors of modern crops, and now need to be bred back into the modern cultivars that have lost this resilience. The recent advent of new DNA sequencing technologies has transformed our ability to collect genomic information quickly and cheaply. This, along with improved bioinformatics and analytical methods, has revolutionised the approaches that can now be taken to source the natural variation that exists in both domesticated crops and their wild ancestors. For example, such approaches allow CNAP to domesticate neglected and underutilised crops (‘orphan’ crops), which have not previously benefited from modern breeding techniques, and to apply new molecular breeding tools to established crops such as rice and oil-seed rape. These modern methods speed up the breeding process such that what previously took six generations can now be achieved in two. Almost any trait can be targeted:  resistance to specific pests, the ability to resist pathogens, fix nitrogen, consume less water and need less fertiliser. In York we are particularly interested in developing both more resilient crops and those with increased by-product value. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ on wheat]]]&#xa0;4.5 Climate change is predicted to affect wheat production in the UK, but there is little consensus on whether any potential benefits to yields from rising temperatures will be offset by extreme and unpredictable rainfall, nor sufficient understanding of how these changes will affect the quality of grain upon which food manufacturers rely, limiting their ability to assess the risk to their supply chains accurately. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[biomass]]]&#xa0;4.7 The economy of the future will increasingly rely on biological rather than fossil resources for materials, chemicals and fuels. The rising demand for crops for fuel has put them in direct competition with food crops over land and water;  the use of food crops for non-food purposes to meet environmental objectives is increasing. For example, the Vivergo Fuels refinery near Hull requires over one million tonnes of wheat each year, equivalent to nearly 60% of the region’s cultivated area of wheat.&#xa0;4.8 The impact of using grain crops to produce fuel on food supply is debated, but it is clear that growth of the bio-economy requires new technology. If agricultural waste could be turned into useful products, it would lessen the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biofuel production to the detriment of food supply. The exploitation of biomass as a feedstock for biofuel production is technically challenging but attractive.&#xa0;4.9 Straw from maize, wheat, barley and oilseed rape, dedicated biomass crops such as Miscanthus and forestry products are all potential bioethanol feedstocks. Annually, over five million tonnes of wheat and barley straw is produced in England, of which around half could be sold for bioenergy purposes, with the potential to generate sufficient ethanol to contribute around 2% of the UK petrol requirement as a fuel additive. The major cereal producing areas of Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and East of England have the potential to supply almost two million tonnes of straw for bioenergy purposes. The environmental and economic cost of straw transportation would point to biofuel processing plants being situated within these regions.&#xa0;4.10 Sustainable biofuels can be produced from wood and straw as they contain polymeric sugars that can be converted into simple sugars for fermenting into fuel; useful by-products can also be extracted from straw before digestion. Unfortunately, we currently lack effective enzymes to digest woody materials; CNAP have developed rapid screening methods for discovering novel enzymes to facilitate the move to a bio-based economy from a petrochemical-based one.

[[[aste]]]&#xa0;4.12 Food is a valuable resource and yet UK households throw away over 7 million tonnes every year. Considering food – and agricultural – waste to be a valuable resource would ameliorate the related problems of waste management and resource scarcity. Novel strategies for the utilisation of food waste need to go beyond organic waste reuse and recycling to include animal feed, composting, and anaerobic digestion. &#xa0;4.13 Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the best option for food waste processing. AD is the process where complex plant and animal material is converted into simple molecules by microorganisms in the absence of air. The useful products of AD are biogas (around 60% methane, 40% carbon dioxide), which is combusted to generate heat and power, and digestate, which contains valuable plant nutrients and organic humus. Important approaches to creating more value from waste include:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the extraction and reuse of valuable complex molecules from the waste before digestion;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; improving the efficiency of methane production by methanogenic bacteria in digesters; c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; pre-treating waste using microwaves to improve digestion efficiency.&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.17 Modern crops deliver high yields with the aid of extensive irrigation, fertiliser and chemical pesticides, but this may not be environmentally sustainable. Even with such inputs, global losses in crop production due to pests, diseases and weeds are around 30%. Future losses are likely to be greater due to:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; warmer climates increasing the abundance and range of existing and new biological threats;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; growing resistance to current agrochemicals;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a shortage of new active agents; andd)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the withdrawal of existing agents &#xa0;4.18 Given 76% of pesticide active ingredients have been removed from the EU market, there is a major opportunity for the UK to develop new crop protection solutions. One approach is to harness “natural” crop defences, i.e.  metabolites that defend wild plants against pests and diseases, which have often been bred out of domesticated crops in the race for increased yield. ‘Rescuing’ crops with these plant products is an effective and environmentally sustainable method to future-proof crop production.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Professor Sue HartleyDirector of the York Environmental Sustainability Institute on behalf of the University of York&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
