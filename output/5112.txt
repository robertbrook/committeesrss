[[[Supplementary written evidence from Certsure (BRC 75)]]]&#xa0;Thank you for the opportunity to present to the Select Committee regarding Electrical Safety and Part P of the Building Regulations on 6th January 2014.  During the discussion, you requested more information regarding the Qualified Supervisor (QS) role and how the number of QS required is decided. &#xa0;To help with your considerations I would like to make the following additional points:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;One specific question we were asked by the Select Committee was:  How many operatives can one Qualified Supervisor adequately manage?  The level of management and supervision required is determined after careful consideration during the initial and subsequent surveillance assessment processes, where the assessor will determine the number required by sampling, listening, questioning and observing during the assessment and by visiting a representative sample of sites where the work has been completed.  This assessment includes the identification, evaluation, estimation of the levels of risks involved, their comparison against benchmarks and the type of work undertaken by the company.&#xa0;The answer may be one QS or possibly a significant number, depending on the type, extent and location of the company’s work and the number of locations from which it operates.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In conclusion we believe there is no objective evidence to suggest the QS system is not working and that to increase the costs and regulatory burden on electrical firms by insisting that all competent persons who may be currently undertaking work under the supervision of a QS become registered is impractical.  It would be costly and place additional burden on the industry and there is no evidence to suggest that an additional safety benefit would be delivered.&#xa0;The current framework provides the opportunity for continuous improvement and our suggestion to the Committee is that the guidance criteria used for deciding the number of QS is enshrined in the Minimum Technical Competency requirement imposed on the scheme operators by DCLG, ensuring a consistent application against agreed standards.&#xa0;I hope this provides the Committee with further useful information and I am happy to expand on any of the points raised above at the Committee’s request.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
