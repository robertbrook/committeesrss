[normal]Written evidence submitted by Citizens Advice (LAI 0064)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction
[normal] and 
[normal]key recommendations
[normal]In 2012/3 the Citizens Advice service in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] advised around 3 million people on 6.6 million problems
[normal], with 
[normal]o
[normal]ver 30
[normal] 
[normal]local CAB act as 
[normal]civil legal aid 
[normal]suppliers mainly for housing
[normal] law issues.
[normal]Like many organisations we are having
[normal] to adapt to the impact of the
[normal] recent Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment
[normal] of Offenders Act (LASPO)
[normal] which has nearly halved the provision of civil legal aid services.
[normal]  
[normal]The cuts to legal aid have has put a great strain on our service as we have 
[normal]lost considerable specialist casework capacity in social welfare law and around 150 le
[normal]gal aid contracts as a result of recent scope changes. 
[normal]This has led to
[normal] 
[normal]significant 
[normal]human rights concerns
[normal] 
[normal]with many of our clients 
[normal]being denied
[normal] access 
[normal]to 
[normal]justice
[normal] because they can’t afford legal representation
[normal] and Citizens Advice 
[normal]struggles
[normal] to provide the support they need
[normal]. The government’s proposal on 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid
[normal] will lead to 
[normal]further problems 
[normal]in terms of Article 6 and other substantive human rights.
[normal]Our key recommendations 
[normal]to make sure that the Government’s plans do not 
[normal]contraven
[normal]e
[normal] human rights legislation are:
[normal]Restricting payment for permission work in judicial review cases
[normal]Judicial review is a vital to
[normal]ol in ensuring the that people’s basic human rights are protected 
[normal]when
[normal], local authorities or g
[normal]overnment
[normal] break the law
[normal] or exceed their legal powers
[normal].  Restricting legal aid for judicial review creates the potential that 
[normal]justice 
[normal]is denied for some not ab
[normal]le to
[normal] afford 
[normal]legal support
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are pleased that t
[normal]he g
[normal]overnment has 
[normal]said that they will consult on their plans for restricting judicial review 
[normal]as 
[normal]it is vital that they look again at this issue to ensure that this basic 
[normal]protection and mechanism for holding 
[normal]public authorities to account is not
[normal] eroded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now that the government has published further details on their plans it is clear that 
[normal]the earlie
[normal]r
[normal] stages of judicial review work
[normal] 
[normal]only 
[normal]remain
[normal] within the scope of legal aid 
[normal]by way of a discretionary payment schem
[normal]e.
[normal] 
[normal]With a
[normal] 
[normal]discretionary scheme the government is saying that access to justice is not a human right or a legal requirement but is purely at the 
[normal]will
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]a government body.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Legal Aid providers will 
[normal]still 
[normal]be expected to shoulder all the risk of taking 
[normal]cases whose outcome can often be uncertain.  This could effectively remove access to judicial review for otherwise important and arguable cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is 
[normal]also 
[normal]a risk this will change the behaviour of public authorities because they will anticipate relucta
[normal]nce to take judicial review beyond a threat to application stage. This could be seriously 
[normal]detrimental to those in need of services such as housing, social care and education
[normal] and lead to serious human rights abuses
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]J
[normal]ust because most cases are withdrawn b
[normal]efore a full hearing does not mean they are without merit - a significant number of cases are withdrawn because they settle in favour of the
[normal] claimant before reaching court.
[normal] Often it is the threat of judicial review which prompts public authorities to prov
[normal]ide solutions, but not before substantial work has been done. So cases which are likely to settle at an early stage are often some of the strongest cases. It is no exaggeration to say that legal aid for judicial review can be the only thing standing betwee
[normal]n a homeless family and the street.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Examples of the type of cases in which the Judicial Review process is of real benefit to bureaux clients include:- 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A client came to their local CAB after their homelessness application had been turned down by their council despite the fact they had 
[normal]no where
[normal] to live and was suffering from a  serious lung condition.  Not only did the council turn down the application but
[normal] they also refused to house the client while their decision was reviewed.  The CAB took action to get a 
[normal]legal aid counsel opinion that they would be able to make an application for judicial review.  With the threat of this judicial review the council agree
[normal]d to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]provide accommodation pending review.  With the CAB and Counsel's opinion supporting the client, the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]review
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]found in their favour
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]they were in need of support to avoid homelessness and there was no need for a court hearing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the council
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]had k
[normal]nown that the CAB could not afford to take it further they
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]may have been less likely to bow to pressure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Without the threat of a judicial review a
[normal] CAB
[normal] client
[normal] in 
[normal]Lancashire
[normal] may still have had to suffer without enough incontinent pads for 
[normal]her
[normal] needs.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] cli
[normal]ent who was bedbound and needed a hoist to get out of bed
[normal],
[normal] with carers attending four times a day to change her incontinence pads. She had dementia, neuropathy, incontinence and was unable to stand. Under the NHS funded care package, the PCT insisted that 
[normal]they could only provide 3 pads per day - not enough 
[normal]for her
[normal] needs and they could not afford to buy any more 
[normal]herself
[normal]. The bureau advised that the care package should meet the cost of however many pads were required and wrote a complaint letter. After furthe
[normal]r advocacy by the bureau including an initial application for judicial review, the NHS incontinence team re-assessed the client and agreed to allow four pads.
[normal] Without legal aid funding for making this initial application it is much less likely they would h
[normal]ave been able to put this extra pressure 
[normal]to get the support they needed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It was only a successful judicial review that forced the government to rethink rules on the housing benefit size criteria so that severely disabled children did not have to share a r
[normal]oom.
[normal] 
[normal]A family with two severely disabled children came to their local CAB because they felt the rules amounted to disability discrimination.  With support from CPAG lawyers the case was taken all the way to the court of appeal and DWP agreed to modify thei
[normal]r rules. 
[normal]Meaning a number of families can now afford to give better care for their disabled children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Restricting the scope of legal aid for prison law
[normal]Whilst
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]we agree that it would be reasonable for more trivial issues to be dealt with by the Prison Ombudsman Service rather than through legal aid,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]we are
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]concerned that if 
[normal]legal aid is not available for
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]serious issues involving prison
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]authorities and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]trea
[normal]tment of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]prisoners
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]there is a danger that some 
[normal]human right abuses would be missed as so many treatment issues
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]can potentially 
[normal]cause human rights concerns
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We disagree with the proposed restriction, as
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]prison law concerns
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]fair hearings for those who have b
[normal]een mistreated by prison authorities; taking cases out of scope
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]which involve
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] prison authorities'
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]conduct would in our view be inconsistent with human rights law such as the right to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]privacy and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]family life, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, a
[normal]nd liberty and security of the person. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While the government has said that human rights issues
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](
[normal]eg
[normal] ECHR Article 5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and 6 determinations)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]will still be covered by legal aid, alongside parole hearings and sentencing reviews, there is a serious danger that it
[normal] will be impossible for someone to show that there has been a human rights issue before they are able to access legal aid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a great deal of difference between a complaint regarding access to television or prison food quality, with serious maltr
[normal]eatment by officers, repeated denial of contact with families, or ongoing prison detention of foreign nationals who have served their sentence but where UKBA/Home Office have failed to determine their future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Prison Ombudsman
[normal] does not have any jurisdiction over
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]human rights
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]law and issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]We therefore believe that legal aid should be available for all serious cases to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]be determined by the Legal Aid Agency, with more trivial complaints
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]being dealt with by the Prison Ombudsman
[normal] Service.  This would give legal aid lawyers the chance to identify potential human rights breaches which may
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]otherwise be
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]missed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current plans would affect vulnerable groups who need protection such as mothers and babies and children in custody and 
[normal]removes important issues such as treatment and prison conditions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]from scope. 
[normal]Those with 
[normal]mental health issues and/or learning disabilities and young offenders will find it especially hard to obtain effective redress for other serious matters. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The prison 
[normal]ombudsman service does not have the power to enforce resolutions and therefore cannot
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]always resolve these problems without recourse to the courts, and the proposal makes no attempt to distinguish between trivial and serious complaints but rather imposes a
[normal] blanket restriction. We believe accountability
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]for
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]mistakes or
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]maltreatment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in criminal justice system is of the highest importance but will be sacrificed if the proposal on restricting legal aid in prison law cases goes ahead.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The projected saving from 
[normal]this measure is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]tiny
[normal] in Government spending terms - £4 million according to the consultation paper impact assessment - but the implications for victims of mistreatment in prison are huge
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Citizens Advice Bureaux run many prison based advice projects - cu
[normal]rrently covering around 50 prisons, so if the government reduces legal aid funding for advice to prisoners this may well add to the pressure on our staff and volunteers currently delivering advice in prisons.  This in turn would have a damaging impact on t
[normal]he prison and parole services if we are not able to support as many clients.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introducing a residence test
[normal]H
[normal]uman right
[normal] are not something
[normal] that you have to earn by being in a country for 12 months.  In the same way that as soon as you set foot into our coun
[normal]try you must abide by our laws
[normal],
[normal] you should not have to wait 12 months to access to justice if your treatment at the hands of others is 
[normal]unlawful
[normal].
[normal]  This is important as the Human Rights Act protects universal rights.
[normal]We strongly
[normal] 
[normal]dis
[normal]agree
[normal]d
[normal] with the proposal
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]set out in the original consultation 
[normal]for limiting legal aid to those with a "strong connecti
[normal]on" with the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  
[normal]Despite modifications to the proposals 
[normal]regarding
[normal] asylum seekers we remain concerned that for those recently granted asylum
[normal] whose asylum claim was 
[normal]mad
[normal]e less than a year ago they may
[normal] still fail the residence test
[normal] bar
[normal] and be unable to access justice, regardless of the issue for which they are seeking legal advice. This will affect cases where asylum is granted quickly because the case for asylum itself
[normal] is very strong.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of the most disadvantaged will therefore be left outside of scope regardless of the severity or nature of their legal problem as a result of this proposal.
[normal]Making exceptions for children and 
[normal]trafficking victims
[normal] 
[normal]does not deal with this
[normal] underlying problem with the policy. Many clients visiting 
[normal]their local CAB
[normal] for help with housing, family, welfare or debt pr
[normal]o
[normal]blems 
[normal]have foreign national backgrounds and often it is difficult for the bureau to determine their precise immigration status.
[normal] 
[normal]Oft
[normal]en they are our most vulnerable clients, for example:-
[normal]A London CAB saw an unemployed Nigerian woman who was living with her partner and two 
[normal]dependant
[normal] children.  Although she was a council tenant, her application for indefinite stay was pending and she did
[normal] not have recourse to public funds. She needed advice as the council had initiated possession proceedings for rent arrears of £2,925. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A CAB in the South West of England saw a Thai woman aged 30.  She was married and pregnant, but had experienced domestic violence. She needed advice on  finding accommodation and to update her spousal visa for Indefinite Leave to Remain because of domestic
[normal] violence. For this she needed a specialist lawyer (the nearest specialist being in 
[normal]Cardiff
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A London CAB was particularly concerned about one client who complained about being blackmailed and exploited by his employer. The 36 year old ma
[normal]n 
[normal]had very uncl
[normal]ear immigration status, has no family, but had been in 
[normal]UK
[normal] for 12 years. When he visited the bureau the client had no money for food and had to pay rent of £80 per week. He was receiving £1 per hour for a job and was being blackmailed to work for such littl
[normal]e money or be handed in to the police
[normal] by his employer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Civil merits test – removing legal aid for borderline cases
[normal]Borderline in the context used by the Legal Aid Agency means around the 50 per cent potential success mark, and cases where borderline challenges are currently permitted include some public law, immigration and family claims. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This means that around half 
[normal]of the people who will no longer be able to afford to have 
[normal]their case heard would have won
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They are often cases where the matters arising are fundamental ones, such as cases involving human rights. The points raised in these cases may be of high import
[normal]ance and the very nature of a legal case is that the final outcome cannot be determined without deliberation on controversial issues. Test cases on borderline issues are often vital for shaping the law’s development and 
[normal]clarifying the difficult questions. 
[normal]Removing this possibility will increase the power of public bodies and may allow undesirable practices to continue without a realistic option to challenge them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reform of the 
[normal]Criminal Legal Aid Market
[normal] and Fees
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Criminal legal aid is not our area of expert
[normal]ise so we do not intend to comment 
[normal]in detail 
[normal]on these issues;
[normal] however 
[normal]many of our advisors
[normal] regularly report circumstances in which vulnerable individuals are unable to get appropriate legal support
[normal] in magistrates or county court 
[normal]proceedings
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst we are 
[normal] 
[normal]often
[normal] able to advise social welfare matters 
[normal]we
[normal] do not have the expertise to advise or represent in 
[normal]complex 
[normal]family cases, and certainly not in any criminal law proceedings. For example:-
[normal]              
[normal]A CAB in the South West was visited by a single parent with a disabl
[normal]ed son, who had recently 
[normal]              
[normal]been made redundant and was in the process of claiming Income Support and Carer's 
[normal]              
[normal]Allowance. She needed legal representation in the Magistrate's court for a drink driving case. 
[normal]              
[normal]She had strong mitigating circumstances as she was 
[normal]the victim of an assault at the time and 
[normal]              
[normal]was moving away from the house of the attacker, by moving her car 50 yards. She was told by 
[normal]              
[normal]several solicitors that she was not eligible for legal aid and the cost would be several thousand 
[normal]              
[normal]pounds, although they 
[normal]all thought she had a case to argue. She was desperate for help 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]because she could not afford to lose her licence with a disabled child. When she visited the 
[normal]              
[normal]her local CAB
[normal], the case was due to come to court in three weeks time
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst we welcome that the
[normal] government have abandoned a potentially unworkable procurement model for criminal defence services, we remain concerned that a 17.5% cut will be impossible for suppliers to absorb. Many more firms will exit legal aid or close as a result which will also h
[normal]ave a knock on impact on the supply of civil and family legal aid meaning there will be less support for the overworked CAB service. 
[normal]Reforming Fees in Civil Legal Aid
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We disagree with the proposed further fee reduction in family legal aid cases by 10 per
[normal] cent
[normal].  Fees have already been 
[normal]cut by 10 per cent under the LASPO reform package
[normal] and the full implications of 
[normal]this may not have yet been felt
[normal]. 
[normal]Citizens Advice 
[normal]Bureaux rely heavily on being able to refer clients to local firms of solicitors fo
[normal]r advice and r
[normal]epresentation in f
[normal]amily matters, and we are concerned
[normal] that 
[normal] this proposal which will weaken the supplier base and may lead 
[normal]to some firms withdrawing from f
[normal]amily legal aid altogether
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are also concerned that providers have 
[normal]recently 
[normal]signed new f
[normal]amily con
[normal]tracts, which started on 1 April 2013
[normal] based on current fee levels.  Beyond any immediate unfairness of this, we are concerned that in future providers will have reduced con
[normal]fidence in the tender process,
[normal] damaging the supplier base for legal aid in general.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Expert fees[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We would be concerned that
[normal] the effect of a 20 per cent across the board cut risks experts being less attracted to appearing in cases funded by legal aid.
[normal] 
[normal]Often cases rely heavily on the availability of expert evidence.  If legal aid providers are unable to find experts willing to undertake the work at significantly reduced fees, clients will suffer.
