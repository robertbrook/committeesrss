defaultIntroduction
default and 
defaultkey recommendations
defaultIn 2012/3 the Citizens Advice service in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default advised around 3 million people on 6.6 million problems
default, with 
defaulto
defaultver 30
default 
defaultlocal CAB act as 
defaultcivil legal aid 
defaultsuppliers mainly for housing
default law issues.
defaultLike many organisations we are having
default to adapt to the impact of the
default recent Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment
default of Offenders Act (LASPO)
default which has nearly halved the provision of civil legal aid services.
default  
defaultThe cuts to legal aid have has put a great strain on our service as we have 
defaultlost considerable specialist casework capacity in social welfare law and around 150 le
defaultgal aid contracts as a result of recent scope changes. 
defaultThis has led to
default 
defaultsignificant 
defaulthuman rights concerns
default 
defaultwith many of our clients 
defaultbeing denied
default access 
defaultto 
defaultjustice
default because they can’t afford legal representation
default and Citizens Advice 
defaultstruggles
default to provide the support they need
default. The government’s proposal on 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid
default will lead to 
defaultfurther problems 
defaultin terms of Article 6 and other substantive human rights.
defaultOur key recommendations 
defaultto make sure that the Government’s plans do not 
defaultcontraven
defaulte
default human rights legislation are:
defaultRestricting payment for permission work in judicial review cases
defaultJudicial review is a vital to
defaultol in ensuring the that people’s basic human rights are protected 
defaultwhen
default, local authorities or g
defaultovernment
default break the law
default or exceed their legal powers
default.  Restricting legal aid for judicial review creates the potential that 
defaultjustice 
defaultis denied for some not ab
defaultle to
default afford 
defaultlegal support
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are pleased that t
defaulthe g
defaultovernment has 
defaultsaid that they will consult on their plans for restricting judicial review 
defaultas 
defaultit is vital that they look again at this issue to ensure that this basic 
defaultprotection and mechanism for holding 
defaultpublic authorities to account is not
default eroded.
default&#xa0;
defaultNow that the government has published further details on their plans it is clear that 
defaultthe earlie
defaultr
default stages of judicial review work
default 
defaultonly 
defaultremain
default within the scope of legal aid 
defaultby way of a discretionary payment schem
defaulte.
default 
defaultWith a
default 
defaultdiscretionary scheme the government is saying that access to justice is not a human right or a legal requirement but is purely at the 
defaultwill
default 
defaultof 
defaulta government body.   
default&#xa0;
defaultLegal Aid providers will 
defaultstill 
defaultbe expected to shoulder all the risk of taking 
defaultcases whose outcome can often be uncertain.  This could effectively remove access to judicial review for otherwise important and arguable cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is 
defaultalso 
defaulta risk this will change the behaviour of public authorities because they will anticipate relucta
defaultnce to take judicial review beyond a threat to application stage. This could be seriously 
defaultdetrimental to those in need of services such as housing, social care and education
default and lead to serious human rights abuses
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJ
defaultust because most cases are withdrawn b
defaultefore a full hearing does not mean they are without merit - a significant number of cases are withdrawn because they settle in favour of the
default claimant before reaching court.
default Often it is the threat of judicial review which prompts public authorities to prov
defaultide solutions, but not before substantial work has been done. So cases which are likely to settle at an early stage are often some of the strongest cases. It is no exaggeration to say that legal aid for judicial review can be the only thing standing betwee
defaultn a homeless family and the street.
default&#xa0;
defaultExamples of the type of cases in which the Judicial Review process is of real benefit to bureaux clients include:- 
default&#xa0;
defaultA client came to their local CAB after their homelessness application had been turned down by their council despite the fact they had 
defaultno where
default to live and was suffering from a  serious lung condition.  Not only did the council turn down the application but
default they also refused to house the client while their decision was reviewed.  The CAB took action to get a 
defaultlegal aid counsel opinion that they would be able to make an application for judicial review.  With the threat of this judicial review the council agree
defaultd to
default&#xa0;
defaultprovide accommodation pending review.  With the CAB and Counsel's opinion supporting the client, the
default&#xa0;
defaultreview
default&#xa0;
defaultfound in their favour
default&#xa0;
defaultthat
default&#xa0;
defaultthey were in need of support to avoid homelessness and there was no need for a court hearing.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the council
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulthad k
defaultnown that the CAB could not afford to take it further they
default&#xa0;
defaultmay have been less likely to bow to pressure.
default&#xa0;
defaultWithout the threat of a judicial review a
default CAB
default client
default in 
defaultLancashire
default may still have had to suffer without enough incontinent pads for 
defaulther
default needs.
default 
defaultThe
default cli
defaultent who was bedbound and needed a hoist to get out of bed
default,
default with carers attending four times a day to change her incontinence pads. She had dementia, neuropathy, incontinence and was unable to stand. Under the NHS funded care package, the PCT insisted that 
defaultthey could only provide 3 pads per day - not enough 
defaultfor her
default needs and they could not afford to buy any more 
defaultherself
default. The bureau advised that the care package should meet the cost of however many pads were required and wrote a complaint letter. After furthe
defaultr advocacy by the bureau including an initial application for judicial review, the NHS incontinence team re-assessed the client and agreed to allow four pads.
default Without legal aid funding for making this initial application it is much less likely they would h
defaultave been able to put this extra pressure 
defaultto get the support they needed
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt was only a successful judicial review that forced the government to rethink rules on the housing benefit size criteria so that severely disabled children did not have to share a r
defaultoom.
default 
defaultA family with two severely disabled children came to their local CAB because they felt the rules amounted to disability discrimination.  With support from CPAG lawyers the case was taken all the way to the court of appeal and DWP agreed to modify thei
defaultr rules. 
defaultMeaning a number of families can now afford to give better care for their disabled children.
default&#xa0;
defaultRestricting the scope of legal aid for prison law
defaultWhilst
default&#xa0;
defaultwe agree that it would be reasonable for more trivial issues to be dealt with by the Prison Ombudsman Service rather than through legal aid,
default&#xa0;
defaultwe are
default&#xa0;
defaultconcerned that if 
defaultlegal aid is not available for
default&#xa0;
defaultserious issues involving prison
default&#xa0;
defaultauthorities and
default&#xa0;
defaulttrea
defaulttment of
default&#xa0;
defaultprisoners
default&#xa0;
defaultthere is a danger that some 
defaulthuman right abuses would be missed as so many treatment issues
default&#xa0;
defaultcan potentially 
defaultcause human rights concerns
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe disagree with the proposed restriction, as
default&#xa0;
defaultprison law concerns
default&#xa0;
defaultfair hearings for those who have b
defaulteen mistreated by prison authorities; taking cases out of scope
default&#xa0;
defaultwhich involve
default&#xa0;
default prison authorities'
default&#xa0;
defaultconduct would in our view be inconsistent with human rights law such as the right to
default&#xa0;
defaultprivacy and
default&#xa0;
defaultfamily life, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, a
defaultnd liberty and security of the person. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile the government has said that human rights issues
default&#xa0;
default(
defaulteg
default ECHR Article 5
default&#xa0;
defaultand 6 determinations)
default&#xa0;
defaultwill still be covered by legal aid, alongside parole hearings and sentencing reviews, there is a serious danger that it
default will be impossible for someone to show that there has been a human rights issue before they are able to access legal aid.
default&#xa0;
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a great deal of difference between a complaint regarding access to television or prison food quality, with serious maltr
defaulteatment by officers, repeated denial of contact with families, or ongoing prison detention of foreign nationals who have served their sentence but where UKBA/Home Office have failed to determine their future.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Prison Ombudsman
default does not have any jurisdiction over
default&#xa0;
defaulthuman rights
default&#xa0;
defaultlaw and issues.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWe therefore believe that legal aid should be available for all serious cases to
default&#xa0;
defaultbe determined by the Legal Aid Agency, with more trivial complaints
default&#xa0;
defaultbeing dealt with by the Prison Ombudsman
default Service.  This would give legal aid lawyers the chance to identify potential human rights breaches which may
default&#xa0;
defaultotherwise be
default&#xa0;
defaultmissed
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current plans would affect vulnerable groups who need protection such as mothers and babies and children in custody and 
defaultremoves important issues such as treatment and prison conditions
default&#xa0;
defaultfrom scope. 
defaultThose with 
defaultmental health issues and/or learning disabilities and young offenders will find it especially hard to obtain effective redress for other serious matters. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe prison 
defaultombudsman service does not have the power to enforce resolutions and therefore cannot
default&#xa0;
defaultalways resolve these problems without recourse to the courts, and the proposal makes no attempt to distinguish between trivial and serious complaints but rather imposes a
default blanket restriction. We believe accountability
default&#xa0;
defaultfor
default&#xa0;
defaultmistakes or
default&#xa0;
defaultmaltreatment
default&#xa0;
defaultin criminal justice system is of the highest importance but will be sacrificed if the proposal on restricting legal aid in prison law cases goes ahead.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe projected saving from 
defaultthis measure is
default&#xa0;
defaulttiny
default in Government spending terms - £4 million according to the consultation paper impact assessment - but the implications for victims of mistreatment in prison are huge
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCitizens Advice Bureaux run many prison based advice projects - cu
defaultrrently covering around 50 prisons, so if the government reduces legal aid funding for advice to prisoners this may well add to the pressure on our staff and volunteers currently delivering advice in prisons.  This in turn would have a damaging impact on t
defaulthe prison and parole services if we are not able to support as many clients.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroducing a residence test
defaultH
defaultuman right
default are not something
default that you have to earn by being in a country for 12 months.  In the same way that as soon as you set foot into our coun
defaulttry you must abide by our laws
default,
default you should not have to wait 12 months to access to justice if your treatment at the hands of others is 
defaultunlawful
default.
default  This is important as the Human Rights Act protects universal rights.
defaultWe strongly
default 
defaultdis
defaultagree
defaultd
default with the proposal
defaults
default 
defaultset out in the original consultation 
defaultfor limiting legal aid to those with a "strong connecti
defaulton" with the 
defaultUK
default.  
defaultDespite modifications to the proposals 
defaultregarding
default asylum seekers we remain concerned that for those recently granted asylum
default whose asylum claim was 
defaultmad
defaulte less than a year ago they may
default still fail the residence test
default bar
default and be unable to access justice, regardless of the issue for which they are seeking legal advice. This will affect cases where asylum is granted quickly because the case for asylum itself
default is very strong.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the most disadvantaged will therefore be left outside of scope regardless of the severity or nature of their legal problem as a result of this proposal.
defaultMaking exceptions for children and 
defaulttrafficking victims
default 
defaultdoes not deal with this
default underlying problem with the policy. Many clients visiting 
defaulttheir local CAB
default for help with housing, family, welfare or debt pr
defaulto
defaultblems 
defaulthave foreign national backgrounds and often it is difficult for the bureau to determine their precise immigration status.
default 
defaultOft
defaulten they are our most vulnerable clients, for example:-
defaultA London CAB saw an unemployed Nigerian woman who was living with her partner and two 
defaultdependant
default children.  Although she was a council tenant, her application for indefinite stay was pending and she did
default not have recourse to public funds. She needed advice as the council had initiated possession proceedings for rent arrears of £2,925. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA CAB in the South West of England saw a Thai woman aged 30.  She was married and pregnant, but had experienced domestic violence. She needed advice on  finding accommodation and to update her spousal visa for Indefinite Leave to Remain because of domestic
default violence. For this she needed a specialist lawyer (the nearest specialist being in 
defaultCardiff
default). 
default&#xa0;
defaultA London CAB was particularly concerned about one client who complained about being blackmailed and exploited by his employer. The 36 year old ma
defaultn 
defaulthad very uncl
defaultear immigration status, has no family, but had been in 
defaultUK
default for 12 years. When he visited the bureau the client had no money for food and had to pay rent of £80 per week. He was receiving £1 per hour for a job and was being blackmailed to work for such littl
defaulte money or be handed in to the police
default by his employer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCivil merits test – removing legal aid for borderline cases
defaultBorderline in the context used by the Legal Aid Agency means around the 50 per cent potential success mark, and cases where borderline challenges are currently permitted include some public law, immigration and family claims. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis means that around half 
defaultof the people who will no longer be able to afford to have 
defaulttheir case heard would have won
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThey are often cases where the matters arising are fundamental ones, such as cases involving human rights. The points raised in these cases may be of high import
defaultance and the very nature of a legal case is that the final outcome cannot be determined without deliberation on controversial issues. Test cases on borderline issues are often vital for shaping the law’s development and 
defaultclarifying the difficult questions. 
defaultRemoving this possibility will increase the power of public bodies and may allow undesirable practices to continue without a realistic option to challenge them.
default&#xa0;
defaultReform of the 
defaultCriminal Legal Aid Market
default and Fees
default&#xa0;
defaultCriminal legal aid is not our area of expert
defaultise so we do not intend to comment 
defaultin detail 
defaulton these issues;
default however 
defaultmany of our advisors
default regularly report circumstances in which vulnerable individuals are unable to get appropriate legal support
default in magistrates or county court 
defaultproceedings
default.
default 
defaultWhilst we are 
default 
defaultoften
default able to advise social welfare matters 
defaultwe
default do not have the expertise to advise or represent in 
defaultcomplex 
defaultfamily cases, and certainly not in any criminal law proceedings. For example:-
default              
defaultA CAB in the South West was visited by a single parent with a disabl
defaulted son, who had recently 
default              
defaultbeen made redundant and was in the process of claiming Income Support and Carer's 
default              
defaultAllowance. She needed legal representation in the Magistrate's court for a drink driving case. 
default              
defaultShe had strong mitigating circumstances as she was 
defaultthe victim of an assault at the time and 
default              
defaultwas moving away from the house of the attacker, by moving her car 50 yards. She was told by 
default              
defaultseveral solicitors that she was not eligible for legal aid and the cost would be several thousand 
default              
defaultpounds, although they 
defaultall thought she had a case to argue. She was desperate for help 
default              
default              
defaultbecause she could not afford to lose her licence with a disabled child. When she visited the 
default              
defaulther local CAB
default, the case was due to come to court in three weeks time
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst we welcome that the
default government have abandoned a potentially unworkable procurement model for criminal defence services, we remain concerned that a 17.5% cut will be impossible for suppliers to absorb. Many more firms will exit legal aid or close as a result which will also h
defaultave a knock on impact on the supply of civil and family legal aid meaning there will be less support for the overworked CAB service. 
defaultReforming Fees in Civil Legal Aid
default&#xa0;
defaultWe disagree with the proposed further fee reduction in family legal aid cases by 10 per
default cent
default.  Fees have already been 
defaultcut by 10 per cent under the LASPO reform package
default and the full implications of 
defaultthis may not have yet been felt
default. 
defaultCitizens Advice 
defaultBureaux rely heavily on being able to refer clients to local firms of solicitors fo
defaultr advice and r
defaultepresentation in f
defaultamily matters, and we are concerned
default that 
default this proposal which will weaken the supplier base and may lead 
defaultto some firms withdrawing from f
defaultamily legal aid altogether
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also concerned that providers have 
defaultrecently 
defaultsigned new f
defaultamily con
defaulttracts, which started on 1 April 2013
default based on current fee levels.  Beyond any immediate unfairness of this, we are concerned that in future providers will have reduced con
defaultfidence in the tender process,
default damaging the supplier base for legal aid in general.
default&#xa0;
defaultExpert feesdefault&#xa0;
defaultWe would be concerned that
default the effect of a 20 per cent across the board cut risks experts being less attracted to appearing in cases funded by legal aid.
default 
defaultOften cases rely heavily on the availability of expert evidence.  If legal aid providers are unable to find experts willing to undertake the work at significantly reduced fees, clients will suffer.
