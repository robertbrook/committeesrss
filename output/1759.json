"&#xa0;\nNBI0017&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Santander UK&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n welcomes the opportunity to respond to this call for evidence \n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n UK \nis a full-service retail and commercial bank providing services to some 15 million active customers, with almost 1,200 branches and 37 regional Corporate Business Centres.\n \n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n \nUK\n is a wholly owned subsidiary of \nBanco\n Santander SA.\n&#xa0;\nSantander\n manage\ns its affairs autonomously with its own local management team responsible for its performance.\n&#xa0;\nSantander UK is firmly focused on the UK with c. 98% of customer assets UK-related and c. 80% of customer loans consisting of prime residential mortgages to UK c\nustomers.\n \nSantander \nUK\n is subject to the full supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the \nUK\n. \nSantander\n \ncustomers are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt i\ns \nSantander\n’s ambition to be the bank of choice for \nUK\n companies. In 2012, \nSantander\n increased its net lending to SMEs in \nNorthern Ireland\n by\n 27% (compared to \nSantander\n’s national average of 18%). \nSantander\n is a challenger to the Big Four banks in SME lend\ning\n across the country\n, where we have 5.5% market share. \n&#xa0;\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n \nhas approximately 700,000\n retail customers in \nNorthern Ireland\n. This includes a network of 31\n \nretail \nbranches. \nIn \nNorthern Ireland\n, \nSantander\n has \nopened almost 28,000 1|2|3 credit card accounts since its launch in September 2011 and over 27,000 1|2|3 current accounts since its launch in March 2012.\n \n&#xa0;\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n is committed to \nNorthern Ireland\n where we are proud to be a key private sector empl\noyer. \nWe employ over 1,1\n00\n staff in the country, including 800 employees based at our key site at Mays Meadow in \nBelfast\n.\n&#xa0;\ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe note that some of the questions in this call for evidence \nare \nvery specific in \nnature\n or related to \nindividual \nfinancial services compan\nies. Consequently, we have only responded to those questions where \nSantander\n can offer a particular insight to the Committee.\n  \n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Is there a difference in the structure of banks in Northern Ireland, compared to their structure in Great Britain? Is there any disadvantage for customers, both private and business, in NI as a result? &#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n does not differentiate its business in \nNorthern Ireland\n compared to \nGreat Britain\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe offer the same \nrange of products to our customers and make lending decisions for both our individual customers \nand business customers \nin the same way. \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a consequence of this, we do not believe that our customers are in any way disadvantaged by banking with \nSantander\n in \nNorthern Ireland\n as opposed to those banking with us in \nGreat Britain\n. \n&#xa0;\nDo banks that operate in both GB and NI, eg, Barclays and Santander, operate differently in NI than in the rest of the UK? Does this result in customers in NI being at a disadvantage compared to customers in GB? &#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSee \nabove\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Historically, finance for start-ups and expansions had been largely provided through Government agencies – ie, Invest NI &amp; its various predecessors – with the result that bank finance traditionally played a lesser role in NI than in GB. Have NI banks continued to play a lesser role in commercial finance than elsewhere – in particular, have economic and financial conditions since 2008 exacerbated that position? &#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is \nSantander\n’s\n ambition to be the bank of choice for companies across the country\n, including\n in \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile some of the banks\n operating\n in \nNorthern Ireland\n have seen a declining appetite for lending si\nnce 2008, \nSantander\n \nis committed to\n grow\ning this part of its business in the years ahead. O\nur experience over the last 18 months\n suggests that\n there is no shortage of SMEs seeking funding in \nNorthern Ireland\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012, \nSantander\n grew its net lending to SMEs in \nNorthern Ireland\n by 27%.\n This compares to a national lending increase by \nSantander\n \nUK\n of 18%. \nOur commitment to grow our lending to SMEs in \nNorthern Ireland\n has continued into 2013. As of 30 June 2013, \nSantander\n grew its ne\nt lending to SMEs \nin \nNorthern Ireland\n \nby 32% from a year earlier. \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding for expansion for companies in \nNorthern Ireland\n, as in \nGreat Britain\n, is often provided by banks in the form of invoice finance or factoring. These provide a \nhigh \nlevel of control and transparency, especially for younger businesses. These products are likely to remain popular for banks and businesses in the years ahead.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding banking products for start up businesses is a challenge that banks face in both \nGre\nat Britain\n and \nNorthern Ireland\n. Banks find it difficult to provide lending to new businesses due to a lack of track record and, usually, a lack of trading data on which to base risk assessments. \n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nUK \nGovernment has sought to overcome this problem thro\nugh the Start-Up Loans programme. \nSantander\n supports this initiative and considers it an excellent\n example of how g\novernment can help more start up businesses grow and create jobs. \n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStart-\nUp Loans are available to business in \nNorthern Ireland\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Is the population of NI at a disadvantage to the rest of the UK as a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recovery initiatives by banks in NI?&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n \nUK\n participates in a number\n of g\novernment schemes\n available in \nNorthern Ireland\n designed to help \nboost\n the economic\n recovery. Thes\ne include: \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur customers\n in \nNorthern Ireland\n benefit from these schemes in the same way as our \ncustomers\n in \nGreat Britain\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The lack of available data means that it is difficult to properly assess the impact of the reduced availability of credit in NI, and also means that there is not sufficient visibility about whether banks are reaching their agreed lending targets. &#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs noted above, \nSantander\n has increased its net lending to SMEs in \nNorthern Ireland\n by 32% in the last year. \nSantander\n is currently lending £147m to SMEs in \nNorthern Ireland\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n also notes that the British Bankers Association \n(BBA) \nhas agreed to \nlead an industry initiative to increase the amount of publicly available data on bank lending in \nNorthern Ireland\n. \nSant\nander\n refers the Committee to the BBA’s response for more detail on this matter.\n \n&#xa0;\nHow is new lending recorded; how much ‘new’ lending recorded is actually made up of extensions or additions to existing loans; and what are banks actually doing compared to what they are advertising? &#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n has only been operating as a corporate bank in \nNorthern Ireland\n for the last 3 years. As most of our loan facilities last for a 5 year period, we have not yet had any \ncustomer facilities expire which need\n renewing. \nConsequently, the vast majority of \nour \nlending recorded in \nNorthern Ireland\n is new lending. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Following the closure of Danske Bank of some branches in rural areas, are the interests of those living in more rural areas, particularly the elderly, sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure as it currently stands? &#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n \nUK\n will have 31 branc\nhes in \nNorthern Ireland\n by the end of this year. This includes 22 branches which we would consider to be in rural areas\n.\n We have no plans to reduce \nthe number of branches in \nNorthern Ireland\n below\n this number. \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n \nUK\n understands the importance of the branch network to our customers. While \nSantander\n has closed 6 branches in \nNorthern Ireland\n over the last 18 months, it is important to note that every one of the branches has been in a financial centre where we have at le\nast one other branch remaining.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSantander\n \nUK\n is an amalgamation of the ex Abbey, Bradford and Bingley and \nAlliance\n and Leicester Building Societies and as such we have a number of high streets where we have multiple branches\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere we have closed branc\nhes, the customer facing \nstaff have\n all transferred to the remaining branches in the area which we have, in turn, improved to accommodate all of our customers in the town.\n \nThis exercise has shown us that we are able to provide a better service to our cust\nomers when we consol\nidate all of our staff into one, larger \nbranch.\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlongside our branch network, \nSantander\n has an active “\nomni\n-channel” strategy to ensure that our customers can access our services in a variety of ways as suits their needs. This includes large domestic call \ncentres\n for phone inquiries, a comprehensive online banking platform and a mobile banki\nng app which was recently named best personal banking app in its category by mobile developer \nXtreme\n Labs.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
