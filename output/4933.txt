[[[(FDC22)]]]&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                            &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.0              Introduction&#xa0;1.1              Sunderland City Council welcomes the opportunity to provide to the Committee comments on how fiscal and financial powers could be devolved to cities and City Regions.&#xa0;1.2              These comments are provided in addition to the comments of the Key Cities Group (of which the council is a founder member) submitted on behalf of the Group by Wakefield City Council and which the City Council fully supports.&#xa0;1.3              The City Council considers that the potential implications from greater Scottish autonomy should be borne in mind as part of any further considerations on how fiscal and financial powers could be devolved to and beyond cities and City Regions in England.&#xa0;2.0              Evidence&#xa0;2.1              The scale of economic competition currently provided by Scotland is an issue which the council wishes to respond to.  Research has already been undertaken by organisations such as the Association of North East Councils in this regard, in terms of both competing and engaging with Scotland.&#xa0;2.2              An un-level playing field currently exists between England and Scotland in respect of devolved fiscal and financial powers.  Scotland already has power over many of the key determinants of economic development including infrastructure, skills, education and industrial development and could become more attractive for inward investment if it acquires greater fiscal powers, to the detriment of areas in the North East and Cumbria in particular.  For example, Scotland has the ability to vary taxes and incentives to its advantage but the North East and Cumbria doesn’t have the ability to take countervailing measures.&#xa0;2.3              The different institutional frameworks and capacities on each side of the border (particularly since the abolition of the Regional Development Agencies  and the Government Offices) place the North East and Cumbria at a disadvantage.&#xa0;2.4              Both are institutionally weaker following the abolition of regional structures leaving them with reduced power and autonomy.  Scotland, in contrast, already has powerful political and economic development organisations (including Scottish Local Authorities, Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish Funding Council and Skills Scotland) forming a more effective institutional framework with the capacity to speak with a single voice directly to the First Minister for Scotland and colleagues on a regular basis.&#xa0;2.5              The Scottish Independence Referendum to be held on 18 September 2014 and is very likely to result in Scotland acquiring substantial new powers either through independence, or the ‘Devo Plus’ or ‘Devo Max’ options.  Regardless of the actual result, the acquisition of new powers by Scotland can be expected to have substantial economic development implications for the rest of the UK, and especially for the North East and Cumbria.&#xa0;2.6              Increased autonomy for Scotland, is therefore not just a matter for Scotland.  A resurgent Scotland will pose a threat to economic development south of the border, but there is also the potential for economic development in the North East and Cumbria to benefit from a more autonomous Scotland.  The City Council recognises that there are both potential threats and opportunities but they do not necessarily balance out.&#xa0;2.7              It is Sunderland City Council’s consideration that without greater fiscal devolution to and beyond cities and City Regions areas like Sunderland are at risk of being caught between “a rock and a hard place”, between an increasing autonomous and confident Scotland and an increasingly prosperous and powerful London and the South East.&#xa0;2.8              An example of the type of incentives for growth which the City Council would seek to have devolved to relevant local authorities would include the ability to put together a package of incentives that would be equivalent (but not identical) in financial terms to that which Scotland/Scottish authorities would be able to muster.  The City Council recognises that for instance, varying Corporation Tax within the rest of the United Kingdom would not be possible, financial devolution could allow the North East and Cumbria to assemble a competitive financial offer.&#xa0;3.0              Conclusion&#xa0;3.1              The issue of Scotland’s competitive advantage now and after the independence referendum must inform considerations by government in respect of maximizing economic impact and the potential to improve services and reduce costs through fiscal devolution to and beyond cities and City Regions in England.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
