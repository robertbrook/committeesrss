"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of interest: The Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics was formed by Compassion in World Farming, the Soil Association and Sustain to raise awareness about the growing threat of antibiotic resistance passing from food animals to humans.\n&#xa0;\n1.1 Rates of antibiotic resistance in some infections have increased substantially, sometimes dramatically, over the past decade, but these developments have not been uniform.  In some cases, like MRSA, there have even been significant improvements in recent years. It is therefore necessary to look at bacterial types separately.\n1.2. Virtually all bacteria can be divided into two large families called Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which have different cell walls and react differently to different antibiotics.\n1.3. Whereas new antibiotics are still being developed for some Gram-positive bacteria like MRSA, no significant new antibiotics have recently become available for treating major Gram-negative bacteria, like E. coli, and none are well advanced in the development pipeline.\n1.4. As a result, most of the concern regarding the rise of resistance is now focused on Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n1.5. The rise of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, in particular, has been particularly dramatic during the past decade. Rates of resistance to some of the most important antibiotics for treating E. coli infections, the modern cephalosporins, the fluoroquinolones and gentamicin have increased sharply since the 1990s. Strains are now emerging which are resistant to the antibiotics of last resort, the carbapenems, which doctors increasingly have to turn to because they are concerned that the other antibiotics won’t work. Doctors are even sometimes using older antibiotics which had previously been abandoned because of their toxicity. The rise of resistant E. coli is happening internationally, and the European Centre for Disease Control has called it ‘remarkable’ \n[1]\n.\n1.6. Approximately 70-80% of urinary-tract infections are caused by E. coli and if the strain is resistant to the antibiotic chosen, the infection may develop into blood-poisoning. This probably explains why the sharp increase in E. coli resistance has coincided with an equally dramatic increase in the incidence of E. coli blood poisoning. E. coli overtook Staphylcococcus aureus to become the leading cause of blood poisoning in the UK in 2003, and now causes nearly 40,000 cases a year, over three times more than S. aureus.\n1.7. The emergence of resistance to antibiotics classified by the WHO as critically important in human medicine, the fluoroquinolones and the modern cephalosporins, is a major development which has occurred in recent years, and which has been driven by inappropriate use of these antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine. An important example of this is the emergence of ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) resistance in E. coli and Salmonella, which confers resistance to the modern cephalosporins.\n1.8. Livestock-associated strains of MRSA infecting humans are a developing problem, which also results from the use of modern cephalosporins in farm animals.\n2.1. Whether or not farm antibiotic use contributes to the rise of resistance in human infections has been a major source of scientific debate and controversy over many years. However, remaining uncertainties should not be used as an excuse for inaction.\n2.2. It is now generally accepted that human antibiotic use is overall the main cause of resistance in human infections, but that farm antibiotic use also makes a significant contribution to the human resistance problem.\n2.3. For some bacteria like Campylobacter and Salmonella, farm antibiotic use is the principal cause of resistance in human infections. For others, like E. coli and enterococci, farm antibiotic use contributes significantly to the human resistance problem.\n2.4. Salmonella is a food-poisoning infection which often causes outbreaks where a number of people are infected at the same time. Because of this it is generally easy to establish the origin of the bacteria and their resistance. Meat, particularly poultry, is also known to be a major source of Campylobacter infection.\n2.5. EFSA concluded in its 2008 report, which reviewed the evidence on foodborne antimicrobial resistance, that: ‘\nResistant Salmonella and Campylobacter involved in human disease are mostly spread through foods\n’ \n[2]\n.\n2.6. The WHO similarly said in its 2011 report on foodborne antibiotic resistance: \n‘\nResistance in the foodborne zoonotic bacteria Salmonella and Campylobacter is clearly linked to antibiotic use in food animals, and foodborne diseases caused by such resistant bacteria are well documented in people. Of special concern is resistance to so-called critically important antibiotics for human medicine. For example, the use of fluoroquinolones in food animals has led to a corresponding antibiotic resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter species, thus causing infections in people’\n \n[3]\n.\n2.7. With E. coli, which cause urinary-tract and blood-poisoning infections, and with enterococci, which cause kidney and wound infections, definitively establishing the origin of resistance is more difficult because farm-animal strains can frequently contribute to resistance in human infections by transferring copies of resistance genes to human-adapted E. coli and enterococci in the human intestine, rather than by directly causing infections.\n2.8. Despite these greater scientific difficulties, in both cases, there is now clear evidence that farm-animal antibiotic use does contribute significantly to antibiotic resistance in human infections. This is particularly important in the case of E. coli because of the large rise in resistance which has occurred in these infections in recent years. The accumulating evidence has led one leading Australian scientist to warn that, with resistant E. coli, ‘We are what we eat’ \n[4]\n.\n2.9. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also said:\n‘\nSome categories of food may often be contaminated with E. coli, including resistant isolates, and these bacteria reside long enough in the intestines of humans to be able to transfer resistance genes to the residential flora. It is therefore highly probable that food is a vehicle for spread of resistance genes between different ecosystems\n’ \n[1]\n.\n2.10. To our knowledge, there is only one scientific study which has directly studied the effect of food on resistant E. coli in people’s intestines \n[5]\n[6]\n. This French study involved volunteers eating their normal diet for 21 days, and subsequently eating a sterile diet for an average of 17 days (during the sterile-diet period their food was heated to 105ᵒC for one hour, which was shown to be sufficient to destroy any E. coli bacteria on the food).\n2.11. The faecal E. coli taken daily from the six volunteers were tested for resistance to three antibiotics, tetracycline, ampicillin and streptomycin. Once the sterile diet began, a drastic fall in the number of resistant bacteria occurred. The number of tetracycline-resistant E. coli fell 500-fold (by 99.8%), the number of ampicillin-resistant E. coli fell 250-fold (by 99.6%) and the number of streptomycin-resistant E. coli fell 125-fold (by 99.2%). The total number of E. coli (including antibiotic-sensitive E. coli) only fell 3-fold. Figure 1 illustrates the fall for tetracycline-resistant E. coli and total E. coli.\n2.12. Figure 1 Log number of E. coli per gram of stools given sterile diet after three weeks (the graph uses a log scale, so 1 on vertical axis means 10 bacteria, 2 means 100 bacteria, 3 means 1000 bacteria etc.).\n2.13. The scientist concluded from this experiment that most antibiotic-resistant E. coli in the human intestine come from contaminated food. This is important because it is the E. coli living in our intestines which ultimately cause most urinary-tract and blood-poisoning infections.\n2.14. Further, virtually conclusive proof that farm antibiotic use can lead to resistance in human infections, including E. coli, was obtained when the antibiotic nourseothricin was used in pigs in the former East Germany in the 1980s. No equivalent antibiotic was used in humans during the same period, so when resistance to the antibiotic subsequently appeared in human E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella infections, it could only have been due to the use in pigs. One scientist from the UK’s Veterinary Laboratories Agency commented that: ‘\nThese observations strongly support the premise that resistance genes present in the commensal flora of animals can spread to bacteria which can colonize or infect humans\n’ \n[7]\n.\n2.15. Similarly, in the 1980s and 1990s, government scientists working for the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) produced some strong evidence that resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics was passing from farm animals to humans. By 1994, they said that their findings: ‘\nsupport the view that resistance to gentamicin and apramycin in clinical isolates of E. coli results from the spread of resistant organisms from animals to man, with subsequent inter-strain or inter-species spread, or both, of resistance genes on transferable plasmids\n’ \n[8]\n.\n2.16. More recently, in 2011 an international study used data from 11 European countries and concluded that: ‘\nIn addition to the contribution of antimicrobial usage in people, a large proportion of resistant E. coli isolates causing blood stream infections in people are likely derived from food animal sources\n’ \n[9]\n.\n2.17. Regarding the spread of the highly antibiotic-resistant ESBL E. coli, the main epidemic strain of ESBL E. coli in humans in the UK, called ST131, is not thought to have a significant farm-animal link from animals in this country.\n2.18. There is, nevertheless, substantial evidence that farm animals may be a source for some of the other ESBL E. coli strains, which have been increasing in incidence in human infections, as well as sources of resistance genes which may be transmitted to pathogenic strains. EFSA, for example, has said that the similarities between one type of ESBL found in humans and farm animals ‘\nstrongly suggests an animal reservoir for this ESBL gene variant\n’ \n[10]\n.\n2.19. Further information on the links between farm antibiotic use and resistance in human infections is available from the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics report ‘Antibiotic resistance – the impact of intensive farming on human health’ \n[11]\n.\n3.1. In human medicine, reducing the inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics, and improving hygiene so that the spread of pathogens is limited are the two most effective measures which can be taken to tackle the spread of antibiotic resistance.\n3.2. Improved hospital hygiene and a significant reduction in the use of the critically important antibiotics contributed to the large fall in the hospital incidence of MRSA and Clostridium difficile. These reductions in antibiotic use also led to a stabilisation of ESBL resistance in E. coli, which had previously been increasing year on year.\n3.3. Similar principles apply to antibiotic-resistant bacteria found in farming. The higher the levels of antibiotic use, the more likely that resistance will emerge. The resistant bacteria will spread more readily if the animals are kept in close confinement, indoors, rather than when they are raised with access to the outdoors.\n3.4. A joint report by two government committees, DARC and ARHAI, said: ‘\nfor animals, the risks of acquiring resistant bacterial infections also tend to be highest in those individuals that are ill and/or under antimicrobial treatment, followed by those kept in higher stocking density situations and/or  mixed with other animals on a regular basis and lowest for animals kept singly or extensively’\n \n[12]\n.\n3.5. Both the Belgian and Danish Governments are beginning to require reductions in livestock stocking density in order to reduce the use of antibiotics \n[14]\n[15]\n.\n3.6. According to statistics produced annually by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), approximately 95% of UK farm antibiotic use is in pigs and poultry, the two most intensively farmed species. The routine use of antibiotics in feed and water for disease prevention is what enables many intensive pig and poultry farmers to keep animals indoors in crowded conditions where disease spread is inevitable. A move to less intensive forms of farming would lead to much lower levels of antibiotic use, but would also more generally reduce the spread of bacterial and viral diseases (such as swine flu) which can be transmitted to humans.\n3.7. Defra research found much lower levels of antibiotic use in organic pigs and poultry than in conventionally farmed pigs. Of five organic and seven non-organic pig farms followed during the two-year study, the non-organic farms used between 13 and 330 times more antibiotic per kilo of meat produced than the highest-consuming organic farm. Only one of seven organic poultry farms surveyed used any antibiotics during the entire study period \n[13]\n.\n4.1. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can easily move across borders, either because of global travel, or because of international trade in food or live animals, so international action is highly desirable. Nevertheless, the benefits of action at a national level should not be dismissed. Countries like Sweden and Denmark have led the world in reducing their farm use of antibiotics and consequently have much lower levels of resistance in their food.\n4.2. The European Union has already taken some welcome action aimed at reducing the veterinary use of critically important antibiotics, particularly the modern cephalosporins. However, much more remains to be done. Some of the most important elements of a truly effective strategy would be:  \n5.1. The publication of the Government’s five-year strategy plan is welcome, but there is a disappointing lack of specific recommendations for reducing antibiotic use in farming. The plan contains only general advice that farmers and vets should use antimicrobials responsibly, but leaves it to the industry to decide what is, and what is not, responsible.\n5.2. The importance of education, hygiene, surveillance of resistance and of antibiotic use are all emphasised, but no goals are set for reducing overall antibiotic use or the use of the critically important antibiotics. No commitments are made to collect antibiotic-usage data by animal species, resistance data on farm-animal E. coli, or to review the widespread practice of using antibiotics routinely in the feed and water of healthy animals – all recommendations which have previously been made by independent UK advisory committees.\n5.3. Some European countries have already introduced policies which go significantly further than the UK towards reducing farm antibiotic use. The Netherlands reduced farm antibiotic use by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2012 \n[16]\n. In Denmark, 97% of poultry no longer receive any medically important antibiotics and there is now a ‘yellow-card’ scheme which cautions farmers using too many antibiotics \n[17]\n. The French government has announced an action plan which aims to reduce farm antibiotic use by 25% in five years \n[18]\n.\n5.4. Despite the lack of specific actions recommended in the action plan, earlier this year the VMD and by the then Public Health Minister, Anna Soubry MP, made welcome statements that the routine use of antibiotics for disease prevention is not acceptable practice. However, it remains legal to use some antibiotics in the feed or water of herds or flocks of animals when no disease has been diagnosed and there are still not any proposals to phase this practice out. So it is unclear whether these statements will lead to any significant regulatory change.\n&#xa0;\n[1]\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEuropean Centre of Disease Prevention and Control, 2011.
