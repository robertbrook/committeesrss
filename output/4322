[normal]CIBSE is pleased to respond to 
[normal]the 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee’s
[normal] consultation on 
[normal]Low Carbon Innovation.
[normal]Summary of CIBSE [bold]Response[bold]1. There is t[bold]oo much focus [bold]in the Government[bold]’s approach to Low carbon Innovation [bold]on individual measures or [bold]incentives and insufficient focus on systems integration[bold] and on feedback and analysis of the performance of incentivised low carbon measures[bold]. [bold]2. [bold]The current strategy does not reflect that used elsewhere in Government [bold] of first reducing energy use through efficiency, then reducing energy use through low carbon systems, and only then delivering energy through low carbon or renewable generation. [bold]3. T[bold]here is insufficient attention to existing buildings and the specific consumer or user aspects of promoting low carbon interventions in existing buildings, and undue emphasis on retrofitting bolt on low carbon technology. [bold]4. There is insufficient [bold]support [bold]for the innovations required for [bold] the delivery of existing policies such as the energy performance of buildings regulations and building regulations. [bold]Q1. [bold]Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legal[bold]ly binding targets at the lowest possible cost?[bold]1. 
[normal]The 
[normal]associated 
[normal]NAO 
[normal]Report 
[normal]has quoted the IIASA 
[normal]Global Energy Assessment’s conclusion
[normal] that innovation plays a key role in the delivery of a low carbon global economy. Many of the innovations that will be de
[normal]ployed over the next decades to meet the UK’s target will have been developed by industries abroad
[normal] eager to capture global markets
[normal]. European manufacturers are taking leading roles in technology like organic LED’s, High Voltage DC transmission and smart gri
[normal]d control. The Department inherited 
[normal]possibly
[normal] the most incoherent programme of 
[normal]public sector 
[normal]research amongst its 
[normal]international 
[normal]peers, and its approach 
[normal]to 
[normal]consolidation and co-ordination is widely welcomed. 
[normal]W
[normal]hether
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]when 
[normal]viewed in hindsight
[normal],
[normal] this consolidation 
[normal]will be seen to have delivered
[normal] the 
[normal]UK’s 
[normal]targets at the lowest cost
[normal],
[normal] is a harder question. 
[normal]2. 
[normal]Energy
[normal] engineering
[normal], 
[normal]whether 
[normal]collecting biomass 
[normal]or 
[normal]distributing 
[normal]electrical 
[normal]power is a set of interconnected systems. Systems incorrectly analyz
[normal]ed deliver less than the sum of their parts.  This is as true in cutting edge 
[normal]low energy 
[normal]building design as it is in many other fields. Indeed this Institution has 
[normal]recently 
[normal]prioritised looking at city level 
[normal]energy 
[normal]systems as key to delivering the full prom
[normal]ise of technology
[normal] to meet low carbon targets
[normal]. This 
[normal]important 
[normal]urban
[normal]-level
[normal] 
[normal]theme 
[normal]was also 
[normal]echoed in the IIASA report. We find the Governments innovation plans very patchy 
[normal]in resolving the inevitable systemic issues
[normal] in target delivery
[normal]. 
[normal]To achieve outcomes tha
[normal]t are efficient and effective, i
[normal]nnovation in deployment is at least
[normal],
[normal] if not more critical
[normal],
[normal] than innovation in components.
[normal]3. Innovation in deployment requires a greater degree of integration between policies than is currently achieved. For example, there a
[normal]re several incentive schemes for the delivery of low carbon building technologies, the feed in tariff for photovoltaics and the renewable heat incentive for biomass heating, solar thermal and heat pump systems. When first launched 
[normal]none 
[normal]of these required an
[normal]y minimum level of energy efficiency to be present in buildings in receipt of the incentive payments, even though the installation of basic insulation and draft proofing would have delivered a far better return on investment than the investment in renewabl
[normal]e systems. This clearly fails the test of delivering low carbon innovation at lowest cost. 
[normal]4. 
[normal]In contrast 
[normal]the Department for Communities and Local Government, they have adopted a hierarchical approach to delivering “zero carbon” buildings, 
[normal][[to include it
[normal] would be a bit of a diversion]]
[normal]This sets out the policy approach of seeking improvements in building fabric first, then seeking to reduce the emissions from the installed energy using systems, called carbon compliance, and only then looking to install ren
[normal]ewables (or using “allowable solutions” instead). Whilst “allowable solutions” demonstrate innovation in low carbon accountancy, they are unlikely to drive innovation in low carbon technology.
[normal]5. A further frequently overlooked aspect of low carbon 
[normal]innovation relates to its successful integration into buildings
[normal] as complex systems
[normal]. Buildings are responsible for almost half of UK carbon emissions, and many of those which emit the highest levels of carbon per unit floor area are the most complex. In the
[normal]ory, Building Regulations require that these buildings have the
[normal]ir
[normal] complex energy systems properly installed, tested, and commissioned, or put into practical operation. In practice, it is widely understood in the industry that the various minimum legal requ
[normal]irements to commission building services systems are honoured in the breach. 
[normal]6. There is also evidence to suggest that the measures required by the energy performance of buildings regulations, which implement the eponymous Directive, are widely 
[normal]overlooked
[normal], leaving building owners individually, and DCLG, DECC and other policymakers unaware of current levels of energy performance of much of the building stock. It 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]therefore very 
[normal]hard 
[normal]to argue that low carbon building innovation is being delivered on the sc
[normal]ale it should be, let alone at lowest cost.
[normal] A strong driver for innovation would be if new buildings procured by Government were required to deliver a Display Energy Certificate rating of A in 
[normal]the relevant
[normal] c
[normal]ategory
[normal]. 
[normal]DEC’s focus on real out turns not simply
[normal] design calculations made pre-tender.
[normal]Q2.[bold]Does the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?[bold]7. 
[normal]This I
[normal]nstitution has long been concerned at the inverted pyramid of public sector funding for energy research.  Research that improves the efficiency and efficacy of energy use may be messy but that is not a reason to deprioritise it against far blue skies resea
[normal]rch agendas like fusion, which often have little industrial relevance to the UK. 
[normal]This issue goes far beyond a low carbon agenda. If international consensus was to fail and the UK carbon target was to fade, the economy still has the pressing problem of rema
[normal]ining 
[normal]globally 
[normal]competitive should its marginal fuel remain LNG, 
[normal]currently 
[normal]the most expensive 
[normal]fossil 
[normal]fuel of all. 
[normal]8. Given the current levels of concern about the falling capacity margin in the wholesale electricity market, any policy which can deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions and energy demand has the potential to reduce the risk of power supply dis
[normal]ruption. Energy efficiency, or enabling people not to use as much energy without impairing their comfort, enjoyment or productive use of buildings is the lowest cost route to reducing UK electricity and gas demand. It may not require huge levels of technic
[normal]al research, but some of the research into consumer behaviour and reaction to energy efficiency propositions shows that more needs to be done to deliver consumer acceptable low carbon building refurbishment
[normal].
[normal]Q3. [bold]What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely[bold] to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?[bold]9. 
[normal]In the built environment sector, 
[normal]which is 
[normal]itself a significant part of the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]carbon footprint
[normal],
[normal] market pull rather than
[normal] technology push has been the defining paradigm of successful innovation. Unfortunately a
[normal] procurement
[normal] incentive plan with sufficient stability to create confidence has seldom been 
[normal]the outcome. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]For example 
[normal]level 6 of the
[normal] Code for Sustainable Homes had
[normal] been both a test bed for new technology and a market pull for better overall performance of housing
[normal]. As Code levels became economically achie
[normal]v
[normal]able 
[normal]by the industry at large 
[normal]they could
[normal] be later encapsulated in Building Regulations. We now understand that in
[normal] England 
[normal]at least (
[normal]and 
[normal]possibly also 
[normal]Wales
[normal])
[normal] the 
[normal]proposed
[normal] Housing Standards 
[normal]Review 
[normal]will 
[normal]lead to a winding down of the Code and public sector housing procurement will 
[normal]no longer link to it
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]n important incentive 
[normal]for innovation 
[normal]has 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]been removed in 
[normal]a critical area. Some of the leading specialist
[normal] firms
[normal] who have provided much of the innovation 
[normal]in this sector 
[normal]now face a difficult time
[normal], with little obvious prospect of their investments in levels 5 and 6 being profitable
[normal]. 
[normal]If there were short comings with 
[normal]the Code, given its innovation importance, they sh
[normal]o
[normal]uld have been addressed rather than the Code abandoned.
[normal]11. 
[normal]Closer to home, LCICG should look to 
[normal]the need for some stability in funding arrangements, and for 
[normal]smoother transitions between incentive schemes.
[normal] 
[normal]The current hiatus over the Energy Company Obligation has led to an almost total moratorium on new projects being approved, with very serious implications for the specialists who provide installations under ECO. These installers have to be certificated un
[normal]der the Green Deal installer rules, a process which will have cost them. Now, without the regulated workstream they expected from the ECO, they have to compete on the open unregulated market with those variously described as “cowboy” or “rogue” traders, wh
[normal]ere they cannot hope to recoup the costs of investing in Green Deal approval and certification. 
[normal]Their learning curves gains from repeated quality installations will be dispersed. 
[normal]The changes to the ECO arrangements threaten to penalise those installers mos
[normal]t likely to be working to 
[normal]and advancing 
[normal]good practice standards, and to reward those who stayed out of the ECO and Green Deal system. That is perverse. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. 
[normal]However, it is also a threat to future low carbon innovation schemes, as those who may consider be
[normal]coming early 
[normal]investors
[normal] will need to form a view on whether the scheme, and the political support for it, will be sufficien
[normal]tly robust to justify the risk of early participat
[normal]ion
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. 
[normal]Current transitions 
[normal]in the feed in tariff and renewable heat incentive al
[normal]so 
[normal]appea
[normal]r to pay little heed to the col
[normal]l
[normal]a
[normal]teral damage caused by abrupt change and funding hiatus. Specialist firms, and those most likely to provide innovative solutions, suffer most. In the present SME banking climate the effect can be terminal
[normal], and only 
[normal]odd job cowboy contractors survive
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. 
[normal]The Committee has asked for views on metrics. 
[normal]Experience suggests that metrics can cause more harm than good unless they closely reflect the objectives. 
[normal]The problems associated wioth a patents metric provides a good
[normal] example. 
[normal]F
[normal]inding a faster, cheaper way to install a solar collector is never likely to obtain a patent, but would revolutionize the market
[normal] since insulation costs now dominate
[normal]. We note that the LCICG naturally chose patents as one possibility, without nece
[normal]ssarily recognizing that this could distort priorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. In the market to retrofit low carbon solutions to existing buildings, the most significant innovations are likely to be process related, and not product related. Working out how to create a pack
[normal]age of cost effective measures to improve the worst housing in a cost effective manner will require innovation, but not patents. Perhaps metrics need to be applied to successful outcomes in the form of measurable low carbon results in buildings. The emphas
[normal]is needs to be on measured practical low carbon outcomes on site, and not on predicted theoretical results in a building simulation or design. 
[normal]Q4. [bold]Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment[bold] towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?[bold]16. 
[normal]We do not believe that is currently true for the built environment. While enthusiasts often promote the idea of learning 
[normal]rat
[normal]es to justify 
[normal]investment in expensiv
[normal]e renewables technology, it is hard to see how the argument can apply when there is so little investment in collecting 
[normal]data from which to 
[normal]learn.  Integrating heat pumps into heating systems is a case in point. Manufacturers’ test data suggested impressive 
[normal]performance
[normal] from the latest models
[normal]. 
[normal]But i
[normal]t required an initiative by the Energy Savings Trust to actually test the field performance of some 80 installations. Needless to say because of a lack of knowledge about critical systems
[normal] integration
[normal] issues the actu
[normal]al performance was disappointing. 
[normal]Yet CERT had installed some 8,000 heat pump installations without any feedback or learning.  
[normal]NAO recently commented on the general lack of feedback information during their review of the Levy Control Framework.
[normal]17. 
[normal]It is e
[normal]ven impossible to access 
[normal]statutory 
[normal]Display Energy Certificate 
[normal](
[normal]D
[normal]EC) d
[normal]ata 
[normal]in quantity 
[normal]online without incurring 
[normal]significant 
[normal]fees, despite the availability of benchmarking data being critical for the confident roll out of new technology.
[normal] Although energy perfo
[normal]rmance data is essential to the improvement of our building stock, DCLG is tied into a contract for the management of the national database of energy certificate data under which access to the data is only available at considerable expense. In the case of 
[normal]DEC data, which is required to be displayed in public buildings, and is therefore publicly available data, to obtain that data in aggregate form from Landmark is prohibitively expensive. 
[normal]Q5. [bold]What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on privat[bold]e sector investment?[bold]18. 
[normal]The Institution can only offer an observation. Modern R&amp;D is a fast moving area. For example smart grids built today might be obsolete in 5 years time such is the pace of IT technology. What is often a greater disincentive
[normal] than fun
[normal]ding length
[normal], especially when trying to incorporate new technology into a real project
[normal],
[normal] is the front end delay in obtaining final approval
[normal] from a support scheme
[normal].  Whether delays are unavoidable it is hard to say from 
[normal]the 
[normal]outside
[normal], but our own research fund 
[normal]can 
[normal]make allocative decisions within weeks.
[normal]Q6. [bold]How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?[bold]19. 
[normal]The Institution suggests th
[normal]at the Committee might wish to 
[normal]e
[normal]n
[normal]quir
[normal]e whether the underspend relates 
[normal]in part 
[normal]to Departmental staffing levels.  In other areas of Government recent staff reductions have had a disproportionate reduction in in-house technical skills able to process projects with confidence.
[normal]20. The Department 
[normal]might consider that any initiative to increase spending should focus on improving system integration and outcomes, and on measuring actual practical performance of some of the early installations under the various existing schemes.
[normal]Q7. [bold]How is the Governmen[bold]t maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?[bold]21. 
[normal]CIBSE’s membership is worldwide.  We work closely with our US sister organisation 
[normal]ASHRAE 
[normal]and we are an active member in the Europe wide equivalen
[normal]t REHVA.  Most of the public sector research is indeed in the public domain, and many of the companies involved in innovation are themselves global in reach. Possibly the starkest comparison is in the style of 
[normal]innovation
[normal] procurement. The US Department of E
[normal]nergy funds large programmes through experienced prime contractors, much as the 1970’s 
[normal]UK 
[normal]Department of Energy used the UKEA to run the programmes of the Energy Efficiency Office. 
[normal]US 
[normal]Government is also a strong provider of market pull for innovation, espec
[normal]ially the Department of Defense. 
[normal]This May
[normal],
[normal] for example
[normal],
[normal] DOD connected its Fort Bliss embedded generation system into the Texa
[normal]s power grid, showcasing Lockhee
[normal]d smart grid controllers. 
[normal] In Europe larg
[normal]e metrop
[normal]o
[normal]l
[normal]itan authorities are frequently involved in the 
[normal]procurement of innovative solutions such as advanced waste combustion and heat distribution. The po
[normal]w
[normal]er of informed and challenging procurement along the technology strategy trajectory is noticeable by its absence in the UK
[normal] programmes
[normal].
