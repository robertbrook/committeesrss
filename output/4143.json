"&#xa0;\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND OMBUDSMAN [PHS0044]&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n1.\n1\n              \nI am pleased to have the opportu\nni\nty to \ncontribute\n to the Committee’s inquiry into Parliament’s \nOmbudsman\n Service\n and to \nshare with the\n Committee my experiences as Northern Ireland \nOmbudsman\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nI curre\nntly hold two statutory offices,\n that of Assembly \nOmbudsman\n for \nNorthern Ireland\n and the \nNorthern \nIreland\n Commissioner for Complaints.  I have held both offices since September 2000.  In my role as Assembly \nOmbudsman\n, I have \nthe authority\n to investigate complaints of maladmi\nni\nstration \nmade \nagainst \nNorthern Ireland Departments and their statutory agenci\nes.  As \nNorthern Ireland\n Commissioner for Complaints, I \nhave the authority to\n investigate complaints of maladmi\nni\nstration about local authorities, housing, health and social care bodies a\nnd a wide range of arms length \nauthorities\n including \na number of \njust\nice\n bodies\n in \nNorthern Irelan\nd\n.  I\nn\n addition, a number of statutory \nregulatory bodies\n are within my jurisdiction; these include the \nEq\nu\nality\n \nC\nommission for \nNorthern Irel\na\nnd\n, the Northern Ireland Children and Young Persons Commissioner, and the Commissioner\n for \nOlder People \nfor \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nLike \nthe current \nPHSO, I h\na\nve a jurisdiction in respect of health complaints which \nalso allows\n me to examine the cli\nni\ncal judgement of health professionals including general health service provi\nd\ners and \nindependent\n health \nservice \nproviders.\n  Because health and social care are provided as an integrated service in \nNorthern Ireland\n, I can investigate cases across \nthe full spectrum of health\n and social care.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \n              \nThroughout my time as Northern Ireland \nOmb\nu\nd\nsman, I have\n seen a steady increase\n \nin \ncitizen\n’s\n \naccessing\n \nmy office to seek redress for \ninjustice \nresulting from \nthe admi\nni\nstrative \nfailu\nre of bodies in my jurisdiction.  In particular, in the first six months of this financial year, complaints to my office overall \nhave increased by 3\n1\n% and \nwithin this the\n health jurisdiction \nfigure \nhas \nseen\n an increase of over \n35\n%.\n&#xa0;\n1.4 \n              \nThe \ncitizen\n can complain to my office \nat any point in their service journey but I\n normally expect the complainant to have exhausted the complaints \nprocess of the body \nthat ha\ns\n provided the service\n before bringing a complaint to me.  This \napproach confirms\n the role of my office as the office of last resort in respect of citizen\n’s\n complaints \nparticularly where they \nrelate to\n poo\nr\n admi\nni\nstration.  \nCurre\nntly, as happens with the \nPHSO, there is a filter for complaints to my office in \nmy role as Assembly \nOmbudsman\n where an individual is alleging\n maladmi\nni\nstration by \nGovernment \nDepar\nt\nments and their agencies.  \nThis filter requires that\n the \ncomplainant secure\ns\n sponsorship \nof their\n complaint\n by a member of \nthe \nNorthern \nIreland Assembly\n.  It is probable\n that \nthis barrier \nwill\n be removed \nif \nthe \nlegislative changes that are currently being \nproposed\n by the\n \nOFMdFM\n Committee of the\n \nNorthern Ireland \nAssembly\n \nare imple\nmented\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nThe Landscape of Ombudsmen and Complaint Handlers in the \nUK\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe landscape of ombudsme\nn and complaint handlers in the \nUK\n \ndealing with complaints about public services and consumer grievances \nis\n, in my view, \ncrowded\n.  T\nhis \noften \ncan be \nconfusing for the citizen who seeks redress for injus\ntice.  \nIn order to refine\n the redress landscape, t\nhe devolved government\ns in \nScotland\n and \nWales\n \nconsulted on the roles and remit of various ombudsmen schemes\n in those countries\n. As a result \na single \noffi\nce of \nPublic Services \nOmbudsman\n \nwas created \nin \nScotland\n in 2002 and in \nWales\n in 2005 in order \nto deal\n with complaints of maladmi\nni\nstration about \nthose \ndevolved \nbodies who deliver public services.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThis ‘one stop shop model’ for complaints about publi\nc administration has, in essence, been in existence in \nNorthern Ireland\n since 1969 with the creation of the statutory offices of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration for \nNorthern Ireland\n and \nNorthern Ireland\n Commissioner for Complaints. \nWhile \nthes\ne of\nf\nices were rebranded \nin 1996, \nas Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints \nrespectively, they \nhave\n, \nsince their inception\n ( with one exception), \n been \nheld by the same \no\nmbudsman with\n staff inves\ntigat\ning \nco\nmplaints spanning central\n and \nlocal gov\nernment, health and social \ncare, housing\n and other public services across both \nstatutory remits.\n.\n A\nn\n \nindependent review of \nthe \noffice by Deloitte in 2004 \nrecommended legislation\n to merge the\nse\n \nstatutory offices\n. W\nhen \nenacted\n this will\n give\n \nlegal \neffect to the devolved \nombudsman model o\nf a \none stop shop for complaints about \nlocal \npublic services\n.\n  The \ndevelopment of legislative proposals \nfor \nth\na\nt\n single office\n, to be known as the \nNorthern Ireland Public Services \nOmbudsm\nan\n (\nN\nI\nPSO) \nhas been undertaken by the\n OFMdFM Committee and this legislation \nwill be introduced into the Assembly in \nearly \n2014.  While the specific provisions are still to be \ndrafted, \ndebated and scruti\nni\nsed, I welcome the \nOFMdFM\n Committee’s \nparticular\n con\nt\nrib\nut\nion and commitment to introducing this legislation which \nwill modernise\n \nmy \nO\nffice\n and provide greater access \nfor\n citizen\ns to remedy and redress when public\n \nservice\ns\n \nin \nN\northern \nIr\neland\n fail them.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nAccess to Parliament’s \nOmbudsman\n Service\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nTo e\nnsure that all cit\nizens have direct access to an o\nmbudsman, having exhausted \nthe internal complaints procedure of bodies\n, it is important that\n \nany barriers to accessibility \nto further redress \nare\n removed.  Sponsorship by a Member of Parliament or \nmembers o\nf a\n Legislative Assembly should not, in my view, be a requirement\n \nin\n bringing a complaint to an \nomb\nu\ndsman\n.  The \n‘\ntwin-track approach\n’\n as proposed by the Law Commission for \nEngland\n and \nWales\n would ensure that the citizen who wishes to complain has, if he or she so chooses, the support of their MP or MLA in bringing a complaint to an \no\nmbudsman\n.  This \nwould also help maintain that vital link between the legislature and \nthe\n \nOmbudsman\n which is ne\ncessary to ensure that \nG\novernment \ndepartments and public bodies are\n held to account \nf\nor \nthe\n quality and delivery of public services.\n  The Committee may also wish to note the development of monthly bulletins and case digests in \nScotland\n, \nWales\n and \nNorthern \nIreland\n that offer an alternative means of keeping elected members \nupdated\n about \nthe nature, number and source of \ncases and complaints being raised by citizens.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nIn \nScotland\n and \nWales\n,\n the ‘filter’ has already been removed in relation to complaints abo\nut central government\n departments\n.  In \nNorthern Ireland\n,\n I am on record as \nask\ning for the removal\n of the MLA filter in relation to complaints about \nNorthern Ireland\n  \n Departments.  In my role as \nNorthern Ireland\n Commissioner for Complaints dealing with hea\nlth and social care\n,\n \nlocal government and public services, \nno such requirement exists.  This\n dichotomy between the two regimes\n is confusing for the public who seek to \naccess\n my office.  I therefore welcome the \npolicy \nproposal of the \nOFMdFM\n Committee to rep\nlace the MLA filter with the \n‘\ntwin track approach\n’\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nOmbudsmen and Powers of Own Initiative\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nIn the \nUK\n, an \nOmbudsman\n model has developed which is dependent on the citizen pursuing a complaint.  This is not the model which has developed \ni\nnternationally where \norganisations such as the European Ombudsman, \nhave the power to commence an investigation \nwithout first receiving a complaint\n \nfrom a citizen\n.  \nIn the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n, the Ombudsman has discretion to commence such an investigation a\nnd this has been used sparingly but to significant effect\n.  The value of an ‘own-initiative’ power is that it can deliver systemic improvements for a greater number of citizens and not just the complainant in a particular case.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThe Deloitte Review recommended that the NIPSO have a power to commence an investigation where there is evidence of systemic maladministration.  \nI am pleased to note that the\n \nOFMdFM\n policy proposals provide for such a power in the \nproposed \nN\nIPSO \nlegislatio\nn\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nThe Reformed \nOmbudsman\n’s \nOffice\n Relationship with Parliament’s Select Committee\ns\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nPublic Services \no\nmbudsmen exist to\n provide a\n service\n for\n the citizen, the wider public and Parliament itself.   \nThey play a unique role in reflecting to Parliament\n the concerns of the ‘governed’ about the services overseen and provided by Government.  It is important therefore that Public Services ombudsmen have a mechanism for bringing the results of their investigations to th\ne attention of a Parliament or l\negislat\nive Assembly.  \nI currently produce periodic case digests and an annual report which I lay before the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Assembly’s response has been that \nthe relevant\n \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee ha\ns\n invited me to give evidence of the issues raised in the\nse reports.  \nFor instance, I have given evidence to the Committee for the Environment on issues arising from complaints to my Office about the planning service and the Committee for Finance and Personnel about complaints relating to public procurement.  I \nwelcome this opportunity to inform the relevant Select Committee about the results of my investigations which may assist a Committee’s deliberations and considerations of related issues, by providing a real time and, importantly, independent perspective on\n the citizen’s experience of public services.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe role of informing Parliament of the overall outcome and findings of the Ombudsman across his/her range of investigations should be undertaken by a separate Select Committee from the Committee that is s\ncrutinising the financial and administrative performance of the Ombudsman’s office. \nScrutiny of an \no\nmbudsman\n’s performance by a single Select Committee is a necessary role to ensure that \nthe \nservice is operating effectively \nand efficiently, \nand is \nprovidin\ng an appropriate, \nproper \naccount \nof the \nguardianship of \nhis/her\n remit and expenditure.  I currently do not report directly to a \nspecific \nCommittee in \nrelation to this separate aspect of my role\n. \n  However, i\nt is proposed that the financial performance of t\nhe new \nNI\nPSO\n be subject to the scrutiny \nby\n the Audit Committee\n of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  \n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nThe Role of a Complaints Standards Authority\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nThe establish\nment of a \nC\nomplaints \nStandards\n \nA\nuthority was debated by the \nOFMdFM\n Committee when considering \nthe\n policy \nframework that would inform its approach to the proposed\n \nN\nI\nPSO Bill.  The Committee considered this was no\nt an appropriate role for the NIPSO \nand after due consideration, I \nhave \naccept\ned\n this view.  A different model \nhas emerged in \nNorthern Ireland\n to ensure a standardised approach to complaints handling \nin\n \nour jurisdiction\n.  In 2009, I published guidance on standards for effective complaint handling\n.  I am pleased to note that these standards have been adopted by the\n interdepartmental group on \ncomplaints\n handling convened by the Permanent Secretary Group for Northern Ireland (PSG).  As a result, the following recommendations of that interdepartmental group are being implem\ne\nnted as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI welcome this initiative and my office will continue to engage with the PSG and the interdepartmental group members to assist in these significant innova\ntions in \nthe \ncomplaint handling \nof public bodies \nin \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember
