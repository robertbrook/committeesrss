[[[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland – Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]                                                                                                  Our Committee, on behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, confined its examination of the provisions of this Bill to Schedule 5, Insolvency and Company Law.  Our specific comments on those provisions are attached herewith.&#xa0;We respond to a number of the general questions posed in the Call for Written Evidence as follows:&#xa0;

[[[Q. 3]]]

[[[              ]]]Are the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account?&#xa0;

[[[A. 3]]]              We are not convinced of the benefits/risk balance in the proposal to remove the obligation on a bankrupt to present a statement of affairs when the petition is presented by a creditor.&#xa0;

[[[Q. 4]]]              Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly?&#xa0;

[[[A. 4]]]              On balance, yes.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q. 5]]]              Will the draft Bill generally benefit businesses by offsetting other regulatory burdens?&#xa0;

[[[A. 5]]]              Reduction in administrative burdens in insolvency assignments will reduce costs. Consequently, more funds will be available for the creditors of the insolvent business.&#xa0;

[[[Q. 6]]]    To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses?&#xa0;

[[[A. 6 ]]]   Amendments within Schedule 5 may benefit consumers who are creditors of insolvent           businesses.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;John Bowen-WalshSecretaryInsolvency Committee&#xa0;16 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
