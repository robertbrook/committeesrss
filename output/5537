[normal]Written evidence submitted by WWF UK[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WWF is a leading global conservation organisation, employing over 5000 staff in more than 100 countries and with more than five million supporters across the world.
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WWF has been working on marine conservation and management for over 30 years. We have worked with fisheries to make them more sustainable and have helped achieve protection for marine areas around the world, including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, mangroves, fish breeding grounds, and deep-sea habitats. In all cases, these successes have been due to strong partnerships including fishermen, local communities, businesses, governments, NGOs, and research institutions, all working together towards a common vision to manage and conserve marine ecosystems and the resources they support.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WWF-UK is a member of Wildlife and Countryside Link and supports the written evidence submitted by its Marine Working Group. This short submission for WWF-UK complements that of Link by looking more widely at the delivery of the UK Government’s marine programme and the contribution it will make towards achieving Good Environmental Status of our seas by 2020.
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This inquiry is timely, not only to reflect upon recent progress in designating MCZs, but also as there is an unprecedented level of change that is being driven by legislation and policy, both domestic and European. Much of this change will be focused over the next three to four years, and some of it is already underway. These changes can potentially lead to a radically different, pro-active and positive way to steward the marine environment and to manage marine industries such as fisheries and energy provision. Together they provide an opportunity to ensure greater coherence across marine related work within and beyond Government.
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WWF-UK welcomes the opportunity to submit written evidence to this important inquiry. In doing so, we wish to fully support the points made in the Link response. In summary:
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]However, WWF believes that i
[normal]solated 
[normal]protected sites
[normal] cannot effectively protect marine habitats
[normal] and species
[normal]. Neither can isolated instances of well-managed fisheries
[normal] or other industry activity
[normal]. Instead, we need to conserve and sustainably manage entire marine 
[normal]ecoregions
[normal]. We 
[normal]can achieve
[normal] this through a large-scale, holistic approach that involves:
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK Government and Devolved Administrations’ stated aim is to create an ecologically coherent network of MPAs throughout UK waters. It is intended that the network will contribute to the delivery of international commitments for the protection of marine biodiversity through MPA networks and will contribute to the achievement of Good Environmental Status (GES) under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Good Ecological Status under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Favourable Conservation Status for Annex I habitats and Annex II species under the EC Habitats Directive and Annex I species under the EC Birds Directive.
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It was never envisaged that Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), designated under the Marine &amp; Coastal Access Act 2009, would be sufficient on their own to form an ecologically representative network. The intent was that the network would be comprised 
[normal]of nationally important sites through the designation of MCZs, internationally important sites through the existing and new designations of Special Areas for Conservation (Habitats and Species Directive) and Special Protection Areas (Birds Directive), and marine components of existing Sites of Special Scientific Interest (Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981) and Ramsar sites (Ramsar Convention), plus MPAs in Scottish territorial waters (under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010) and sites to be designated in Norther
[normal]n Ireland’s territorial waters.
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to complete an ecologically coherent network, not only will further designation of sites, in particular MCZs, SACs, SPAs as well as sites in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland territorial waters be required, but there will likely still be gaps which will need to be addressed. For example, to be a truly ecologically coherent network that will protect habitats and species that are rare, threatened or representative of UK biodiversity, it will be important to ensure that examples of all stages of life cycles of mobile and migratory species be encompassed by the network i.e. spawning and nursery grounds, foraging and rafting areas, breeding / pupping / nesting areas. Mobile species have not so far been adequately addressed through the existing initiatives to designate MCZs or in the implementation of the Habitats and Species Directive.
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Natural England and JNCC guidance on the development of an ecologically coherent network reports on an assessment undertaken to assess the potential conservation benefit of MCZs for highly mobile species of conservation importance. The assessment concluded that the current knowledge of the ecology and behaviour of many highly mobile species suggests that site-based protection may be appropriate but that there was no spatial data to support the identification of relevant areas in UK waters. It does however highlight that important foraging, breeding (including nursery and spawning grounds), moulting, wintering and resting areas, should be included in the MPA network.
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The designation of MCZs, MPAs in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and of SACs and SPAs, is not yet complete. However at a future point, before a network can be considered complete, an assessment should be undertaken to ensure that connectivity has been adequately addressed for species that are dependent on a range of habitats or sites during their life cycle. Furthermore, such an assessment should ensure that there is appropriate integration between protected sites at the land / sea interface and between important sites at marine boundaries i.e. across devolved boundaries and at the boundaries with neighbouring States. It is conceivable that a number of ecologically important sites will span such borders, as does the Dogger Bank in the central North Sea. In cases where an important site is identified spanning a border, collaborative effort should be undertaken with the devolved administration or adjacent governments to secure appropriate protection across the whole site.
[normal]4.6
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In order for the network to deliver against international commitments, designation of the sites alone will be insufficient. Sites will need to be managed in a manner appropriate to the individual objectives of each site and in relation to the objectives of the network as a whole. A range of management approaches, including both strict protection and multi-use techniques, is likely to be required to ensure that the network is well-managed and supports the delivery of international commitments as envisaged. This will need to include clear arrangements for effective enforcement of such sites.
[normal]4.7
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is widely recognised that marine policy cannot operate independently of climate change policy, and also that well designed, ecologically coherent networks of MPAs can contribute to efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase the ability of marine ecosystems to adapt to climate change. It will be important that the UK’s ecologically coherent network is developed in a way that it contributes to the delivery of a climate change adaptation strategy and can be responsive to changes including migrating habitats, redistribution of species, rising sea levels, and erosion or accretion of sites.
[normal]4.8
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]To complete an ecologically coherent network of MPAs, further sites still need to be identified. In order for this to happen, it will be essential to improve the evidence base in relation to the identification of MPAs. This will require prioritisation of the work required by the relevant research bodies and the provision of funding to undertake the work.
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Marine ecosystems are very complex, our knowledge of them is limited, and the ways in which our activities affect them is poorly understood. Sustainable management of our seas requires the adoption of an ecosystem-based approach that aims to achieve sustainable exploitation of natural resources by balancing the social and economic needs of human communities with the maintenance of healthy ecosystems. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) sets out such an approach.
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the MSFD (2008/56/EC), EU Member States are required to promote sustainable use of the seas and conserve marine ecosystems, putting in place measures to reach or maintain GES in Europe’s seas by 2020. MSFD is unique in the breadth of its coverage; GES must be achieved across all aspects of the UK’s marine ecosystem and covers all the key pressures and impacts on it, including cumulative impacts. The MSFD states that an ecosystem-based approach should be used to manage human activities and marine resources sustainably. This provides the legal foundation for placing the ecosystem-based approach at the heart of decision-making. Co-ordinated implementation by UK Government and Devolved Administrations of existing European (e.g. the Birds and Habitats Directives) and national legislation (e.g. the Marine &amp; Coastal Access Act (2009), the Marine (Scotland) Act (2010) and the Marine Act (Northern Ireland) 2013) can make an important contribution to achieving GES, as well as fulfilling wider sustainable development objectives.
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The MSFD states that measures to achieve GES should include spatial protection measures contributing to coherent and representative networks of MPAs, adequately covering the diversity of the constituent ecosystems. In addition, the UK Government is required to take into account wider measures which will also be required to deliver GES under each of the 11 MSFD descriptors. When completed, the UK MPA network will be critical for helping move us towards GES targets for biodiversity (descriptor 1), food webs (descriptor 4) and sea-floor integrity (descriptor 6); as well as meeting the MSFDs requirements for spatial protection measures which contribute to a coherent and representative network of MPAs.
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The reformed 
[normal]Common Fisheries Policy[bold] (CFP) states that 
[normal]EU fisheries management will be governed by the ecosystem approach (Article 2) to ensure that the impacts of 
[normal]fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised and to ensure that fisheries activities avoid the degradation of the marine environment. 
[normal]To this end, the reformed CFP promotes coherence with other EU environmental legislation, and specifically with the objective of achieving GES by 2020 as set out in the MSFD. In particular, the reformed CFP has a critical role to play in supporting the achievement of GES for commercial fish stocks (descriptor 3) and wider biodiversity (descriptors 1, 4 and 6), whilst also ensuring consistency across European waters, promoting sustainable fish stocks and fishing practices. Other key tools for meeting new, clearer environmental targets and integrating broader environmental considerations will be through work on co-management schemes and the development of ecosystem-based management plans for sea areas.
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Marine planning[bold] is one of the key tools in applying the ecosystem-based approach to managing human activities and in achieving GES of our seas by providing the framework for decision-making in relation to spatial protection measures. An ecologically coherent network of MPAs will only be effective if integrated within a wider marine spatial planning system that ensures complementarity between the network and a range of spatial designations developed for the management of other marine activities or uses, and delivers the wider management needed to ensure our use of the marine environment is sustainable and eliminate or minimises impacts on the network arising from further afield. Marine planning will also guide licensing decisions, where projects will also be assessed through existing regulations such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations and the Habitats Regulations.
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]At a regional scale, marine planning is a potentially important tool for Member States to support certain aspects of MSFD implementation, including cross-border co-ordination of Marine Strategies, links between the spatial measures of the MSFD and the implementation of other objectives, such as the Birds and Habitats Directives. WWF therefore believes that there is considerable value in the proposed 
[normal]EU Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Management
[normal], provided it applies an ecosystem-based approach to planning and ensures coordinated and coherent planning across administrative boundaries in support of achieving GES by 2020.
[normal]5.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government and Devolved Administrations expect existing policy measures, such as those identified above, to play a major role in helping us achieve GES. However, at this time it is difficult to predict exactly how far existing policies will take us and it is likely that additional management measures will be needed to further improve the state of the marine environment in order to achieve GES. Strong progress in the coming months is needed 
[normal]given the Government’s intention to consult on UK programme of measures for achieving GES in autumn 2014.
[normal]5.8
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The monitoring programmes for GES, which have to be in place by the middle of 2014, will help improve our understanding of marine ecosystems and human impacts on them. The UK Government and Devolved Administrations are currently consulting on their proposals for UK monitoring programmes; WWF will be submitting a response to the consultation. The Directive is also driving decisions about marine research and development spending both within the UK and more widely within Europe. This is welcome, particularly in relation to our understanding of the less well researched aspects of GES.
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The operationalisation of the ecosystem approach, through the MSFD, is dependent upon effective regional governance structures and mechanisms. This is a particular challenge for Europe’s regional seas where different bodies at different governance scales with different constituent interests are all involved, each making, or contributing to, decisions affecting the area. The main disparity in the governance framework arises as a result of differing competencies, often at the same governance level (e.g. in relation to the MSFD and CFP), which constrains a coherent approach to integrated decision-making.
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the Directive each Member State is required to develop a marine strategy for their waters, in coordination with other countries within the same marine region or subregion - in the UK’s case these being the Greater North Sea and the Celtic Seas - to protect and conserve the marine environment, prevent its deterioration, and, where practicable, restore marine ecosystems in areas where they have been adversely affected. This coordination is intended to be achieved through the Regional Seas Conventions, which for the UK is the 
[normal]OSPAR Convention
[normal]. Good progress has been made through OSPAR, which has made MSFD implementation a significant element of its work programme but the co-ordination process is proving particularly challenging due to extremely tight timescales, differing interpretations of the Directive and different national processes and priorities for implementation.
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Working in such an integrated manner to cut through the single-sector focus of traditional marine management arrangements, and to promote the fundamental reform of, or the creation of new, structures and mechanisms that can deliver the change we need, is a new approach for many of us. But this shift in governance is essential if we are serious about our role in achieving sustainable development and securing the long-term health of our seas
[normal].
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Many people look to our seas to make a living or to enjoy their leisure and will have an interest in the changing way in which our seas
[normal] are managed. One of the key initiatives that we believe the UK government should focus on is finding a mechanism to gather the most appropriate marine stakeholders in any one sea area in order to obtain their support for a programme of management that will deliver for key environmental, economic and societal sustainability objectives. It is WWF’s view that only by engaging the stakeholders across the sectors in the development of such measures will there be a high chance of compliance with the resulting programme of work. The work of the Advisory Councils established under the reformed CFP will be important in offering a starting point for the convening of fisheries stakeholders but there is a need to think about how wider participation can be achieved across the different sectors.
[normal]6.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recognising this, the WWF-led 
[normal]PISCES project[bold] (
[normal]http://www.projectpisces.eu/
[normal]) brought together stakeholders from the Celtic Sea to develop a set of guidelines for implementing the MSFD with involvement of stakeholders throughout the process, including management decisions, monitoring and enforcement of measures. Key recommendations from the PISCES guide include the following:
[normal]6.6
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]WWF is well known for its ability to convene and consult with all sectors and local communities, resulting in more effective partnerships and conservation outcomes. Building on the success of the PISCES project, the current WWF-led Celtic Seas Partnership Project (
[normal]http://celticseaspartnership.eu/
[normal]) is bringing together stakeholders from across the Celtic Seas MSFD sub-region (including UK, Ireland and France). The project is working with a wide range of marine stakeholders, governments and the scientific community to develop and demonstrate a series of transboundary and cross-sectoral approaches and tools to support the implementation of the MSFD. The project is overseen by an Observer Board, comprising representatives from the governments of the Celtic Seas countries and OSPAR, and Expert Advisory Group comprising technical experts.
[normal]6.7
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The next step for the project is to evaluate the draft measures developed through stakeholder workshops to identify those measures which have the potential to be further developed in order to add value to the process of MSFD implementation in the Celtic Seas. Viable draft measures which receive the support of stakeholders and the project’s advisory groups will be developed further during the project’s national workshops in each of the six project countries. This provides stakeholders with a platform to influence the forthcoming programme of measures, due to be developed by the end of 2015. These national workshops will also allow for more detailed discussion of the regional complexities of MSFD implementation and its implications for national or devolved statutory governance mechanisms. They are also intended as a means of capturing the views, ambitions and concerns of regional sectors and distilling the key issues ahead of the next multi-national event of the Celtic Seas Partnership to be held in France in 2015.
[normal]6.8
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is strong government support for the project and WWF looks forward to working with the UK Government, devolved administrations and stakeholders in taking forward this important initiative that will pave the way for the new shift in governance needed to deliver better management of our seas.
