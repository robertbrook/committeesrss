defaultWritten evidence from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) (HCS0015)
defaultThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) welcome the opportunity to submit 
defaultour views as part of TRANSCOM’s inquiry into the Government’s maritime policy
default strategy
default.
defaultThe RMT 
defaultorganises
default 
defaultaround 7
default,000 
defaultoffshore workers, including
default d
defaultrilling, engineering/maintenance, diver, 
defaultand catering grades
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaultall of these workers 
defaultrequire helicopter 
defaulttransport to and from installations on the UK Continental Shelf
default a
defaultt the start and end of their 2 or 3
default week long tours
default.
defaultKey Pointsdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1.1 
default              
defaultThe offshore unions, RMT, Nautilus, Unite, Balpa and GMB are
default calling 
defaultfor 
defaulta public inquiry into 
defaultthe safety
default off
default 
defaulthelicop
defaultter transport
default in the
default offshore
default industry
default which would cover
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 1980 there have been nine fatal accidents involving helicopters operati
defaultng in the offshore oil and gas industry, claiming the lives of 114 offshore workers and helicopter crew. There were 44 reportable non-fatal helicopter incidents in the offshore sector over this period.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 25 years since the Piper Alpha disaster in the 
defaultNorth Sea and 23 years since the publication of the Cullen Report which was a watershed moment for operational 
defaultsafety
default in the offshore oil and gas industry. 
defaultKey amongst Cullen’s 106
default recommendations (all of which were accepted by the Government of the day an
defaultd industry) 
defaultwas to institute a safety culture of ‘continuous improvement’ in the offshore industry. 
defaultWe believe that this culture of continuous improvement is critical to improving the safety record of offshore helicopter operations. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe cost of such an 
defaultinquiry would not be prohibitive, given the scale of the industry’s annual contribution to
default national tax revenue (
default£10.6 billion in 2011-12
default). 
defaultFor example,
default the House of Commons Library recently estimated that the 
defaultfull 
defaultcost of the Cullen Inquiry in today’s pr
defaultices would be £5.7m
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the wake of the Clutha bar tragedy in Glasgow
default on 29
defaultth
default November this year
default, RMT also accept that there is a serious case for a full public inquiry into all aspects of helicopter transport
default 
defaultcovering operations 
defaultbeyond the offshore 
defaultsector
default, including
default police, air ambulan
defaultce and air-sea rescue
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is notable that the
default model of helicopter, EC
default 135, involved in the 
defaultClutha Vaults incident is a Eurocopter
default manufactured machine
default. The models of helicopter that transport the vast majority of offsh
defaultore workers, the EC225 Super Puma and AS332 L, L1 and L2 are all Eurocopter models.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultfive incidents, two of them fatal, involving helicopters in the North Sea since February 2009 should press th
defaulte Government into concerted and effective action to improve the 
defaultsafety record of helicopter 
defaultoperators
default and their operations
default in the UK Continental Shelf. Yet the current approach is purely reactive, in terms of the Air Accident Investigation Branch and Civil
default Aviation Authority reports, as demonstrated in response to the fatal accident involving a Eurocopter AS332 L2 on 23
defaultrd
default August this year which claimed the lives of four offshore workers. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRMT
default is concerned at the variation i
defaultn practice that exists amongst he
defaultlicopter companies operating in the North Sea
default and the potential consequences of this in terms of the safety of offshore oil and gas workers
default. For example, Bristow Helicopters operate to a "gold standard"
default,
default essentially the set of standards applied in the Norwegian sector 
defaultwhich are widely acknowledged
default as more robust than those in place for the UK sector. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf
default the “gold standard” in inspection, 
defaultoperating procedures, 
defaulttraining and maintenance in operation at Bri
defaultstow and in the Norwegian sector had been in place in the UK sector,
default 
defaultwe believe that 
defaultfour 
defaultout 
defaultof the five incidents 
defaultsince February 2009 
defaultpotentially could 
defaulthave been avoided
default, including the fatal incidents on 1
defaultst
default April 2009 and 23
defaultrd
default August 2013 which claimed 
defaulta total of 20 lives
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVariations between minimum and “gold” standards amongst offshore helicopter operators are a source of concern in the specific area
defaults
default of pilot training
default and operating procedures
default. Bond and CHC, for example, only train their pilots to the
default minimum standard and industry sources tell RMT that this is because the companies are under no statutory obligation to achieve higher standards in this and other
default areas, so this extra cost is avoided. In our view, Norwegian standards should be adopted acro
defaultss the industry and this standardisation should be set in law.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHistorically, helicopter transport in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was not as safe as that provided for their offshore colleagues in the UK. Between 1966 and 1989 the fatality rate wa
defaults 4.1 for the Norwegian sector and 3.7 for the UK sector per million person flight hours. This difference continued over the 1990s with a fatality rate of
default 
default1.6 in the UK compared to 2.3 in the Norwegian sector between 1990 and 1998. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the decade between 
default1999 and 2009, however, there were no fatal accidents in the Norwegian sector (a nil rate) whilst the UK’s fatality rate shot up to 5.6 – a deeply worrying reversal of the historic, downward trend across the North Sea. Furthermore, 11 out of the 12 helicop
defaultter accidents in the North Sea between 2001 and 2009 were in the UK sector.
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Norwegian sector has a different inspection regime and different regulations applying to helicopters and helicopter flights in the North Sea. All of these have been introduced over the last 12 years or so and explain the marked improvement in the safet
defaulty record. 
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRMT welcome the C
defaultivil 
defaultA
defaultviation 
defaultA
defaultuthority
default’s announcement on 24
defaultth
default September 
defaultof the review of helicopter operations in the North Sea. We note that t
defaulthis will involve work with the h
defaultead of helicopter operations at the Norwegian CAA
default (as well as officials from the European Aviation Safety Agency)
default, comparing the record of helicopter operations in the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. 
defaultWe await with interest
default the publication of the CAA’s recommendations in early 2014.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default 
defaultRMT also s
defaultupport the introduction of a system of guaranteed access to seats for trade union officials on helicopters travelling to and from offshore installations. Not only would this 
defaultremove a significant barrier to improving 
defaultthe
default health and safety culture offshore, 
defaultit would also provide offshore workers with greater awareness of their workplace rights, as well as benefiting the performance of helicopter operations in the North Sea which is in the interests of all concerned.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default 
defaultFollowing the fatal incident on 23
defaultrd
default Augu
defaultst, the RMT met with industry representatives to discuss a number of issues, including regular trade union access to offshore workers at heliports and on installations
default with some positive progress being made
default. S
defaultome 
defaultsubsequent progress has been made in terms
default of 
defaultaccess to the workforce at 
defaultbut
default progress on trade union access to offshore workers in their place of work (i.e. on installations in the North Sea) has slowed. RMT support amendment to the existing law, if necessary, to ensure that 
defaultoffshore workers have 
defaultregular access to their trade union representatives when they are working on installations
default which can be
default for period
defaults
default of up to three weeks at a time
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe role and effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) 
defaultis at risk 
defaultfrom two recent developments. Firstly, we believe that proposals
default to extend the regulatory remit of the 
defaultE
defaulturopean 
defaultA
defaultviation 
defaultS
defaultafety 
defaultA
defaultgency (EASA)
default 
defaultto cover helicopter operations in the UK continental shelf will dangerously undermine the responsiveness and loca
defaultl knowledge of the UK offshore sector that the CAA has built up over a number of years
default. 
defaultRMT argue that member states with extensive helicopter operations central to the transport of workers in an industry should retain the powers to regulate that sector. 
default&#xa0;default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecondly, the Coalition Government’s decision to
default 
defaultcut
default 120 posts 
defaultat the CAA is a serious threat to effective enforcement of the regulatory framework and, therefore, increases the risk to offshore workers obliged to use helicopter transport because transport
default by sea takes too long. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is not to say, however, that there are no complaints about or concerns over the CAA’s regulatory performance. For example, the CAA’s response to the fatal incident off the coast of Shetland on 23
defaultrd
default August was not widely regar
defaultded as sufficiently strong to prevent a further decline in confidence of offshore workers in this mode of transport or the Super Puma models.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also worrying that the CAA 
defaulthave only limited powers of enforcement on 
defaulthelicopters
default operating within the UK, 
defaultbut registered elsewhere.
default Clarity needs to be established in this area and we would prefer those regulatory standards to be brought up to a high level, rather than down to a lower level which is a potential consequence of EASA’s regulatory power grab.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultour view, the Government should take its cue from the H
defaultelicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG)
default on which the offshore trade unions, Health and Safety Executive, 
defaultCAA, 
defaultoil and gas industry representatives and helicopter operators sit, before taking any decisio
defaultns that affect the regulations applying to helicopter operators in the offshore sector.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, in order to regain the confidence of the offshore workforce in helicopter transport, any decisions that the Government makes on the future regulatory fram
defaultework applied to offshore helicopter operations should be consulted on with workers and their trade union representatives,
default at the very least.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1 
default              
defaultWe are also concerned at the reliability of the Department for Transport’s 
defaultstatistics on the offshore helicopter fleet, including the range of helicopter models used to transport offshore
default workers. Our concern has been 
defaultcaused by a recent written answer
default to a question from Grahame Morris MP requesting information on the composition
default of the offshore helicopter fleet. I
defaultncredibly, the Super Puma EC225 and
default AS332 L1
default 
defaultmodels were not included in the Government’s answer.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultSuper Puma models AS332 L, L1, L2 and EC225 account for 60% of the helicopter fleet currently transporting the vast m
defaultajority of the 30,000 strong workforce employed in the UK offshore oil and gas industry. That is 45 out of a fleet of 75
default which has clocked up millions of flight hours and passengers 
defaultover the last ten years alone
default. 
defaultT
defaultrade unions on the H
defaultelicopter Safety 
defaultS
defaultteer
defaulting 
defaultG
defaultroup
default agreed with the operators’ decision to ground Super Puma models following 
defaultthe fatal incident on 23
defaultrd
default August 2013.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultThe EC225 model was taken out of service following two non-fatal emergency ditchings in the North Sea in May and October 2012. 
defaultIt had only been returned to service in the offshore sector a matter of weeks before the fatal accident on 23
defaultrd
default August 2013 involving a Super Puma AS332 L2.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultTwo events prior to the 23
defaultrd
default August incident are 
defaultvital to consider in the context of offshore
default 
defaultworkers’ 
defaultconfidence in the safety of helicopter transport in the North Sea. Firstly, a survey of 1,600 offshore workers in May 2013 by the Step Change in Safety body, a coalition of the safety regulator HSE, the 5 trade unions and the oil and gas industry,
default found that nearly 9 in 10 (86%) of offshore workers did not trust the EC225 model. It was clear from this that trust in helicopter transport in general had declined significantly amongst the offshore workforce, before the fatal accident on 23
defaultrd
default August. As
default the Step Change in Safety official Les Linklater commented in industry press coverage of the May survey’s finding: “
defaultWe cannot think of this as an EC225 issue...The EC225 will come back and will be safe to fly again, but there are other airframes out there
default and there are confidence issues.”
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultSecondly, the reported comments
default of a helicopter company (CHC) employee in response to an offshore worker’s concern over the safety of the EC225s has served to anger offshore workers and highlight a culture of macho bullying that exists with the tacit acceptance of the employers. Again t
defaulthis episode occurred before the accident on 23
defaultrd
default August, but also serves to highlight the problems over confidence in helicopter transportation that are ingrained in the workforce in the offshore sector.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultIt should also be noted that the “Boots On” cam
defaultpaign to reassure and support offshore workers was agreed and launched by
default members of
default the HSSG, in response to the 
defaultfurther concern over 
defaulthelicopter safety raised by the fatal incident on 23
defaultrd
default August. RMT believe that this unified approach is the most effecti
defaultve way of improving the health and safety of all offshore workers, on installations and on the helicopters used to transfer them to and from the workplace.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1 
defaultThe RMT supports Patricia Ferguson MSP’s 
defaultInquiries into Deaths (Scotland) B
defaultill 
defaultand would urge 
defaultTranscom to consider
default apply
defaulting
default pressure on the Scottish Government, via the Scotland Office, HSE and CAA to support this Bill which contains much needed reform to the fatal accident inquiry process in Scotland that attends such tragic acc
defaultidents. 
defaultThe consultation on the Bill is open to responses until 31
defaultst
default January 2014
default. 
defaultWhilst all effort must be expended in protecting the lives and well being of offshore workers in the North Sea, they must also be assured that access to justice will be swi
defaultft, straightforward and effective should 
defaultthe worst case scenario be realised
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.2 To further illustrate the need for reform in this area, we point to 
defaultthe 
defaultunacceptable 
defaultexperiences of the families of the 14 offshore workers and 2
default air
default crew who died on 1
defaultst
default April 2009 in an incident north east of Peterhead involving a Super Puma AS332 L2, the same helicopter model involved in the 23
defaultrd
default August 
defaultincident. The families of those who died in April 2009 are still waiting for the Procurator Fiscal to open the Fatal A
defaultccident Inquiry into this tragic episode. Whilst that inquiry will finally commence on 6
defaultth
default January 2014, a preliminary hearing 
defaultin November
default was cancelled at the last minute, leaving the bereaved relatives who had travelled to Aberdeen from all over the UK s
defaulteverely inconvenienced and again asking why such a significant inquiry into the death of their loved ones should be subject to constant delay and its terms of reference, powers and scope, so severely 
defaultrestricte
defaultd.
