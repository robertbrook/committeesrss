"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Joseph Whelan, Head of Passenger Transport Services, Cambridgeshire County Council (TIC 069)&#xa0;&#xa0;1.              Introduction&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCambridgeshire is a diverse county, consisting of large rural areas, market towns and the city of \nCambridge\n.\n The issues facing rural areas vary considerably across the county. In Fenland, in the north of the county, the key concerns are linked to an ageing\n population, deprivation, educational attainment and health inequalities, while in rural areas to the south of the county the overriding issue is the availability of transport to access services. Improving transport has an important role to play in reducin\ng social exclusion, improving accessibility and helping people to live independent lives, but the location of services and choices as to how they are provided often have significant transport impacts. \nDifferent groups in the county face a variety of transp\nort problems, for example children and young people often rely on parents to provide transport where public transport opportunities do not exist\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn 30\nth\n January \n2012 \nthe County Council \nCabinet \ncommitted to a three year phased programme of \nremoving (in two\n steps) \nthe £2.7 million used to subsidise bus services. \nIn its place it committed £1.5M of targeted investment \nto \nbe spent \nproviding transport solutions that\n better reflect the needs of\n local areas\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis investment in local transport solution and is part\n of a wider Programme of work being delivered under the Cambridgeshire Future Transport Programme. The CFT Programme\n is focusing on:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nstrengthen\ning\n the connections between transport solutions and community outcomes,\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nenabl\ning \nthe pooling of resources across\n boundaries\n where applicable\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nproviding\n a strategic framework to bring partners together\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nstimulat\ning\n opportunities to create new community joint ventures to operate as local \ndelivery\n bodies\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nengag\ning \nmore widely with other services to explore the potential to innovate and improve service accessibility in \norder to \n&#xa0;\nprovide transport solutions that better meet communities’ needs \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012 Cambridgeshire\n Co\nunty \nC\nouncil\n embarked on \nthis ambitious programm\ne to\n increase and improve \naccessibility\n. A key part of the CFT Programme is a comprehensive review of the transport needs of communities and how the previous bus subsidies are being spent. Value for money and cost (in £) per subsidised bus journey are crit\nical dimensions of this review. \nThe methodology of this approach, how the \nneeds of different groups/sections of the commun\nity together with the challenge\ns faced are all described in further detail below. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the local transport solutions work, the County\n has been divided up into 13 areas or tranches. The engagement work described below has been undertaken (fully) in Areas A to D and is being launched in \nOctober \n2013 in Area E F and G.  \n&#xa0;\n2.               Identification of Demand for Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nkey feature of the approach to developing new local transport solutions \nusing input and information gained through engagement\n rather than consultation. Progr\ness to date has implemented new \nsolutions that have been co-produced with local co\nmmunities. The approach of subsidising bus services on the bas\nis o\nf existing passengers has been replaced\n with \nencouraging community involvement throughout the process and broadening the reach to include potential passengers, as well as existing\n. The resul\nt has \ntransport \nthat is more (commercially) \nsustainable and appropriate.  \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDecisions \nare being \nmade on an area by area basis\n about the \nlevel \nand type \nof engagement that is most appropriate for that community.  \nLocal engagement plans \nare in place and have \nbeen contributed to by \nlocal members and the \nlocal \nparish council\n. \nThis local engagement \nis \nreflect\ning \nthe diversity of communities within Cambridgeshire \nwhilst \nrecognisin\ng and responding to differences.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scope of what is part of the engagement (and what is not) is \nset out \nbelow\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn scope\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOut of scope\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEngagement Outputs &amp; Outcomes\n&#xa0;2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nEngagement Outputs\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngagement Outcomes (primary)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngagement Outcomes (Secondary)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n              \nEngagement Process\n&#xa0;\nThe \nengagement process provid\nes \nstructure whilst enabling flexibility to adapt to the needs to the local area.\n The following \noutlines \nthe basic process \nfrom which \ndifferent engagement techniques can be \nemployed at a local/community level dep\nending on the \narea\n.\n&#xa0;Stage 1 –\nMeet with local District\n and \nCounty \nCouncil \nmembers and Parish \nC\nouncils to agree a community engagement plan and to answer questions on the CFT process.\n&#xa0;Stage 2 – Begin the \nq\nuantitative data collection of current travel patterns and bus usage a\ns well as collating any existing transport data within the area.  \n&#xa0;Stage 3 – Set up initial meetings\n with identified community groups\n. Th\nese\n meeting\ns\n will have a number of purposes. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Stage 4 –\n W\norking groups to put together options\n \n&#xa0;Stage 5 –\n \nCarry out evidence gathering to fill any gaps in data and knowledge. \n&#xa0;Stage 6 – \nFeedback options to the parish councils and local communities for comment, amendments\n.\n&#xa0;              Stage 7 – \nFinalise design of solution\n&#xa0;Stage 8 – Take it back to the wider community for approval – This \nis \nvia\n members, the parish councils and community events.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.0              Taking into Account Groups of Passenger with Different Needs&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe approach described above is well defined and has good structure and clear and intended outcomes. However in the absence of active and positive participation \nf\nr\no\nm local communitie\ns \nthe approach will not yield results \nor\n \nlead to \nthe implementation of solutions that reflect local needs. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nA\n comprehensive stakeholder analysis and mapping exercise has identified six main groups that will be key to community engagement for this project.  Local engagement plans will provide more detail on an area basis and explore the mechanisms that can be used\n to engage with each of these groups and their sub-sections.\n&#xa0;\nCommunities\n&#xa0;3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is not a one size fits all approach to community engagement\n. \n \nW\nithin Cambridgeshire there is considerable diversity between each local community that will determine the most appropriate approach to engagement.  When working with communities it \nis \nrecognised that there may already be groups and networks of active peopl\ne that could play an important role on the engagement process. In addition to this consideration will also be given to the two main forms of engagement;\n&#xa0;3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunities of place – \nformed from\n residents who live in an area where services are being reviewed.  T\nhere are two key audiences within this group. Those who currently use buses and those who \nhave the potential\n \nto\n use services\n in the future\n. The success of the project will depend on engaging with these two groups.\n&#xa0;3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunities of interest – \nformed from tho\nse with a shared interest in the provision of transport in an area. \nThere\n \ncommunities \nmay be made up from interest groups such as\n ‘Save our buses’ part of the campaign for better transport or ‘Towards Sustainability’, they could also be businesses within t\nhe area.\n \n&#xa0;Members\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of member buy-in is \na \nkey risk. The withdrawal of bus subsidy is a contentious issue\n. \nThe engagement process needs to move on quickly from these discussions to allow all stakeholders to engage positively in the development of alter\nnative solutions. We intend to mitigate this key risk by working closely with both District and County members drawing on their invaluable experience of the local area to help us fully understand local n\need, to work with CCC to organis\ne engagement events a\nnd for members to be involved in the design of any new transport solutions.\n&#xa0;\nParish Councils\n&#xa0;3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough parish council’s have a wide range of powers there are few statutory duties placed upon them.  Parish plans may already have \nconsidered transport need\n for a village and identified actions. These are a valuable source of information. The knowledge and experience of a parish council will enable the formation of working groups and ensure the most difficult to reach are included in the process.  The parish \ncouncil will also have access to those who are active in the community and can help to communicate the aims of the project.\n&#xa0;3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential assistance and support that a parish council can provide to the project should not be underestimated.  Parish councils should be involved from the outset of the project moving into an area. \n&#xa0;3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere the engagement has been at its best, there have been local champions who are driving the process forwards. In some areas the local champions have been local politicians form the county, district or parish council \n&#xa0;Partners\n&#xa0;3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n number of partners \nhave\n been identified that will become involved over the course of the project. T\nhis will include organisations that currently commission transport such as PCT (GP Clusters) or are involved in transport issues such as ACRE\n (Action for Communities in Rural Engla\nnd)\n. \n L\nocal employers, schools and the \nfurther education \nsector\n will also be approached to become involved in the process\n.  The stakeholder management plan identifies how we plan to work with these organi\ns\nations.\n&#xa0;3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nambridgeshire \nC\nounty Council a\nlready has \nstrong links with District Councils and they have been involved in \nCambridgeshire Future Transport Programme\n from its inception\n. T\nhis partnership working \nis continuing\n.\n&#xa0;3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport providers including \nCommunity Transport Schemes, Car Scheme, Commercial oper\nators, Taxi firms, Entrepreneurs and Communities or parishes which provide their own transport\n also form part of this group\n. \n&#xa0;\nInterest Groups\n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a wide range of groups who represent residents with an interest in passenger transport. Broadly these a\nre;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInternal\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInternal stakeholders can be split into four distinct groups\n;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nA key \nelement of CFT is\n \nencouraging\n local communities and service providers including partners to become more involved in the proc\ness of designing and delivering transport, developing a culture of co-production. \nThis moves away \nfrom \nthe historic approach whereby subsidised services have been designed based on previous or existing provision.\n \nThe first step is \nwork\ning\n with local communities to \nasses\n the transport need in their local area to then work with transport providers and the local authority to design transport solutions that best reflect the identified need.\n \nBy encouraging community involvement throughout the p\nrocess and broadening the reach to include potential passengers, as well as existing, the resulting transport will be more sustainable and appropriate.  \n&#xa0;4.0              Main Challenges to Better Services in Isolated Areas&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the CFT programme the main challenges t\no date have been\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe challenges noted above have been successfully met o\nn a local basis and are described further in the section below.\n&#xa0;\n5.0              Successes to Date&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Area \nB\n (\nWhittle\ns\nford\n to \nCambridge\n city corridor) there is a brand new bus service in place that has been designed by the working group and funded by the County Council. It has been in operation since March 2013 and is \nvery successful. It links a number of villages to key public services (\nsuch as the health centre in \nSawston\n) and also provides a \nlink\n to the \nBabraham\n \nRoad\n \nPark\n and Ride site for journeys onwards to \nCambridge\n. There is also an interchange opportunity at \nSawston\n to the Stagecoach service into \nCambridge\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Area A, a new servi\nce will be launched in October – following a vote undertaken in the local communities involved as to what their preferred solution is from the two available.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
