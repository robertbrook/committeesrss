EIS 13
[normal]Written evidence submitted by Mining On Top[bold]What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? [bold]Summary[bold] of main points[bold]:[bold]About me and my submission:[bold]I make this submission on behalf of Mining On
[normal] Top; the conference and training division of IntierraRMG. IntierraRMG are the leading data supplier to the global mining industry with offices in Australia, across Canada, in Sweden and London. Mining On Top was launched in January 2013 in order to consol
[normal]idate the company’s events and trainings under a single brand. I am the leader of the Mining On Top business.
[normal] This submission will focus largely on the contribution of the 
[normal]metals and minerals 
[normal]exploration and mining industry to the UK economy.
[normal]I have a BA i
[normal]n Social Ethics and worked in Financial Services for many years before stumbling int
[normal]o the mining industry in January 2010. I have organised more than 30 mining focused conferences
[normal], seminars
[normal] and trainings in the UK, Europe and Africa. 
[normal]The reason for the Mi
[normal]ning On Top submission of evidence is that we 
[normal]passionately 
[normal]believe that mining is an essential enabler of social and economic development in developing nations where the mineral endowment is often 
[normal]rich and underexploited
[normal]. The UK industry must be strong and
[normal] transparent in order to be at the forefront of the facilitation of this development
[normal] and to ensure the supply of the resources critical 
[normal]to the UK population and business
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations:[bold]Answers:[bold]1.[bold]How does the UK based extractive[bold] industries support employment A) in the UK and B[bold]) for UK citizens overseas?[bold]There are four types of structures that make a 
[normal]contribution
[normal] to the UK economy from extractives. They are:- 
[normal]From the first two categories the contribution to the UK economy is not that high (although in the past the mining industry in the UK 
[normal]contributed significantly, 
[normal]th
[normal]e contribution of North Sea oil and gas has been substantial and shale gas is set to make a substantial contribution 
[normal]to the economy 
[normal]in the future).
[normal]Today, the biggest economic contribution comes from the third and fourth categories. It is no coincidence th
[normal]at global companies like BHP Billiton and Anglo American have decided to list and headquarter in London; London provides the best access to capital markets, investment, expertise and extractive support services of anywhere in the world. Other extractives c
[normal]entres (such as Perth, Vancouver, Calgary, Nordics, Houston and Johannesburg) do not come close to the depth and history and experience, built up over many centuries, which is found in the UK. 
[normal]UK engineering expertise is regarded as some of the most relia
[normal]ble on the planet and an essential component of any successful mining project. 
[normal]This expertise is utilised by UK and international companies. Every day Canadian and Australian mining companies are in London to secure expertise, finance and services. 
[normal]The UK
[normal] has historically been home to some of the world’s most respected mining engineering and geological colleges with Imperial College, Royal School of Mines, Cardiff and Cambourne.
[normal]A.
[normal]The UK based extractives industry supports employment in the UK in many indu
[normal]stries. Clearly in varied roles working within UK based mining companies, but also within financial services – 
[normal]metals traders, 
[normal]analysts, brokers, investment bankers, asset and wealth managers, stock brokers, fund managers and in private equity and venture 
[normal]capital. Insurance, 
[normal]law and accounting 
[normal]are other
[normal] large area
[normal]s
[normal] of employment. 
[normal]Other services such as 
[normal]recruitment, 
[normal]PR/ IR 
[normal]geological, engineering, risk and environmental consultancy
[normal] are also represented. Data, publications, investor presentations, conferences and training are another 
[normal]are where the UK leads
[normal]. 
[normal]Finally, but not exclusively, engineering, equipment and infrastructure and building services also contribute to the industry. 
[normal]These include 
[normal]building, 
[normal]explosives, piping, drills, water management, power generators, steel products and a large variety of other products and services.
[normal]I am not sure of the total universe 
[normal]of UK people involved in the industry 
[normal]but I do know that there ar
[normal]e over one thousand Women in Mining members in the UK and women are not highly represented in the industry.
[normal]B.There are a high number of UK citizens working abroad in the mining industry and many have migrated to mining boom areas, such as Western Australi
[normal]a, Africa and South America to fill skills shortages in those regions and to supply expertise in the form of consultancy and services.
[normal]Unsubstantiated estimates 
[normal]claim 
[normal]that the contribution to the UK economy of the wider mining and support industry is 
[normal]over 
[normal]twenty percent. 
[normal]2.Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries i.e. In sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?[bold]UK industry benefits more widely
[normal] from its position as a 
[normal]centre of excellence for extractives in economic terms (as discussed above) but also from innovations which are generated by the need to solve complex engineering issues in mining projects.
[normal] These innovations feed into the general engineering offering in the UK.
[normal]Mining projects are complex engineering initiatives. Bulk commodities – coal and iron ore -are really transportation projects; bauxite is a power story and much processing has a heavy reliance on chemical and water and waste treatment. For this reason 
[normal]engi
[normal]neering consultancy 
[normal]companies such as Mott MacDonald have recently established a mining division to capitalise on these opportunities.
[normal]If you attend a large mining conference, such as the Prospectors and Developers Association Conference or Mining Indaba y
[normal]ou will see many familiar UK engineering and equipment companies represented
[normal] who are looking to earn additional clients in the mining sector
[normal].
[normal]Another important point to make is that the jobs created by the mining industry are not just London centric. Consu
[normal]ltant Weir is based in Todmorden
[normal] with a head office in Glasgow
[normal], SRK in Cardiff, ERM in Cambridge etc.
[normal]3.Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitiv[bold]e position in this sector?[bold]The boom in London listed extractive companies with businesses overseas has occurred due to the predominant position of the UK as the hub of the global mining industry and has reinforced that position. The Toronto Stock Exchange 
[normal]has more listed mining companies than the UK 
[normal]at 1638 compared with 179, 
[normal]but their average size
[normal] in terms of
[normal] market capitalisation and share price tends to be smaller
[normal] (£1129m cf $170m)
[normal]. No other exchanges come close.
[normal]4.What are the corporate governance conce[bold]rns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?[bold]Some recent, high profile cases of alledged corporate governance irre
[normal]gularities by London listed foreign extractive companies have caused co
[normal]ncern but should not provoke 
[normal]over
[normal]-
[normal] reaction.
[normal] There are parallels with recent issues in the banking sector but no one believes that the UK’s position as the leading financial centre in t
[normal]he world be scaled-back but rather that better governance is introduced to ensure that this position is protected and proper due-diligence procedures are followed.
[normal]Similarly with mining
[normal],
[normal] sufficient and auditable but light-touch corporate governance legislation is essential. In the past Canada suffered a similar high profile extractives corporate governance scandal 
[normal]in the 1990’s 
[normal](Br
[normal]e-X
[normal]) but has survived as a recognised centre of mining.
[normal]5.[bold]Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?[bold]In the past the extractive sector in general has been too closed. This is prob
[normal]ably due to a lack of understanding of the importance of engaging with civil society and a lack of knowledge of how to engage. This has led to mistrust and a lack of awareness in wider society of the centrality of minerals and metals to everyday life. 
[normal] Con
[normal]sequently, 
[normal]mining companies 
[normal]were 
[normal]even more reticent 
[normal]to put their heads above the parapet 
[normal]and 
[normal]it 
[normal]has enabled NGOs to set the agenda and perceptions of the industry.
[normal]This situation is beginning to change among the more forwa
[normal]rd thinking mining companies 
[normal]as ga
[normal]ining social license to operate becomes more important a
[normal]nd
[normal] civil society becomes increasingly powerful. At the same time it sometimes appears that there is 
[normal]unwillingness
[normal] amongst NGOs to engage with the mining industry and listen to an alternative viewpoint
[normal].
[normal]The recent Mining On Top: Africa – London Summit in June had African Mining Ministers, UK MPs, miners, and industry suppliers around one table with NGOs debating 
[normal]sustainability and how
[normal] mining 
[normal]can be used to foster
[normal] social and economic development of the c
[normal]ontinent.
[normal] The event was one of the first to have all stakeholders around the same table to discuss these 
[normal]issues and all the participants were amazed to discover how much common ground they had once they actually listened to each other.
[normal]Participants 
[normal]included the London companies Anglo American and
[normal] First Quantum Minerals Limited and
[normal] Canadian companies with UK board members, shareholders and management Banro Resources, and Montero Mining. They were joined by NGOs including 
[normal]PWYP, WWF, 
[normal]Africare, Internati
[normal]onal Alert
[normal] (
[normal]Global Witness dropped out days before the event
[normal])
[normal]. Ministers from six African countries including Ghana, Rwanda and South Sudan attended alongside James Duddridge and Eric Joyce
[normal] MP
[normal]. Other organisations participating included U
[normal]nited Nations Econ
[normal]omic Council for Africa
[normal], EITI,
[normal] 
[normal]International Council on Metals and Mining
[normal], 
[normal]The International Institute for the Environment and Development
[normal] and UKTI.
[normal]In 2014 the event will also feature a focus on the development of regional infrastructure, precipitated by 
[normal]the need to support mining projects but, that also support community and agribusiness development in those areas. 
[normal]Anglo American is a leader in sustainability and a good example of best practice
[normal] among mining companies
[normal]. The International Council on Metals 
[normal]and Mining, an organisation sponsored by large mining companies, also sets many of the standards that the industry adheres to. The International Institute for the Environment and Development is a think-tank that leads much of the thinking around sustainabi
[normal]lity issues.
[normal]6.Does the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas? [bold]A lack of support for the industry, combined with lower 
[normal]commodity prices and the reduced ability to attract investment in the current global economic climate means that the UK industry skills base is diminishing. The numbers of geology and mining engineering students is reducing and those that do train often mi
[normal]grate to other mining jurisdictions where the industry is better supported, salaries are higher and jobs more plentiful – Western Australia, Canada and the Nordic regions.
[normal]7.What is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?[bold]The signing o
[normal]f the EITI by Cameron’s government in June has been very positive for the UK extractive industries.
[normal] The signing puts the UK in the position of being a leader in accountability and transparency in the industry and helps to counteract any negative perception
[normal]s that may have been generated by the corporate governance issues previously mentioned; and hopefully goes some way to ensuring that they will never be repeated.
[normal]In t
[normal]he Nordic countries, often regarded as the leaders in ethical areas
[normal], Finland, Denmark and 
[normal]Sweden
[normal] have made 
[normal]announcements
[normal] in September
[normal] that the UK’s stance on transparency has inspired them 
[normal]to
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“quickly transpose the EU Accounting and Transparency Directive”
[normal],
[normal] indicating that this is an area where the UK is seen to be setting the bar.
[normal]At the Mining On Top: Africa – London Summit, which was purposely timed to occur the week following the EITI signing at the G8 meeting, the African Mining Ministers were also 
[normal]inspired by the UK’s lead, with Kenya declaring a commitment to sign up to the in
[normal]itiative also.
[normal]8.Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?[bold]Although increased regulation would
[normal], I am certain, be opposed by some parts of the industry, other
[normal] part
[normal]s would welcome it as they are entirely committed to improving the global reputation of the
[normal] mining
[normal] industry. The fact that we are questioning the impact on 
[normal]reputation of 
[normal]corporate governan
[normal]ce
[normal] lapses
[normal] indicates that the UK has a reputation 
[normal]worth preserving. C
[normal]ompanies 
[normal]who have nothing to hide 
[normal]are 
[normal]not put-off by increased regulation so long as it does not add too much expense and is not too onerous.
[normal]Differing
[normal] levels of regulation 
[normal]for different 
[normal]organisations might be
[normal] an effective approach. More complex and rigorous 
[normal]regulation is required 
[normal]for the larger more complex
[normal] 
[normal]organisations with more resources and 
[normal]simpler and 
[normal]less time consuming for the smaller
[normal],
[normal] less complex
[normal],
[normal] cash strapped juniors.
[normal]9.What is[bold] the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]The competitive landscape for extractives in the 21
[normal]st
[normal] century is complex. The demand story 
[normal]maintain
[normal]s as developi
[normal]ng nations continue urbanisation and the growing middle classes demand more, smaller, lighter technology and the developed world looks for greener alternatives. At the same time supply is increasingly controlled by less politically stable countries.
[normal]Produc
[normal]tion costs increase, metal prices fluctuate, shareholders 
[normal]and governments 
[normal]demand higher returns 
[normal]from the industry 
[normal]and companies concentrate on cost reduction. The large projects are being abandoned by the majors, the junior explorers are struggling to rais
[normal]e cash for their activities and consolidation is occurring as the majority of companies have less than one year’s cash remaining
[normal] (IntierraRMG)
[normal].
[normal]All these factors point to future undersupply and 
[normal]increased competition for resources. Whilst the boom days of c
[normal]ommodities may be over, returns are still significant and, as previously noted the industry delivers returns f
[normal]ar beyond the immediate mining companies
[normal].  
[normal]The UK must ensure a place at the centre of the industry in order to secure metal supplies and to 
[normal]protect the income and jobs that contribute so significantly to the UK economy.
