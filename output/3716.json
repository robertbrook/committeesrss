"BRC25\n&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Peter SmithI am writing this letter as an individual who has been a qualified Electrician for over 30 years, with experience of working in Domestic, Commercial and Industrial sites all over the UK, carrying out installation and \nmaintenance contracts.\nI am qualified to the latest standard for BS7671 i.e. the 17\nth\n edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations, and hold the City and Guilds 2391 qualification for Electrical test\ning\n and Inspection.\nMy concerns about Part P are as follows.\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTh\ne whole\n competitive\n \nframework for registering companies, such as Napit and Elecsa, offers no benefits to the consumer from a safety aspect, whi\nch is what the regulation is supposedly\n about.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fact that thousands of qualified Electricians, like myself, ar\ne not considered competent to carry out Domestic installations\n, and in fact may have to pay for the services of an unqualified person who has taken a short course\n is insulting and impractical.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithout a single reference point for consumers there will alway\ns be confusion and ultimately many will simply not bother to have work carried out by professionals or indeed at all.\n&#xa0;\n I\nn my opinion the industry definitely needs to be regulated, but not in a way where the emphasis is on a competitive market with several\n companies touting for business from contractors.\nInstead it should be on ensuring that a consumer can find the a fully qualified contractor, locally to carry out their work in the safest and most economical way, this cannot be achieved by companies fillin\ng their pockets by offering registration and training to whoever knocks at their door.\nAt this moment in time it seems the Government are not happy because the whole framework of Part P was set up as a knee jerk reaction, without enough thought and plannin\ng.\nConsumers are still unclear as to regulations and where to look for an appropriate contractor.\nThousands of highly qualified tradeâ€™s people are being excluded from carrying out work in favour of people with next to no qualifications or experience.\nIn co\nnclusion the clock needs resetting, introduce one regulating and authorising body that is not merely concerned with making profit, but actually works towards offering the best deal to the consumer.\n \n23 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
