[[[Introduction.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  First it has about a 20% higher efficiency (about 80% achievable double that of thermal coal) and second carbon (or carbon fuels) are much easier to store than hydrogen. &#xa0;&#xa0; The waste product fro a DCFC is a stream pure CO2 so no additional capture technology is required, although compression and storage are still required. &#xa0;&#xa0; Provide a mechanism for massive energy storage combined with on demand power generation which can support renewable power generation.&#xa0;&#xa0; Provide a more efficient power train for large scale transport (e.g. shipping) that could include carbon capture to reduce, possibly eliminate, carbon emissions.&#xa0;&#xa0; Provide a much cleaner and much more efficient waste to energy conversion from non-recyclable waste plastic compared to incineration.&#xa0;
