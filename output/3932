defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Legal Aid Practitioners Group (JRR 0035)defaultThe Legal Aid Practitioners Group is a membership organisation for firms and organ
defaultisations with a contract to carry out legal aid work. Our members are based throughout England and Wales and are both private practices and not for profit organisations. Our members carry out civil and criminal work and cover the whole range of sizes from 
defaultsmall sole principal firms to some of the largest providers of legal aid services in the country. 
defaultIntroductiondefault1. In response to the JCHR’s call for evidence, this document sets out evidence from the Legal Aid Practitioners Group (LAPG) in relation to hum
defaultan rights issues raised by the following Government proposals relating to judicial review: 
default              
defaulta
default. 
defaultStanding and third party interventions default– The proposed introduction of a narrower test for 
default              
default“standing” to apply for judicial review, so as to limit the range of 
defaultpeople and groups who are 
default              
defaultentitled to invoke the procedure, and the proposed modification of the rules to discourage 
default              
defaultthe involvement of interveners and third parties.
default              
defaultb
default. 
defaultCostsdefault – The proposed rebalancing of financial incentives so that providers are only
default paid for 
default              
defaultwork carried out on judicial review cases where permission is granted, or exceptionally in the 
default              
defaultLegal Aid Agency’s discretion; and the proposed restriction on the availability of “Protective 
default              
defaultCosts Orders” which can currently be made by courts to limit the possible costs exposure for a 
default              
defaultclaimant in a case judged by the court to be brought in the public interest.
default              
defaultc
default. 
defaultProcedural as opposed to substantive defects in decisionsdefault – The proposal to red
defaultuce the 
default              
defaultpotential for delay by strengthening the courts’ powers in cases where a procedural defect 
default              
defaulthas been established which would have made no difference to the outcome had the correct 
default              
defaultprocedure been followed.  The Government is considering lowering t
defaulthe probability threshold 
default              
defaultto include cases where it is not necessarily certain that the defect would have made no 
default              
defaultdifference, and/or by bringing forward the point at which the “no difference” question is 
default              
defaultconsidered, so that applications for judicial revi
defaultew can be rejected on this basis at the 
default              
defaultpermission stage.
default              
defaultd
default.
default 
defaultThe Public Sector Equality Dutydefault – The proposal to make non-
defaultjusticiable
default the statutory duty 
default              
defaultimposed on public bodies by the Equality Act, to have due regard to the need to eliminate 
default              
defaultdiscriminat
defaultion, by providing an alternative, non-judicial mechanism for resolving disputes 
default              
defaultabout whether public bodies have complied with the duty.
default              
defaulte
default. 
defaultThe Committee also seeks evidence on the combined effect of these proposals and
default:
default              
default (1) the Government’s proposals 
defaultto reform legal aid, in particular the proposed 
default              
defaultintroduction 
default              
defaultof a residence test and 
default              
default(2) the provisions in Part 2 of the Immigration Bill reducing rights of appeal against 
default              
defaultimmigration decisions.
default2. LAPG notes that the Government’s latest proposals to 
defaultmake changes to judicial review are at variance with assurances made by Ministers to Parliament during the passage of the LASPO Act 2012 regarding the continued availability of legal aid for judicial review post-LASPO. For example, Ken Clarke gave an assur
defaultance that the Government would be “continuing legal aid in all cases involving judicial review”, and added that the Government “do not think that the Government or any public body should be resisting a claim about abuse of their powers from a litigant who 
defaultcannot get legal advice” (Programme (No 3) motion, House of Commons, 17 April 2012, 
defaultcol
default 227). The Civil Legal Aid (Merits) Regulations 2012 issued under LASPO Act provided a more robust test for availability of legal aid for judicial review cases and has a
defaultlready restricted the availability of public funding.
defaulta. Standing and third-party interventionsdefault3
default. 
defaultIt is constitutionally important that there are proper checks on the decisions of public bodies and that where there is an issue of serious concern, cases ar
defaulte able to be brought to shed light on the issues raised.
default There is no evidence to suggest that the proposed changes are needed.
default4
default. 
defaultT
defaulthere are already many hurdles to climb over to satisfy the current test of 
defaultstanding 
defaultto bring a judicial review:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5
default. 
defaultThere is no evidence that
default numerous cases that have been brought just to seek publicity or hinder the process of proper decision-making.
default Evidence from the Public Law Project suggests that only around 3% of j
defaultudicial review final hearings involve “public interest” claimants (such as charities).
default The current position on standing means that meaningful and important cases where nobody else could bring a case were properly raised before the Courts for determination 
defaulte.g. the Medical Justice case
default (
defaultMedical Justice v SSHD
default [2010] EWHC 1925 (Admin)
default. 
default6
default. 
defaultThe role of third party interventions is important and helps to ensure that relevant arguments are put. Speaking
default at the Public Law Project Conference 14 October 2013,
default Baron
defaultess Hale indicated that she found the interventions in the cases before her helpful.
default7
default. 
defaultWe would reiterate what we stated in our
default consultation
default response
default:
default namely that these proposals raise very important constitutional issues. We are greatly concerned to see 
defaultthem put forward on an ad hoc basis in a relatively short consultation, in a time of considerable change.
defaultb. Costsdefault8
default. 
defaultWe would briefly outline 
defaultthe 
defaultpoints made in our response to the consultation about the problems of providers only being paid for work wher
defaulte permission is granted
default.
default 
defaultWe will then
default set out our concerns 
defaultabout the L
defaultegal Aid Agency 
defaultdiscretion. Judicial 
defaultreview 
defaultis a vital constitutional procedure for holding the decisions and omissions of public bodies to account in a democratic society. The original 
defaultproposals were planned to save £1
default 
defaultm
defaultillion
default, a very small part of the overall budget
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9. 
defaultWe do not expect that inserting a provision that the Legal Aid Agency
default (LAA)
default may exceptionally pay costs will improve the situation because the relationship between providers and the 
defaultLAA
default is such that providers would not treat the possibility of payment as very different to the original proposal of no payment unless permission is g
defaultranted. 
default10
default. 
defaultThere are many examples where practitioners have acted to the absolute best of their ability to comply with contractual and other requirements
default,
default but the LAA has 
defaultdisagreed with the provider’s interpretation, either:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default11
default.
default 
defaultIn these situations, 
defaulteither party may have made an error or there may be a disagreement over
default the interpretation
default of complex legal aid provisions.
default12
default. 
defaultA practical example is the calculation of 
defaulta 
defaultclient’s means. This used to be carried out without too much d
defaultifficulty. 
defaultThen 
defaultlegal help 
defaultf
defaultorms became longer. Regulations became lengthier. The LAA came under pressure from the National Audit Office on financial eligibility. More checks were carried out on file samples. Vulnerable, marginalised, chaotic clients now f
defaultace a major barrier to justice as they seek to prove their financial eligibility. What practitioners have absorbed is that they need to cut out all risk so if
default,
default 
defaultfor example,
default a client with an emergency cannot prove their financial eligibility when they come 
defaultto the office
default,
default there is every likelihood that they will not be seen. Why? Because if the client fails to return with the correct documentation, the practitioner cannot claim any of the fee.
default13
default. 
defaultThe level of auditing and the huge cost to practitioners of de
defaultaling with issues raised on audit means that it is unlikely that practitioners see the LAA as an agency that will exercise its discretion in favour of the practitioner. This concern has been highlighted by the LAA interpretation of when to grant exceptiona
defaultl case funding. 
default14
default. 
defaultIt is unrealistic for legal aid practices to do this work ‘at risk’ and the amended proposal would not alter this. The practical effect is that 
defaulta
default case would not be brought in the first place because the legal team could not predict in 
defaultadvance what stage the case would reach.
default15
default. 
defaultWe would raise an added complication
default:
default namely 
defaultthat 
defaultthe current limitation on new matter starts for public law cases means that already existing providers have to ration legal help cases in public law. If the exis
defaultting 
defaultlimit on new matter starts
default remains, then it will not be possible for providers to undertake work under legal help because 
defaultthey 
defaultare insufficient
defaultly
default allocated at present.
default16
default. 
defaultRegarding Protective Costs Orders, 
defaultwe think that PCOs play an important part in
default allowing matters of public interest to be considered by the judiciary and would oppose any changes. We refer to the analysis from the Public Law Project which makes it clear that there is no problem that needs to be tackled. The principles set out in the 
defaultCorner House Case admirable and the Government has provided no information which gives c
defaultause for concern that frivolous 
defaultcases could be brought. Nor has the Government indicated which cases it would class as ‘a campaign tool’.
default17
default. 
defaultThe Government has 
defaultreferred to inequality arising from PCOs but the bigger inequality is between those bringing the claims and those defending their actions. This is the true inequality of arms which needs to be addressed.
default3. Procedural as opposed to substantive defects in ddefaultecisionsdefault18
default. 
defaultThere is no evidence that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Certainly in legal aid cases the Legal Aid Agency would not fund legal aid for such a case unless the more onerous merits test is met, whether the challenge is based on p
defaultrocedural defects or any other ground. Our understanding is that procedural issues may be raised along with other issues but we would again ask for evidence of these
default purported
default cases which are so numerous or severe that the current carefully thought out pro
defaultcesses face being overturned.
default4. The Public Sector Equality Dutydefault19
default. 
defaultThis is a summary of the points LAPG made in its consultation response:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. The combined effect of these proposals and (1) the Government’s proposals to reform legal aid, in particular the proposed introduction of a residence test and (2) the provisions in Part 2 of the Immigration Bill reducing defaultrights of appeal against immigration decisions.default20
default. 
defaultIn our view, it is unnecessary to make the proposed changes when there are so many mechanisms in place to protect abuse of the system.
default(1)
default The residence test
default21
default. 
defaultThe proposal is to introduce a residence t
defaultest in order to qualify for any level of civil legal aid, with two limbs: firstly to be lawfully resident in the UK, crown dependencies or overseas territories, and secondly to have resided lawfully in these places for 12 months. 
default22
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultG
defaultovernment has am
defaultended the original proposals
default              
default‘
default125. Having carefully considered consultation responses, we have concluded that 
default              
defaultthere are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain 
default              
defaultmatters of law (as set out in Schedule 1 to LASPO) would not be required to meet the 
default              
defaultresidence test. The test will not apply to the following categories of case (which 
default              
defaultbroadly 
default              
defaultrelate to an individual’s liberty, or where the individual is particularly vu
defaultlnerable or where 
default              
defaultthe case relates to the protection of children): 
default23
default. 
defaultUnder 
default“
defaultdetention cases
default”
default,
default 
defaultpara
default 5 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 
defaultof the LASPO Act 
defaultrefers t
defaulto Mental Health and Mental Capacity cases.
default24
default. 
defaultWe therefore understand that this 
defaultwould still leave the following categories of clients/cases having to meet the residence test:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default25
default. 
defaultWe stated that we believe that
default this proposal is unlawful, unjust, impractical and unnecessary. It removes access to justice arbitrarily for
default many
default vulnerable client groups and is indefensible.
default26
default. 
defaultOther responde
defaultnts
default 
defaultwill cover compliance with Articles 6 and 14 of the E
defaulturopean 
defaultC
defaultonvention on 
defaultH
defaultuman 
defaultR
defaultights
default, Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Equality Act and other relevant legislation.
default27
default. 
defaultIn our view the proposal is discriminatory and will affect large numbers of vulnerable people who will, if the proposal is i
defaultmplemented, be at 
defaultincreased
default risk of physical and mental harm
default, with no effective remedy
default.
default28
default. 
defaultThis provision – which the Government does not suggest will save money – will affect all clients because the test will have to be met by all those seeking advice un
defaultless their case is clearly within the exceptions listed above. Many clients have no passport, will have difficulty with the first part of the 
defaulttest and will have difficulty providing the evidence that they have lawfully been here for a period of 12 months.
default29
default. 
defaultDespite the concession, we believe that t
defaulthe proposal will also adversely affect vulnerable mentally incapacitated adults who currently have the protection of the powers of the Court of Protection.  
defaultParagraph 5 Schedule 1 LASPO Act covers cases other th
defaultan detention as well as detention.  Will clients with cases within this category be exempt or not?
default30
default. 
defaultSchedule 3 of the MCA 2005 deals with the International Protection of Adults with incapacity and sets out the scope of the Court of Protection's jurisdic
defaulttion in relation to those adults at paragraph 7 of the Schedule.  Part 2 of the Schedule specifica
defaultlly provides at Para 7(1)
default(c):
default              
defaultthe court may exercise its function under this Act ( in so far as it cannot otherwise do so) in 
default              
defaultrelation to:-
default              
default...
default              
default...
default              
default(c) a
defaultn adult present in England and Wales or who has property there, if the matter is 
default              
defaulturgent, or
default              
default(d
default)
default an adult present in England and Wales, if a protective measure which is temporary and 
default              
defaultlimited in its effect to England and Wales is proposed in relation to h
defaultim.
default&#xa0;
default31
default.
default 
defaultThese provisions appear to have been specifically added to include adults who would not otherwise meet the residency requirements of the Schedule. A typical case would be the removal of an incapacitated adult from another jurisdiction to England o
defaultr Wales and an application to return the adult to the other jurisdiction. If the residence test as currently formulated is implemented then severely disabled persons who are at risk and require protection will be left without any remedy. This could in many
default cases result in physical or mental harm or even death.
default32
default. 
defaultIn our view any system which requires the provider to obtain proof of lawful residence for a period of a year will be wholly unworkable both because of practical difficulties in obtaining such evi
defaultdence and also due to the complexities as to who is ‘lawfully’ resident (and for a year). If this proposal is implemented there will be practical difficulties in obtaining proof and providers will be risk averse because of reasons given above.
default33
default. 
defaultWe are c
defaultoncerned that the legal aid provider would need to gather the evidence in all cases, including people who are extremely vulnerable per se but also whose circumstances mean that they cannot easily find their own paperwork. Many people, particularly those wh
defaulto have chaotic lifestyles or disabilities, or who are in a time of crisis do not readily have access to documentary evidence of lawful residence. Even if, which we doubt, this client group could provide evidence of lawful residence for a year, the delay in
default producing the evidence prior to accessing legal advice would place them at very serious risk and may in some cases lead to their suffering harm or even death because of the administrative requirements.
default34
default. 
defaultThe complexity around the term ‘lawfully 
defaultresident’ will result in confusion, people being denied advice to which they are entitled, and second guessing by the LAA. This in turn will
default, judging from past experience on e.g. financial eligibility evidence, 
defaultlead to considerable additional expense for t
defaulthe LAA in auditing firms, appeals and other challenges, something recognised by the original Impact 
defaultAssessment. We think that this has been seriously underestimated and will create massive problems for the efficient operation of the legal aid scheme.
default35
default. 
defaultA
defaultdditionally this is time which providers can ill afford to spend on administrative matters when businesses are already under extreme pressure
default.
default36
default. 
defaultIt is already difficult for people who are entitled to legal aid to satisfy the eligibility test because of i
defaultts increased complexity following 
defaultthe 
defaultLASPO
default 
defaultA
defaultct
default. The residence test will make it even more difficult for people to obtain legal aid, even if under this new test they are lawfully entitled to do so.
default 
defaultThis is a non-evidence based proposal 
defaultand 
defaultthe Government h
defaultas shown no logical or defensible reason for its introduction. It is flawed on every level. 
default37. British Citizens who have not lived here for the last 12 months will have to show proof they have previously lived here for a period of 12 months which provide
defaultrs need to check, which for people who have lived abroad, possibly with their partner's job, may find very hard to prove. 
default38
default. 
defaultThe Government has acknowledged that it does not have data on the numbers of people affected by this proposal. It cannot cost it,
default 
defaulteither 
defaultin terms of any savings to the legal aid fund or the additional cost to society from removal of access to legal aid.
default39
default. 
defaultThe Government 
defaulthas no evidence to say that this proposal is needed to shore up public confidence. There is no evidence that acc
defaultess to legal advice is a cause of unlawful entry or residence in the UK (and this would be most surprising). Public confidence in the legal aid system could be fostered by the Government explaining to the public what legal aid remains available for, and th
defaulte fact that already only a very small percentage of the population is eligible for any legal advice at any level.
default4
default0
default. As we stated in our response to the consultation, the effects of the LASPO cuts have yet to be evaluated but it was anticipated that they 
defaultwill result in over 600,000 people a year being denied access to justice. The LASPO 
defaultAct 
defaultcuts left a rump of a legal aid system accessible to a very small minority of the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The residence proposal will ensure that the po
defaultorest and most vulnerable of those, many of them lawfully and properly in the UK, will also now be excluded from access to justice. This proposal is not a transformation. It is a cut of the most politically cynical ‘slash and burn’ variety.
