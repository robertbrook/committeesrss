[[[Introduction]]]1.              This evidence is submitted in relation to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Wales Bill. I am happy to elaborate on this evidence in person should the Welsh Affairs Committee consider that to be of value.

[[[ ]]]2.              The evidence focuses on Part One of the Bill (‘The Assembly and Welsh Government’).  It draws upon my on-going research on devolution, relating specifically to the capacity of the National Assembly for Wales (Assembly). It also uses evidence submitted to the Commission on Devolution in Wales (the Silk Commission) from the Study of Parliament Wales Group. The submission focuses on the enduring issue of the Assembly’s capacity, as I regard this as critical to the scrutiny of the Bill and its intended outcomes. 3.               The fundamental principles which underpin all democratically elected legislatures include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Capacity (to discharge its roles)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Clarity&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Simplicity&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Intelligibility (to internal and external stakeholders)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Profile&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mutual respect and effective co-operation (between all UK legislatures) &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Legitimacy&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Autonomy (to act on matters affecting Wales, without excessive prescription or unnecessary obstacles)4.              My submission contextualises Part One of the Bill against the long-standing capacity challenges that the Assembly faces. This is a fundamental constraint that frames the context for the Assembly’s current operation, as well and many of the issues that are raised in connection with the operation, public profile and acceptance of devolution in Wales. Various pieces of recent published research by our team at the University of Liverpool (McAllister, Cole, Stirbu) rehearse these issues in some depth.  Matters relating to Assembly size are highlighted here as these are especially relevant to Part One, Section 2 of the Bill: “Removal of restriction on standing for election for both constituency and electoral region”. &#xa0;Moreover, the fundamental issue of capacity also relates to Part Two of the Bill, as these additional financial and fiscal responsibilities are framed by a desire for greater accountability. Without the resources to properly scrutinise and manage these powers, that objective is unlikely to be fulfilled.&#xa0;

[[[Assembly size]]]&#xa0;5.              By all the evidence and by any international comparison, the Assembly is a very small institution indeed.  With just 60 elected members, it has fewer elected politicians than small US states such as Utah (73 members), North Dakota (94 members), Vermont (148 members) and Maine (151 members). The Assembly has fewer politicians than ‘small’ German Lander, such as Bremen (with 83 members) and Saxony Anhalt (97 members). The average size of national parliaments within the EU with populations of between 1-6 million citizens is approximately 141 elected members. &#xa0;6.              Within the UK context, the Assembly is less than half the size of the Scottish Parliament (129 MSPs) and substantially smaller than the Northern Ireland Assembly (with 108 MLAs), which has a population half the size of Wales. The Assembly has fewer politicians than many Welsh local authorities: Cardiff Council has 75 councillors, and Swansea has 72. In 2004, when the Assembly’s powers were much more constrained, the Richard Commission advocated an increase to 80 AMs. &#xa0;7.              It is frequently said that the matter of Assembly size should not be addressed whilst public disengagement with elected politicians remains high and against a context of economic recession. To the contrary, without consideration of the appropriate number of AMs, the capacity challenges which the Assembly currently faces are likely to be exacerbated by new powers over taxation and borrowing. In turn, matters of capacity affect negatively public confidence and support for the institution, as well as challenging many of the fundamental principles that we have set out above. Furthermore, the Assembly Commission has a strategic goal to engage with the people of Wales by encouraging greater interest in the Assembly’s work and facilitating involvement with the legislative process. For this to happen, there needs to be first, greater clarity and intelligibility, and also, sufficient politicians to discharge the Assembly’s duties effectively.&#xa0;8.              We have argued elsewhere (Cole, McAllister and Stirbu, 2013) that the size of the Assembly is at the heart of many of its capacity challenges. The negative impact on scrutiny and on developing effective committee work is considerable.  In particular, matters of capacity were associated with the intensive workload of the Third Assembly and driving and constraining changes to the system of committee scrutiny in the Fourth. The small size also places a substantive burden on the political parties to select candidates of the highest calibre because the presence of more than a handful of less effective members can quickly become a serious weakness. In contrast, larger-scale institutions such as the House of Commons or the Scottish Parliament can easily absorb the diverse skills range and experience of elected members into the overall mix of roles that any legislature furnishes. In Wales since 2006, this has been exacerbated by the ban on standing for election on both constituency and electoral region ballots.9.              Our research has made various suggestions for addressing capacity weaknesses in the Assembly, acknowledging that some clearly address the symptoms rather than the causes of the problem:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changes to the dual candidacy ban&#xa0;The Government of Wales Act, 2006 introduced a prohibition on “dual candidacy”, that is candidates standing for election in the constituencies and on the regional list simultaneously. This is an anomaly and out of line with virtually all other Additional Member Systems (AMS). Furthermore, it has a serious impact on capacity with regard to quality of candidates that parties might put up (and, therefore, of elected AMs). The Wales Office Green Paper (2012) on future electoral arrangements for the National Assembly for Wales

[[[ ]]](http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/have-your-say-2/) suggested removing the ban saying that the UK Government believes: &#xa0;“that, in principle, candidates should not be barred from standing for election simultaneously in an Assembly constituency and an Assembly region. It impacts disproportionally on smaller parties, who would understandably not wish to risk their smaller pool of candidates in a constituency election when there may be a chance they could be elected from the regional list. Likewise, if a party does better than expected in constituency elections, candidates on that party’s regional list are unlikely to be elected. The prohibition on dual candidacy may, in time, have a negative effect on representation in the Assembly as high quality candidates who stand as constituency candidates, but who fail to secure that seat, are lost to the Assembly because of the “all or nothing” choice they are required to make.” &#xa0;I agree entirely with the removal of the restriction in the draft Bill. The ban introduced in 2006 was ill-advised and has affected both capacity and calibre, especially given the split between list and constituency seats in the Welsh system. In other nations that use similar Additional Mixed Member Systems (AMS), there is no such restriction. Indeed, a recent Electoral Commission report in New Zealand rejected a ban, as did the Arbuthnott Commission in Scotland. Issues about mandate and procedures between constituency and regional members have been successfully resolved elsewhere, and there is no reason to think Wales is different in this regard.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Increasing the number of AMs 

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is hard to disprove that substantial capacity constraints arise from having such a relatively small number of AMs. Any longitudinal review of devolution in Wales and strategic planning for the future of the Assembly means that at some stage the core capacity issues will have to be addressed, otherwise there will be an inevitable continued impact on the profile, effectiveness and legitimacy of the Assembly. It is, however, critical to consider the number of politicians representing Wales and its localities in the round, that is at European, UK, national and local level. Equally, it lends weight to Section 3 of Part One of the Bill which rightly prohibits the holding of a seat in both the UK Parliament and the Assembly. &#xa0;Research undertaken by McAllister (in 2008-9, whilst working with the Independent Panel on AMs Pay and Support) and Cole et al (2013) has examined alternatives to increasing the finite number of AMs. It should be noted that each of these is far from perfect as they are essentially temporary solutions to symptoms of a core problem.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Shorter-term alternatives: Assembly Associates &#xa0;There is some merit in considering the appointment of a small number of individuals to serve on Assembly committees with the paramount objective of enhancing opportunities for scrutiny.  Such a proposal would build on practice already underway in local authorities, where scrutiny committees often appoint independent members as a means of enhancing capacity (Wilson and Game, 2011). The suggestion for Assembly Associates was raised by McAllister in research papers provided for the Independent Panel on AMs Pay and Support (2008-9) and in recent work on Assembly capacity with Cole et al (2013). &#xa0;Such Associates might each serve for no more than four years and would have an unpaid and non-voting status. As well as augmenting internal expertise for effective scrutiny, this would have the added bonus of presenting greater diversity and experience to the work of the Assembly.  Of course, there are difficulties with this suggestion especially with regard to democratic legitimacy: Cole et al (2013) suggest that it would not be appropriate to appoint more than six at any one time to ensure that elected AMs would retain at least a 10-1 ratio. Although this is an interesting innovation, clearly it is an experimental one and one moreover, that is wholly unfamiliar to a UK parliamentary context. In addition, the likely financial differential between pursuing one of these routes or having more directly AMs is minimal.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Overhang’ seats&#xa0;A mechanism for providing additional AMs without formally increasing the size of the Assembly could lie in the concept of ‘overhang seats’ (used in the New Zealand Parliament, the German Bundestag and the National Assembly of Venezuela). The need for ‘overhang seats’ arises when a party in a Mixed Member Electoral System wins more constituency seats than its share of seats determined by the party vote (that is, its overall proportional entitlement). In such cases, the extra seats are not normally removed, rather the number of representatives in parliament increases just for the life of that parliament, so adding to its capacity (Soberg Shugart and Wattenberg, 2003; National Assembly Independent Review Panel, 2009).
