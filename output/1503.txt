&#xa0;Written evidence from Leslie Bowman a councillor within Seaton Valley, Northumberland (TIC 035)&#xa0;Thank you for the privilege to write this report on public transport and other related services.&#xa0;I am Leslie Bowman a councillor within Seaton Valley, Northumberland. I do not officially represent the residents or the Seaton Valley Council in this report, but as someone who lives and works within this part of Northumberland and has an ear for the people of this area.&#xa0;

[[[Outline]]]This area of South East Northumberland is poorly served by public transport and all pervious national and local government and has not provided a good sound framework for good, safe, relevant public transport service to this community of 5 villages. Example: Although we are not far from national rails services we have no links with bus services. Most of the bus routes have not changed much since the 1930s even though people lives and work place have.&#xa0;Public transport is provided by bus services operated mainly by Arriva and on one route by Go North East. We have no rail service in the valley.

[[[Bus Services]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I get many complaints about the Arriva bus services as they are cutting back on routes and isolating villages in the process.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We need more bus companies in the area to shake Arriva who has 95% of the bus services and yes they must make a profit but must also service the community.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Cost of fares is extremely expensive and for families it must be back breaking.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We need a system of ONE ticket for all bus journeys ( Transfare ) to get to your destinations.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We need bus services to National Rail connections like 

[[[Morpeth Station ]]]which provides mainline services to London and places south. Edinburgh and Scotland. We have none.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also need connections with a rail service at 

[[[Cramlington Station]]] and Tyne and Wear Metro System.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also need a connection with our local International airport 

[[[Newcastle Airport ]]]

[[[(]]]

[[[NCL]]].)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The connections above should be for ALL of Seaton Valley not just the parts the bus companies like to have to make profits.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The residents of one village would love a service to and from 

[[[Cramlington]]] and Station as they do not have any service there at all. They never have done and will never see it happen under this present system.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The quality of the buses must improve. They are to be quiet, comfortable, cooled in the summer with air con and cosy in the winter when bitter cold outside with air quality improvements.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We need bus actual running times at bus stops, just like many cities. More so because routes are longer than cities and traffic problem can wreck havoc on bus time tables. Mobile phone apps with real time.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We should be thinking Green Buses. Electric etc.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All buses should be disable friendly ie. Mobility, Blind, Deaf, and other less able persons. At the moment 99% of bus services are NOT.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We need bus shelters and more of them, which are clean, dry, good repair, with seating, lighting for nights and the winter months. Fitted with real time transport times. And a bin.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We need a rail service in Seaton Valley. We have a famous line going through 3 of our 5 villages that was closed to passengers in the 1960s (50 years ago). It is a mineral line at the moment and could be put back into passenger use with little cost, providing confections to Newcastle, Blyth, Bedlington, Ashington, and the county town of Northumberland and Mainline Station, Morpeth.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
