Written evidence from Mr Yu Tan[bold] [PHSO054][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dear Mr Jenkin, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing to you in your capacity as the Chair of the PASC (Public Administration Select Committee) who holds Dame Julie Mellor (Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman) to account. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My local MP, Mr Jim Fitzpatrick MP (former Minister of London and former Minister of State for Environment) has kindly agreed to forward this to you. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This letter concerns a matter that affects all 62 million citizens living in the UK as the one issue I am raising have wide public significance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This letter focus on the specific issue of Dame Julie repeatedly ignoring the several internal complaints I made regarding the exceedingly poor quality of service I have received from her staff over the past one year. In total, my MP made 3 referrals containing 6 separate cases, none of which were properly dealt with by Dame Julie and her staff. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My high profile case about Abuse and Negligence in the NHS was referred by a Senior MP (former Minister of London and Minister of State for Environment) but the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman's staff stubbornly refused to investigate. I have no money to launch a judicial review to overturn their wrong decision, so am stuck with their wrong decision (I did lodge an internal appeal but the result was even more unfair). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, during the past year, I made several Internal Complaints about the discriminatory treatment and appallingly poor quality of service received from their staff. On all occasions they persistently refused to investigate those internal complaints and gave vexatious reasons for their refusals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a person with multiple disabilities and multiple minority identities protected by the Equality Act 2010, the way I was treated by the Ombudsman's staff infringed and violated my rights and dignity (for instance, the reckless words from their acting assistant director in a hurtful letter and then ignored my response). 
[normal]My long-standing high profile case is receiving attention at national level from press and media, but before publication, I feel that the Chair of the PASC (Public Administration Select Committee) needs to intervene and set the record straight. Just think, if a highly qualified senior professional who was published and won the respect of the Prime Minister can't get any justice from the Ombudsman, what chance is there for the rest of the 62 million people in the UK? 
[normal]My high profile case was part of the Clwyd-Hart Review commissioned by the Prime Minister, launched by the Health Secretary and published by the Department of Health in October 2013. 
[normal]I am aware that you are a Senior MP with 16 years experience. Being a Registered Counsellor, I am aware that you are the Vice-President of Combat Stress (we have a lot to talk about when we meet). 
[normal]As you can see, I am not raising concerns of a personal nature, but I am expressing my professional opinion (in the past I have held senior positions in the health sector including NHS) that the Ombudsman's Office appears to be on the edge of "not fit for purpose". 
[normal]I have received sympathetic replies from the UK Chief Hospital Inspector newly appointed by David Cameron, but he has no power to intervene the Ombudsman's Office, only the Chair of the PASC (Public Administration Select Committee) has the jurisdiction and power to look into the aforementioned matter. I have also applied to work for the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as a Hospital Inspector. 
[normal]I should be grateful if we can have a short meeting in your House of Commons office to discuss the aforementioned concerns that have wide public significance. 
[normal]I look forward to hearing from you and your colleagues.
[normal]10 December 2013
