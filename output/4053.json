"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Andrew Reid [FBB0039]&#xa0;Future of the BBCWhat should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?If it is deemed necessary \nfor the UK \nto have a \nnational public service broadcaster\n,\n it should be proportionate\n,\n and focused on “core business” ie\n providing it’s audience with high quality\n,\n \nbalanced and impartial \noutput on matters of \nnational and public importance, which would\n not otherwise \nbe addressed\n by the private sector. \nIt’s news \nbroadcasts \nshould \nstick to \nreporting \nfactual\nly \naccurate \ninforma\ntion, not\n supporting\n \nan institutional agenda \noverwhelmingly consisting of\n \nopinion\ns\n from\n it’s \nown \napproved \n“\ntalking heads\n”\n.\n&#xa0;How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?The BBC has performed extremely badly in this regard, and continues it’s long decline. \nI \ntravel\nled\n widely, internationally, \nin the eighties and nineties, \nand I was proud of the BBC\n as a respected British institution\n. Alas, no more. \nThe BBC has become\n \nself-serving, \nbloated and arrogant\n,\n and out of touch with mainstream public opinion. A recent spate of scandals has revealed a disgrac\neful abuse \nof  licence payers\n’\n money\n,\n awarding huge sums to surplus executives and managers\n. M\nany\n, like me, \nhave been shoc\nked by \nthe \ndisgraceful\n cover up of foul and criminal activities undertaken on BBC premises\n over many years in the past.\n In the recent Savile case, the “whistle-blowing” had ITN to thank, not the BBC itself.\nI \nused to wake up routinely to the Radio 4 Today \nprogramme, but gradually became disillusioned\n \nand irritated by\n it’s content\n.  I \nfind that I can no longer listen \nto \nor watch BBC News \nand current affairs \nprogrammes on a regular basis as they are exceedingly biased\n,\n reflecting the BBC’s Metropolitan Libera\nl Left agenda\n.\nThe BBC is required to be balanced and impartial, but it is \ntoo often \nneither. In any BBC phone in or discussion you quickly can assess the BBC’s position and what the outcome will be.  \nAnyone who deviates significantly is interrupted, sneer\ned at or shouted down.\nThere is a clear BBC agenda/position on many major \npolitical \ntopics, examples being;\nThe E\nur\nopean Union (pro)\nImmigration, m\nulti-culturalism and PC \n(pro)\nGlobal Warming (now metamorphosed into \n“\nClimate Change\n”\n) – (pro)\nThe Labour\n Party (pro)\nThe Middle East (pro Palestinian)\nRe the USA, strongly pro Democrat \n&#xa0;\nAlthough I have no religious affiliations, I note the BBC regularly criticises \nand mocks \nChrist\ni\na\nnity (ofte\nn justifiably) but protects and promotes Islam\n, whilst generally i\ngnoring other religions.\nThe BBC also \nseems \nover\n-\nobsessed\n \nwith “racism”\n, \n“equality” \nand “green” \nmatters\n, so much \nso, \nthat \nthis \nc\nan in effect \nbe counter-\nproductive to \ntheir underlying aims\nThe BBCs flagship Newnight programme is, and has been\n,\n dominated by senior people well to the left of the political spectrum.\n \nIt is obvious to any intelligent and aware person that BBC phone-in’s and programmes like Question Time/Any Questions are clearly carefully managed to ensure the right outcomes and out\nputs for the BBC.\nOther than for Sport, I no\n l\nonger use the on line BBC\n \nsite\n, prefe\nr\nr\ning \nto get my News from \nmany other \nexcellent \non-line \nsources including \nnewspapers\n and blogs.\nComplaints about the BBC’s bias\n,\n once infrequent\n,\n are now commonplace\n.  Howeve\nr \nit’s \ncomplaints system is the metaphorical \nequivalent of scaling Everest. M\nany people no longer bo\nther\n,\n having \nbeing told that the BBC \nhas considered their point\n, but\n, on reflection,\n \nthink that \nthe BBC \n“got it just about right”\n \nAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?The Charter content seems reasonable in principle, but the BBC has rather focused on competing with the private sector, in producing what some might unkindly call \ncommercial \n“\nTrash TV\n”\n rather th\nan core public service matters. The private sector is more than capable of meet\ning market demand for the former.\n&#xa0;\nWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? \nTo s\ntick \nstrictly \nto core public service broadcasting \nsupported by \na \nvery \nsmall number of TV\n and radio channels. \nIn 2013 we do not need a “force-funded”, large State Broadcaster producing “Trash TV” and \nbiased \n“News” any more than we need a similar State distributor and retailer of food, competing against the highly efficient major supermarkets.\nShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? \n&#xa0;\nAs stated elsewhere \nthe output of popular commercial programmes should be cut back\n,\n as the\nse\n can, and will be covered\n adequately by private \nbroadcasters.  \n&#xa0;What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?With a smaller public service orientated BBC, much more would be covered in-house.  However, the \nexact \nbalance\n would be \na matter for the \nsenior management to decide.\n \n&#xa0;How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?&#xa0;\nAs stated \nalready,\n the wide-scale involvement of the BBC in commercial matters does not sit well with the remit o\nf a public service broadcaster.\n&#xa0;What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?Public sector organisations are ill-suited to \neffective \nand productive \nlarge scale \nresearch \nand development.  A good example was the recent major \nBBC \nIT project cancellation whereby £100M of licence payer’s money was wasted. The BBC does however need to employ smart\n,\n commercially-aware people to ensure \nit keeps up with the latest developments, and \nadop\nts \nthe best \ntechnology available\n,\n as the media indus\ntry continues to \nrapidly \ntransform. \n&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? \nThe anachronism of the current licence fee\n, often\n enforced by \nthreat of criminal sanctions \nmust\n be abolished. \nI was astonished to read of\n the sheer \nnumbers of people now find\ni\nng\n themselves in court for non payment.\nThe BBC should be cut down \nsubstantially\n,\n \nfor example\n with the sale of Radios 1, 5 \nLive\n, 6Music\n \nand a number of TV channels \netc\n.  The role of it’s\n local radio network should also be \nreviewed as it is \nduplicating and \nseverely\n stifling\n local\n competit\ni\non.\n \nFunding \nof a much slimmed down BBC \nshould be through\n;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nvoluntary subscripti\non (like SKY – no pay, no play)\nb)  \nthrough advertising. \nAlthough the BBC is currently \nperceived to be \n“ad-free” it’s TV\n,\n and \nespecially \nradi\no \nchannels\n are awash with annoying, repeated ad’s for it’s own programmes\n.\nBy this mechanism the BBC could save greatly on the costs of evasion, \nplus \nit’s \nsubstantial \nfunding \nof \n(private) \nTVL–Capita\n enforcement.  This would also \nre\nmove\n the \nmuch criticised \nelements of public har\nas\ns\nment \nand threats, widely reported, and avoid \npeople \nacquiring \ncriminal records \nfor simply avoiding or not \nwant\ning\n to pay for the BBC\n.\nIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?I believe \nthis has only become an issue \nbecause of the \nwell publicised abuses involving\n the BBC\n, plus \nit’s perceived size and power\n.\nWhat comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries?I have no significant \nrecent \nexperience of overseas broadcasters although I have found that I can often learn of factual news about the UK from broadcasters such as Russia Today, France24 etc on subjects which the BBC \nfinds “uncomfo\nr\ntable” and \nchooses to ignore, omit or play do\nwn as they don’\nt fit with the BBC’s\n \napproved \nagenda\n.\n&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?The BBC Trust is the ultimate oxymoron. It has proved itself, particularly in recent times\n,\n to be not fit for purpose. It shou\nld be scrapped and repl\na\nced by Ofcom\n.\nIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?Ten years is fa\nr too long a period when we look at how much the BBC has declined and abused it’s position ov\ner the current Agreement period plus the ongoing revolution in modern media.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC has become \n“unhealthy” \nfor our democracy. Through it’s\n TV and Radio News network it \neffectively controls 70% of the News. \nIt’s sheer power can, I believe influence outcomes.  It has mounted vo\nciferous campaigns aga\ni\nnst those it sees as rivals\n or enemies\n, and is in the vanguard of campaigning for State control\n \nover \nof our free press. \nSadly many politicians, especially \nthose \non the right\n,\n seem to be afraid of \nstanding up to \nthe BBC\n.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
