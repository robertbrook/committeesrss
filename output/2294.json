"RCH0011&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Jonathan Stanley for the Independent Children’s Homes Association (ICHA). The ICHA is the largest independent children’s homes membership organisation. \n \nIt provides evidence-based and informed policy and practice leadership for the sector. \n \nWe wish to ensure the \nC\nommittee has the evidence and experience that supports the consistent views of providers. \nMuch of what is being taken \nin the debate \nas conventional wisdom\n \nhas not been given rigorous scrutiny. \n \nSensationalist media interpretation and reporting needs to be set aside in favour of robust analysis of the evidence and to uphold the cardinal principle held by all stakeholders: ‘the right placement at the right time for the right child at the right cost.’\nI would be happy to give evidence in person to the Committee.\nThe person making this submissionJonathan Stanley, the Chief Executive Officer of the ICHA, has 40 years of working in residential child care across local authority, voluntary and independent sectors, managing residential and associated integrated provision (education, care, health) for national resources that address the learning, emotional, and social needs of young people. He is Principal Partner of the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care. \n \nHe was a member of the work groups for the DfE regarding the reform of residential child care. \nSummaryEven with the preference for family and community-based placements, the numbers of children requiring a children’s home remains consistent year on year (page 6 DfE data pack September 2013)\n:\nhttp://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/c/childrens homes data pack2013.PDF\n Section One - The proposed changes can be supported in principleSection two – The need for more evidenceSection three - too much is missing from the proposalsA national strategy&#xa0;\nA new direction and role for commissioninghttp://www.icha.org.uk/uploads/files/use_of_placement_request_forms_in_commissioningplacements_for_lac_final.pdf\n \nThe consequences of seeing children’s homes only as ‘high cost’ and how constructing a graded, sequential, hierarchical view of care may not be in the best interest of young people.Residential child care as a positive option for young peopleSection three - Addressing specific issues and the DfE data packQuality of homes – 72% Good or Better – and more to be donehttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/official-statistics-childrens-social-care-inspections-and-\noutcomes\n  \nThese\n show 72% of all homes are Good or Better - 16% Outstanding; 56% Good; 24% Adequate; 5% Inadequate\nThe DfE data pack dispels several myths that have gained credenceThe Ofsted report, Outstanding Providers, shows larger providers had a higher proportion of \n‘\nOutstanding\n’\n ratings arising from their ability to invest in Quality Assurance. \n \nThe same could be offered to others\n,\n if commissioning was for more than placements but for support too. \nAge of arrival and length of stay – raising concerns All data from DfE data pack September 2013\nIs this the best age to make optimum use of a placement? \n \nWhere have they been before?\nIs a children’s home\n only for adolescents? \n \nWhy is there a wider spread of ages and especially younger ages\n,\n in other countries? \nYet we know\n:\n30.\n \nFelt security is found to predict outcomes above stability.  The lived experience of stability, felt security and development of meaningful relationships matter to young people\n. \n \nICHA research review:\n \nhttp://www.icha.org.uk/uploads/files/icha_research_review___stability_continuity_and_felt_security_sept_2011_1.pdf\n&#xa0;\nDistance as a factor in placementhttp://www.icha.org.uk/uploads/files/icha_research_review___placement_at_distance__from_home__jan__2012__1.pdf\nN.B. The DfE research ‘A long way from home’ of 2012 has not been made public. 31.\n \nSome children may need local placements and others more distant one\ns.\n  There may well be a ‘correct proportion’ but no one knows what it is and the proportion of local placements needed is certainly not 100%. \n \nThe evidence is clear that local placement\n,\n as a universal rule\n,\n is the wrong conclusion.\n32.\n \nWe need to approach placement choice with the sophistication that includes instrumental and expressive (psychological, dynamic) dimensions. \n \nIn the main and where there is purpose, children are more able to accept additional, concerned and loving parental figures in their lives, with all the confusion inherent in such situations, than accept the loss of meaningful figures.\n33.\n \nThe decision on whether a child should be locally placed has to be a \nclinical\n one that takes account of the relationship between child and family, the effect on the child of the local environment, and the purposes and quality of the placement\n.\n34.\n \n Simple instrumental factors such as distance between the placement and the child’s home are less important than the relationships among and the aspirations of care-givers in the placements’ (Lost in Care 1985).\n&#xa0;Out Of Authority placements35.\n \nForthcoming research suggests that placements away from home are often made to secure specialist provision for children with complex disabilities or severe mental health issues, or to establish some geographical distance to break patterns of risky behaviour (child sexual exploitation, offending behaviour, gangs and guns).\n \nThere is nothing to say that being local increases knowledge and intelligence about the quality of homes or the suitability of their location. \n \nDo we know if social work oversight is increased? Family work can be a task given successfully to the very skilled practitioners in this work in children’s homes. \n \nIt is not only social workers who can do this task. \n36.\n \nWe need a clear definition of Out Of Authority. \n \nCurrently it can mean round the corner or over the road.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Question – are we not at a point where we can say that children’s homes are offering a national service?&#xa0;We are now sharing a high-level needs service across the country.  This has happened without strategy.  If we now apply strategy to it, we might make better or even best use of this national service.&#xa0;It is not possible for any local authority to always meet all needs.  We should not be asking them to do so.&#xa0;&#xa0;Location37.\n \nGovernment figures show that areas with a current density of homes (North West, West Midlands, Kent) have always had more homes. \n \nThis arises out of their historical development. \n38.\n \nThe picture is changing. \n \nIt will change more quickly if the Government had a national strategy for residential child care. \n \nThere are no current DfE proposals for this. \n39.\n \nThe change is complicated by new demands by some local authorities for planning permission for children’s homes.\n \n A recent debate in Parliament recorded that such hurdles are not supported by legislation. \n40.\n \nFurther requirements, such as \nany bureaucracy surrounding \nsafe area checks, will slow the changes desired by Government.\n41.\n \nThere is no direct correlation between location of children's homes and level of deprivation. (page 38)\n42.\n \nThe title of page 39, ‘\nThere is a slight skew towards deprived areas in the location of the 1,718 homes by local levels of crime and disorder’ requires more context\n,\n as extracted from the source used by DfE The English Indices of Deprivation 2010\n:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6320/1870718.pdf\n43.\n \nThere is no data\n presented in the DfE data pack regarding the level of deprivation of local authorities and their use of homes. \n \nOpportunity to do so was possible here and in pages 22 – 41. \n \nThis could be an informative study. \nCosts44.\n \nThe costs reported in the DfE data pack are extrap\nolations from a \nlimited sample.\n45.\n \nThe most accurate costs were collated by the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care and Revolution Consulting\n,\n through an FOI to all local authorities. \n \nThese figures \nfrom 110 \nlocal authorities are the best information ever on this sector.\nPrivate and voluntary average cost per week is £2,841\nLocal \nauthority average cost per week\n is £2,490\n46.\n \nComparative costings of local authority and other homes\n,\n is not advisable.\n \n The two cohorts are not comparable, sizes and needs often diverge. \n \nThere is also a likely under\n-\ncosting of local authority homes.\n \n There is a need for a level playing field that can determine one method of calculating costs.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nKaniuk J, Steele M and Hodges J (2004) Report on a longitudinal research project exploring the development of attachments between older hard-to-place children and their adopters over the first two years of placement.
