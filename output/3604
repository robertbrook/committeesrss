[normal]We also refer the Committee to 
[normal]Baroness Hale at paragraph 23 of 
[normal]ZH (Tanzania) (FC) (Apellant) V[bold]Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4[bold] which 
[normal]states,  'This is a binding obligation 
[normal]in international law, and the spirit, if not the precise language, has also been translated into our 
[normal]national law.

[normal]'Of course, the judicial review system is an important way to right wrongs, but it is not a      promotional tool for countless Left-wing ca
[normal]mpaigners. So that is why we are publishing our       proposals for change. We will protect the parts of judicial review that are essential to justice,     but stop the abuse.
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal] Britain cannot afford to allow a culture of Left-wing-dominated, single-issu
[normal]e activism to hold 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal] back our country from investing in infrastructure and
[normal] new sources of energy and from
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]bringing
[normal] down the cost of our welfare state.
[normal]We need to make decisions quicker and respond to issues more quickly in what is a true
[normal] global race.
[normal] 
[normal]The Left does not understand this, and believes that our society can do everything for
[normal]  e
[normal]veryone,
[normal] a
[normal]nd that 
[normal]those who work hard to get on in life should pick up the tab.
[normal] 
[normal]They want more money for public services, but at the same time to be able to halt 
[normal]the investments which can deliver the wealth that pays for those services.
[normal]I
[normal]n proposing these changes, I will no doubt be accused of killing justice and destroying Magna
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Carta
[normal]. Although as the great old lady of British law is approaching her 800th birthd
[normal]ay, and the 
[normal] 
[normal]judicial review system is barely 40, I’m not sure that argument stacks up. But in proposing  these changes, I know we will be doing the right thing for Britain.' 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst the Lord Chancellor’s comments may have been in some part specific to ju
[normal]dicial reviews brought on environmental/plann
[normal]ing interests the NAYJ has
[normal] concern that he expresses his  views in political terms with a heavy regard towards economical value for money. Judicial review is not political and certainly not a left-win
[normal]g mechanism. It is a means of 
[normal]holding those who make and uphold the law to account
[normal] and ensure the correct and just decisions are made, not just speedy ones
[normal]. We sincerely hope that the
[normal] Lord Chancellor regrets these 
[normal] comments in light of our submissions in o
[normal]ur response on behalf of the need for access to justice  on behalf of Britain’s children.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]“There is no principle more basic 
[normal]to our system of law than the mai
[normal]ntenance of the rule of law itself and the constitutional protection afforded by judicial review”

[normal]“
[normal]The proceedings have been brought by The Howard League for Penal Reform whose history and credentials need no introduction. It undoubtedly 
[normal]is, as it claims to be, the leading non-governmental organisation in this country concerned with penal issues and policy. Here I need only to note that in the last decade or so it has had a particular focus on children and young people in the criminal just
[normal]ice system.

[normal]‘...judicial review provides a prompt and efficient remedy for many persons affected by government action in large numbers of cases, often of critical importance to them, which are conceded by public bodies at an early s
[normal]tage, and at little cost either to the public body or the legal aid fund. By ensuring that officials are accountable to the law, judicial review provides a powerful corrective to poor decision making, the importance of which goes well beyond the relatively
[normal] small number of cases which get near a court. We consider that the proposals in the Consultation Paper will undermine the accountability of public bodies to the detriment of society as a whole and the vulnerable in particular’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]     [bold] The NAYJ fully agrees with this view and believes it encapsulates the negative impact this will 
[normal]      have on access to justice and erosion of human rights.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Standing and third party interventions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]‘No application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and the court shall n
[normal]ot grant leave to make such an application unless it considers that the applicant has a sufficient interest
[normal] [bold]in the matter to which the application relates.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Given the serious nature of the issues raised concerning young and vulnerable individuals, it would seem strange that a reputable ch
[normal]arity such as the Claimant should not be entitled to come to court and raise the kind of issues raised.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The first stage test which is applied on application for leave [permission] will lead to a ref
[normal]usal if the applicant has no interest whatsoever and is in truth no more than a meddlesome busybody. If, however, the application appears to be otherwise arguable and there is no other discretionary bar, such as dilatoriness on the part of the applicant, t
[normal]he applicant may expect to get leave to apply leaving the test of interest or standing to be reapplied as a matter of discretion on the hearing of the substantive application. At the second stage the strength of the applicant’s interest is one of the facto
[normal]rs to be weighed in the balance.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In some contexts, it is appropriate to require an applicant for judicial review to demonstrate that he has a particular interest in the matter complained of: the type of interest which is relevant, and therefore required in order to have standing,
[normal] will depend upon the particular context. In other situations, such as where the excess or misuse of power affects the public generally, insistence upon a particular interest could prevent the matter being brought before court, and that in turn might disab
[normal]le the court from performing its function to protect the rule of law.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The claim itself is brought in the public interest with the benefit of public funding. It raises issues of real 
[normal]substance concerning the risk to transferees, and, although the claimant’s standing to bring it was at one time in issue, the point has not been pursued by the Secretary of State.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“It would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group … or even a single public-spirited taxpayer … were prevented 
[normal]by outdated technical rules [of 
[normal]standing] from bringing the matter to the attention of the court t
[normal]o vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawful conduct stopped.”

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘The superficially attractive reason is that it will inhibit the making of long-shot or speculative claims at public 
[normal]expense, but it is supported by no evidence, and the argument advanced in support of it – that the claimant’s lawyer “is in the best position to know the strength of their client’s case” – displays a depressing degree of ignorance about how judicial review
[normal] works. More often than not, it is the defendant authority which holds most of the relevant cards, and in many cases it holds on to them for longer than it is supposed to, either because there is too little time for proper disclosure of documents or becaus
[normal]e sitting tight affords the best hope that the claim will go away. The departmental calculation is that indigent claimants’ lawyers will be deterred from taking on all but sure-fire claims. In proposing that other claimants can be left to their own devices
[normal] without injustice, the paper makes no attempt to confront the consequences: a plethora of claims made by litigants in person, clogging up the courts as judges try to discern arguable points in the chaos of paper, and costing public authorities large sums 
[normal]in irrecoverable costs as they attempt to respond to such claims.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Cutting the cost of legal aid deprives the very people who most need the protection of the courts of the ability to get legal advice and representation. That is true whether one reduces the types of claim which qualify for legal aid or increases
[normal] the stringency of the requirements of eligibility for legal aid. The recent changes have done both. If a person with a potential claim cannot get legal aid, there are two possible consequences. The first is that the claim is dropped: that is a rank denial
[normal] of justice and a blot on the rule of law. The second is that the claim is pursued, in which case it will be pursued inefficiently, and will take up much more of the court staffs’ time and of the judge’s time in and out of court. So that it means greater c
[normal]osts for the court system, and delay for other litigants.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘(
[normal]i
[normal]) The cause of the delays complained of is largely historic, thanks to the very recent removal of asylum and immigration cases from the Administrative Court to the Upper Tribunal, which the 
[normal]judges proposed in 2009. (ii) Cutting down time limits for JR applications may actually increase the work, due to rushed applications and many more requests for extensions of time. (iii) The cost-cutting proposals risk deterring a significant number of val
[normal]id applications, and will save a pathetically small sum.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NAYJ endorses Lord Neuberger’s comments and would agree that these proposals are
[normal]likely to result in higher rather than lower costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]More immediately, the consultation paper has nothing to say about public authorities which play the judicial review system at public expense... It
[normal] would be straightforward to propose that a public body which unjustifiably resists the grant of permission in a viable case should pay the costs of doing so; but the consultation paper has nothing to say about this, or about penalising late disclosure, or
[normal] about other ways of saving public funds.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Arguably some of the successful reviews involving young people in the criminal justice system cited above were cases where the government’s opposition to the application was of this form.

[normal]       matter of course

[normal]“Legal representatives will, of course, whether barristers or solicitors, advice clients of the perceived weakness of their case and of the risk of failure. But clients are free to reject advice and insist that cases be litigated. It is rarely if ever safe
[normal] for a court to assume that a hopeless case is being litigated on the advice of the lawyers involved. They are there to present the case; it is (as Samuel Johnson unforgettably pointed out) for the judge and not the lawyers to judge it.” 
[normal]              
[normal]Given that, as 
[normal]noted previously, the legal issues involved in representing children are 
[normal]frequently more complex any increased threat of WCO might result in young people in trouble with the law finding it increasingly difficult to secure representation for judicial 
[normal]review.
