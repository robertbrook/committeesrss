default'Of course, the judicial review system is an important way to right wrongs, but it is not a      promotional tool for countless Left-wing ca
defaultmpaigners. So that is why we are publishing our       proposals for change. We will protect the parts of judicial review that are essential to justice,     but stop the abuse.

defaultI
defaultn proposing these changes, I will no doubt be accused of killing justice and destroying Magna

default. Although as the great old lady of British law is approaching her 800th birthd
defaultay, and the

defaultjudicial review system is barely 40, I’m not sure that argument stacks up. But in proposing  these changes, I know we will be doing the right thing for Britain.'

defaultWhilst the Lord Chancellor’s comments may have been in some part specific to ju
defaultdicial reviews brought on environmental/plann
defaulting interests the NAYJ has
default concern that he expresses his  views in political terms with a heavy regard towards economical value for money. Judicial review is not political and certainly not a left-win
defaultg mechanism. It is a means of 
defaultholding those who make and uphold the law to account
default and ensure the correct and just decisions are made, not just speedy ones
default. We sincerely hope that the
default Lord Chancellor regrets these 
default comments in light of our submissions in o
defaultur response on behalf of the need for access to justice  on behalf of Britain’s children.

default‘...judicial review provides a prompt and efficient remedy for many persons affected by government action in large numbers of cases, often of critical importance to them, which are conceded by public bodies at an early s
defaulttage, and at little cost either to the public body or the legal aid fund. By ensuring that officials are accountable to the law, judicial review provides a powerful corrective to poor decision making, the importance of which goes well beyond the relatively
default small number of cases which get near a court. We consider that the proposals in the Consultation Paper will undermine the accountability of public bodies to the detriment of society as a whole and the vulnerable in particular’
default.
default&#xa0;default     default The NAYJ fully agrees with this view and believes it encapsulates the negative impact this will 
default      have on access to justice and erosion of human rights.
default&#xa0;defaultStanding and third party interventionsdefault&#xa0;
default‘No application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and the court shall n
defaultot grant leave to make such an application unless it considers that the applicant has a sufficient interest
default defaultin the matter to which the application relates.’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“Given the serious nature of the issues raised concerning young and vulnerable individuals, it would seem strange that a reputable ch
defaultarity such as the Claimant should not be entitled to come to court and raise the kind of issues raised.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“The first stage test which is applied on application for leave [permission] will lead to a ref
defaultusal if the applicant has no interest whatsoever and is in truth no more than a meddlesome busybody. If, however, the application appears to be otherwise arguable and there is no other discretionary bar, such as dilatoriness on the part of the applicant, t
defaulthe applicant may expect to get leave to apply leaving the test of interest or standing to be reapplied as a matter of discretion on the hearing of the substantive application. At the second stage the strength of the applicant’s interest is one of the facto
defaultrs to be weighed in the balance.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn some contexts, it is appropriate to require an applicant for judicial review to demonstrate that he has a particular interest in the matter complained of: the type of interest which is relevant, and therefore required in order to have standing,
default will depend upon the particular context. In other situations, such as where the excess or misuse of power affects the public generally, insistence upon a particular interest could prevent the matter being brought before court, and that in turn might disab
defaultle the court from performing its function to protect the rule of law.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“The claim itself is brought in the public interest with the benefit of public funding. It raises issues of real 
defaultsubstance concerning the risk to transferees, and, although the claimant’s standing to bring it was at one time in issue, the point has not been pursued by the Secretary of State.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“It would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group … or even a single public-spirited taxpayer … were prevented 
defaultby outdated technical rules [of 
defaultstanding] from bringing the matter to the attention of the court t
defaulto vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawful conduct stopped.”

default‘The superficially attractive reason is that it will inhibit the making of long-shot or speculative claims at public 
defaultexpense, but it is supported by no evidence, and the argument advanced in support of it – that the claimant’s lawyer “is in the best position to know the strength of their client’s case” – displays a depressing degree of ignorance about how judicial review
default works. More often than not, it is the defendant authority which holds most of the relevant cards, and in many cases it holds on to them for longer than it is supposed to, either because there is too little time for proper disclosure of documents or becaus
defaulte sitting tight affords the best hope that the claim will go away. The departmental calculation is that indigent claimants’ lawyers will be deterred from taking on all but sure-fire claims. In proposing that other claimants can be left to their own devices
default without injustice, the paper makes no attempt to confront the consequences: a plethora of claims made by litigants in person, clogging up the courts as judges try to discern arguable points in the chaos of paper, and costing public authorities large sums 
defaultin irrecoverable costs as they attempt to respond to such claims.’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultCutting the cost of legal aid deprives the very people who most need the protection of the courts of the ability to get legal advice and representation. That is true whether one reduces the types of claim which qualify for legal aid or increases
default the stringency of the requirements of eligibility for legal aid. The recent changes have done both. If a person with a potential claim cannot get legal aid, there are two possible consequences. The first is that the claim is dropped: that is a rank denial
default of justice and a blot on the rule of law. The second is that the claim is pursued, in which case it will be pursued inefficiently, and will take up much more of the court staffs’ time and of the judge’s time in and out of court. So that it means greater c
defaultosts for the court system, and delay for other litigants.

default) The cause of the delays complained of is largely historic, thanks to the very recent removal of asylum and immigration cases from the Administrative Court to the Upper Tribunal, which the 
defaultjudges proposed in 2009. (ii) Cutting down time limits for JR applications may actually increase the work, due to rushed applications and many more requests for extensions of time. (iii) The cost-cutting proposals risk deterring a significant number of val
defaultid applications, and will save a pathetically small sum.’
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NAYJ endorses Lord Neuberger’s comments and would agree that these proposals are
defaultlikely to result in higher rather than lower costs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultMore immediately, the consultation paper has nothing to say about public authorities which play the judicial review system at public expense... It
default would be straightforward to propose that a public body which unjustifiably resists the grant of permission in a viable case should pay the costs of doing so; but the consultation paper has nothing to say about this, or about penalising late disclosure, or
default about other ways of saving public funds.

default“Legal representatives will, of course, whether barristers or solicitors, advice clients of the perceived weakness of their case and of the risk of failure. But clients are free to reject advice and insist that cases be litigated. It is rarely if ever safe
default for a court to assume that a hopeless case is being litigated on the advice of the lawyers involved. They are there to present the case; it is (as Samuel Johnson unforgettably pointed out) for the judge and not the lawyers to judge it.”
