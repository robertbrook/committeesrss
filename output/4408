defaultWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level defaultdecision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better modelsdefault?
defaultThe benefits of local decision-making include:
defaultThe disa
defaultdvantages include:
defaultBetter models:
default&#xa0;defaultDo local bodies (including local defaultauthorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look defaultlike?defaultThe capacity to deliver local transport schemes varies considerably from authority to authority.
defaultMost will struggle to deliver enough schemes at the higher levels of funding possible under the new local growth deals. Local authorities are being force
defaultd to reduce the size of their teams because of overall reductions in levels of funding in particular revenue.
defaultWe can increase capacity, but we need time and revenue funding to do this. We also need reassurance that any extra capacity we do acquire will not
default be wasted if the Government changes its mind about levels of funding. A successful approach would commit capital and revenue funding over a 15 to 20 year period which is the gestation period for the larger major schemes.
defaultThe optimum client delivery body w
defaultould have sufficient technical capacity to ensure value for money through feasibility and modelling.  It should be able to deliver transport improvements quickly and flexibly.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local defaultauthority boundaries or have wider regional impact?defaultThere are two methods:
defaultHow effectively do local bodies work with each other and with defaultgdefaultovernment departments and national transport agencies?defaultOn the whole, there are good working relationships between different local bodies. The biggest problem is the interface between 
defaultlocal and national. All too often, 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment introduces new initiatives and changes its approaches too quickly.
defaultDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compardefaulte with previous arrangements?defaultToo bureaucratic. We spent a long time creating local transport bodies only for these to be mostly superseded by growth deals. We don’t yet know how the new arrangements will work.
defaultThe old arrangements also had their problems including slow decision-making by 
defaultg
defaultovernment.
defaultIt did not make sense that the Hindhead 
defaultT
defaultunnel had to be funded from the old regional pot. It was much too expensive (£371 million) and strategically important to be
default suitable for regional funding. Should have been a national scheme.
defaultMost LEPs will struggle to get agreement to pool funds for worthy schemes above £100
default million 
defaultparticularly when local authorities find that other smaller improvements with benefits are esse
defaultntially shelved for many years.
defaultIn order to ensure delivery post 2015 LEPs should be advised to allocate revenue funding to promoters with approved programmed schemes to develop robust business cases.  
defaultWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding todefault Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?defaultA huge amount of extra work for everyone. A list of deliverable schemes needs to be developed following many years when limited funding was available for schemes development
default.
defaultHuge pressure on revenue budgets to develop the schemes at a time when 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaulta
defaultuthorities are facing budget pressures and staff cuts from an already low staff position.
defaultUnrealistic expectations from 
defaultg
defaultovernment about the amount of local contributions that 
defaultare possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?defaultThe challenge is to find a mecha
defaultnism which will give a financial return. The private sector will occasionally fund transport infrastructure that has a direct bearing on their business - eg 
defaultthe A3 
defaulthospital roundabout
default in Guildford
default. But it is a lot harder to attract funding for more general
default infrastructure - eg a strategic junction.
defaultAlternative funding streams such as section 106/ CIL are possible, but there are many calls on them (
defaultsuch as the 
defaultrising need for more school places).  
defaultHow clear are the lines of accountability for local decision defaultmaking on transport expenditure?defaultAt the moment, not very! We do not know how the new growth fund governance arrangements will work, or how they will relate to local transport bodies.
