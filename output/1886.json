"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by James Painter (CLC057)1. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism \n(RISJ) \nis part of the Department of Politics and International Relations at \nthe University of \nOxford.  It was established in \n2006. The \nRISJ \naims to serve as \na\n leading forum for a productive engagement between scholars from a wide range of disciplines and the practitioners of journalism.  It \naims to \nbring the depth of academic scholarship to major i\nssues of relevance to the practice of \nthe \nnews media. \n2. The \nRISJ\n regularly publishes reports and books on various issues affecting the media.  On the specific issue of climate change, it has published three recent works:  \nSummoned by Science: Reporting C\nlimate Change at Copenhagen and Beyond\n (2010); \nPoles Apart: the international reporting of climate scepticism \n(2011); and \nClimate Change in the Media:\n&#xa0;\nreporting\n&#xa0;\nrisk and uncertainty\n (forthcoming, September 2013).\n&#xa0;\n \n3. James Painter is the author of the abo\nve three publications.  In an individual capacity, he has als\no published extensively on the theme \nof climate change a\nnd the media, including a\n recent \nacademic article on the relative presence of climate scepticism in the UK print media compared to the \nmedia in five other countries.\n \n \nHe also teaches the \nMSc\n module on the media and the environment at the School of Geography, Oxford University.\n4. This submission focuses on the role that the UK media play in portraying climate change, the affect that this \nmay have on public understanding, and recommendations that may help journalists, scientists and government bodies improve the communication of climate science.\n5. The committee asks: Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?6.  Even though \nvarious\n surveys show different results about the \ntrends in the \nabsolute\n \nlevel of trust in cl\nimate scientists\n (for example, \nPoortinga\n et al., 2011 and \nShuckburgh\n et al., 2012)\n, \ntwo recent \nsurveys which focus on \ncomparative\n levels of trust in different sectors clearly indicate that climate scientists \nin the UK \nare significantly more trusted than ot\nher sectors such as politicians\n, environmental groups/charities or the media\n to talk about climate science\n (\nDonald, \n2013\n;\n \nShuckburgh\n et al., 2012). \n7.  In this context, it is worth pointing out that even though they are the most trusted group, scientists \nare often not the most vocal group to be heard in the media.  \nA\n RISJ 2010 study on the media coverage of the Copenhagen summit in December 2009 showed that when the climate science was being reported in newspaper articles, university scientists represented\n only 12% of those \nquoted on the science, compared to 11% for representative\ns\n of environment or development NGOs\n (Painter\n,\n 2010)\n.  This was despite the fact that around 2,000 members of delegations from 250 universities around the world were present\n at the summit\n, including 280 professors.\n8. Part of the explanation for this is that NGOs and governments had far more communication officers or media relations personnel at Copenhagen than universities. For example, Greenpeace alone had more media people\n there than all the universities put together (20 compared to 12). The I\nntergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (I\nPCC\n)\n ha\nd\n just one paid media officer\n at the time, although at the time of writing this has since been increased to two\n.\n9. \nThere is plenty of\n scope for \nclimate \nscientists from government departments, universities and other publicly funded bodies to receive more training in \neffective public engagement, including \nhow to deal with the \ndifferent types of \nmedia.  There \nare \nwell-run organisations off\nering excellent training (such as the Science Media Centre)\n.  B\nut it remains the case that often scientists are not good communicators with a wider audience beyond their peer group and/or are \n(understandably) \nreluctant to \nengage\n with the media through fear\n of misrepresentation\n, or being asked to comment beyond their area of expertise or engage in adversarial debate (amongst other factors)\n. \n More institutional recognition needs to be given to those scientists who do engage with the media, as it requires time\n, \nexperience, \ncommitment and skill.  \n10. The committee asks: How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Do the media have a positive role to play?11. To focus on the media coverage o\nf climate change, it is worth stressing that the degree to which media \ncoverage of any particular issue \naffect\ns\n or change\ns\n individual attitudes, understanding \nor behaviour change \nis a disputed area in academic circles. \nMany\n scholars argue that the media ma\ny only have a minor impact, when compared to other factors such as wider cultural, social or political values\n and the views of peer groups, family or friends\n.  However, there is much more agreement that the media have a huge role in setting the agenda for \nwhat people talk or think about, even if they have much less of a role\n \nin shaping their views.\n12. In the specific area of science coverage, most people in the UK get their information from the media\n, so the way the media report and frame climate change is\n \none\n significant input into \npublic understanding of the topic. \n13. It is also important to \npoint to the\n strong evidence that in their consumption of news, the UK public have markedly different levels of \ntrust in different media organis\nations and platforms.  In a 2013 report on the digital consumption of news, the RISJ found that despite the advance of new and social media \nsuch as blogs, \nF\nacebook\n and Twitter, the web sites of the UK broadcasters were by far the most trusted for news\n \nby 7\n9% of those surveyed\n (Newman and Levy, 2013\n).  These were followed by UK newspaper sites (60%), news-related blogs (11%), Twitter (10%) and \nFacebook\n (8%). \n14.  \nOf the UK broadcasters, the BBC’s coverage of science topics is recognised around the world for\n its high quality. Part of the reason for this is that t\nhe BBC \nfor the most part \ntakes considerable pains to follow its editorial guidelines of aiming for ‘due impartiality’ in reporting climate science, in other words asking its correspondents and reporte\nrs to reflect the mainstream consensus on climate science while not ruling out the presence of climate sceptics when \ntheir presence is \ndeemed to be appropriate (for example in discussing policy options of how to tackle climate change, rather than the scien\nce of climate change).\n15.  However, \nthere have been recent examples \nfrom\n some BBC \noutput\n such as the Daily Politics Show where the programme might have been better served by inviting climate scientists\n, rather than advocates,\n onto the programme.   In June\n 2012 for example, Friends of the Earth’s Andrew Pendleton was invited to debate with the well-known sceptic blogger, James \nDelingpole\n, the significance of the apparent slowdown in global temperature rises since 1998. Both invitees were not disinterested p\narties to the \ndebate \nor experts on the science\n.  I\nt would have been more appropriate to invite two climate scientists with differing views on the significance of the slowdown.\n16. \nA more pressing issue than the BBC’s coverage is the presence of climate sce\nptics (of different types) in \nthe \nUK \nprint media, and in particular the right-leaning tabloid press. \n  The RISJ 2011 study \n(Painter, 2011) \nof 5,000 articles in six countries in 2007 and 2009/10 showed that the UK’s press is similar to that of the USA in gi\nving much more space to sceptical views than in the other four countries examined (Brazil, China, France and India).  \nTogether the UK and the USA represented more than 80% of the times sceptical voices were quoted across all six countries.  \n17. Other \nkey \nfindings of this study relevant to the \nselect \ncommittee’s questions are:\n18. \nThe second period under examination (2009-10) was a time when a \nsignificant\n amount of media inclusion of climate sceptic voices could have been expected as it covered the time of \n‘\nClimategate\n’\n \n(when scientists at the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia in the UK were accused of manipulating results and keeping critics out of science publications) \nand the questioning of some aspects of the 2007 IPCC reports.  \nHowever, f\nurther \nexamination of articles on climate change in the UK press from a later period (2010-11) suggests that the presence of sceptic voices remain\ned\n high at about one in five of all articles, despite a marked drop in the \ntotal \nnumber of articles covering the topi\nc\n (Painter and Gavin, unpublished 2013)\n.\n19. \nThere are several reasons why it is important to reflect on the high presence of climate sceptic voices in the UK print media, and particularly the opinion pages.  The first is that much of the uncontested scept\nic opinion is written by in-house columnists and not climate scientists.  Th\nis could give the impression to a general audience that climate science is \na matter of opinion or merely\n ‘a point of view’, in the same way as many political issues are, without gi\nving the readers a sense of what most climate scientists \nsay is the case about rising temperatures and the \ncauses of \nthem\n.\n20. \nA second important aspect to consider is the effect on readers of the promulgation of uncertainty, and in particular the view oft\nen put forward by sceptics that there is significant disagreement amongst scientists.  There is evidence from a recent study carried out with focus groups in the UK that many people believe that there is a lack of consensus in scientific opinion, partly be\ncause this is frequently \nthe way climate science is presented in the media.  The participants thought that scientists are often in disagreement with each other or change their mind over time\n (\nShuckburgh\n et al, 2012)\n.  \n21.  Moreover, research carried out b\ny communicat\nions scholars in the USA sugges\nt\ns\n that uncertainty generated - deliberately or not - in peoples’ minds about the level of agreement amongst scientists can make a big difference for engagement.  P\neople\n who (wrongly) believe that scientists disag\nree on global warming tend to feel less certain that global warming is occurring, and show less support for climate policy\n (Ding Ding et al., 2011)\n.  \nLikewise, \nthe lead author of the \nresearch done by the Glasgow Media Group found that \ni\nn \ntheir focus \ngroups\n in the UK\n, \n‘\nthe uncertainty of the science left the evidence open to interpret\nation by a range of experts.\n&#xa0;\n \nParticipants said they were very reliant on these interpretations due to the complexity of the subject, and yet found it difficult to place faith i\nn any of them – hence stalemate, and disengagement.\n’ \n(Catherine Happer quoted in Painter, 2013) \n22. \nA 2013 study by the RISJ \n(Painter, 2013) \nsuggests that risk language can in certain circumstances and with certain groups be a more helpful of talking abou\nt climate change than uncertainty\n, and particularly for policy makers\n.  It is certainly the language now being used by a wide variety of politicians and scientific reports on climate change. \n23. Part of the \nchallenge\n is that scientific uncertainty is ofte\nn misunderstood, particularly by the general public, and misinterpreted as ignorance.  For example, many people fail to recognise the distinction between ‘school science’, which \nis \na\n source of solid facts and reliable understanding\n, and ‘research science’ \nwhere uncertainty is engrained and is often the impetus for further investigation. Risk on the other hand is an essential part of everyday experience, including the worlds of insurance, health and investment.   \n23.  \nThe RISJ\n \n2013 \nstudy, which looked at mo\nre than 300 articles \non climate change \nin the print media in six countries, found that the media on the whole overwhelmingly use a narrative of ‘disasters’ and ‘uncertainty’, when reporting climate change. \nThe language of risk (and of opportunity) was much\n less prevalent.  \nStudies show that d\nisaster and uncertainty frames – at least in their more extreme forms - are not usually seen as enhancing public understanding, engagement or behaviour change\n (Moser and \nDilling\n 2004, O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2010)\n. \n \n24. \nRecommendationsMore research \nis needed \ninto the effect of certain messages\n about climate change\n in the media and elsewhere on public understanding, e\nngagement and behaviour change. It is often wrongly assumed that simply giving the public more infor\nmation about climate science will promote ‘better’ engagement, when most communication theory suggests that most people filter information about climate science through their cultural values.  Dialogue and discussion are \noften \nmore effective than top-down \ninformation. \nScientific uncertainty about climate change (for example, the timing, severity and location of \nfuture \nimpact\ns\n) is particularly difficult to convey without confusing the public. More work need\ns\n to be done on \ntesting \nwhat sort of messages \nand l\nanguage \nmight help\n with what sectors of society\n, and whether risk is a more productive language.\nIn the specific area of risk and uncertainty communication, for the media, \nFor scientists,\nIn genera\nl, \n&#xa0;\nReferencesDonald, \nRos\n, ‘Polling reveals public trust scientists most on climate’, \nCarbon Brief\n, 2 April 2013. \nDing \nDing\n et al, ‘Support for climate policy and societal action are linked to perceptions about scientific agreement’, \nLetter to Nature\n, December 2011. \nGlasgow Media Group, \n‘\nClimate Change and Energy Security: Assessing the Impact of Information and its \nDelivery on Attitudes and Behaviour’, \nUK Energy Research Centre\n, London 2012\n.\nMoser, S\nusanne\n and \nDilling\n, L (2004), ‘Making climate hot; communicating the urgency and challenge of global climate change’, \nEnvironment\n, 46, pp. 32-46.\n \n&#xa0;\nNewman Nic and Levy D., \nDigital News Report\n 2013\n, RISJ, Oxford 2013.\nO’Neill, S\naffron\n and Nicholson-Cole, S.
