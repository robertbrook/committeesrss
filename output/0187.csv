Written evidence submiited by Prospect (FSS006)&#xa0;
Introduction 1. Prospect is a trade union representing 120,000 professionals, managers and specialists across all sectors of the economy. We represent 50,000 professional scientists and engineers in the UK. These included more than 1,000 employed by the Forensic Science Service (FSS). At the time of the Select Committee’s initial inquiry we expressed considerable concerns about the merits of the decision to wind-down the FSS and the impact that it may have on the criminal justice system and forensic science in the UK. 
&#xa0;
2. 
Prospect therefore strongly welcomes the Select Committee’s decision to investigate the aftermath of the closure decision.
 To inform our submission we have consulted with our members who we
re made redundant from the FSS.
 Their comments do not make for happy reading: In summary ‘We were world leaders in forensic science, something this country and our Prime 
M
inister should have been proud of. Now we have a forensic archive that costs the taxpayer just as much to fund as having the FSS. The FSS was starting to make a small profit as closure loomed but the full effect of our transformation project was never given time to prove itself’. 
&#xa0;
3. 
39% of 
our members who provided feedback for this inquiry 
are still working in forensic science, though this may be an over-estimation of continued forensic employment since these are the members most motivated to stay in contact with Prospect. Other anecdotal evidence suggests around 10% of FSS staff have been employed by private forensic providers. 
Just one third of those located in London or Birmingham have managed to find alternative employment of any kind on a permanent basis. 
As one member commented ‘It is the minority of FSS staff who have continued in forensics. The majority have vast amounts of expertise which is simply lying dormant as they remain unemployed or have moved to other fields’. 
More than one member perceives that they have been ‘kicked out’ of their forensic science career only to ‘end up in an unskilled, low paid job with no prospects’. Some of those who have managed to stay in forensic science are paying a very high personal price to do so: ‘I am now travelling more than 120 miles a day … to a private forensic company’. 
O
thers 
have 
express
ed
 concern
 and frustration stemming from the
 insecurity of employment in the private forensic sector, with a number facing redundancy for a second time. 
&#xa0;
4. Our responses to the questions posed by the Select Committee are set out below. 
&#xa0;
Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?5. 
As suggested by the international shock and dismay at the decision to close, the FSS was previously the only UK organisation that featured in the survey of Top 25 institutions (2001-2011) both for citations and impact 
http://archive.sciencewatch.com/ana/fea/11julaugFea/
 
spending significant amounts (2009-10 £4.11m, 2010-2011 £3.3.m) on R&amp;D annually.  This spending 
has
 of course ceased and we are concerned that the UK has lost its position in this scientific sector.
 This certainly seems to be the case in relation to forensic science developments elsewhere in Europe. For example there is now a European Standard Set for DNA profiling. The FSS was ready to use this system but it would have required a significant upgrade to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) software to allow profiles to be loaded. There is no sign of current FSPs moving to the ESS or of funding for the NDNAD to move forward to facilitate this. 
&#xa0;
6. We understand that
 other providers
 (FSPs)
 continue to undertake their own R&amp;D
, but believe that this merits further investigation. F
airly broad statements 
were 
made to the Select Committee
’s previous inquiry
 about the amount of spending and number of research projects being undertaken by 
FSPs, but this information needs to be updated in the light of experience
. The Silverman Review (June 2011) 
http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/fsr/forensic-science-review/forensic-science-review-report?view=Binary
 
suggested that consideration 
be
 given to establishing forensic science as a strategic priority for Research Councils and proposed that the Home Office faci
litated an exploration of this. In our view the Select Committee should examine whether this has actually taken place. It would also be useful to explore
 what applied research is being undertaken currently
 as this
 is of key importance in assessing the direct and immedi
ate impact of R&amp;D to the CJS. 
&#xa0;
7. Prospect further recommends that the Select 
C
ommittee revisits
 
the
 restrictions to market that discourage
s
 investment and
, conversely,
 what competitive advantage there is for investment in this sector
. We
 remain
 concerned that in a
 fragile market 
there is no
 
perceived 
commercial value of developing technologies beyond the business cycle of tendering for short-term contracts, predominantly with police forces as the major customers. 
&#xa0;
8. In summary this information should provide the evidence to assess whether the closure of the FSS precipitated 
a significant overall drop in UK spending on forensic science R&amp;D and
, if so,
 in which areas that reduction has been most acute.
&#xa0;
Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?9. 
Less than half of our members report that the transition and closure ran smoothly.  We received views from members formerly employed at all the main FSS locations: London, Birmingham, Chorley, Huntingdon, Chepstow, Wetherby and Manchester. Experiences of the transfer of work were particularly problematic in London. Overall four out of ten members consider that communications were poor, with some unfair treatment of staff.   
&#xa0;
10. 
There appears to have been prolonged uncertainty among staff about whether they would be transferred to another provider or made redundant. 
These concerns are explored in more detail in paragraphs 
18 
to 
20
 below. 
Even where staff were transferred, there are concerns that their full skills are not being utilised. For example, members report that the homicide staff transferred to the Metropolitan Police 
Service 
no longer
 use their DNA interpretation skills or their case assessment and interpretation skills. A year after transfer many of them are still not back to reporting cases or are doing so in a very limited capacity. Other homicide staff in the sexually motivate crimes unit were initially included in this transfer but this decision was reversed and they were subsequently made redundant.  
&#xa0;
11. 
Feedback we have received from members indicates that 
FSPs
 were most interest in taking on FSS staff either with skills that are expensive to train or those that were recently qualified with little or no reporting experience. Conversely, there was little interest in recruiting the most experienced (and therefore higher paid) scientists. Consequently at least one generation of reporting scientists has been lost. Specifically, our members highlight a loss of experience in marks and traces work – including shoe
 
marks, gunshot residue
s
, 
DN
A
, 
fibres
 and toxicology. 
&#xa0;
12. 
It is perhaps important to distinguish between a smooth closure, in the sense of winding up the assets of the organisation, and ensuring a smooth legacy – both in terms of physical and intellectual capital. Much emphasis has been placed on the custody of the F
S
S archive, and rightly so, but this does not account for the many databases collected over the years, such as the 10,000 record Chorley analytical glass database, which have been lost to the forensic community. Neither does it account for the large scale loss of specialist equipment sold at auction, including the robotics platforms that had been in operation in London for barely one year. 
It is also worth noting that there was a wealth of intellectual property sold by the FSS – DNA Boost, Kwikmix (DNA mixture statistics software), DNA Insight. All of these were validated and used by the FSS before closure, but none are currently being used. 
&#xa0;What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)13. 
We believe that questions need to be asked about quality of work currently being undertaken in comparison with
 that produced by the FSS, and that
 an honest appraisal 
by 
police forces 
would be most instructive. Specific issues that should be explored include whether 
work 
has 
been further sub-contracted from FSPs lacking 
in 
capacity
 
and 
the
 possible 
implications for
 contamination
. Another issue arises from the disparity in quality standards required from police labs and FSPs
. 
Our understanding is that 
experienced staff working for defendants are succeeding in getting cases dropped before they reach court on the basis of challenges to the quality of work undertaken. 
&#xa0;
14. 
We understand that CAST (Centre for Applied and Science and Technology)
,
 
part of Home Office Science, 
advertised to set up a Forensic DNA Expert Community to support its ‘growing capacity’.  We would be interested to know what the take up on this has been given the reductions in professionals working in the field 
http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science/cast/forensic-dna-expert-community?view=Binary
&#xa0;
15. 
Finally, while the FSS was declining in number of employees, particularly with the closure of the Chepstow, Chorley and one of the Birmingham sites, we believe that other providers and agencies benefited extensively 
prior to and immediately after the closure 
from being able to draw upon skilled and experienced scientists who had had the opportunity to develop their expertise at the FSS
. 
While this pool of available specialists may have been increased greatly at the time of closure, we 
remain
 concern
ed
 that overall capacity has 
since 
been lost to the sector
. 
We also remain concerned about the 
d
