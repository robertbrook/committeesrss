"&#xa0;\n              Written evidence submitted by the UK Environmental Law Association (ESG 38) Summary&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nOverview of the SituationFor example\n,\n on 12 August 2013, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, stated \nin the Telegraph\n newspaper\n \nthat he thought fracking should receive public support\n.\n  \nFurthe\nrmore, HM Treasury in its report \nInvesting on Britain’s Future \n(Command 8669,June 2013) indicated that \nshale gas exploitation is important in relation to Britain’s future pro\ns\nperity and that the Government is likely to support the process, partly through \na\n target of \nthe Environment Agency being able to issue permits by February 2014 within 1-2 weeks of receipt. \nThe Legal and Regulatory Processes(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nadequacy \nof the current legal regime.\nFracking is a controversial \nprocess\n as far as the general public is concerned\n.  Consequently,\n \nsimpler, more streamlined \nand overt \nregulation could provide the public with the reassurances it needs and thus be welcomed by industry.  \nThere is no overall control of the process as a variety of public sector organisations\n and regulators\n are involved and/or consulted at various stages. \nThe\n regulatory process in Wales is complex, partly due to the fact that development of major energy projects is not a devolved function\n.  As a result,\n licenses for\n the \n exploration and development (Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences – PEDLs) of sh\nale gas resources are granted by the UK Government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).  \nThere are numerous pieces of legislation and regulation relevant to obtaining overall permission to explore and exploit shale gas resources\n.  These \ncover \ntown and country planning; water resources; environmental permitting; hazardous waste; design and construction of wells; operation of borehole sites; dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres; use of works equipment; and mineral mining. \n \nApart from ob\ntaining \nPEDLs \nfrom DECC for testing for \nand extraction of methane gas from shale rock, p\nlanning permission has to be granted by local planning authorities\n.\n  Natural Resources Wales and the Health and Safety Executive are \nalso \nconsulted\n,\n \nnotified \nand involv\ned \nduring the processes.  The former is concerned with pollution control\n and\n is served notices of the proposed development\n, determines\n and issues abstraction licences and discharge \nconsents\n (and possibly flare emission permits)\n, whilst the latter has to agree the drilling activity.  \nThe agreement of \nboth \nlandowners on the site concerned \nand\n adjacent landowners has to be obtained and, i\nf coal seams a\nre affected, which is the case in\n many potential areas of Wales, the Coal Authori\nty will \nneed to \nbe \nconsulted.\n  \nThis complex\n, multi-layered\n \nagency process\n \ninvolves \na number of risks, such as the potential for communication failures; the loss of opportunity to develop wide expertise \nin\n fracking, and its environmental and other impacts; \nthe lengthy and complex \ndecision making \nprocess acting as a barrier to industry development\n; and confusion amongst the public \nabout\n where responsibility lies and how they can engage with the process of granting approvals and permissions.  \nA\nlthough the UK p\nrocess is more robust than that in the US, there are concerns about whether it is \nfit for purpose and sufficiently \nrobust \nto ensure environmental \nand community \nimpacts are minimised\n.\n \n   \n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nresourcing \nof the regulators and the trans\nparency of the approval\n process\nThe adequate resourcing of NRW\n,\n as the lead regulator \nin Wales, \nin terms of manpower and the necessary expertise\n,\n will be essential \nin providing potential developers with the confidence to explore and possibly exploit resources in Wales.\n  \nRegulation is only as good as the resources available for\n setting appropriate permitting conditions and ensuring their subsequent\n enforcement.  \nIt is, therefore, important that \nNRW regulatory staff \npossess \nthe necessary background experience to manage the processes of \nfracking \neffectively\n.  \nFor the reasons given\n \nabove, the fact that the process\nes\n \nfor \ngranting permission\ns\n for exploration and extraction \nof shale gas \nare so complex \n(\ninvolv\ning\n the application o\nf a number of \nregulatory regimes)\n poses significant obstacles to the development and regulation of this sector\n,\n and presents \ndifficulties for the public in terms of hav\ning\n a clear\n and \njoined up understanding of the overall process. \n   \nConclusion12.\nT\nhe\n technology is evolving and major energy companies, such as Centrica, are now investing in this area. \n \nExploitation of shale gas seems to have the potential benefit of bring\ning greater security of energy supplies\n,\n although there is no definitive assessment of the extent of exploitable shale gas reserves in Wales. \n \nM\nore research is needed\n, therefore,\n and the regulators need to keep up to date with developments\n,\n as well as playing a\nn \nactive role with the industry, policy developers and the research community\n.\n13.  T\nhe \nexploitation of \nshale gas \nmay have \nthe capacity to\n contribute to the Welsh economy\n, but t\nhere is still a considerable amount of technical, politica\nl, economic\n, regulatory\n and environmental work to be done before it can be relied upon as an economically viable energy source \nthat\n can be \nexploit\ned\n in a sustainable way.\n  In particular\n,\n \nthe legal processes \nthat apply to \nthe process of \nfracking need to be \nconsolidated\n and simplified.  The current system i\ns\n complex requiring permissions and consents from a number of different \nregulatory \nbodies\n.  \nAccordingly, it is essential that regulators have adequate resources to maintain and develop expertise in, and exp\nerience of, managing the risks to the public and the environment that arise from exploration and exploitation of Wales’s shale gas reserves. \n1\n9\n December 2013\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
