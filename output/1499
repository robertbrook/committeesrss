defaultExecutive defaultSummarydefaultThis paper has been prepared by a team of academics bas
defaulted at the University of Ulster 
defaultcurrently involved in a research project examining the property market bubble in Northern Ireland. A primary objective of the research is to examine the structure
default of the decision making processes adopted by banks in Northern Ireland in regard to lending.
default 
defaultThis submission describes a number of findings of relevance here, identified as part of the overall study:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe general structure of the banking system in Norther
defaultn Ireland, with the mixture of domestic and international banks in the current climate
default,
default can be viewed as advantageous from a consumer viewpoint.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe structure of decision making in regard to lending has become more 
defaultcentralised
default post crisis. 
defaultCentralised
default deci
defaultsion making increases the quality, standard and consistency of decision making in regard to lending decisions. It can however, also be problematic due to less negotiation at the local level, a lack of local knowledge and understanding and the lower speed a
defaultt which decisions are often reached. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLending policy post 2007 has become more stringent which impacts on the ability of firms and individuals to access finance.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are consequences for the ownership structure of banks in Northern Ireland, including a l
defaultack of control over the 
defaultbehaviour
default of these institutions. This area warrants further research. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is not only the sale of assets by NAMA that may be impacting on Northern Ireland property values. Other financial institutions are affecting recovery through 
defaulttheir asset disposal strategies also.
defaultThe submission also makes a number of suggestions in relation to the issues raised by the inquiry:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImmediate clarity over the
default defaultfuture of Ulster Bank and NAMA is necessary to aid the recovery process.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsider the potential role for NISRA in producing regional lending statistics for Northern Ireland in order to increase transparency and allow for a clearer understanding of the nature and scale of the problem in Northern Ireland. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther analysis into t
defaulthe regulatory implications of the varying ownership structures adopted by the banks operating in Northern Ireland would enable a better understanding of the impact of the structure on Northern Ireland.
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe implication of recent changes to the branch networ
defaultk in Northern Ireland is that new delivery channels may be necessary. Substitutes to the rural branch network include extending the services currently provided through the Post Office, increase the services that Credit Unions are permitted to engage in and
default the implementation of off-site banking kiosks. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEncourage further education initiatives and awareness raising activities surrounding the use of online and mobile banking facilities. 
defaultIntroduction and Backgrounddefault1.default This submission is based on the experiences of a team of academics based in Northern Ireland. They are members of the Ulster Business School's Department of Business &amp; Enterprise, University of Ulster. The response is based on 
defaultdata collected as part of an
default on-
defaultgoing doctoral research study into Northern Ireland’s property market. The aim of the study is to explore the causes and consequences of the recent property market bubble in Northern Ireland. 
default2. defaultOne aspect of the study involved examining the banking s
defaultector in Northern Ireland. In particular, evidence was gathered regarding the structure of the decision making processes adopted by the banks in Northern Ireland in relation to lending, in particular mortgage lending. Data was gathered on the changes in th
defaulte operations and policies of banks in Northern Ireland in recent years. To achieve this, semi structured interviews were conducted with a range of key stakeholders in the study, including banks and property developers. This was complemented by secondary 
defaultco
defaultntent
default analysis
default.
default 
default3.default Five banks that currently operate in Northern Ireland have participated in the study and findings have been triangulated within each participant organisation.
default 
defaultFor competitive reasons the identity of these organisations has been 
defaultanonymi
defaultsed
default.
default4. defaultThe main reason for submitting a response is because the primary evidence gathered as part of this study contributes to the debate and the inquiry into the banking structure in Northern Ireland.
defaultQuestions and ResponsesdefaultThe structure defaultand governance of banks in Northern IrelanddefaultIs there a difference in the structure of banks in Northern Ireland, compared to their structure in Great Britain?default5.default The following provides a brief summary of the structure of the banking sector in Northern Irel
defaultand. The main banks in Northern Ireland often referred to as the ‘Big Four’
default are structured as follows:
defaultUlster Bank:
default Ulster Bank Limited part of the Ulster Bank Group is a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group headquartered in Edinburgh. 
defaultBank of I
defaultreland:
default Bank of Ireland (UK) 
defaultplc.,
default is a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland Group incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. The Irish government currently hold a minority stake in the Bank of Ireland Group. 
defaultFirst Trust:
default In Northern Ireland, the bank trades a
defaults First Trust Bank of the AIB Group (UK) 
defaultplc.,
default which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks plc.,
default 
defaultand is incorporated in Northern Ireland. Allied Irish Bank 
defaultplc.,
default is headquartered in Dublin. Currently, the Irish government hold a majority stak
defaulte in the bank.
defaultDanske
default Bank:
default 
defaultDanske
default Bank is a trading name of Northern Bank Limited. Northern Bank Limited is a member of the 
defaultDanske
default Bank Group which is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.
default6. defaultThe Big Four, two of which are Irish owned and two of which are internationally owned, have traditionally played the largest role in the market. However, the banking sector in Northern Ireland has undergone significant change in recent years. Some of the n
defaultewer international entrants to the market include HSBC Bank 
defaultplc.,
default Barclays Bank plc., both headquartered in London; Santander UK plc., a wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group, headquartered in Spain; and Halifax plc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Llo
defaultyds Banking Group headquartered in London. 
default7. defaultThe following describes the structure of the mortgage lending processes adopted by banks operating in Northern Ireland. Traditionally, banks in Northern Ireland operated under a decentralised model whereby, b
defaultranch managers had local discretions of varying amounts that enabled them to make loans up to a certain value so long as they complied with head office credit policy. With recent technological advancement, the study investigated the impact of these develop
defaultments on the mortgage decision making process. 
default8. defaultOur findings suggest that three of the banks that participated in the study have adopted a centralised mortgage lending process whereby all mortgages are reviewed and sanctioned from one central location.
default For these banks in the sample, the location of their centralised credit functions is also either Belfast or England. In the case of one of the banks, this model was adopted over a decade ago but for the others this change had occurred more recently and in
default the majority of cases was implemented after the crisis of 2007. Prior to 2007, each of these banks operated under a decentralised model.
default9. defaultThe findings of the study also indicate that currently two of the international banks that participated in the stu
defaultdy operate under a mixed model of centralisation and decentralisation. These banks have always operated under such a structure and currently have no plans to change the model. Under this approach, certain products are reviewed centrally but in general mort
defaultgages continue to be assessed under a decentralised model with branch managers retaining local discretion.
default 
defaultFor these banks, the location of their centralised credit functions is either Belfast or England.
default10. defaultThe level of IT that is used within the proc
defaultess varies among all the banks. One of the banks has implemented an automated and largely standardised system whereas others have adopted systems of a more bespoke nature. Regardless of the model adopted however, there is still scope for internal change an
defaultd there is still a large element of judgement based evaluation of applications. 
default&#xa0;defaultIs there any disadvantage for customers, both private and business, in NI as a result?default11. defaultIn terms of the general structure of the banking system in Northern Ireland, the mi
defaultxture of domestic and international banks in the current climate can be viewed as advantageous. Non-Irish banks with wider access to funding from their overall group and parent banks may be more willing to lend. In addition, consumers have access to more p
defaultroduct choice and may enjoy more favourable rates. 
default12. defaultSpecifically in regard to the mortgage lending process, preliminary findings indicate that centralised decision making has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages include less negotiatio
defaultn at the local level, a lack of local knowledge and in some instances understanding of the market and decision making is often slower. There are also often wider economic implications in terms of the reduced number of branches and staff required to operate
default in the area.
default 
defaultHowever, the centralised model also offers a number of advantages. These include the ability to achieve economies of scale and thereby reduce costs. In addition, the specialisation of knowledge that is associated with centralisation raises q
defaultuality and standards and is seen to result in independent and consistent decision making. 
defaultDo banks that operate in both GB and NI, e.g. Barclays and Santander, operate differently in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK? Does this result in customdefaulters in NI being at a disadvantage compared to customers in GB?default13. defaultNo comment. The study examined Northern Ireland only. 
defaultWhat are the consequences for customers in NI of banks and bank debts being owned by non-UK banks?default14. defaultThere are implications due to 
defaultthe lack of control over the behaviour of these institutions, particularly in relation to their asset disposal strategy (see below for further details). There are also regulatory implications. 
defaultWhat role does the Republic of Ireland play in NI banking?default15default. defaultAs outlined above, officially the Republic of Ireland plays a relatively small role in Northern Ireland banking. Although some of the institutions operating in Northern Ireland, are foreign owned, in theory they operate under the UK regulatory framework.
default However, there may be an impact in terms of the different cultural and operating environments of the parent banks headquartered in other jurisdictions. As subsidiaries, the conditions imposed on some of the banks as a result of state support, specifically
default those incorporated in the Republic of Ireland could also lead to restrictions on their activities in Northern Ireland.
default 
defaultWhat effect does the sale of bank assets by NAMA have on NI property values?default16. defaultAll property developers and banks that participated
default in the study were questioned on the perceived impact of NAMA on the Northern Ireland market.
default 
defaultThere was a general feeling among respondents that the sale of bank assets by NAMA has created a negative perception in the market place which may be hindering r
defaultecovery. While some respondents initially regarded the concept of NAMA as a positive move, the actual performance of NAMA in relation to the disposal of assets situated in Northern Ireland, was repeatedly questioned. The issue of whether NAMA is ‘drip feed
defaulting’ the market was also raised. Respondents felt that there was an incentive for potential buyers to delay purchasing, as NAMA still holds a substantial proportion of assets in the market that must be disposed of within its limited lifespan.
default17. defaultOther respondents, mainly property developers, commended NAMA for its long term view towards asset disposal unlike other institutions. One interviewee commented on how NAMA was the ‘best place to be’ at present. However, concerns were raised over the futur
defaulte strategy of NAMA as it was felt that to date, they had disposed of ‘all the low hanging fruit’ in order to achieve targets. In general, the lack of transparency over NAMA's activities and future strategy has created a feeling of insecurity among those in
defaultvolved with the organisation.
default 
default18. defaultThe behaviour of financial institutions with large property debt exposures, other than NAMA, was also raised. Thus, it is not only the sale of assets by NAMA that is impacting on Northern Ireland property values. There 
defaultwas a general feeling among those involved with Ulster Bank that it has been more aggressive in attempting to recoup losses. The uncertainty over Ulster Banks future was also highlighted as a source of constant concern and confusion for respondents.
defaultThe pdefaultossible break up of RBS/Ulster bankdefaultIt has been reported that HM Treasury are considering trying to persuade the Irish Government to take control of Ulster bank. This would involve removing Ulster Bank from the RBS group and swapping all or part, of the badefaultnk for the British loans and investments currently owned by NAMA. What would be the implications of such a move for NI? default19. defaultWhile this was outside the parameters of the current study, we wish to make the following comments:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt present the general feeling 
defaultof uncertainty surrounding the future of Ulster Bank and NAMA is impacting on Northern Ireland’s recovery. 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithout further information, it is difficult to ascertain the benefits of such a move for NAMA and the impact on the Republic of Ireland.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultfor Northern Ireland, the move would bring back control of assets currently owned by NAMA which would have implications for Northern Ireland’s recovery. 
defaultThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution CorporationdefaultDue to legislation introducdefaulted in the republic of Ireland, those people formerly employed in Dublin by IBRC, the successor of Anglo-Irish bank would be able to transfer to Capita, whereas those involved in Belfast had no such rights, and had been made redundant.default20. defaultNo comment
defaultAccesdefaults to finance, particularly for SMEsdefaultHistorically, finance for start-ups and expansions have been largely provided through Government agencies- i.e. defaultInvestdefault NI and its various predecessors- with the result that bank finance traditionally played a lesser roledefault in NI than in GB. Have NI banks continued to play a lesser role in commercial finance than elsewhere- in particular, have economic and financial conditions since 2008 exacerbated that position? default21. defaultPrevious reports have indicated that this has traditiona
defaultlly been the case in Northern Ireland. The issue of whether banks continue to play a lesser role in commercial finance since 2008 is a complex one. Although outside the scope of our main study, some evidence suggests SMEs have faced difficulties in accessi
defaultng finance post 2008.
default 
defaultOn one hand, banks have adopted a more conservative stance and lending policy has become more stringent, while on the other, as the EAG (2013) report finds that demand has remained subdued in recent years. It is probable that a combi
defaultnation of these factors have impacted on the ability of SMEs to access commercial finance. 
default22. defaultOur findings suggest some SMEs operating in Northern Ireland, invested in commercial and ‘buy to let’ properties prior to 2007, financed mainly through overdra
defaultft facilities and bridging loans. This is consistent with the findings of the EAG (2013) survey which suggests that around one fifth of medium sized enterprises in Northern Ireland purchased property since 2005. However, and as noted below further transpar
defaultency in regard to the level and the nature of exposure is necessary to examine what measures could potentially be taken to resolve the issue and ensure that SMEs are able to access the finance necessary to sustain their primary operations.
defaultIf so, what impdefaultact does the problem have on (a) business, (b) Government and (c) economic growth/ rebalancing the economy and what measures might be taken to tackle it? default23. defaultNo comment
defaultLack of availability of detailed regional lending datadefaultThe lack of available data defaultmeans that it is difficult to properly assess the impact of the reduced availability of credit in NI, and also means that there is not sufficient visibility about whether banks are reaching their agreed lending targets.default24. defaultThe lack of availability of regi
defaultonal lending data in Northern Ireland is an issue. Currently, the main source of lending data at the regional level for Northern Ireland is published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders but it is limited in nature to those who are not members or associates 
defaultof the organisation. The potential role for NISRA in producing regional lending statistics for Northern Ireland should be considered in order to increase transparency and allow for a clearer understanding of the nature and scale of the problem in Northern 
defaultIreland. 
default25. defaultWhile property prices can be used as a proxy for lending, there are also issues with the regional data in this regard for Northern Ireland. And while much progress has been made by LPS/NISRA in recent years to resolve these, the index commen
defaultces from the 1
defaultst
default of January 2005 and as such any long term analysis is restricted. 
defaultHow defaultis ‘new’ lendingdefault recorded? How much ‘new’ lending recorded is actually made up of extensions or additions to existing loans; and what are banks actually doing compareddefault to what they are advertising?default26. defaultNo comment
default&#xa0;defaultThe lack of effectiveness of national initiatives to help aid economic recoverydefaultIs the population of NI at a disadvantage to the rest of the UK as a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recovery idefaultnitiatives by banks in NI?default27. defaultWhile Northern Ireland has experienced a much deeper and prolonged recession in comparison to other areas of the UK, there is little evidence to suggest that this was a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recove
defaultry initiatives by banks operating in Northern Ireland. It is however, important to consider that these banks are often influenced by polices of state regulators in which their headquarters are located.
default 
defaultIf so, is a more tailored approach from the HM Treadefaultsury required for NI? default28. defaultNo, economic recovery is a challenge facing all of the UK; it is not solely a regional issue.
defaultAccess to banking in rural communitiesdefaultFollowing the closure of defaultDanskedefault Bank of some branches in rural areas, are the interests of thosdefaulte living in more rural areas, particularly the elderly, sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure as it currently stands? How significantly will the situation be exacerbated if Ulster Bank also closes some of its rural branches?default29. defaultNorthern Ireland 
defaulthas a different demographic profile and a lower degree of urbanisation than other parts of Great Britain and as such the delivery of banking services in rural areas is a general issue. While anecdotal evidence suggests that the needs of the elderly may not
default be sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure currently, there is no easy solution. 
default30. defaultThe role of the branch network has changed in recent years. Technological advancement and changing consumer behaviour have been key drivers of this change. Tech
defaultnology adoption is slower within the elderly cohort of the population and in general, rural areas can be considered more conservative.
default 
default31. defaultThe implications of recent changes to the branch network in Northern Ireland and of any further projected changes 
defaultis that new delivery channels tailored to the needs of the elderly may be required. However, substitutes to the branch network can be implemented.

defaultExtend the services currently provided through the Post Office
defaultIt is estimated that 95% of the total rural 
defaultpopulation across the UK are within three miles of their nearest outlet. More specifically, within Northern Ireland there are currently 331 post offices located in rural areas. The services currently offered are primarily traditional intermediation functio
defaultns such as deposition taking however, these are not available at all locations. These services if expanded offer a potential avenue that may assist in overcoming the access issues for the rural population that are currently being raised.

defaultIncrease the serv
defaultices that Credit Unions are permitted to provide
defaultAs highlighted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, an update of the legislation on credit unions in Northern Ireland to increase the services that they are permitted to provide, could pote
defaultntially act as a another countermeasure to the rural branch closures.
default 
defaultAround 23.6% of the 
defaultp
defaultopulation in Northern Ireland 
defaultis a member
default of a credit union compared to only 1.6% in Great Britain (
defaultMcKillop
default, Ward and Wilson 2010). An increase of powers to credit unions may increase competition within the sector and in the delivery of services to rural areas.

defaultUse banking Kiosks as an alternat
defaultive off site delivery channel
defaultAnother alternative as outlined by Jim Brown, the Chief Executive of the Ulster Bank Group, includes the use of kiosks for rural areas. These provide several locations for customers to access services without requiring the sam
defaulte level of investment that would be necessary to sustain a rural branch. This substitute does however; require the largest change in consumer 
defaultbehaviour
default. There is therefore, the need to implement support mechanisms for this transition and to further educate
default consumers in this regard. 
default32. defaultOverall, while the decline of the branch network is challenging for rural areas, the main issues are age and education sensitive. 
defaultO
defaultn one hand there is scope for the expansion of existing services or development of alternati
defaultves such as those outlined above. On the other hand, with the level of adoption of currently available online and mobile banking facilities increasing, the costs involved in implementing the alternatives must be carefully considered. 
defaultConclusiondefault33. defaultThe s
defaulttructure of the banking sector in Northern Ireland has both advantages and disadvantages associated with it. The Ulster Business School will be happy to discuss this issue further or to keep the Committee informed of findings of the project as it progresse
defaults.
