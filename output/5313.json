"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n Richmond Cycling Campaign (CYS0131)\n&#xa0;\nTo simply answer your key questions:\n1.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs cycling safe?\nAll the statistics tell me cycling is safe, and that’s what I tell our members. But this reflects only cycling as it is carried out today. In \nevery school in Richmond\n, many more children \nwant to cycle to school than currently do so. What’s holding them bac\nk? In general, it’s safety: no parent would allow a primary school child to cycle in a cycle lane on an A-road or A-road equivalent – when asked, parents generally list safety concerns as the reason for them not allowing children to get on a bike to school\n.\nMy daughter wants to cycle to school, and is capable of making the journey, but I can’t allow her to ride in the gutter with cars, trucks and vans passing by a foot away at up to 30 mph. The only way to make cycling both *seem* and *be* safe for these ve\nry vulnerable transport users is to provide safe places to cycle where they are not required to interact constantly with dangerous vehicles.\n2.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat can central / local \nGovt\n do to improve cycling safety …\nGovernment across the country needs to provid\ne safe, continuous, direct routes which make it possible for people to get on their bikes without the need for expensive lighting or clothing: in countries where lots of people cycle, it happens because they can do it without having to continuously interac\nt with motor vehicles.\nWe’ve tried, for too long, telling people how useful it is to get training, or legislating for safer HGVs, or making cars nicer for when they inevitably drive into people or things. Now let’s try the thing that we know – from plentif\nul evidence in Cambridge, as well as \nAssen\n, from Bristol and from Copenhagen – cycling is something everyone can do, if we give them somewhere nice to do it.\n3.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs it desirable / feasible to separate cyclists from other road users, including prohibit\ning HGVs in peak hours …\nProhibiting HGVs in rush hour isn’t going to make a primary school child any safer on an ordinary urban or sub-urban road: she still has to interact with buses, vans and cars in our current environment.\nCycling in the UK is a safe \nthing to do. However, most people rightly perceive:\n-\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA vehicle squeezing by at much higher speed\n-\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHaving to ‘own the lane’ in front of a vehicle weighing a ton or more\n-\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe intimidation of other road users who fail to see them\n-\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe dangerous behaviour of road users who don’t understand the highway code\n-\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnd, most frequently, the minor inattentions that might result in a small scratch to another vehicle but potential death or serious injury to a cyclist\nAs th\nings that make them feel cycling is too dangerous or just isn’t worth it. No amount of telling people ‘cycling is safe’ will fix these things, but \nbuilding somewhere safe to cycle\n will do. \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
