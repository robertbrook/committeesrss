"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Evidence from ACEVO [CEP0012]&#xa0;\n1.1 \nThis submission from the Ass\nociation of Chief Executives of \nVoluntary Organisations (ACEVO), to the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC), outlines ACEVO’s position on executive pay in the charitable sector (‘the sector’). It describes the nature o\nf executive pay in \nthe sector – captured by the \nACEVO\n Pay Survey \n2013-14\n \n– how pay is set; and the grounds on which ACEVO believes good pay should be evaluated.\n1.2\n              \nACEVO believes the pay of charity executives is right if it represents \nvalue for money as j\nudged\n by \nthe Board of Trustees\n,\n informed by \ncharity beneficiaries, funder\ns\n \nand staff. In this submission we offer a number of metrics and tools for the Committee to \nconsider during their inquiry\n. We welcome this opportunity to i\nnput into the Committee’s \nwork.\n2.1 One of the greatest virtues of the charity sector is its diversity. It includes organisations of all sizes, aims and areas of operation.\n2.2 There are 163,361 registered charities in the UK.\n 42% h\nave an annual income under £10,000. 75% have an annual income under £100,000. Only 6.1% have an income over £500,000, with 1,892 (1.2%) having an annual income over £5 million.\n2.3 The \nACEVO Pay Survey\n 2013/14\n (launched 20 November 2013) surveyed 678 chie\nf executives from amongst ACEVO’s members. It is the most comprehensive guide to CEO pay available, and has been published annually by ACEVO for more tha\nn two\n decade\ns\n.\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMedian Chief Executive Pay is £60,000 (from 650 \nrespondents to this question). The lower quartile is £45,000 and the upper quartile is £78,000.\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe gender pay gap, among charity Chief Executives, has widened to its largest extent in several years. The median is £67,000 for men and £54,530 for women\n, so \nwomen are paid 18.6% less.\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regional pay gap remains striking. Median pay for CEOs with offices in London was £70,000, while the lowest was for \nthose in Scotland, at £45,401. It is notable that of the 14 charities in the Disasters Emergency Committee, w\nhose salaries were in the news in August 2013, only 3 have head offices outside London.\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n82.8% of Chief Executives in the sector are on defined contribution or money purchase pension schemes, in contrast to more generous final salary or defined benefi\nt \nschemes still prevalent in other\n sector\ns\n.\n&#xa0;2.4 Chief Executive Pay correlates closely with increasing organisation size. Figure 1 shows that median salary only reaches £100,000 when the number of employees exceeds 1000. This figure does not include volunt\neers.\nFigure 1: Pay correlates closely with the number of employees in an organisation.To give an idea of organisation size at the top end of the above graph, Mencap’s CEO, who is paid £137,500, is responsible for 6,800 staff. Oxfam’s CEO (£119,500) i\ns responsible for around 5,000 staff and tens of thousands of volunteers.\n2.5 Chief Executive Pay varies considerably by charity sub-sector. For example the median salary was £78,858 \nfor sports charities \n(the highest median)\n, and £49,000 for religious \ncharities (the lowest median)\n. Sports charities also had the highest minimum pay in the sample, at £46,000. Other outliers include certain cultural charities, such \nas the Royal Opera House whose Chief E\nxecutive receives £250,000,\n and whose previous Chief \nExecutive received £390,000, the highest pay in the sector at the time.\n Healthcare charities, whose executives will often be clinicians, \nalso tend to be highly paid\n, particularly if their procedures demand that Chief Executive pay \ncannot be lower than\n oth\ner directors’\n salaries\n. \n2.6\n Chief Executive Pay correlates \nclosely with charities’ revenue.\n Median CEO salary is £34,600 for charities with a revenue of less than £150,000\n, whereas the median only \nexceeds the £100,000 threshold as charities reach a \nrevenue\n of £25-50 million.\n&#xa0;3.1 In spite of the difficulties of applying one set of principles to suc\nh an obviously diverse sector, \nACEVO recommends cer\ntain good practices when it comes to setting Chief Executive Pay. \n3.2 Charity pay at director level and above is the responsibility of the Board of Trustees, \nwhose decision-mak\ning will be overseen\n by the Chair\n. In large charities the Trustees will often \ndelegate the s\netting of executive pay to a Remuneration\n Sub-Committee, which decides executive salaries and pension schemes. \nIt might\n also review the responsibili\nty for \nsetting other staff pay, \nor delegate it\n to the appropriate Finance or Human Resources d\nirector.\n3.3 Many large charities also use recruitment consultants to assist with recruiting senior executives. Together with the charity’s Board of Trustees, consultants will usually set pay after considering organisation turnover, number of employees, in\n-job risk, pay of other directors and the possible use of performance-related incentives. Pay levels may also reflect the need to retain employees who may consider jobs in other related sectors. For example, international agencies such as the UN can of\nfer \ndirector pay of at least £80\n,000, so \nlarge international aid charities such as Oxfam, British Red Cross and Save the Children (all of which pay their CEOs over £100,000) need to keep their pay competitive to attract and retain the best leadership. Pay is o\nften set according to the dictates of the organisation and the job market in the sector, just as would happen in any other industry. Boards often also consider average senior pay in other comparable sectors, such as:\n&#xa0;\n3.4 ACEVO recognises that th\nere may not be sufficient publ\nic\nly-available guidance on the considerations that trustees make when setting executive pay. This is why \nare working\n to publicise\n five principles of best practice for the charity sector when setting pay for employees. These principles ensure value for money for beneficiaries, staff, \nfunder\ns and the \npublic purse\n.  They are: transparency, proportionality, performance, retention and pr\notocol.\n3.5 These principles are appropriate to charities of all sizes. In larger charities where trustees are more distant from the day-to-day running of the organisation, they may delegate control over pay to a Remuneration Committee. Its terms of refere\nnce would be formally approved by a vote of the trustees, and control over pay of other \nemployees\n delegated to a Finance or Human Resources Director. Charity Commission Document CC8, section D7 briefly outlines the Commission’s good practice guidance for c\nontrol, by trustees, over wages and salaries.\n A\nCEVO\n recommends this practice for larger charities and recommends that the principles of good pay apply to the work of remuneration committees.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSet the pay of \nChief Executives and other senior executives.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecify and review conditions under which the Chief Executive and Human Resources manager have delegated control of the pay of other staff, including pensions, and how they will report to the Board.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure that\n pay \nlevels correspond with any other policies the charity may have, such as a risk policy.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDetermine appropriate targets if the charity uses performance-related pay.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRemain aware of major changes in employee benefits, including pay, pensions and other rew\nards.\n&#xa0;\n4. Conclusion: ACEVO’s principles for good pay&#xa0;4.1 \nAbove all, ACEVO believes that good pay for any charity employee means charity beneficiaries, donors and employees agree that it provides good value for money.4.2 Recent opinion polls show \ncharities are among the most trusted organisations in society\n, but that the public are also concerned about the pay of charity leaders.\n ACEVO acknowledges concer\nns expressed by members of the Public Administration Select Committee \nand the wider public th\nat methods of setting pay in the sector may not be sufficiently transparent, and works constantly to promote transparency and an emphasis on \nvalue for money within the sector\n. The ACEVO Pay Survey has been \npublishing data\n on the pay practices of the sector\n every year \nfor more than\n \ntwo decades\n, \na\nnd is established as the market-leading benchmark of pay for the sector’s largest charities.  We hope \nto continue working to\n establish best practice \non \nthe setting of \nChief Executive pay \nacross the sector\n,\n and ensure\n that charities remain among our country’s most trusted organisations.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Charity Commission, ‘Facts and figures about Charities’\n. \nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/about-charities/sector-facts-and-figures/\n. \n[Accessed \n1 December \n2013].\n Charity Commission, ‘Facts and figures about Charities’\n.\n ACEVO, \nACEVO Pay Survey 2013/14\n, (2013).
