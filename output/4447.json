"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe Treasury \nselect \ncommittee\n (TSC)\n \nhas \nidentified six principles for tax policy\n: that it should be \nfair; support growth and competitiveness; certain (i.e. legally clear, targeted and simple);\n stable; practical; and\n coherent.\n Following the 2013 Autumn Statement, ICAEW has assessed how this year’s new tax policy matches up to the committee’s six principles of tax policy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Business Rates: Rate increases capped at 2% increase from April 2014 (to match inflation).\n Extension of small business rate relief for another year from April 2014.\n Reoccupation relief: For\n the\n next two years, every retail premises in England with a rateable value of up to £50,000 will get up to £1000 discount on their business rates\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe’re pleased the Chancellor met our call for an extension in small business rate relief until 2015.\nThe rates discount (up to £50K)\n and allowing businesses to pay\n business rates in 12\n rather than 10\n monthly instalments will both help business cash flow – the most vital factor for their survival.\n&#xa0;\nHMRC is exempt from £3 billion \nadditional spending cuts over the next two years \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis will be \nlittle\n comfort for HMRC - its budget \nis \nstill due to be cut by a further 5% in 2015/16.\nAbolition of employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for 18-21 year olds from April 2015 (except those earnin\ng more than the £42,285 a year),\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe National Insurance (NI)\n cut for small businesses may well help small businesses take on young people. ICAEW research found a quarter of SMEs would consider taking on young people if offered a tax break. The scheme needs to be easy to administer though, and not add to the red tape companies already encounter.\n Problems \npossible with what happens when someone reaches 21 years of age. \n&#xa0;\nMarriage Tax Allowance or ‘transferable tax allowance’: From 2015; married couples and civil partners can transfer £1,000 of their income tax personal allowance to their spouse. Worth £200 a year to four million couples from 2015, at a cost of £700 million. Will be \nuprated\n in future along with personal allowance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransferring the allowance will mean the couple’s take-home pay will rise. This is could affect their benefits entitlement, and their \nuniversal credit could go down as a result\n.\n This is symptomatic of still-separate tax and benefits systems, and means in practice that particularly for lower-paid couples, the government is giving with one hand while taking with the other.\n \nThis creates practical difficulties because it mixes a cap, a transfer and a taper. This will make for a complex system, running counter to the government’s com\nmitment to tax simplification.\nIt puts a\n new burden on an already-stretched HMRC, whose budget will be cut by a further 5% in 2015/16.\nTougher rules to limit use of \npersonal service companies \n(PSCs) \nto disguise employment as false self-employment to avoid NI (from April 2014).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPSC legislation is already complex. This latest change introduces further anti avoidance legislation. The workers affected \nare likely to\n be either unaware of their tax position or \npossibly \npowerless to do anything about it. \nThis measure is a yet another sticking plaster to address the wider problems in this immensely difficult area. A\n complete review and overhaul\n is needed.\nA new, limited power \nrequiring people to pay upfront their taxes where the scheme they used has already been struck down by the courts in an avoidance case, with effect from July 2014. At the moment, taxpayers can hold onto disputed tax while it’s investigated. Some are using this for cash flow benefit. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis s\neems a sensible move\n,\n although good consultation on implementation is essential\nCommunity Amateur Sports Clubs (\nCASCs\n). The amount clubs can earn tax free in income and rent will rise to £50,000 and £30,000 respectively. \nIt w\nill also be easier to qualify for the relief.\n&#xa0;\nHigher \nlimits are\n welcome, as is C\norporate Gift Aid for donations to CASCs.\nMain concerns are the new rules for eligibility for CASC status. D\netailed record keeping \non what members do for the club \nwill place a greater burden on many volunteer club treasurers. HMRC must adopt an \neducational\n approach to those caught transgressing\n,\n rather than penalising them.\nLoss of business rates relief will be a serious financial blow to clubs affected.\n&#xa0;\nUniversal credit (UC) DWP announced that the roll-out will miss its 2017 deadline\n. \n&#xa0;\nThis was always a challenging deadline. In our view, UC for the self-employed is still in need of radical rethink. In its present form it imposes an unrealistic reporting burden on businesses and is\n \npotentially unfair\n on those whose businesses with low income or losses.\n&#xa0;\nFrom April 2015, \ncapital gains tax will apply on future gains made by non-residents who sell residential property in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis is in line with the approach \ntaken by many other countries. A p\notential problem area is that in the UK a person can do their own \nconveyancing\n with\nout using a solicitor or notary\n. \nWe may need a\n system \nto ensure that\n CGT can be calculated and \npaid. In some countries part of the sale proceeds are withheld before they are paid to the vendor. This may require changes to the way UK property is \nconveyanced\n. \n&#xa0;\nReal Time Information. Employers must report to HMRC details of gross, PAYE and NIC deducted ‘on or before’ the time they pay employees\n. This applies to every cash payment made to employees\n.\n This rule is currently relaxed to allow month end reporting instead for employers with 9 or fewer employees.\n&#xa0;\nThe relaxation was due to end in April 2014, but\n for micro-employers it\n is now extended until \nApril 2016 to allow them\n time to change their systems. This is a welcome and sensible change although it should be made permanent. We \nremain concerned that\n employers who are already unpaid tax collectors \nmay\n be forced to make \nsubstantial \nchanges to their \nsystems, imposing considerable extra admin burdens and costs for little obvious benefit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n"
