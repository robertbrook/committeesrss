"&#xa0;\n              \n              \n              \n              \n               \nWritten evidence submitted by AbleChildAfrica&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAbleChildAfrica is a UK based charity working with and alongside partner organisations in Africa to achieve equal rights for disabled children and young people\n. \n&#xa0;\nWe are the leading UK charity working exclusively wit\nh and fo\nr disabled children in Africa. Our partners work on the ground to challenge and address the barriers faced by disabled people.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdopting a rights-based approach, we recognise that a person is disabled by the attitudinal, institutional and environmen\ntal barriers they face within society and therefore addressing these barriers is a means to achieving equality. Through our work, we highlight and address the additional and \nspecific barriers that disabled children and their families face. \n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are\n an active member of \nthe UK network Bond\n’s Disability and Development Group (DDG), UNICEF’s Global Partnership on Children with Disabilities and the International Disability and Development Consortiu\nm (IDDC); \nAbleChildAfrica also upholds the fundamental pr\ninciple of “nothing about us without us”.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAbleChildAfrica welcomes this \ntimely \ninquiry by the IDSC into disability and development, which we see as an invaluable opportunity to build on and enhance the role of the UK government in promoting inclusive devel\nopment. \nThere is now widespread agreement that the MDGs and development priorities will fail unless they are met for \nall \npeople and that disabled people must be included.  There is also recognition that an individual’s impairment interacts with other factors to influence development outcomes and that \ndisability should be as a core development topic within an inequalities fra\nmework.\n \n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn our work, we continue to see inequalities and barriers experienced by disabled children and their families; this evidence submission is intended to\n high\nlight some of these issues\n, with a particular focus on our area of e\nxpertise, children and f\namilies\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development\n2.1.1.\n \nAbleChildAfrica commends the positive work being done by DFID through its twin-track approach to disability. It is a leader in promoting t\nhe rights \nand \ninclusion of disabled people in development and putting the issue of disability on the global agenda. Its ‘Disability, Poverty and Development’ issues paper, \ng\nuidance note and other disability practice papers comprehensively detail what needs\n to be done to ensure that disability is no longer side lined.  \n2.1.2.\n \n While this high level support is evident, there is still a noticeable gap between the sentiments of the papers and what is actually being practiced on the ground. For instance, despite the 2\n007 practice paper on ‘Working on Disability in Country Programmes’, a \n2011 \nreport highlighted the significant absence of written statements in DFID country operational plans to reduce educational marginalisation for any vulnerable group other than girls\n.\n \nUnless these papers are elevated to policies and implementation monitored, we fear there will be little change in practices, particularly with regard to \nmainstreaming.\n2.1.3.\n \n We recommend that a policy \nthat draws together and builds on these existing documents \nand DFID’s twin-track approach \nis developed, implemented, and \nresourced\n with a realistic and practical monitoring and accountability fra\nmework.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability mainstreaming within DFID’s sector programmes\n2.2.1.\n \n DFID’s recognition that the MDGs cannot be achieved without addressing disability is an important statement that highlights the necessity of disability mainstreaming. As an effective tool for bridging the equity gap, we hope to see DFID continue and stren\ngthen its efforts to incorporate disability mainstreaming practices across its sector programmes.\n2.2.2.\n \n Currently there is still room for improvement to be made by DFID, particularly within core sectors - such as health and education - that impact the lives of \ndisabled people. For example, although over 20% of the UK aid budget for this financial year has been allocated to health\n, we continue to observe many difficulties faced by disabled children and their families in accessing and receiving health services, a\nt disproportionate levels to others. In fact, a recent study by Plan International found that\n \ndisabled children\n are significantly more likely to have had a serious illness, including malnutrition than \ntheir non-disabled peers\n. In the areas where we work, \nthis pattern was observed most strongly for children with intellectual impairments. \n2.2.3.\n \n Within the education sector, DFID has s\nupport\ned\n developing countries\n’\n \nwork towards achieving the MDG\n of \nuniversal primary education\n (UPE), unfortunately research demonstr\nates this progress has actually increased disparities faced by disabled children. P\nolitically reverberant pressure to meet \nMDG/UPE\n deadlines has contributed to increasingly overcrowded classes, insufficiently trained teachers and dec\nlining quality; \nefforts\n to meet \nUPE\n \nthen \nmay \nironically be \nhindering the \nconditions necessary for \nthe inclusion of disabled children, without whom the goal cannot ultimately to be \nrealis\ned.\n We endorse the comprehensive 2010 DFID practice paper ‘Education for Children with Disabi\nlities – Improving access and quality’. Yet as with the health sector, there is still much\n to be done on transforming this \nguidance notes into institutionalised practices and approaches. \n2.2.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlmost ¾ of out of school children are in sub-Saharan Africa and dis\nabled children are disproportionately represented in this group\n.  In fact, up to 98% of disabled children in developing countries do not attend school (UNICEF). The \nWorld Report on Disability\n reaffirms the finding that disabled children are less likely to\n attend school and demonstrates the adverse impact this has on human capital formation, employment, future earnings and productivity in adulthood\n.  \n2.2.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence shows that whilst 63% of African children finish primary school, only 2% of disabled children \nreach this stage\n. \nIn \nTanzania where we work, being disabled doubles the probability that a child will never attend school\n.  M\naking effective use of DFID’s practice paper on education, \ncould result in a \nsignificant positive shift in \nthese\n figure\ns\n.\n2.2.4.\n \n To hel\np enhance its mainstreaming efforts, we also recommend that DFID utilises\n \ndisability-disaggregated data and indicators. Guidance should also be available on how to plan for and gather accurate data. AbleChildAfrica is aware that many disabled children lack\n access to protection, medical, psychosocial and legal services (UNICEF, 2005)\n \nso it is particularly important to ensure that data \ns\nurrounding these \nissues \nare disaggregated within UK aid grants and country programmes.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID’s approach to rehabilitation an\nd service provision for disabled people\n2.3.1.\n \n DFID’s practice papers rightly identify and emphasise that both mainstream and disability specific services \nshould be\n holistic in their delivery. We call on DFID to ensure that both tracks are addressed simultaneous\nly in a coordinated way. Furthermore, early interventions can reduce the likelihood of intersecting issues compounding upon on\ne another.  O\nur partners \noften tell us \nthat poor access to health care, habilitation and rehabilitation services impacts on the ac\ncessibility of education and skills training for disabled children and young people. \n2.3.2.\n \n As a signatory of the UN Convention on the Right\ns of Persons with Disabilities\n, the UK\n government supports the right to the provision of learning materials, sign languag\ne and other assistive technologies. \nWe\n would\n therefore call upon DFID to ensure that\n a\nssistive aids\n that support a disabled child’s development and functionality \nare\n considered an essential service provision across all projects. While doing so, it is impor\ntant to avoid stockpiling of unwanted or unsuitable devices, so there should be flexibility in the procurement requirements for such items to ensure that actual individual needs on the ground are being met. \n2.3.3.\n \n Of particu\nlar concern to AbleChildAfrica\n, are t\nhe unmet needs of children with \nlearning disabilities or \nintellectual impairments and \nthose\n with complex impairments\n, as well as\n their families. Entrenched stigma and social isolation unfortunately mean that actual prevalence will remain underreported unti\nl data collection and reporting are improved, however we know from our partners that the ability of families to access quality, or any, services remains a challenge. We believe there is an opportunity for DFID to be a leader in addressing this gap and sett\ning the model for good practice using its rights-based approach. \n2.3.4.\n \n Finally, we recommend that the indicators used to measure success in the fields of rehabilitation and service provision go beyond tangible outputs and short term results\n to measure the real impact on individual lives. For example, a child who receives a wheelchair may not necessarily be able to access their local school or other community facilities and therefore continues to face barriers to inclusion. Such data should b\ne captured across mainstream as well as disability-specific programmes.\n&#xa0;2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStrength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability\n2.4.1.\n \n The \nDFID funded Disabili\nty Knowledge and Research \nprogramme has provided an invaluable bank of knowledge and information in relation to disability and development. \nf\nilling the data gap on disability should still remain a priority for DFID to \nguide\n the level and types of interventions being made in its pro\ngrammes. \n2.4.2.\n \n \nAbleChildAfrica believes it is important not to assume the criteria for what makes strategies effective; the evidence needs to be fed back from the ground and reflect the views of disabled children, youth and adults. We would also like to highli\nght that disability inclusive best practices will vary from country to country and therefore can\nnot \nbe applied generically.\n2.4.3.\n \n \nOur experience has shown that there is often\n hesitancy\n around applying inclusive practices in mainstream programmes\n, from governmen\nt and civil society alike\n. This \nis \nlargely due to misassumptions that it is too costly\n or complicated\n a process and can only be done with specialists available at all times. We have found that inclusive programming tools and Disability Equality Training ar\ne effective ways of supporting \ninclusive development.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRole of disabled people in DFID’s policy and programmes\n2.5.1.\n \n In recent years we have seen positive steps taken by DFID to ensure that disabled people have a bigger role and more voice within its work. Of p\narticular note is the collaboration with disabl\ned person’s organisations\n \n(DPOs) \nto undertake \naccessibility audits of DFID offices as well as steps taken\n to receive direct feedback from project beneficiaries. However, there is little evidence of DFID direct\nly listening to the voices of disabled \nchildren\n or their families and we call upon DFID to extend their consultative practice to this group as well.\n2.5.2.\n \n AbleChildAfrica is however, concerned that disabled people, particularly children, still remain mainly rec\nipients of aid rather than leaders and implementers of the process. It is our belief that disabled people of all ages must play a central role in all stages of policy and programme development as well as implementation. \nWithin Africa\n there are cultural con\nstraints on the role of a child and their visibility is less pronounced. Combined with the added marginalisation of being disabled, it is important to safeguard the voices and opinions of disabled children\n \nin addition to promoting their access to services, social participation, inclusive play and protection. For empowerment and advocacy outcomes in particular, which can be harder to measure, we strongly recommend engaging with disabled children and y\nouth, as\n well as their families, \nto determine what they consider to be indicators of success within such programmes. \n2.5.3.\n \nDisabled girls in particular are known to face more barriers than boys,\n \nespecially in \nsocieties \nthat \nfavour males to females\n. This makes them less\n likely to obtain health care, get an education, receive vocational training or find employment\n. On top of this, women and girls with disabilities are more \nlikely to experience\n practices which qualify as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment and are m\nore susceptible to violence and abuse\n. The \nmultiple \ndiscrimination and additional marginalisation \ndisabled girls\n face \nresults in poorer access to services and silenced voices \nwithin the development auditorium.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinancial costs and benefits of \nan increased\n emphasis on disability\n2.6.1.\n \nDFID’s Disability, Poverty and Dev\nelopment paper states that disability is a cause and consequence of poverty. \nEmpowerment of disabled people to break out of the chronic poverty cycle requires directed efforts to ensure their access\n to services and inclusion in the society; \ngiving consideration to disability issues and investing accordingly directly contributes to reducing poverty.  We recommend DFID adopt a policy of introducing an accessibility budget line into all programme funds \nin support of this goal. “Poverty reduction cannot be met without considering the needs of disabled people.”\n \n2.6.2.\n \nWe welcome DFID’s recent announcement to \nonly \nsupport the construction of accessible schools and hope to see a comprehensive approach of inclusiv\ne design applied. It will be important that guidelines on accessibility, as well as training on these guidelines\n,\n are rolled \nout. We would like to encourage DFID to continue in this vein with all infrastructure project\n,\ns especially since \nthe \nWorld Bank est\nimates that \naccessibility cost\ns\n are generally less than 1% of total construction costs\n. \n2.6.3.\n \n Investing in early childhood development is also an important way of not only engaging with the issue of inclusion, but also increasing the chances of detecting and \npreventing health issues that can lead to lifelong impairments. Being excluded from early childhood education significantly reduces the opportunities that disabled children can have later in life in terms of securing wor\nking and financial stability. \nResear\nch demonstrates that an individual’s potential income can increase by as much as 10% with each additional year of schooling\n, and this figure is likely to be even greater for disabled people, whose baseline earnings are undoubtedly significantly lower. Fur\nthermore\n this increased independency will \nreduce the financial \nresponsibility\n that is often\n placed on\n family members and government funds.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK’s work with other development agencies and partner governments on disability\n2.7.1.\n \n AbleChildAfrica considers the UK \nGovernment to be a world leader in promoting disability inclusion within the international development sector. There is still much to be done and it is our hope that more resources will be invested to support the work being championed by DFID and UK parlia\nmentarians. \n2.7.2.\n \nCurrently d\nonor funds for disability projects tend to be project-based rather than supporting national \ndisability strategies or \nCBR programme\ns\n. As a consequence there \ncan be a\n significant separation \nacross various\n initiatives\n, with\n no common s\ntandard of good practice, \nthus hindering\n sustainability. \nSupporting interventions at the strategic level would also be an \nopportunity to strengthen the ties between government and civil societ\ny organisations and promote\n disability mainstreaming\n.\n2.7.3.\n \n \nTo facili\ntate affirmative action we recommend that DFID ring fences funds - in line with its twin tack approach - for initiatives that particularly target disabled people\n, with a proportion set aside for the needs of children,\n as well as \nsetting aside sufficient re\nsources to ensure disability is mainstreamed across all DFID funding mechanisms\n.\n2.7.4.\n \n \nWe call on DFID to require all grant applications, government funding and country programmes to outline how funds w\nill impact upon disability (as \nis currently the case for ge\nnder)\n. Where possible all projects should actively include disabled people and at a minimum it should be \na requirement\n that projects don’t inadvertently exclude or increa\nse barriers for disabled people particularly children.\n2.7.5.\n \nThrough its bilateral programme\ns, we would like to see DFID w\nork\ning\n with government partners \nto facilitate \ndisabled people’s participation in the formulation\n and implementation\n of \ninclusive\n \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Plans. This would increase their democratic ownership\n,\n which in turn w\nould help \nintended outcomes be realised. \n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK’s role in ensuring disability inclusive post-2015 development goals\n2.8.1.\n \n \nAbleChildAfrica commends DFID for this timely enquiry; the UK Government itself has recognised momentum is building and that the post-2015 \ndev\nelopment a\ngenda has the potential to be watershed moment in history for disability and development\n.  The recent \nHigh Level Panel and Secretary General’s reports on post-2015 call for a transformative shift which ‘leaves no one behind’, they highlight the \nimportance of disaggregating indicators to support this, and state that ‘no target should be considered met unless met for all social groups, including people with disabilities’.\n AbleChildAfrica echoes these sentiments.\n2.8.2.\n \n \nHowever, this framework has not yet been agreed, and we call upon the UK Government to ensure that disability inclusion and an inequality framework remains central and explicit.  We encourage the UK Government to use continue using its position as a global\n leader and to work alongside civil society to maintain vigilance and pressure in the final moments. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should continue to build upon its solid foundations employing both its rights-based and twin-track approaches. \nFollowing its successful growth in disability-focused work, attention should now be given to strengthening disability mainstreaming across all DFID’s sector programmes.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA policy for inclusive development should be created, drawing together into one concise\n document all the good work developed by DFID in the past and developing a robust implementation plan as well as monitoring and accountability framework that includes tools and indicators of inclusion. To ensure wider engagement and ownership it should be \ndeveloped through a participatory approach\n - \ninclusive of children\n -\n and should include benchmarks of good practice in inclusion (e.g. the central role of disabled people in policy and programmes).\n \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA series of ‘quick win’ policies that address factors for\n exclusion should be introduced into DFID’s operations and practices. These could include utilising positive discrimination quotas for disabled people, particularly \nchildren and \nfemales; committing to ensuring that \nall\n UK aid infrastructure projects are ac\ncessible; introducing an accessibility budget line into project templates and ensuring all new projects must highlight how they will impact upon disabled people in the conceptualisation phase.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile disability is a cross-cutting issue, there are particular\n issues, such as abuse, \nviolence\n, access to basic rights and social exclusion that disproportionately affect disabled children which need to be identified and addressed. In addition to this, c\nhildhood disability systemically impacts upon the whole family.\n \n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe strongly recommend that all actions are guided by the goal of assuring the full and meaningful participation for disabled people, of all ages. Moreover, ensuring a holistic approach to disability in development involves recognising that disabled people\n are not a homogenous group and have varying needs depending upon their age, gender, impai\nrment, context and environment.\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAbleChildAfrica is \nhappy to expand upon or support DFID with any of the above calls to action and is available\n to lend our \nunique \nexpe\nrtise on the multifaceted considerations impacting upon disabled children \nand their families in Africa.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nWe recognise the complexities and ongoing debate surrounding terminology regarding disability. However, as an organisation in the UK we have chosen to support and advance the UK Disability movement and their stated preference of using the terms ‘disabled p\nerson’ or ‘disabled child’ in recognition of the social model’s primary tenet that an individual is disabled \nby\n societal barriers.\n  \n Equity and Inclusion for All in Education, G\nlobal \nC\nampaign for \nE\nducation\n (2011) \n \nhttp://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/sector/\n Include us! - A study of disability among Plan International's sponsored children, Plan International (2013)\n UN MDG Report (2010)\n \nWorld Report on Disability, \nWHO and World Bank (2011)\n Education for All Global Monitoring Report, UNESCO (2008)\n UN MDG Report (2010)\n \nChildren and Young People with Disabilities Fact Sheet, UNICEF (2013)\n Thematic study on the issue of violence against women and girls and disab\nility, UNOHCHR (2012)\n European Commission (2004)\n Education for All: The Cost of Accessibility, World Bank (2005)\n Building Human Capacities in Least Developed Countries to Promote Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development,\n \n \n    \nUNESCO ( 2011)\n Lynne Featherstone, Parliamentary Secretary of State for International Development, to the High-Level Meeting on Disability and Development\n"
