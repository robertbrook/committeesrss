"11\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBNI0020&#xa0;Written submission from the BBA&#xa0;\nThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s inquiry into the banking structure in Northern Ireland&#xa0;\nThe BBA is the leading trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector. We speak for over 200 member banks from 60 countries on the full range of UK and international banking issues. \nThrough \nour \nNorthern Ireland Advisory Panel, the BBA m\naintains\n&#xa0;\nregular\n&#xa0;\ncontact with the Northern Ireland Executive\n&#xa0;\nand local industry bodies, over and ab\nove the on-going activity\n&#xa0;\nof our\n individual members. \n&#xa0;\nWe are pleased to have this opportunity to respond to The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s inquiry\n into the banking structure in Northern Ireland.\n Whilst it is not suitable for the BBA\n to comment on the actions of individual members, we are able to provide some broader commentary around the banking sector in Northern Ireland, which we believe will be o\nf assistance to the Committee.\n \n&#xa0;\nSpecifically, the evidence in Annex 1 include\ns\n detail on the following areas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nhttp://www.bdrc-continental.com/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=6235\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\nANNEX 1 – Evidence from the British Bankers’ Association to The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, on the inquiry into the banking structure in Northern Ireland&#xa0;This \nevidence is separated into the following sections:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;SECTION 1&#xa0;Key banking statistics on Northern Ireland.&#xa0;&#xa0;Ref: The City UK: Northern Ireland.

The BBF\n is supported by the BBA in conjunction with some of our members and has been created to bring to life the recommendations of the\n&#xa0;\nBusiness \nFinance Taskforce\n. The BBF has three core themes at its heart: improving customer relationships; improving access to finance;\n&#xa0;\nas well as\n improving information and transparency. It\n&#xa0;\nincludes supporting businesses through \nmentoring; \nthe introduction of an \nindependently monitored appeals process for finance applications and providing guidance to UK businesses on how to export abroad or pitch to a bank when seeking finance. \n&#xa0;\nThe BBF and its initiatives are gaining good traction with businesses generally but \nwe acknowledge awareness of the mentoring and appeals support in Northern Ireland, as well as the support tools available for businesses such as mentorsme.co.uk, betterbusinessfinance.co.uk and businessfinanceforyou.co.uk, are not as extensive as we would \nhave hoped. \n&#xa0;\nTo this end, we are working with the banks and the Northern Ireland Chambers of Commerce upon how we can further invigorate the mentoring scheme and with Professor Russel Griggs, with the CBI, and more generally the Ulster Business School, up\non how the appeals process and support tools are more widely known. Further detail\ns\n are \noutlined below\n:\n&#xa0;\nAwareness RaisingOne of the key matters that the SME Finance Monitor \n(SMEFf) \nhighlights is the \n‘i\nndirect discouragement\n’\n \nof\n \na \nbusiness to \napproach its bank \nto discuss \nits\n finance need\n.\n \nIt \ni\ns important that all parties\n:\n banks; business groups; government\n,\n work together in \nbuilding\n confidence and \npromoting \nthe support that is available to businesses. To this end the BBA is working with the N\no\nrthern Ireland banks \nand business groups on  a series \nof\n activities to raise awareness through, inter alia:  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlongside the Better Business Finance Initiatives, the banks continue to work hard upon the deployment of the national UK Enterprise Finance Guarantee\n (EFG) Scheme and Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS).  Both of these Schemes are positive initiatives seeking to support business, with EF\nG\n targeted at helping businesses with a lack of security and FLS seeking to ensure credit is more affordable for custome\nrs. These schemes have had positive impact \nin Northern Ireland \nand the banks will continue to work closely with policy makers to ensure their optimal structure for the local Northern Ireland market. Progress of the schemes of course also depends on levels \nof credit demand which remain subdued.   \nIn addition\n,\n the BBA with the major banks continues to review ways in which the banking industry can support and develop alternative finance options for business. This includes the establishment of the £2.5bn \nBusiness Growth Fund \nin 2011 \nwhich \nwas\n set up \nby the major UK banks as part of the commitments made under the Business Finance Taskforce to provide long term patient capital for growing SMEs. Now operating out of \n7\n \nlocations the BGF has invested\n in the UK\n over GBP \n150\nm in growing businesses. The BGF \ncontinues to work\n \nwith business groups and banks in Northern Ireland, as regards \nto \nopportunities there\n.\n \nThe \nBBA is pleased\n \nto see\n the number of initiatives, presentations and meetings taking place to help buil\nd a \npipeline in Northern Ireland\n across\n \na range of sectors\n.\n \nThe BBA has also recently entered into a strategic partnership with the UK Business Angels Association to help business gain greater understanding of the benefits and options from angel investors \nand is currently working on the rollout of a referral programme, whereby in instances where bank finance is not appropriate\n,\n the business has the option to be referred by the bank to a local community development finance provider. \nL\nater this year\n the BBA w\nill\n be assessing how such a programme can be expanded to Northern Ireland\n.\n    \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;SECTION 4&#xa0;\nDetailed regional lending data&#xa0;The BBA provides quarterly aggregated lending statistics, in confidence, to the Department for Finance and Personnel (DFP) \nand the Economic Advisory Group (EAG) to aid understanding of credit distribution\n&#xa0;\nin the local SME market.\n&#xa0;\nWe also supply quarterly aggregated agricultural data to help the Northern Ireland Executive establish a\n&#xa0;\nbetter understanding\n&#xa0;\nof income factors affec\nting farmers.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBA is also working with the banks and Northern Ireland government upon how this data may be expanded. In addition, as highlighted above, the major banks fund the independent work BDRC Continental undertake \nto assess\n businesses experience\n with finance. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSECTION 5&#xa0;Branch closure and access to banking in rural communitiesBBA members recognise their responsibility in providing a network of services for their customers. Individual firms continue to view a branch \nfootprint as an integral part of their service to customers and continue to compete against each other on the strength of this offering.\n \nIn common with most commercial businesses, banks make\n&#xa0;\ntheir decisions in respect of both provision and withdrawal of b\nranches based upon demand and profitability. Branches will remain open if they are being used, but if the number of customers coming into the branch falls, then just like any other retail outlet, the bank will need to look carefully at whether it is still \nviable to keep it open\n. \nNevertheless a number of banks have committed to keep a branch open if there are no alternative banks in the vicinity. The increasing availability of cash services through ATMs, Post Offices\n (c11,000 branches in the United Kingdom)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nand cash back via retail outlets has greatly reduced the demand for counter access in recent years.\n&#xa0;\n Direct Debits and Standing Orders have also reduced the need for over the counter bill payments.\nThe ways in which customers are demanding their banks pro\nvide services are evolving in new ways and at a tremendous speed that could not have been envisaged even 5 years ago. Offerings such as: location based services, online banking, mobile payments, faster payments and faster account switching only begin to sc\nratch the surface of recent developments. These services are flexible, convenient and usually provide 24 hours, 7 days a week banking service. \nT\nhe telephone banking network has been well established for many years providing an ea\nsy to use service for custo\nmers;\n \na\ns such many personal customers now do not need to go into a bank branch and call centres are able to deal with many other aspects of personal banking. Some banks are also trying to find more cost efficient and effective ways for small businesses to bank ca\nsh rather than queue up at the branch. They understand that this is a problem for small business customers and there are already systems in place for cheques. \nOne recent development of interest has been from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), whose remit i\ns to \nmake markets work well by promoting and protecting consumer interests throughout the U\nnited \nK\ningdom\n. The OFT\n’s paper “Price and choice in remote communities,” published in June 2012, reports\n&#xa0;\non the issues faced by remote communities\n&#xa0;\nwith views receive\nd from over 500 public bodies, companies and voluntary organisations. \nThe report identifies a range of complimentary actions that businesses, including the banking sector, can take. The suggested solution for banks was to provide services to remote communi\nties through alternative delivery mechanisms; this included an example of mobile banking facilities where a bricks-and-mortar bank may not be available to local residents and businesses.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
