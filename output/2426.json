"Written evidence submitted by the Public Law Project (LAI 0032)Introduction\n&#xa0;\nBackground\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow exceptional funding works\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat it is necessary to make the services available to the individual under this Part because failure t\no do so would be a breach of – \n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe individual’s Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998), or\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nany rights of the individual to the provision of legal services that are enforceable EU rights,\n or\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat it is appropriate to do so, in\n the particular circumstances of the case, having regard to any risk that failure to do so would be such a breach.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow exceptional funding is working so far\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe process of applying for exceptional funding\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“You also argue that your client has mental health problems and you state that\n your client was “\nreferred for treatment to X Hospital where she subsequently received counselling\n” (paragraph 19 of grounds). However, there is no supporting evidence provided which outlines your client’s diagnosis and treatment.” \nSourcing evidence\n may i\nnvolve obtaining a letter from a doctor\n or social worker\n. Many doctors charge fees for writing such reports.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe systemic flaws of the exceptional funding scheme\nApplications for exceptional funding are \nmade\n at risk\n&#xa0;\n“An applicant for such funding already faces a high hurdle if it is to be secured. He or she must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director of casework that it would be a breach of their human rights not to provide funding for representation. That wi\nll, of necessity, involve a detailed explanation of the substance of the legal case to show why the applicant needs representation, plus evidence of any characteristics that contribute to the need for representation, and legal argument around the test bein\ng applied. It is not plausible for a client who meets the test and needs the exceptional funding criteria to demonstrate, without assistance, that they meet the test. It is a classic Catch-22 situation, and not the first in the Bill. \n&#xa0;\nIf we are not to fa\nll foul of our convention obligations, it is essential that legal aid funding is available to assist prospective clients to make an application under the test, and the amendment provides for such assistance to be made available. I hope that the Minister wi\nll accept it”. \n&#xa0;\nDuring the course of the debate, the Minister responded by stating (8 September 2011, Hansard report, page 403): \n&#xa0;\n“Amendment 227 would ensure that civil legal services were provided for the purposes of making an exceptional funding applic\nation. I assure the Committee that the Government will implement appropriate procedures to ensure that those who require exceptional funding will, in practice, be able to access the scheme. To that end, we will of course engage with all interested parties,\n including key stakeholders, to discuss relevant procedural issues such as contracting and remuneration and the important practical questions surrounding applications to which her amendment alludes. On that basis, I hope that hon. Members will withdraw the\nir amendments”.\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is no procedure for urgent cases\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“If you wish the application\n to be treated as urgent you should complete page 13 of the CIV ECF1 to provide us with details as to the urgency of the case, for example an imminent date for a hearing or the imminent expiry of a limitation date or reasons why delay would cause risk of h\narm or prejudice to the client’s case. We will consider the information that you have provided and if we agree, then we will deal with your case ahead of non-urgent applications. We aim to determine all cases within 20 working days from the date of receipt\n of the fully completed application. \n&#xa0;\nHowever we cannot guarantee that the application will be determined before a hearing day or before specified urgent work is needed. We can provide information if you call our ECF telephone enquiry line about the likel\ny timeframe for completion of a pending application.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are no exemptions for children or people who lack capacity\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;\n See paragraph 3.54 of \nTransforming Legal Aid\n and paragraph 116 of \nTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps.\n See paragraph 96 of \nTra\nnsforming Legal Aid: Next Steps. \nPLP’s response to the consultation is available here:\n \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/\ndocuments/PLP_legal_aid_consultation_response_4_June_2013.pdf\n \n ‘Enforceable EU right’ is defined in section 2(1) of the European Communities Act  1972, which states: “(1) All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to \ntime created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United \nKingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly; and the expression “enforceable EU right” and similar expressions shall be read as referring to one to which this subsection applies.”\n Section 10 also ma\nkes provision for exceptional funding to be granted in certain inquests. The provisions relating to inquests are not considered further here. \n Statistics will be published by the LAA on a quarterly basis. The next publication will therefore be on or arou\nnd 1 October 2013.\n \nSee the Lord Chancellor’s Guidance\n,\n \np.3, \npara\n.\n10\n.\n"
