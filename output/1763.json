"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Rolls-Royce Group (RaD0019)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is clear that many of the other world economies are protecting or increasing their investment in research for just such reasons.\n  Major international businesses have to date invested in UK research because it is recognised as amongst the best in the world. However, other countries are becoming increasingly competitive and UK industry now has more choice than ever before.  Many Gover\nnments, for example Singapore and Germany, are investing heavily to develop their research capability and provide attractive incentives for Companies to move their R&amp;D efforts.  It should \nbe noted that much of this investment is based on a long-term nation\nal ‘vision’ that stretches well beyond a ten-year horizon.\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the \nsteps taken by\n \ng\novernment on\n UK r\nesearch and development funding\n \nto link \nindustry sector\n strategy\n and \nacademic collaboration\n to support for research and technology\n. This creates cohe\nrence and also supports \nbridging\n the gap between research and bringing innovation to market\n in\n particular in growth industries\n.\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nrecent \nannouncement of the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) \nis an example \nof how \ng\novernment investment\n support\ns\n a strategy for growth\n. Government worked with industry in \nthe Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP) \nto \nset out a national ‘vision’ and \ndefine the strategy for \nsecuring \nlong-term success \nof the industry. Both sides entered into \na\n multi-year commitment to co-invest\n,\n \nwhich provides essential continuity, and to do so at research and\n technology \nfunding \nlevels\n which \nwill enable \nUK’s \naerospace \nresearch\n, \nadvanced manufacturing \nand future products \nto remain \nworld leading\n.\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this context \nwe recognise that \nthrough \nthe Technology Strategy Board (TSB) \nthe \ng\novernment has developed efficient mechanisms for supporting joint collaborative research with universities. \nThe scope of funding avai\nlable through the TSB should be looked at in the context\n of pulling through \nearly stage research to validated technology.\n We believe that the funding available to the TSB is too low to deliver all the early opportunities created in the UK.\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther, \nwe believe that \nEPSRC remains an effective body for funding \nresearch at univ\nersities. While there is some merit in \nrecent calls for streamlining the research councils, we are concerned that this should not lead to over-rationalisation\n into a single research council. S\nuch a step would hurt diversity of research amon\ng \nvarious industri\nes and hinder the adaptation of the individual council to the major drivers in the different research arenas.\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the National Audit Office (NAO) report notes, the\nse\n funds are managed through a number of government departments that are not always well coordinated. \nEstablishment of a government focal point would be a starting point to provide a stronger UK presence and influence at European level.\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversities are disinclined to pursue European funds because of the relatively unattractive overhead recovery structure of the grants. They need mechanisms by which the UK funding bodies can \nincentivise\n and support participation in EU programmes, thus rec\novering more of the \nU\nK taxpayers' contribution.\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regional agenda of funding collaborative \nR&amp;D\n appears to have been lost with the disbanding of the regional development agencies (RDAs), making it much harder to get SMEs involved. \nA strong basis for \neconomic growth is rooted in a sound understanding of a locality’s economic advantage\n and how R&amp;D funding affects it.\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe look forward to more information on how the new LEPs will be able to support larger businesses in the UK. We remain sceptical that the \ngranularity of the LEPs is too fine to be effective in coordinating university activity to support local needs. Most LEPs will contain only one (many none) first class, research intensive university. The granularity of the 39 LEPs means that aligning multi\nple agencies across multiple universities to address major technical challenges will be no small \ntask. It is essential that Government retain an oversight capability to avoid duplication of activity and missed opportunity.\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNo matter how \n‘\nlocality\n’\n is defin\ned; individual universities, industries, regions and even countries must target\n those areas of technology\n or expertise\n where a leading position \nexists, or where\n emerging \ntechnologies\n \nin which\n the UK has the business infrastructure and skill-base to \nbecome\n \nworld leading\n exist. \nThis implies focus on those institutions with a proven track record of excellence and delivering impact.  It also means that some difficult decisions must be taken to \nnot\n support some activities in the ‘locality’, however defined.\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nlooking at universities, w\ne \nacknowledge the difficulty of\n map\nping\n excellent research to most sectors of the Industrial Strategy, and maps based on academic classifications may not do \njustice to centres that excel in\n \napplied research\n in particular\n.  Whilst \nwe can offer no simple \nsolution\n, there is extensive knowledge \nin major industries \nof those with whom successful collaborations are underway– this is likely to be a good proxy for those centres that carry out \nwork having a tangible\n \nimpact on business. I\nt is\n highly unlikely that successful \nbusinesses\n will \nengage long-term with\n organisation\ns that fail to deliver results.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would welcome \ndiscussion on\n additional metrics that recognise successful university-business interaction, and link continued funding aimed\n at UK growth to those metrics.  \nW\ne make it clear that we do not advocate that current, traditional measures of researc\nh\n excellence be simply replaced, and t\nhere is no question that the quality of research and training in the UK must remain internationally\n competitive.\n  \nHowever, i\nt should be recognised that the traditional outcomes of research are not the only measure of success, especially when considering exploitation for the benefit of the UK.  We have yet to see how the ‘Impact metric’ introduced for \nthe 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF)\n will affect the outcome.  In calling for Universities to help “write the plan” for investing ESI funds, there \nis\n a risk that they will do so to support (only) \nmore\n traditional measures.\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, we should not o\nverlook the potential synergies between sectors.  It is quite likely that \nfor example\n Aerospace and Automotive will draw on similar skills and capabilities.  In examining heat maps and other indicators of expertise, where we see overlaps in \ncapability\n, opp\nortunities to more effectively channel R&amp;D funds may become apparent.\n&#xa0;\nAugust\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Annual report of Rolls-Royce Group Holdings, \nhttp://ww\nw\n.rolls-royce.com/investors/financial_reporting/annual_report/index.jsp\n \n Ingenious Britain, a report by Sir James Dyson, March 2010\n Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration: Final Report, HM Treasury, December 2003\n \nhttp://www.ref.ac.uk/\n \n"
