The regional office is currently actively working on \nthe \nDisability Inclusive Peace and Security Project (DIPS) in collaboration with the African Union Peace and Security Department (AU PSD). The DIPS project aims to improve the lives of persons with disabilities in conflict areas of Africa by mainstreaming disability issues in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict in the context of \nthe \nAU peace and security framework. We have responded only to those areas \nwhere \n we feel we have somethi\nng to contribute.
