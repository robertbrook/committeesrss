[normal]Written submission from Birmingham City Council (LPG 45)[bold]Birmingham City Council (BCC) 
[normal]puts very high value on procurement and its potential to deliver Council policies, both directly and through added Social Value.  Last year it established a Cabinet post of Commissioning, Contracting and Improvement with a remit for procurement, contract compliance, contract performance and value for money (see section 6 for more detail). It also had a specific task of establishing the Birmingham Business Charter for Social Responsibility.
[normal]The Council 
[normal]has adopted a suite of complementary policies:
[normal](i)
[normal]              
[normal]Our Social Value Policy sets out how the Council intends to discharge its duties under The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012.
[normal](ii)
[normal]              
[normal]The Birmingham Business Charter for Social Responsibility sets out the guiding principles to maximise Social Value and,
[normal](iii)
[normal]              
[normal]The Birmingham Living Wage which is consistent with the Living Wage Foundation
[normal]Following consultation with Birmingham businesses and organisations BCC introduced The Birmingham Business Charter for Social Responsibility.  This is a set of guiding principles to which BCC will adhere and to which it invites its contracted suppliers, the wider business community, other public sector bodies (including schools) and third sector organisations (including grant recipients) to adopt. The Charter aims to boost the local economy through support to the local supply chain, creation of job opportunities and ensuring employees are paid a fair wage.
[normal]However its adoption and implementation is now mandatory for all new contracts and grants (although with some elements voluntary below a contract /grant value threshold).  
[normal]Charter signatories 
[normal]have to 
[normal]evidence how they 
[normal]will and do 
[normal]work to improve the economic, social and environmental well-being of Birmingham and its citizens.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore Social Value now form
[normal]s
[normal] part of the evaluation criteria for tenders along with Quality and Price
[normal].
[normal]The principles of the charter are:

[normal] is BCC’s procurement portal, where we advertise for the goods, services and works that the Council requires. Finditinbirmingham aims to make all of the council’s purchasing opportunities accessible to local businesses.  We are also working with our contractors and other large businesses and public sector bodies to advertise their opportunities on Finditinbirmingham and to encourage their main contractors to also buy locally.  
[normal]Separately, BCC is currently trading with educational bodies within Birmingham and Walsall by offering a Procurement Service which includes use of our contracts, procurement support and health checks and training. 
[normal]Annually BCC consult with residents and business on its budget priorities.
[normal]There is further involvement with the 10 District Committees (within the 1 unitary authority) on commissioning strategies.  District Committees’ responsibilities include;
[normal]An example of where BCC has consulted in detail with the local residents is in the introduction of wheelie bins, which included two pilot schemes.
[normal]BCC has extensive long term relationships with a range of suppliers including 
[normal]BCC has a Contract Management Team which leads the way in the management of contracts across the council, focussing particularly on the contract with BCC’s Wholly Owned Company, Acivico.  BCC are producing a Contract Management Toolkit to support the work of the Contract Managers across the council.  
[normal]Many BCC contracts are used by up to 20 other local authorities within the West Midlands area.  
[normal]BCC’s legal services framework agreement has been used by other local authorities on a national basis since it was set up in 2010. 
[normal]BCC also take advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities through the use of the Government Procurement Service (Utilities &amp; consultancy services), Pro5 (vehicles, waste accessories and schools supplies) and we are currently working on an agreement to become an associate member of Yorkshire Purchasing Organisation. 
[normal]More innovatively 
[normal]BCC, along with Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and other local public sector organisations, set up a cross-sector community interest company – Buy for Good (BFG) - which helps social landlords, local authorities, schools, social enterprises and emergency services to benefit from the reduced prices that BCC can secure as the UK's largest local authority. 
[normal]BFG is unique in that it has been incorporated in a way which classifies it as a Contracting Authority as defined in the EU Procurement Directive. Its inclusivity is reflected in its board members and networks – Several Local Authorities, Social Enterprise West Midlands, Sustainable Housing, Action Partnership, Improvement and Efficiency West Midlands, and Birmingham Social Housing Partnership amongst others and will expand in time to include contracting authorities from Education, Health and the Emergency Services. 
[normal]Public bodies and third sector organisations, that have sometimes been resistant to working with BCC, are now combining their procurement needs with the local authority via BFG which makes all members equal partners. BFG also aims to address another major challenge facing public purchasing: how to balance the need to use large scale national frameworks to drive down prices with the need to support SMEs to deliver local jobs and skills as well as reducing environmental impact.
[normal]We believe the answer is a social value-focused shared services model for back office support, which is stand-alone, can trade freely, has minimal overheads and is easily replicable. Contracts are open to public and third sector organisations; they are locality-based and focus heavily on boosting local supply markets. Each framework also aims to minimise any adverse environmental impacts associated with the provision of good and services.
[normal]The BFG model is based on rebates which provide a sustainable model. BCC provided a procurement resource to BFG when it was first established and now the council earns an income from this initial investment, whilst also reducing its cost base and that of other public bodies in the area. With pressure mounting on public services to find more efficient ways of delivering shared services, it makes sense for bodies from across the public and third sectors to combine demand and put their trust in community interest companies that can reduce costs and enhance policy outcomes.
[normal]The Council is in year 4 of the Highways Maintenance and Management PFI contract.  Those advising on this contract were involved in its negotiation.  The Council is also making changes to the contract to deliver substantial savings and efficiencies from it.
[normal]Long term contracts such as this require an extensive partnership working approach, which can be challenging to implement.  The Council does work well in partnership with its Service Provider on this contract and there is a good mutual understanding of the need for a partnership approach, particularly to requirements for savings.
[normal]However, from the Council’s experience with this contract, making changes to a PFI contract such as achieving savings is a very complicated process that involves not only the Service Provider but also its lenders.  In particular, due to the long-term nature of the contract and the significant financial commitments involved the lenders are particularly resistant to change.  This approach from lenders is not always congruent with the required partnership approach and has caused some difficulty in adapting a long term contract to the emerging requirements of the Council with regards to savings.
[normal]3. 
[normal]   
[normal]a) How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? 
[normal]The Council recruit from both the public and private sector to gain the skills needed as there is a general shortage of high calibre individuals 
[normal]in both sectors 
[normal]with the skills and expertise required.  BCC implemented a Category Management approach in 2008 which has resulted in Contract Managers gaining expertise in their market areas.  The Managers work with directorates across the council to understand their purchasing requirements and expenditure and support them in producing quality procurement strategies for each market area.  
[normal]The Council’s professional staff regularly works with external professionals on major projects.  This will be with either external consultants it commissions or external 
[normal]consultants who are representing bidders.  This facilitates a two way learning process of how procurement processes can be improved.
[normal]The Council’s legal department staff regularly has two lawyers who assist Local Partnerships to undertake a gateway review of the projects of other public authorities.  It also provides legal advice on procurement advice to other public bodies.
[normal]Value can be added in financial terms such as savings on prices, improving processes to reduce cost and procuring against a specification that costs less. To compliment this 
[normal]social and economic objectives are delivered through the implementation of the 
[normal]Birmingham Business Charter for Social Responsibility
[normal], referred to in 1a above. 
[normal]B
[normal] 
[normal])
[normal]More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?
[normal]The Councils SAP ERP system is able to accurately report on the vast majority of Council expenditure providing detailed spend analysis of 
[normal]WHO[bold] (the cost centre/budget holder) buys 
[normal]WHAT[bold] (the category code) from 
[normal]WHOM[bold] (the supplier) and for 
[normal]HOW MUCH [bold](the price). 
[normal]Additional expertise, skills &amp; market knowledge is gained by BCC, in partnership with other organisations such as Social Enterprise West Midlands, Improvement &amp; Efficiency West Midlands, other regional councils, the national Advisory Group for Local Government Procurement, Sustainable Housing Action Partnership and Birmingham Social Housing. 
[normal]4. 
[normal]a) 
[normal]To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? 
[normal]The Council and the Procurement team maintain &amp; manage a risk log which includes risk of supply chain failure.  This is evaluated during the development of category strategies &amp; delivery of the contract through our contract management processes. Suppliers are reviewed on a risk based approach to determine the level of management &amp; monitoring required.
[normal]As mentioned above, BCC has implemented a Category Management approach which has developed manager’s expertise in their market area. BCC use Framework Agreements either our own or those created by others where appropriate which does not commit BCC to long term spend.  
[normal]The Council has an officer group comprising financial, legal and procurement representatives which reviews specific procurement activities.  A key element in this review is an assessment of risk.
[normal]b)
[normal] 
[normal]More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered? 
[normal]The Council also has a number of ‘intelligent’ client functions to manage the more complicated arrangements e.g. joint ventures and wholly owned companies. These groups take the lead for the commercial and performance management of the contracts and link with users/customers of the services for feedback on operational performance and escalation of issued.  
[normal]The Street Division which manages the operation of the Highways Maintenance and Management PFI contract have staff who played a key role in the negotiation of the contract.  Early on in the contract a detailed contract guide was produced for staff and training sessions were held.
[normal]Depending on the contract, BCC include variation clauses.  See below for an example of such a clause included in a BCC contract:
[normal] Where the Variation relates to the execution of additional or substituted service or supply such services shall be valued in accordance with the following rules:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective?
[normal]Birmingham’s internal audit team have a significant focus on financial systems including spend &amp; finance and adopt a programme of audits covering commissioning, procurement and contract management.  These are reported to Service managers, Directors and the Council’s Audit Committee. 
[normal]The Contract Management Team’s role includes checking that invoices match the contractual basis for charging. We also have a separate team responsible for 
[normal]compliance and governance that monitor how the processes used for procuring goods and services. Spend compliance can be monitored &amp; at a currently level of approx. 98% is sector leading in its performance. 
[normal]As well as BCC’s financial regulations, Contract Procedure Rules for Standing Orders and a Scheme of delegation for contract values, BCC also has Member Scrutiny arrangements to ensure propriety and good governance of procurement activities. 
[normal]6. 
[normal]Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?
[normal]A very effective way to improve procurement and compliance across the council is to consider Cabinet Member responsibility for procurement; this could for example be part of a Deputy Leader role or as a specific responsibility for a Cabinet Member for Finance.
[normal]In Birmingham responsibility for 
[normal]procurement, contract compliance, contract
[normal] 
[normal]performance and value for money 
[normal]has been given even more prominence.
[normal] 
[normal]Of its annual revenue budget of approximately £3.5b the council spends just over £1b with a range of suppliers and for this reason a Cabinet Member for Commissioning, Contracting and Improvement has been established.
[normal]Member involvement is key to ensuring that the right goods and services are procured, thus delivering more of their Council’s priorities at prices that reduce the needs for cuts elsewhere. Scrutiny Committees have an equal role with the Executive in driving additional value, including Social Value, from contracts, grants and partnerships.
[normal]In Birmingham the Cabinet Member for Commissioning, Contracting and Improvement has accountability for the following strategic functions
[normal]In addition the following responsibilities are shared with other Cabinet Members as indicated.
[normal]Shared with the Deputy Leader:
[normal]Shared with the Cabinet Member for Development, Jobs and Skills:
[normal]BCC has its own Standing Orders – financial regulations for the procurement of goods and services to which all those who make a purchase on behalf of the council are required to adhere.  BCC has rigorous governance arrangements for the commissioning and procurement process, which states clearly where Cabinet needs to give approval and where Cabinet can delegate approval. Delegated approval is sought through a board comprising senior finance, legal and procurement officers.
[normal]BCC is open and transparent in its procurement processes.  It is a requirement through Standing Orders that all procurement requirements are sourced through our supplier portal Finditinbirmingham.
[normal]Under the transparency regulations BCC publishes its contract documents onto its web pages for public viewing. 
[normal]During 2012/13 ten internal 
[normal]audits 
[normal]of the corporate 
[normal]procurement activity were undertaken
[normal] with further audits of contract management to be undertaken across the Council during 2013/14. 
[normal]The tender process includes feedback to unsuccessful bidders.
