[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] Government is committed to promoting equality in the workplace as our 
[normal]track record 
[normal]on positive action, 
[normal]transparency, flexible working and
[normal] shared
[normal] parental leave demonstrate. 
[normal] 
[normal]We are committed to ensuring that the
[normal] 
[normal]Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths
[normal] 
[normal](STEM) 
[normal]workforce is diverse, reflect
[normal]s
[normal] wider society and makes use of all the talents available to it. 
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]espite positive progress, there are still too many groups under-represented in this sector. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]The Public Sector Equality D
[normal]uty
[normal] 
[normal]which came into force a
[normal]s part of the Equality Act 2010 
[normal]conveys on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) as public 
[normal]authorities the duty to; 
[normal]advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not
[normal], foster good relations between people who share protected characteristics and those who do not
[normal] and eliminate
[normal] unlawful 
[normal]discrimi
[normal]nation
[normal], harassment and victimisation as defined by the Equality A
[normal]ct.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When considering career progression for women in STEM it is important to consider the diversity of other careers as a comparator.  Although some STEM disciplines do particularly badly 
[normal]in the number of women they attract and retain, there remains a general problem with unequal 
[normal]career progression 
[normal]for women across the workforce as a whole.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women are 46% of the workforce
[normal], but their representation falls in more senior positions: women ma
[normal]ke up only 33% of managers, directors and senior officials
[normal] and only 14
[normal]% of FTSE250 board members
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Overall 
[normal]12 per cent 
[normal]of FTSE 100 board appointments since 1
[normal] 
[normal]March 201
[normal]3
[normal] have gone to women.
[normal]  
[normal]The proportions of women in management vary in different industr
[normal]ies. For example, women make up 55% of corporate managers and senior officials in the public sector but only 6% in retail, food, accommodation and services
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Women outnumber men in HE 
[normal]at undergraduate level
[normal]:
[normal] they have lower drop-out levels and better atta
[normal]inment levels. 
[normal] Although there is
[normal] variability in specific subject participation rates,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]women’s representation is higher than men’s in most subject areas.
[normal]  
[normal]Overall
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]48
[normal]% of students studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathem
[normal]atics (STEM) subjects 
[normal]are women:
[normal] this has remained fairly constant over the last decade.
[normal]  The vast majority of the
[normal]se women study Biological S
[normal]c
[normal]iences
[normal] and 
[normal]Subjects Allied to M
[normal]edicine
[normal] (which includes nursing). 
[normal] 
[normal]M
[normal]en still have 
[normal]much 
[normal]higher part
[normal]icipation in engineering and computer s
[normal]cience
[normal].

[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2011/12 47% of 
[normal]masters
[normal] students studying STEM subjects were female compared with 56% of masters students studying non-STEM subjects.  At PhD level, 44% of STEM PhD students were female compared with 51% in non-STEM subjects.  No central data is collected on lecturers specifical
[normal]ly
[normal], h
[normal]owever in 2011/12, of HEI staff whose academic function included teaching: 39% of those with a STEM cost-centre and 48% with a non-STEM cost-centre were female. In 2011/12, 21% of professors were female. 17% of professors with a STEM cost-centre were 
[normal]female and 26% of professors with a non-STEM cost-centre were female
[normal] (see 
[normal]A
[normal]ppendi
[normal]x A
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] As with the undergraduates, there will be differences 
[normal]in the level of female representation 
[normal]across disciplines within STEM.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s approach
[normal] to tackling lack of diversity in STEM careers
[normal] 
[normal]is to encourage diversity in the STEM workforce by 
[normal]raising awareness of different STEM careers and embedding and mainstreaming equality and diversity 
[normal]through a number of the programmes we fund, and those of th
[normal]e partners with which we work. This build
[normal]s
[normal] on the wider work of the government to promote inclusive workplaces. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A broad mix of STEM activities and wider societal programmes are supported by science and research 
[normal]funding
[normal] and these have a major impact on di
[normal]versity in the STEM workforce. 
[normal] 
[normal]These include the work of STEMNET
[normal] and the STEM Ambassadors to encourage a diverse STEM pipeline; the National Academies’ fellowships; Research Councils’ PhD and fellowships awards; and the Big Bang Fair
[normal] and 
[normal]National Scien
[normal]ce and Engineering Competition
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Better value can be realised through these broader activities and through better direction of existing diversity projects
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]By embedding good practice on gender issues within our other programmes and partner organisations,
[normal] and given the right incentives and direction, we expect these to establish a wide reach and 
[normal]have a significant
[normal] impact on all areas of diversity and 
[normal]equality in the STEM workforce.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BIS funds the 
[normal]Royal Society and Roy
[normal]al Academy of Engineering to lead
[normal] a programme of work
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]n partnership with the 
[normal]professional 
[normal]institutions, industry and others
[normal],
[normal] aimed at understanding and addressing issues of diversity in the STEM workforce.  
[normal]We want the STEM Diversity programme to achieve significant improvements in the 
[normal]diversity of the STEM workforce by identifying and r
[normal]emov
[normal]ing
[normal] barriers to joining STEM w
[normal]orkforce; i
[normal]mprov
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]retention and progression rates for people once they join the workforce. Importantly the STEM Diversity Programme is looking at issues affecting 
[normal]all m
[normal]inority or disadvantaged groups, not gender alone.  This also aligns with the wider government approach to equalities which move away from a more strand specific perspective.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering are submitting evidence t
[normal]o this inquiry which will provide more detail of their activities under the STEM Diversity Programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Women's Business Council (WBC) was set up to look at ways of maximising women's contribution to economic growth and 
[normal]consider how best to
[normal] remov
[normal]e
[normal] the b
[normal]arriers that women face in playing a full part in business and the workplace.  Their report
[normal] included several recommendations on women in STEM.
[normal]  
[normal]The Government is currently drawing up an action plan for implementing the recommendations which will be published in the 
[normal]autumn
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]STEM
[normal] careers in both industry and academia require a specialist skill set.  More is being done to encourage both women and men into this sector via vocational routes such as apprenticeships, however the main route of entry, particularly into senior specialist 
[normal]roles or academic positions
[normal],
[normal] remains through the
[normal] 
[normal]HE route. 
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore in order to increase the number of women in science, it is important to address the issue of access and retention at HE level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government is committed to access to HE based on talen
[normal]t and potential. 
[normal] 
[normal]In HE we have introduced a new framework for widening participation with increased responsibility placed on HEIs. 
[normal] 
[normal]This includes arrangements for annual access agreements.
[normal] 
[normal] HEIs agree their own access agreement measures and targets with t
[normal]he independent Director of Fair Access, in line with their own particular mission and challenges, and these can include targets on gender.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have also asked the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) and the 
[normal]Higher Education 
[normal]Funding Council for England
[normal], in consultation with the HE sector, to develop a national strategy for access and student success. The overarching aim in developing the strategy is to ensure that everyone with the potential to benefit from higher education has an equal opportunity to p
[normal]articipate and succeed, regardless of background, age, ethnicity, disability or gender. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The interim report
[normal] on the development of the new strategy has highlighted the continuing disparity in entry rates between men and women in HE and showed how these mi
[normal]rror the differences between men and women in the A level population before HE entry.  Further consideration will be given to this 
[normal](
[normal]and other equality and diversity issues
[normal])
[normal] as the national strategy is developed through to autumn 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]h
[normal]e Northern Ireland Executive 
[normal]endorsed
[normal] 
[normal]a STEM Strategy 
[normal]in March 2011. This contains 20 recommendations for Government and Business to take 
[normal]forward to encourage more 
[normal]young people to study and pursue a career in science, technology, engineering and maths. The
[normal] first five recommendations in the Strategy are assigned to Business to take forward, and this includes recommendation 4 which is to "address gender bias".
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department 
[normal]for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland 
[normal]has funded a post to work with business to address th
[normal]ese recommendations. This role is known as the 'STEM Business Co-ordinator'. 
[normal] 
[normal]As part of this work the STEM Business Co-ordinator recently organised a STEM gender seminar, entitled, 'Are you getting the balance right', which was attended by over 70 local b
[normal]usiness representatives and opened by the Minister for Employment and Learning, Dr Stephen Farry, MLA. Following the event, the STEM Business co-ordinator is producing a set of Good Practice Guidelines and a Business Charter.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Minister also made a statement in the Assembly on the 4th June
[normal] entitled ‘Gender Issues Relating to E
[normal]mployment, Learning and Skills’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1) 
[normal] 
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? 
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Analysis by BIS 
[normal]has indicated that the lower number of women in STEM subjects is linked to A level subject choi
[normal]ce
[normal].  
[normal]This in turn is affected by progression from GCSE with those achieving A* at GCSE more likely to go on to A Level, parti
[normal]cularly in Physics (see 
[normal]Appendix
[normal] B
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]nly 21
[normal]% of students studying A level Physics in 201
[normal]2
[normal]/1
[normal]3
[normal] were women.  
[normal]Research
[normal] by the Institute
[normal] of Physics
[normal] found that 
[normal]in 2011, 49% of maintained co-educational schools did not send a single girl to sit physics A level.
[normal] 
[normal]The figure for all secondary schools is 46%.
[normal]  
[normal]Of those who achieve science A levels, women are just as likely as men to continue to
[normal] study STEM in HE
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]see 
[normal]Appendix
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal].
[normal])  
[normal]The BIS analysis found:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] Department of Education analysis of the GCSE results for 2013 show that although A*-A an
[normal]d A*-C GCSE pass rates are down
[normal],
[normal] there are some positive trends including an increase in the take-up of the separate sciences. There are also positive initial findings in terms of gender an
[normal]d
[normal] GCSE take up. The increases 
[normal]seen in
[normal] entries in the separate scien
[normal]ces are largely because more girls are taking up these subjects. Entries by girls in biology are up 8.6% compared to 1.6% for boys. In chemistry, entries by girls have risen by 8.4% compared to only 0.8% for boys, while physics entries by girls are up 6.5%
[normal], with boys falling by 1.7%
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Research shows that c
[normal]hildren as young as ten already see a career in science as ‘not for me
[normal]’. 
[normal] 
[normal]Researchers
[normal] also found that parents and 
[normal]children
[normal] still see science careers as predominantly ‘for boys’.
[normal]  
[normal]The investigation 
[normal]found further evidence to suggest that families, teachers and schools play a part in creating gender patterns of subject choice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst women are more highly represented in 
[normal]undergraduate
[normal] study there is emerging evidence which suggests that this does not t
[normal]ranslate into postgraduate 
[normal]level education.  Recent research by the Higher Education A
[normal]cademy (HEA)
[normal] suggests that in progression to research degrees the men’s rate is greater than women’s.  The authors report that gender diff
[normal]erences are not limited to the 
[normal]STEM disciplines, but are seen almost across the board, including in the arts, humanities and social sciences.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Further research and 
[normal]investigat
[normal]ion is required
[normal] to establish the reason
[normal]s
[normal] for this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HEFCE has published a report
[normal] 
[normal]presenting “T
[normal]he trends in trans
[normal]ition from undergraduate to postgraduate study
[normal]”
[normal], focusing on transition within one year for 
[normal]full-time first degree UK domiciled qualifiers 
[normal]from English higher education institutions (HEIs) between 2002-03 and 2010-11.
[normal]  
[normal]Whilst the report did find that men w
[normal]ere more likely to p
[normal]rog
[normal]ress to taught masters and post
[normal]graduate
[normal] research course
[normal]s than women, differences by gender
[normal] were consistent by broad subject group
[normal],
[normal] except for STEM taught masters courses, to which women were more likely than men to progress.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Proposed reasons 
[normal]for 
[normal]why 
[normal]fewer women than men progress in STEM careers include
[normal]:
[normal] lack of visible female role 
[normal]models
[normal];
[normal] bias
[normal] or poor practice in the recruitment process
[normal] and
[normal] lower confidence of women and 
[normal]the way 
[normal]women perform in team assessment exercises.  A s
[normal]tudy
[normal] of undergraduates found that 
[normal]good quality internships or work placements had an i
[normal]mpact on career intentions so 8 per cent
[normal] of women in their final year who had a period of work placement or an internship d
[normal]id
[normal] not intend to study or work in a related ar
[normal]ea com
[normal]pared with 22 per cent of women who had
[normal] not had a work placement or internship.  Careers advice was also found to be vital as men had a higher awareness of career options than women.  Despite being better qualified than men
[normal], women had lower confiden
[normal]ce that they had the majority of technical skills that employers look for.
[normal]  This again can be addressed with good quality work placements or internships.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2) When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of 
[normal]scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A healthy science base and a supply of suitably trained STEM graduates are vital for our economy to enable the UK to do well as a nation. A wide range of business groups a
[normal]nd governments view the UK Science and STEM base as a key part of economic growth and UK competitiveness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Anecdotal evidence from employers suggested that STEM skills are 
[normal]highly valued across sectors and important to the sustained growth of the UK economy
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Some skills of high value to non-STEM employers are unique to STEM graduates, such as a particularly logical approach to solving problems, enabling some STEM graduates to progress faster in their careers than non-STEM graduate colleagues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A report from 
[normal]the Royal 
[normal]Society
[normal] of Edinburgh, titled ‘Tapping all our Talents
[normal]’ looked at the situation in Scotland and established that the number of women STEM graduates and postgraduates has increased significantly in recent years, however they also found that women 
[normal]are more likely than men to leave the STEM sector. They identified that In Scotland, 27%of women graduates in STEM work in the sector they qualified in, compared with 52% of male graduates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“STEM Graduates in Non-STEM Jobs
[normal]” found t
[normal]he most likely reason students seek employment away from STEM is because other fields are seen to be of more interest, although more practical and career-related reasons are also significant for graduates considering ‘leaving STEM’. 
[normal] 
[normal]Earnings (expected pay
[normal]) is an important factor (somewhat more important for males) but not the main motivating factor either to choose STEM degree-related work or not to.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Career
[normal] prospects and earnings are seen as positive reasons both to enter STEM careers and not to, i.e. the
[normal]re are mixed perceptions about where earnings are best.  
[normal]The study found that 
[normal]most graduates had chosen their current job (whether in STEM or unrelated) because it offered interesting work
[normal].  S
[normal]tarting salary and prospective earnings
[normal] were
[normal] a main driver for o
[normal]nly a minority of graduates, almost exclusively male.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]STEM skills, such as a logical approach to problem solving, are valued by many different sectors of the economy.  If women leave a STEM career after making an active and informed choice and having had 
[normal]an equal opportunity to progress in that STEM career as men, then their skills will be valuable to the UK economy wherever they are used.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3) What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in acade
[normal]mic careers? Are there 
[normal]examples of good practice
[normal]?
[normal]30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HEIs are independent from the Government and responsible for their own admissions decisions.  
[normal]However, as mentioned in the introduction, 
[normal]HEIs are 
[normal]covered by the
[normal] provisions
[normal] of the Public Sector Equality D
[normal]uty, which came into force as 
[normal]part of the Equality Act 2010.  
[normal]HEIs should therefore be addressing the issue of gender diversity in order to meet the requirements of th
[normal]is
[normal] duty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] Higher Education
[normal] sector
[normal] has made progress in promoting gender diversity
[normal] and
[normal] there are a number of examples of good practice and existing initiatives adopted by HEIs in order to encourage gender diversity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Athena Swan Charter
[normal], operated by the Equality Challenge Unit, is made up of six principles which focus on promoting gend
[normal]er equality within Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) any HEI which is committed to challenging these issues can sign up to the charter. Since the Charter
[normal]’
[normal]s inception
[normal],
[normal] its membership has increased from 22 institutions in 2006 to 91 in 2013. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Source: Equality Challenge Unit, August 2013
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Equality Challenge Unit wh
[normal]ich operates
[normal] the Charter also issues Athena Swan Awards 
[normal]for 
[normal]which signatories of the charter can apply. These awards are at three levels
[normal] (
[normal]Bronze, Silver and Gold
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]and are 
[normal]assessed across a
[normal] number of areas including
[normal]:
[normal] providing positive support for women at career transition, knowing the baseline and Science Engineering and Technology (SET) baseline and changing the culture and gender balance in decision making.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Examples of 
[normal]good practice include departments at the Universities of Edinburgh, York and Queens University Belfast who have all achieved Athena Swan Gold awards for the work they have done to address gender diversity.
[normal]  Because Athena Swan brings about a culture change within the Universities and Departments it benefits everyone who works within them, not only the women.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Equality Challenge Unit and UK Resource Centre for Women in SET (UKRC) commissioned a study
[normal] to
[normal] assess the impact of the Athena Swan programme on the number and level of women in SET In Higher Education since its launch in 2005. The research demonstrated that taking part in the award scheme had institutional, departmental and individual impacts and 
[normal]that taking part in the Athena Swan Awards had had an impact on the culture of the institutions involved helping to raise awareness of gender inequality and career progression issues. It also found that in departments 
[normal]that
[normal] were renewing their Award there h
[normal]ad been changes in the representation of women at higher academic grades and the number of women applying for promotion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The graph below shows that the proportion of chemistry professors in the two Chemistry departments which hold Athena Swan gold awards 
[normal]is increasing faster than the national average.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The positive impact of the Athena Swan award scheme was further endorsed by Chief Medical Officer in 2011 when it was a
[normal]nnounced that the National Institute for Heath Research would only expect to shortlist medical schools for research funding if the school held a Silver Athena Swan Award. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A range of other initiatives exist which encourage women to study STEM subjects and
[normal] 
[normal]to remain in Academic research;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4) What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
[normal]38.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government recognises the importance of academic research and innovation and the benefits that this has to society as a whole and the economy. This is demonstrated by the level of financial investment which the government has made and continues to make
[normal] into science and research. 
[normal]The Spending Review in 2010 protected Science &amp; Research programme funding at £4.6 billion per annum over the SR period within a ring-fence. Alongside this, a total allocation of £1.9bn was provided for research capital investme
[normal]nt over the 4 years of the Spending Review period 2011-15. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We want to ensure that women who wish to purse an academic career in a STEM field are able to do so. However
[normal],
[normal] we also recognise that there is significant value in both women and men with a STEM e
[normal]ducation entering the workforce outside academia. The STEM industr
[normal]ies are 
[normal]growin
[normal]g, with
[normal] engineering companies predicting that they will have 2.74 million job openings between 2010-2020
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] I
[normal]n order to fill these roles and support growth in the economy we ne
[normal]ed people with the right STEM skills to enter industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]40.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providing the right environment to facilitate women remaining in the workforce, including academic careers
[normal],
[normal] includes putting the correct legislative framework in place
[normal], such as t
[normal]he Equality Duty crea
[normal]ted by the Equality Act 2010 (
[normal]as mentioned
[normal] in question three)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] government is also introducing legislation to support the retent
[normal]ion of women in the workforce.  T
[normal]he Children and Families Bill
[normal],
[normal] which is currently going through 
[normal]P
[normal]arliament
[normal],
[normal] includes provisi
[normal]ons to
[normal] promote
[normal] flexible working
[normal] and shared parental leave and aims to promote opportunities for women in the workforce generally but would also apply to women in academic careers. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A new £75 million Postgraduate Support Fund will be available from 2014/1
[normal]5 - 2015/16.
[normal]  
[normal]BIS and HEFCE jointly announced 
[normal]in
[normal] July 2013, £25 million funding in 2014/15 for a Postgraduate 
[normal]Support
[normal] Scheme (PSS) to pilot projects to test different ways of financing postgraduate study and attract students from less advantaged 
[normal]backgrounds; and in areas that support the Government’s ambitions for economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This followed the Government’s announcement 
[normal]in
[normal] June
[normal] 2013
[normal], that
[normal] Government will refocus £50 million from the National Scholarship Programme (NSP) to support postgraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
[normal]  Findings from the PS
[normal]S
[normal] 
[normal]will inform the f
[normal]ramework for the NSP
[normal] Postgraduate 
[normal]fund 
[normal]in 2015/16; as well as inform
[normal] the criteria for what constitutes 
[normal]“
[normal]disadvantaged
[normal]”
[normal] and 
[normal]“
[normal]less advantaged
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]at this level of education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] PSS
[normal] will be administered by HEFCE
[normal] who
[normal] will allocate the money competitively to 
[normal]HEIs and further education 
[normal]colleges with postgraduate provision, and wi
[normal]ll also attract additional funding from the private sector or contributions from the institutions own resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]44.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Research Excellence Framework
[normal] (REF
[normal])
[normal] promotes equality and diversity in research careers in a number of ways.
[normal] 
[normal] HEIs are strongly encourage
[normal]d to submit the excellent research of all eligible staff; individuals whose circumstances have constrained their ability to undertake research are able to submit fewer outputs without penalty in the assessment. 
[normal] 
[normal]Each HEI is also required to develop, document and apply a code of practice on the fair and transparent selection of staff for their REF submission. In addition,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the quality of the research environment will be assessed as part of submissions to the REF; ea
[normal]ch submission will be required to provide evidence as to how the submitted unit promotes equality and diversity. 
[normal] 
[normal]By including equality and diversity measures as part of the assessment process, universities and research institutions are required to conside
[normal]r them as an integral part of their research work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The measures to promote equality and diversity through the REF have been informed by a review of the equality measures taken in the 2008 RAE, and by the work of the REF Equalities and Diversity Advisory G
[normal]roup, which was established specifically to provide expert advice on the development of equality and diversity measures in the REF
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]46.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In January 2013 Research Councils UK set out the expectation that equality and diversity should be embedded at all levels a
[normal]s part of good research practice. Those institut
[normal]ions
[normal] in receipt of research funding will be expected to provide evidence of ways in which equality and diversity issues are managed at both an institutional and departmental level. This evidence can include p
[normal]articipation in schemes such as Athena Swan or Project Juno
[normal].  F
[normal]unding is not contingent on formal accreditation requirement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]47.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As mentioned in paragraph 34, i
[normal]n a letter sent in 
[normal]July 2011, Dame Sally Davis
[normal],
[normal] Chief Medical Officer
[normal],
[normal] set out her expectation tha
[normal]t all medical schools woul
[normal]d have to have achieved at least
[normal] an Athena Swan Silver Award in order to be considered in the next procurement round for NIHR Biomedi
[normal]cal Research Centres and Units.  This has given considerable impetus to the Charter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]48.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The results
[normal] of 
[normal]a review of the Science and Society programme, run by the Department of Business Innovation and Skills,
[normal] included the need for a greater focus on engaging the “hard to reach”, people who don’t think that science is for them and the disadvantaged.  This 
[normal]will result in an increased targeting of and joining up of resources (including by delivery partners) to have maximum impact for those groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]49.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As mentioned in the introduction, t
[normal]he Government is also funding 
[normal]the STEM Diversity Programme
[normal] is being jointly 
[normal]led 
[normal]by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society
[normal].  It 
[normal]aims to
[normal] understand and address the issues of diversity in the STEM workforce and is looking at a range of issues including 
[normal]the business case for diversity, the make-up of the scientific wor
[normal]kforce and apprenticeships as a route to engineering
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]50.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government funds STEMNET to run the STEM Ambassador programme which raises awareness amongst children and 
[normal]young
[normal] people of the range of careers
[normal] [bold]that science and technical qualifications offer and provid
[normal]e stimulating scientific activities to increase their interest in STEM subjects.
[normal] 
[normal] 40% of 
[normal]the 25,000 
[normal]STEM ambassadors are women. The Department of Business Innovation and Skills commissioned STEMNET to run a pilot of the STEM Ambassador programme in Higher 
[normal]Education Institutions which will report at the end of August 2013. 
[normal] This was a result of 
[normal]evidence
[normal] 
[normal]that even at the undergraduate stage, STEM students are not fully aware of the range of opportunities available to them.  
[normal]The initial findings have been ver
[normal]y positive and this project aims to help undergraduates better understand the career options available to them, including entering academia.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]51.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government also funds the National Careers Service which provides independent, impartial advice to anyone, set in 
[normal]the context of an individual’s needs and priorities. Prime Contractors for the service already operate to key performance targets which include promoting equality of opportunity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion
[normal]52.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The issue of a lack of women in STEM careers is particularly acu
[normal]te in some disciplines.  It is a long standing problem resulting from a range of factors including some intractable ones including about unconscious bias and culture.  
[normal] Newer career paths seen as having job satisfaction and good financial remuneration do not seem to have resulted in a significant increase in the number or women choosing the profession
[normal].  
[normal]Women are underrepresented in the workforce in general and this is 
[normal]replicated in the STEM sector and in academia, particularly at senior levels. Although there has been lots of progress over recent years, there is still significant work required to ensure that women, as well as other underrepresented groups, are able to a
[normal]ccess and progress in STEM careers both in industry and academia.
[normal]53.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] Over recent years a greater awareness of the issue of gender diversity have developed and the some very good practice is being undertaken to address it.  Government is taking a lead by putt
[normal]ing the right equality and diversity legislative framework in place and providing funding via various routes to support a diverse STEM workforce, including through the STEM Diversity Programme.
[normal]54.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Research demonstrates that action is needed at all stages of t
[normal]he education and career pipeline if we are to encourage 
[normal]more people 
[normal]into STEM education and careers and then retain them within the disciplines which they trained.  Government is investing in initiatives such as the STEMNET STEM Ambassador scheme, Big Bang
[normal] Fair and National Science and Engineering Competition, which aim to engage young people in STEM so that they are motivated to pursue a STEM career in the future.
[normal]55.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government recognises the need to ensure that we have sufficient people entering the STEM wor
[normal]kforce to maintain the UK
[normal]’
[normal]s leadership in many of the STEM sectors and in scientific research. Through the Industrial Strategies, which are being developed for priority sectors, mechanisms for addressing industries’ skills needs are being designed in conju
[normal]nction with relevant stakeholders. However the Government does not view people with STEM skills and qualifications working outside STEM sectors as a loss. Industry tells us that STEM skills are valued wherever they are deployed in the economy and so provid
[normal]ed women are making informed and active choices to move away from a STEM career we should recognise the value and contribution of the STEM skills elsewhere in the economy.
