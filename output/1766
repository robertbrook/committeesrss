defaulte
default Government is committed to promoting equality in the workplace as our 
defaulttrack record 
defaulton positive action, 
defaulttransparency, flexible working and

default 
defaultWe are committed to ensuring that the

defaultScience, Technology, Engineering and Maths
default 
default(STEM) 
defaultworkforce is diverse, reflect
defaults
default wider society and makes use of all the talents available to it. 
default 
defaultD
defaultespite positive progress, there are still too many groups under-represented in this sector.

defaultWhen considering career progression for women in STEM it is important to consider the diversity of other careers as a comparator.  Although some STEM disciplines do particularly badly 
defaultin the number of women they attract and retain, there remains a general problem with unequal 
defaultcareer progression 
defaultfor women across the workforce as a whole.  
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen are 46% of the workforce
default, but their representation falls in more senior positions: women ma
defaultke up only 33% of managers, directors and senior officials
default and only 14
default% of FTSE250 board members
default.
default  
defaultOverall 
default12 per cent 
defaultof FTSE 100 board appointments since 1
default 
defaultMarch 201
default3
default have gone to women.
default  
defaultThe proportions of women in management vary in different industr
defaulties. For example, women make up 55% of corporate managers and senior officials in the public sector but only 6% in retail, food, accommodation and services
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWomen outnumber men in HE 
defaultat undergraduate level
default:
default they have lower drop-out levels and better atta
defaultinment levels. 
default Although there is
default variability in specific subject participation rates,
default&#xa0;
defaultwomen’s representation is higher than men’s in most subject areas.

defaultIn 2011/12 47% of 
defaultmasters
default students studying STEM subjects were female compared with 56% of masters students studying non-STEM subjects.  At PhD level, 44% of STEM PhD students were female compared with 51% in non-STEM subjects.  No central data is collected on lecturers specifical

defaultfemale and 26% of professors with a non-STEM cost-centre were female

defaultThe Government’s approach
default to tackling lack of diversity in STEM careers
default 
defaultis to encourage diversity in the STEM workforce by 
defaultraising awareness of different STEM careers and embedding and mainstreaming equality and diversity 
defaultthrough a number of the programmes we fund, and those of th
defaulte partners with which we work. This build
defaults
default on the wider work of the government to promote inclusive workplaces. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA broad mix of STEM activities and wider societal programmes are supported by science and research 
defaultfunding
default and these have a major impact on di
defaultversity in the STEM workforce. 
default 
defaultThese include the work of STEMNET
default and the STEM Ambassadors to encourage a diverse STEM pipeline; the National Academies’ fellowships; Research Councils’ PhD and fellowships awards; and the Big Bang Fair
default and 
defaultNational Scien
defaultce and Engineering Competition
default. 
default 
defaultBetter value can be realised through these broader activities and through better direction of existing diversity projects
default. 
default 
defaultBy embedding good practice on gender issues within our other programmes and partner organisations,
default and given the right incentives and direction, we expect these to establish a wide reach and 
defaulthave a significant
default impact on all areas of diversity and 
defaultequality in the STEM workforce.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBIS funds the 
defaultRoyal Society and Roy

defaulti
defaultn partnership with the 
defaultprofessional 
defaultinstitutions, industry and others
default,
default aimed at understanding and addressing issues of diversity in the STEM workforce.  
defaultWe want the STEM Diversity programme to achieve significant improvements in the 
defaultdiversity of the STEM workforce by identifying and r

defaultretention and progression rates for people once they join the workforce. Importantly the STEM Diversity Programme is looking at issues affecting 
defaultall m
defaultinority or disadvantaged groups, not gender alone.  This also aligns with the wider government approach to equalities which move away from a more strand specific perspective.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering are submitting evidence t
defaulto this inquiry which will provide more detail of their activities under the STEM Diversity Programme.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Women's Business Council (WBC) was set up to look at ways of maximising women's contribution to economic growth and 
defaultconsider how best to
default remov
defaulte
default the b
defaultarriers that women face in playing a full part in business and the workplace.  Their report
default included several recommendations on women in STEM.
default  
defaultThe Government is currently drawing up an action plan for implementing the recommendations which will be published in the 
defaultautumn
default.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSTEM
default careers in both industry and academia require a specialist skill set.  More is being done to encourage both women and men into this sector via vocational routes such as apprenticeships, however the main route of entry, particularly into senior specialist 
defaultroles or academic positions
default,
default remains through the
default 
defaultHE route. 
default 
defaultTherefore in order to increase the number of women in science, it is important to address the issue of access and retention at HE level.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government is committed to access to HE based on talen
defaultt and potential. 
default 
defaultIn HE we have introduced a new framework for widening participation with increased responsibility placed on HEIs. 
default 
defaultThis includes arrangements for annual access agreements.
default 
default HEIs agree their own access agreement measures and targets with t
defaulthe independent Director of Fair Access, in line with their own particular mission and challenges, and these can include targets on gender.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have also asked the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) and the 
defaultHigher Education 
defaultFunding Council for England
default, in consultation with the HE sector, to develop a national strategy for access and student success. The overarching aim in developing the strategy is to ensure that everyone with the potential to benefit from higher education has an equal opportunity to p
defaultarticipate and succeed, regardless of background, age, ethnicity, disability or gender. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe interim report
default on the development of the new strategy has highlighted the continuing disparity in entry rates between men and women in HE and showed how these mi
defaultrror the differences between men and women in the A level population before HE entry.  Further consideration will be given to this 
default(
defaultand other equality and diversity issues
default)
default as the national strategy is developed through to autumn 2013.

default 
defaulta STEM Strategy 
defaultin March 2011. This contains 20 recommendations for Government and Business to take 
defaultforward to encourage more 
defaultyoung people to study and pursue a career in science, technology, engineering and maths. The
default first five recommendations in the Strategy are assigned to Business to take forward, and this includes recommendation 4 which is to "address gender bias".
default 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Department 
defaultfor Employment and Learning Northern Ireland 
defaulthas funded a post to work with business to address th
defaultese recommendations. This role is known as the 'STEM Business Co-ordinator'. 
default 
defaultAs part of this work the STEM Business Co-ordinator recently organised a STEM gender seminar, entitled, 'Are you getting the balance right', which was attended by over 70 local b
defaultusiness representatives and opened by the Minister for Employment and Learning, Dr Stephen Farry, MLA. Following the event, the STEM Business co-ordinator is producing a set of Good Practice Guidelines and a Business Charter.
default 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default1) 
default 
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? 
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnalysis by BIS 
defaulthas indicated that the lower number of women in STEM subjects is linked to A level subject choi
defaultce
default.  
defaultThis in turn is affected by progression from GCSE with those achieving A* at GCSE more likely to go on to A Level, parti
defaultcularly in Physics (see 
defaultAppendix
default B
default)
default 
default 
defaultO
defaultnly 21
default% of students studying A level Physics in 201
default2
default/1
default3
default were women.  
defaultResearch
default by the Institute
default of Physics
default found that 
defaultin 2011, 49% of maintained co-educational schools did not send a single girl to sit physics A level.
default 
defaultThe figure for all secondary schools is 46%.
default  
defaultOf those who achieve science A levels, women are just as likely as men to continue to
default study STEM in HE
default 
default(
defaultsee 
defaultAppendix
default 
defaultC
default.
default)  
defaultThe BIS analysis found:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Department of Education analysis of the GCSE results for 2013 show that although A*-A an
defaultd A*-C GCSE pass rates are down
default,
default there are some positive trends including an increase in the take-up of the separate sciences. There are also positive initial findings in terms of gender an
defaultd
default GCSE take up. The increases 
defaultseen in
default entries in the separate scien
defaultces are largely because more girls are taking up these subjects. Entries by girls in biology are up 8.6% compared to 1.6% for boys. In chemistry, entries by girls have risen by 8.4% compared to only 0.8% for boys, while physics entries by girls are up 6.5%
default, with boys falling by 1.7%
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch shows that c
defaulthildren as young as ten already see a career in science as ‘not for me
default’. 
default 
defaultResearchers
default also found that parents and 
defaultchildren
default still see science careers as predominantly ‘for boys’.
default  
defaultThe investigation 
defaultfound further evidence to suggest that families, teachers and schools play a part in creating gender patterns of subject choice.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst women are more highly represented in 
defaultundergraduate
default study there is emerging evidence which suggests that this does not t
defaultranslate into postgraduate 
defaultlevel education.  Recent research by the Higher Education A
defaultcademy (HEA)
default suggests that in progression to research degrees the men’s rate is greater than women’s.  The authors report that gender diff
defaulterences are not limited to the 
defaultSTEM disciplines, but are seen almost across the board, including in the arts, humanities and social sciences.
default 
default 
defaultFurther research and 
defaultinvestigat
defaultion is required
default to establish the reason
defaults
default for this.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHEFCE has published a report
default 
defaultpresenting “T
defaulthe trends in trans
defaultition from undergraduate to postgraduate study
default”
default, focusing on transition within one year for 
defaultfull-time first degree UK domiciled qualifiers 
defaultfrom English higher education institutions (HEIs) between 2002-03 and 2010-11.
default  
defaultWhilst the report did find that men w
defaultere more likely to p
defaultrog
defaultress to taught masters and post
defaultgraduate
default research course
defaults than women, differences by gender
default were consistent by broad subject group
default,
default except for STEM taught masters courses, to which women were more likely than men to progress.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposed reasons 
defaultfor 
defaultwhy 
defaultfewer women than men progress in STEM careers include
default:
default lack of visible female role 
defaultmodels
default;
default bias
default or poor practice in the recruitment process
default and
default lower confidence of women and 
defaultthe way 
defaultwomen perform in team assessment exercises.  A s
defaulttudy
default of undergraduates found that 
defaultgood quality internships or work placements had an i
defaultmpact on career intentions so 8 per cent
default of women in their final year who had a period of work placement or an internship d
defaultid
default not intend to study or work in a related ar
defaultea com
defaultpared with 22 per cent of women who had
default not had a work placement or internship.  Careers advice was also found to be vital as men had a higher awareness of career options than women.  Despite being better qualified than men
default, women had lower confiden
defaultce that they had the majority of technical skills that employers look for.
default  This again can be addressed with good quality work placements or internships.
default&#xa0;
default2) When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of 
defaultscientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA healthy science base and a supply of suitably trained STEM graduates are vital for our economy to enable the UK to do well as a nation. A wide range of business groups a
defaultnd governments view the UK Science and STEM base as a key part of economic growth and UK competitiveness.
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnecdotal evidence from employers suggested that STEM skills are 
defaulthighly valued across sectors and important to the sustained growth of the UK economy
default.
default 
defaultSome skills of high value to non-STEM employers are unique to STEM graduates, such as a particularly logical approach to solving problems, enabling some STEM graduates to progress faster in their careers than non-STEM graduate colleagues.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA report from 
defaultthe Royal 
defaultSociety
default of Edinburgh, titled ‘Tapping all our Talents
default’ looked at the situation in Scotland and established that the number of women STEM graduates and postgraduates has increased significantly in recent years, however they also found that women 
defaultare more likely than men to leave the STEM sector. They identified that In Scotland, 27%of women graduates in STEM work in the sector they qualified in, compared with 52% of male graduates.
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default“STEM Graduates in Non-STEM Jobs
default” found t
defaulthe most likely reason students seek employment away from STEM is because other fields are seen to be of more interest, although more practical and career-related reasons are also significant for graduates considering ‘leaving STEM’. 
default 
defaultEarnings (expected pay
default) is an important factor (somewhat more important for males) but not the main motivating factor either to choose STEM degree-related work or not to.
default 
default 
defaultCareer
default prospects and earnings are seen as positive reasons both to enter STEM careers and not to, i.e. the
defaultre are mixed perceptions about where earnings are best.  
defaultThe study found that 
defaultmost graduates had chosen their current job (whether in STEM or unrelated) because it offered interesting work
default.  S
defaulttarting salary and prospective earnings
default were
default a main driver for o
defaultnly a minority of graduates, almost exclusively male.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSTEM skills, such as a logical approach to problem solving, are valued by many different sectors of the economy.  If women leave a STEM career after making an active and informed choice and having had 
defaultan equal opportunity to progress in that STEM career as men, then their skills will be valuable to the UK economy wherever they are used.  
default&#xa0;
default3) What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in acade
defaultmic careers? Are there 
defaultexamples of good practice
default?
default30.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHEIs are independent from the Government and responsible for their own admissions decisions.  
defaultHowever, as mentioned in the introduction, 
defaultHEIs are 
defaultcovered by the
default provisions
default of the Public Sector Equality D
defaultuty, which came into force as 
defaultpart of the Equality Act 2010.  
defaultHEIs should therefore be addressing the issue of gender diversity in order to meet the requirements of th
defaultis
default duty.
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe
default Higher Education
default sector
default has made progress in promoting gender diversity
default and
default there are a number of examples of good practice and existing initiatives adopted by HEIs in order to encourage gender diversity.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Athena Swan Charter
default, operated by the Equality Challenge Unit, is made up of six principles which focus on promoting gend
defaulter equality within Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) any HEI which is committed to challenging these issues can sign up to the charter. Since the Charter
default’
defaults inception
default,
default its membership has increased from 22 institutions in 2006 to 91 in 2013. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSource: Equality Challenge Unit, August 2013
default&#xa0;
default33.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Equality Challenge Unit wh
defaultich operates
default the Charter also issues Athena Swan Awards 
defaultfor 
defaultwhich signatories of the charter can apply. These awards are at three levels
default (
defaultBronze, Silver and Gold
default)
default 
defaultand are 
defaultassessed across a
default number of areas including
default:
default providing positive support for women at career transition, knowing the baseline and Science Engineering and Technology (SET) baseline and changing the culture and gender balance in decision making.
default 
default 
defaultExamples of 
defaultgood practice include departments at the Universities of Edinburgh, York and Queens University Belfast who have all achieved Athena Swan Gold awards for the work they have done to address gender diversity.
default  Because Athena Swan brings about a culture change within the Universities and Departments it benefits everyone who works within them, not only the women.
default&#xa0;
default34.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Equality Challenge Unit and UK Resource Centre for Women in SET (UKRC) commissioned a study
default to
default assess the impact of the Athena Swan programme on the number and level of women in SET In Higher Education since its launch in 2005. The research demonstrated that taking part in the award scheme had institutional, departmental and individual impacts and 
defaultthat taking part in the Athena Swan Awards had had an impact on the culture of the institutions involved helping to raise awareness of gender inequality and career progression issues. It also found that in departments 
defaultthat
default were renewing their Award there h
defaultad been changes in the representation of women at higher academic grades and the number of women applying for promotion.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe graph below shows that the proportion of chemistry professors in the two Chemistry departments which hold Athena Swan gold awards 
defaultis increasing faster than the national average. 
default&#xa0;

defaultAthena Swan Award, Measuring Success,
default Equality
default Challenge Unit, August 2013
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default36.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe positive impact of the Athena Swan award scheme was further endorsed by Chief Medical Officer in 2011 when it was a
defaultnnounced that the National Institute for Heath Research would only expect to shortlist medical schools for research funding if the school held a Silver Athena Swan Award. 
default&#xa0;
default37.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA range of other initiatives exist which encourage women to study STEM subjects and
default 
defaultto remain in Academic research;
default&#xa0;
default4) What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
default38.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government recognises the importance of academic research and innovation and the benefits that this has to society as a whole and the economy. This is demonstrated by the level of financial investment which the government has made and continues to make
default into science and research. 
defaultThe Spending Review in 2010 protected Science &amp; Research programme funding at £4.6 billion per annum over the SR period within a ring-fence. Alongside this, a total allocation of £1.9bn was provided for research capital investme
defaultnt over the 4 years of the Spending Review period 2011-15. 
default&#xa0;
default39.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe want to ensure that women who wish to purse an academic career in a STEM field are able to do so. However
default,
default we also recognise that there is significant value in both women and men with a STEM e
defaultducation entering the workforce outside academia. The STEM industr
defaulties are 
defaultgrowin
defaultg, with
default engineering companies predicting that they will have 2.74 million job openings between 2010-2020
default.
default 
default I
defaultn order to fill these roles and support growth in the economy we ne
defaulted people with the right STEM skills to enter industry.
default&#xa0;
default40.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProviding the right environment to facilitate women remaining in the workforce, including academic careers
default,
default includes putting the correct legislative framework in place
default, such as t
defaulthe Equality Duty crea
defaultted by the Equality Act 2010 (
defaultas mentioned
default in question three)
default.
default 
defaultThe
default government is also introducing legislation to support the retent
defaultion of women in the workforce.  T
defaulthe Children and Families Bill
default,
default which is currently going through 
defaultP
defaultarliament
default,
default includes provisi
defaultons to
default promote
default flexible working
default and shared parental leave and aims to promote opportunities for women in the workforce generally but would also apply to women in academic careers. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default41.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA new £75 million Postgraduate Support Fund will be available from 2014/1
default5 - 2015/16.
default  
defaultBIS and HEFCE jointly announced 
defaultin
default July 2013, £25 million funding in 2014/15 for a Postgraduate 
defaultSupport
default Scheme (PSS) to pilot projects to test different ways of financing postgraduate study and attract students from less advantaged 
defaultbackgrounds; and in areas that support the Government’s ambitions for economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default42.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis followed the Government’s announcement 
defaultin
default June
default 2013
default, that
default Government will refocus £50 million from the National Scholarship Programme (NSP) to support postgraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
default  Findings from the PS
defaultS
default 
defaultwill inform the f
defaultramework for the NSP
default Postgraduate 
defaultfund 
defaultin 2015/16; as well as inform
default the criteria for what constitutes 
default“
defaultdisadvantaged
default”
default and 
default“
defaultless advantaged
default”
default 
defaultat this level of education.
default&#xa0;
default43.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default PSS
default will be administered by HEFCE
default who
default will allocate the money competitively to 
defaultHEIs and further education 
defaultcolleges with postgraduate provision, and wi
defaultll also attract additional funding from the private sector or contributions from the institutions own resources.
default&#xa0;
default44.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultResearch Excellence Framework
default (REF
default)
default promotes equality and diversity in research careers in a number of ways.
default 
default HEIs are strongly encourage
defaultd to submit the excellent research of all eligible staff; individuals whose circumstances have constrained their ability to undertake research are able to submit fewer outputs without penalty in the assessment. 
default 
defaultEach HEI is also required to develop, document and apply a code of practice on the fair and transparent selection of staff for their REF submission. In addition,
default&#xa0;
defaultthe quality of the research environment will be assessed as part of submissions to the REF; ea
defaultch submission will be required to provide evidence as to how the submitted unit promotes equality and diversity. 
default 
defaultBy including equality and diversity measures as part of the assessment process, universities and research institutions are required to conside
defaultr them as an integral part of their research work.
default&#xa0;
default45.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe measures to promote equality and diversity through the REF have been informed by a review of the equality measures taken in the 2008 RAE, and by the work of the REF Equalities and Diversity Advisory G
defaultroup, which was established specifically to provide expert advice on the development of equality and diversity measures in the REF
default.
default&#xa0;
default46.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn January 2013 Research Councils UK set out the expectation that equality and diversity should be embedded at all levels a
defaults part of good research practice. Those institut
defaultions
default in receipt of research funding will be expected to provide evidence of ways in which equality and diversity issues are managed at both an institutional and departmental level. This evidence can include p
defaultarticipation in schemes such as Athena Swan or Project Juno
default.  F
defaultunding is not contingent on formal accreditation requirement. 
default&#xa0;
default47.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs mentioned in paragraph 34, i
defaultn a letter sent in 
defaultJuly 2011, Dame Sally Davis
default,
default Chief Medical Officer
default,
default set out her expectation tha

defaultAs mentioned in the introduction, t
defaulthe Government is also funding 
defaultthe STEM Diversity Programme
default is being jointly 
defaultled 
defaultby the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society
default.  It 
defaultaims to
default understand and address the issues of diversity in the STEM workforce and is looking at a range of issues including 
defaultthe business case for diversity, the make-up of the scientific wor
defaultkforce and apprenticeships as a route to engineering
default.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment funds STEMNET to run the STEM Ambassador programme which raises awareness amongst children and 
defaultyoung
default people of the range of careers
default defaultthat science and technical qualifications offer and provid
defaulte stimulating scientific activities to increase their interest in STEM subjects.
default 
default 40% of 
defaultthe 25,000 
defaultSTEM ambassadors are women. The Department of Business Innovation and Skills commissioned STEMNET to run a pilot of the STEM Ambassador programme in Higher 
defaultEducation Institutions which will report at the end of August 2013. 
default This was a result of 
defaultevidence
default 
defaultthat even at the undergraduate stage, STEM students are not fully aware of the range of opportunities available to them.  
defaultThe initial findings have been ver
defaulty positive and this project aims to help undergraduates better understand the career options available to them, including entering academia.
default&#xa0;
default51.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment also funds the National Careers Service which provides independent, impartial advice to anyone, set in 
defaultthe context of an individual’s needs and priorities. Prime Contractors for the service already operate to key performance targets which include promoting equality of opportunity.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusion
default52.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe issue of a lack of women in STEM careers is particularly acu
defaultte in some disciplines.  It is a long standing problem resulting from a range of factors including some intractable ones including about unconscious bias and culture.  
default Newer career paths seen as having job satisfaction and good financial remuneration do not seem to have resulted in a significant increase in the number or women choosing the profession
default.  
defaultWomen are underrepresented in the workforce in general and this is 
defaultreplicated in the STEM sector and in academia, particularly at senior levels. Although there has been lots of progress over recent years, there is still significant work required to ensure that women, as well as other underrepresented groups, are able to a
defaultccess and progress in STEM careers both in industry and academia.
default53.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Over recent years a greater awareness of the issue of gender diversity have developed and the some very good practice is being undertaken to address it.  Government is taking a lead by putt
defaulting the right equality and diversity legislative framework in place and providing funding via various routes to support a diverse STEM workforce, including through the STEM Diversity Programme.
default54.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch demonstrates that action is needed at all stages of t
defaulthe education and career pipeline if we are to encourage 
defaultmore people 
defaultinto STEM education and careers and then retain them within the disciplines which they trained.  Government is investing in initiatives such as the STEMNET STEM Ambassador scheme, Big Bang
default Fair and National Science and Engineering Competition, which aim to engage young people in STEM so that they are motivated to pursue a STEM career in the future.
default55.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment recognises the need to ensure that we have sufficient people entering the STEM wor
defaultkforce to maintain the UK
default’
defaults leadership in many of the STEM sectors and in scientific research. Through the Industrial Strategies, which are being developed for priority sectors, mechanisms for addressing industries’ skills needs are being designed in conju
defaultnction with relevant stakeholders. However the Government does not view people with STEM skills and qualifications working outside STEM sectors as a loss. Industry tells us that STEM skills are valued wherever they are deployed in the economy and so provid
defaulted women are making informed and active choices to move away from a STEM career we should recognise the value and contribution of the STEM skills elsewhere in the economy.
