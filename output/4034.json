"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Ministry of Justice              \nTRANSFORMING REHABILITATION: INFORMATION SESSIONI understand that, following our recent conversation, the Justice Committee Clerk has now been in touch with the Department to arrange an informal information session \nwith the senior officials who are leading the Transforming Rehabilitation work. I am \npleased that you and your colleagues are able to take up this offer to find out more about our important plans for reducing reoffe\nnding through this \nprogramme\n of r\neforms.\nAs you are aware, the Transforming Rehabilitation Strategy published in May this year set out our plans for transforming the way in which offenders are managed in the community in order to bring down reoffending rates. The key elements of the \nprogramme\n are:\n.\nFunding for the supervision of offenders makes up a sizeable proportion of the Department's budget, and we are faced with the challenge of trying to do better for less. We can either impose further cuts on the structures we have, risking increases in re-offending and leaving short-sentenced offenders without support after release. Or we can reform the system so that it provides more effective rehabilitation at a better value to the taxpayer, in a way that is sustainable for the future — and reinvest\n \nsome of the savings in support for short sentence prisoners, an objective that has wide support. We can only do that if we bring in the best of the public, voluntary and \nprivate sectors to work with offenders: it is the reforms in their totality that will bring \nus closer to the important goal of a year-on-year, incremental reduction in re-offending rates.\n&#xa0;\nBefore you meet with officials in the Department I thought it would be helpful to set \nout the progress we are making carefully, and systematically, to transfer from the \ncurrent system to the new operating model in \nAutumn\n 2014. I have set out below \nsome of the key activities that will be taking place over the course of the next year \naround each key part of the reforms — this includes the work that is being undertaken \naround people transition, testing the system, and the Transforming Rehabilitation \ncompetition.\n1 - Creating the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation Companies: Transition of Probation ServiceThe \nProgramme\n has been engaging closely with the leadership of Probation Trusts, including Human Resources leads, on the support that they need to transition staff to \nthe new system. The \nProgramme\n has established a People Transition Service (PTS) \nto support this work and the PTS have had regular contact — both face-to-face and \nthrough teleconferences - with Trusts about how the plans for moving people to the \nnew system are progressing.\nWe are committed to giving Trusts all the information, resources and support they \nneed to successfully transition to the new system. In November the staff allocation \nprocess will be commenced in all Trusts and we will work with Trusts in the coming \nmonths to clarify any issues relating to the allocation of both people and \ninfrastructure to either the National Probation Service or the Community \nRehabilitation Companies.\nThe \nProgramme\n has worked with operational staff from Trusts to test the design of the future operating model. This has included testing the developing risk allocation \ntool, the case allocation process and the Payment mechanism. We will ensure that \noffenders are clear who their Offender Manager will be by having a considered \nprocess for transferring cases. The Department remains committed to continuing to \nwork closely with Trusts to test key aspects of the new system. We have plans in \nplace to roll out business readiness tests at key stages of implementation so that we \ncan ensure we are managing the transition to the new system in a safe and \nmeasured way.\nThis testing will support our plans for operational delivery to transfer from the \nProbation Trusts to the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation \nCompanies by April 2014. At this point all critical systems and process will be in \nplace, so that in the run up to the Autumn we can focus on ensuring that, at the end \nof the competition, providers will take on viable going concerns. We want there to be \ncontinuity in the staff who are managing the caseload, continuity in the buildings that are being used and fully functioning ICT systems, which is why our focus during this \nperiod will be on ensuring stability as the changes bed in.\nThe creation of the new National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation\nCompanies by April next year is the first phase in a transition that will then continue\n \nwith the award of contracts to providers later next year. We expect to see \ntransformation taking place gradually, as providers then start to re-design services by \ntaking advantage of the new freedom to innovate and bringing together expertise \nfrom a wider range of providers. This phased approach to implementation means that we can move to the new system in a safe and measured way.\n2 - Opening up the Market to a diverse range of new rehabilitation providers and introducing Payment by ResultsThe competition process is now underway, following the publication of the OJEU \nnotice in September.\nWe know from our market engagement events that there is a high level of interest in \nthe competition for offender services from a diverse range of providers across the \nvoluntary, community and private sectors. As of mid-October over 100 \norganisations\n have expressed their interest in competing as potential Tier \nI providers, and of that number 70 have completed the registration process via our e-sourcing portal. It has \nalways been our intention for these reforms to open up the market to a variety of \nproviders. Bringing together the best of the public, private and voluntary sectors will allow us to draw on a broader range of expertise, with payment by results offering a \nstrong incentive to improve upon existing service delivery. For our system really to \nwork, I want, to see a whole range of \norganisations\n working to get to grips with \noffenders' life management problems, signposting them to accommodation, \neducation, or health services, or offering a mentor. The competition process has \nbeen designed to enable bids from a range of \norganisations\n, including the voluntary \nand social sector, and to enable genuine partnerships to be formed in order to tackle \nreoffending. To support this, the Department is embedding good market stewardship \nprinciples into the system so that there is fair, reasonable and transparent treatment \nof all those involved in the direct and indirect provision of services.\nDue to the high level of interest and the subsequent number of clarification questions \nasked by providers in preparing their responses, we have allowed potential providers \nan additional 14 calendar days for their pre-qualification responses to be \nfinalised\n, which must now be submitted by 14 November. The competition timetable remains on track, and the \nProgramme's\n competition team and transition team are working \nclosely together to ensure both \nworkstreams\n are aligned.\n3 - Extending Statutory RehabilitationThe Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which is passing through Parliament and today had \nits second reading in the House, extends statutory supervision for those offenders \nwho receive custodial sentences of less than 12 months. The Bill will enable \nrehabilitation services to be extended to this group of offenders for the first time, and \nto start to address the high reoffending rates we currently see. It demonstrates to \nthem that the Government is serious about giving them the support they need to turn \ntheir backs on crime, while at the same time being clear there will be consequences if \noffenders choose to keep on offending.\n4 - Establishing the Through the Gate Resettlement ServiceWe recently announced that 82 prisons will be designated as 'resettlement prisons' \nso that providers can continue the rehabilitation work they have begun in custody into \nthe community. Work is currently being undertaken by the Department to test the model in the North West. This testing will inform the planning for \nreorgnising\n the \nremainder of the estate in the New Year.\nAssuranceThe \nprogramme\n team has been working closely with the Probation Association, \nProbation Chiefs Association, and with Probation Trusts at each stage of the \nprocess, and we will continue to do so as we implement the reforms. We have \nestablished a Sounding Board, which has been meeting since March, so that we can hear directly from Trust leadership.\nWe have developed a Business and System Readiness process for the \nprogramme\n \nto provide assurance that the restructured business, its systems and support \ninfrastructure, including shared services, are ready to go live.\nThis process aims to:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure that every aspect of the new service and the system reform being\ndeveloped are thoroughly validated prior to proceeding with implementation;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide the \nprogramme\n and the business with the assurance that the system \nperforms as expected in an environment that mimics implementation as closely \nas possible;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupport the 'business as usual' function to ensure that structures and resources \nare in place to respond to the reforms as required\nThe team are currently working with colleagues from Probation Trusts, MoJ and \nNOMS and other stakeholders to define the criteria that will be used to test readiness \nat each stage of transition. The team have developed these criteria with input from \nthe Ministerial Sounding Board as well as discussions with a number of Probation \nTrusts and practitioner groups.\n \nThere is no doubt that this is a significant \nprogramme\n of reforms, but one that we are \nimplementing carefully, with the transition taking place in a series of phases. It is my \nview that we cannot afford to not act now while reoffending rates remain so high. It is \nalso my view that to delay these reforms would create more uncertainty for staff \nwithin Probation Trusts about their future role in the system, uncertainty that I would \nlike to avoid.\nI hope that this information will be useful to you and your Committee colleagues in \npreparing for the areas you wish to focus on during the information session with \nofficials from the \nProgramme\n and I look forward to hearing the detail of the areas that \nyou discuss.\n&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
