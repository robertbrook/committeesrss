"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWildlife and Countryside Link (Link) brings together 42 voluntary organisations concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife and the countryside. Our members practise and advocate environmentally sensitive land management, and encourage respect for and enjoyment of natural landscapes and features, the historic and marine environment and biodiversity. Taken together our members have the support of over 8 million people in the UK and manage over 750,000 hectares of land. \n&#xa0;\nThis response is supported by the following members of Link: \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0; \nLink members fully support the UK\n Government\n’\ns \ncommitment to\n develop \na representative and well-managed ecologically coherent network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in UK seas by 2016. \nThis\n network\n would be\n made up of sites of international importance, such as Special Areas of Conservation\n (SACs)\n for wildlife and Special Protection Areas\n (SPAs)\n for birds, and \nthose\n of national importance, such as Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) in England.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nThis network must meet international principles on ecological coherence, and represent the full range of features in the UK seas as required by the relevant Marine Acts\n (as outlined in the Explanatory notes) as well as by international commitments through the Bern Convention, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive \nand the OSPAR Convention. The full network must hence include ambitious proposals within the commitment to two further tranches of MCZs in English seas in 2015/16, alongside completion of sites of European importance, and must be well managed to maintain sites that are in good condition and recover those that are damaged. Strong coordination with parallel processes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland must also occur to ensure the combined UK network is ecologically coherent. The network is essential not only to stem the alarming decline in marine habitats and species, but also to ensure that the enormous social and economic benefits derived from marine goods and services can be realised for generations to come.\n  \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, Government is in danger of not meeting these commitments. Consequently, Link members want to see greater urgency and ambition towards completing both the internationally and nationally important suite of sites\n \nand ensuring that they are well managed\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nLink’s written evidence submission will focus on the English MCZ process.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nLink members broadly welcome the designation of the first tranche of 27 MCZs as an important first step in designating national sites, but th\nis\n still lea\nves us a long way off completing\n an ecologically coherent network of MPAs. At present, we are unclear how these sites will be managed. Management measures will need to be enacted by the relevant Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (IFCA) or the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), as appropriate with advice from the Statutory Nature Conservation Organisations. There is no clear timetable as to when practical management measures will be developed or come into force, and the manner in which these will take place\n. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important that MCZs provide the most effective protection possible, whilst allowing truly sustainable activities that do not impact the habitats to continue. There is a growing body of scientific evidence that marine ecosystems are in decline as a result of pressure from human activities\n,\n,\n \nincluding from the Government’s own assessment, Charting Progress 2\n.\n Equally, there is firm evidence that the establishment of effective MPAs can bring about recovery of marine communities, whether measured in terms of variety or abundance of species\n. But this recovery relies on effective protection from damaging human activities. \nGiven \nthe current, degraded, state of marine ecosystems, we do not believe that it is sufficient to merely ‘maintain’ the current status of the majority of habitats and species within MCZs. If the network of MPAs is to be effective in reversing decline, improving resilience and promoting recovery of marine ecosystems then conservation objectives need to be more ambitious, with all damaging activities excluded. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nLink believes that Government, managers and regulators need to acknowledge that while sites have been selected for individual features, conservation objectives for, and management of sites need to recognise that the maintenance and restoration of those features requires that the integrity of the site as a whole be maintained or restored. This will of course have added value for other habitats and species (both within and beyond the boundaries of MPAs). In ecological terms, it is worth remembering that while MPAs might be designated for specific species or habitats (e.g. reefs or coarse sediment), it is not only those habitats that are important, but the seabed \nand mobile \ncommunities that they support. In most, if not all cases the ecological links between communities on adjacent habitats are not understood. Where there is a lack of certainty regarding the exact extent or distribution of features within a site, it is especially important that a precautionary approach be adopted and that the whole site is managed in ways compatible with the conservation and restoration of that feature.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst we welcome community based management and involvement in site management decisions, we would strongly endorse the need for statutory underpinning to management mechanisms. There is often a view that voluntary management measures are free or at least cheap, however, this is not the case. We have serious c\noncerns about the efficacy of voluntary management measures as well as value for money\n. W\ne would urge Government to consider more effective methods such as the byelaws that are being brought in to manage European Marine Sites.\n&#xa0;\n      \n3.4 On the question of balancing industry interests compared to environmental \n              \nprotection, we \n              \nwould like point out that sites were selected by stakeholder groups \n              \ndominated by industry and so sites that were likely to be most concern to marine \n              \nindustries were generally dropped in \n              \nfavour of other sites, sometimes of less \n              \necological value. We would therefore consider that \n              \nindustry interests have already \n              \nbeen balanced against environmental protection. We also point out that activities that \n              \nhave a low impact, such as potting are likely to be able to continue at sustainable \n              \nlevels, though damaging activities will need to be managed. In addition the enormous \n              \nlong term economic and social benefits that MPAs will provide in safeguarding \n              \nmarine goods and services will far outweigh the short term costs today. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0; \nWe welcome the current £2 million investment that Government is making in the collection of new information. However, data requirements for the designation of MPAs should be balanced against the practicalities and costs of gathering data in the \nmarine environment and the urgent need to act to protect our marine wildlife. Evidence requirements should therefore be reasonably obtainable considering urgent timescales. A number of groups have been established by Government to look at issues around data acquisition in the marine environment and we think it imperative that opportunities are taken to maximise the benefits of data gathered. Data gathered for other purposes, such as from CEFAS fish surveys or by offshore developers should be\n \ngathered and utilised to inform the designation of MPAs but also for marine planning. This data may not have been collected with the express aim of informing decisions around MCZ designation but may nonetheless be useful. \n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0; \nStrategic coordination between the research programmes of the relevant agencies in devolved administrations across the UK is essential for developing solid evidence at the \nbiogeographic\n scales necessary to adequately understand the ecological processes and species mobility and distribution in our seas.\n&#xa0;4.3\n&#xa0; \nLooking more broadly beyond the urgent need to designate MPAs, Government needs to invest much more in data collection and knowledge gathering in the marine environment. This is important for\n \nmonitoring and\n managing our marine resources and enabling the sustainable use of them by industry\n.\n \nDevelopers who are able to make better informed choices about all the options, including \nlocational\n options, would have greater certainty about their decisions and those that \nhave\nthe\n data to prove that their activities\n \nwill not damage a protected site are more likely to be granted consent to develop in those locations.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0; \nBy prioritising short-term economic losses over environmental protection, including through MPAs, the Government is ignoring the obvious fact \nthat \nwe need a sustainable natural resource base to support many of the economic needs, e.g. fish as a food source, wildlife tourism and recreation, as well as \nfailing in\n their duty to protect the\n bequest of a healthy marine environment for future generations\n. This approach is prioritising short-term gains for the few over the long-term benefits for all. \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nEconomic factors have already shaped the location of, boundaries and size of the recommended MCZs put forward by the regional stakeholder groups in 2012, and which will form the basis for future tranches of MCZs. We have concerns about the balance between environmental factors, social and economic data. Whilst we recognise that economic considerations have a part to play in the selection of MCZs, it is important that these are correctly and accurately measured against both the scientific and environmental benefits of designation of MCZs as well as their social value, and are only considered once as opposed to multiple times. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nWith this in mind, we would like to see improvements made to the Impact Assessments for designation of sites.\n The Government Impact Assessment for the first 31 Tranche 1 sites \nonly\n calculated the costs to industry (often as little as £1,000 per year), and made little attempt to monetise the full benefits or effectively capture the potential non-monetary benefits of ecosystems services\n. These\n includ\ne\n: recreation; sense of wellbeing; capture and storage of carbon; nutrient cycling; processing of wastes; and the fundamental role of a healthy ecosystem in producing seafood. There was also no consideration of the “costs of inaction”, i.e. of not designati\nng\n sites or completing the ecologically coherent network, o\nr\n halting the loss of biodiversity– a fundamental stimulus of the MCZ policy – as well as on the economy or society.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nUK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK \nNEA\n)\n calculated that the contribution of marine biodiversity in the UK alone at £1.7bn per year. Furthermore, the NEA reiterated the need for a network of MPAs by observing that while the UK’s seas are important to people’s quality of life, they are significantly less well protected\n than terrestrial sites. Indeed, \nof the\n 621 Special Areas of Conservation in the UK, only 81 are designated for the marine environment. The NEA also \nemphasised that \nseafloor habitats \n(which\n MCZs \naim to protect)\n are the foundations of the vast array of goods and services that our seas provide\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe species and habitats requiring protection are the building blocks of our marine ecosystems, providing direct use benefits for sustainable fishermen, anglers and divers, as well as recognised non-use benefits to wider society as outlined above. Even when numerous academic studies have sought to ascribe firmer values to the benefits provided by MCZs and our marine ecosystems – as well as the costs of doing nothing – the methodologies are often challenged because they do not fit more traditional economic methods of valuation. But in discounting these studies \nthe Government\n also disregard the huge cost incurred by society from the continued degradation of marine habitats and species. Despite the clear and recognised evidence detailing the social, economic and environmental imperative for this network, the reluctance and difficulties in ascribing firm monetary figures compatible with the narrow framework of valuation within which we currently operate, means \nthat short-term economic costs continue to trump broader long term natural capital valuations. It is important that in future tranches, better consideration is given to the economic, social and environmental benefits of designation and that these are properly balanced against economic costs. Furthermore, greater consideration should be given to the costs of failure to provide appropriate marine protection, and the subsequent impacts on the natural resource base upon which we depend. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0; \nW\ne welcome the designation of the first tranche of MCZs and the commitment to an additional two tranches. However, it should be recognised that these tranches \nneed to be\n ambitious and the gaps in the\n network \nalso \nneed to be \nfilled\n (both for nationally and internationally important sites).\n \nOtherwise, \nthey will fall short of what is needed to deliver the ecologically coherent network that is widely recognised as necessary to help reverse declines and \ndegredation\n of our marine environment\n. Not forgetting that we are obligated to complete this network under commitments through the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the OSPAR Convention\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nWe were disappointed that mobile species such as seabirds, cetaceans, basking sharks and fish were not comprehensively covered by MCZs to dat\ne\n, and that where such species were found to be features of recommended MCZs, they were removed prior to the Tranche 1 consultation. The network will not be representative or ecologically coherent if these species are not adequately and effectively included in the network, which means protecting sites of both national and international importance, and with some urgency. The Link members are not asking for the complete life-cycle of these species to be protected, but the key stages when the\ny\n aggregate and the areas that are known to be important, including mating, breeding, nursery, resting, moulting and feeding areas.\n \nThis approach would be wholly compatible with the requirements relating to mobile marine species contained within the Bern Convention\n.\n \nIn addition\n, we welcome the efforts to review sites for designation of harbour porpoise and bottlenose dolphin SACs, as currently there are no porpoise SACs in English, Welsh or Scottish waters despite an EU Habitats Directive requirement.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nWe urge Government to remain ambitious and committed to delivering this full \necologically coherent \nnetwork and to ensuring appropriate and enforced management of the sites, to help us to meet the 2016 network target as well as Good Environmental Status under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive by 2020. \n&#xa0;\n27 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n International Earth system expert workshop on ocean stresses and impacts.
