defaultafter
default 
default9/11
default,
default w
defaulte saw the overall level of risk faced by the 
defaultpublic
default from 
defaultinternational 
defaultterrorism as the product of a number of factors: 
default&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0; 
defaultthe likelihood of attack (to be reduced

defaultPursuit 
defaultcampaign to uncover and disrupt

defaultthe 
defaultlevel of

default emergency services 
defaultand first responders 
defaultcapability and build
defaulting
default resilience so as to enable the nation to bounce back 
defaultas quickly as possible 
defaultafter attack).  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt takes 
defaulta balance of 
defaultinvestment in all 4 Ps
default 
default(Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare) 
defaultmaterially 
defaultto 
defaultreduce the 
defaultoverall 
defaultrisk, and although Pursue is fundamental it is a part of a larger strategy (with interaction between the Ps, for example 
defaulttaking care that
default over-vigorous Pursuit activities overseas 
defaultdo
default not 
defaultprejudice the efforts of Prevent in our towns and cities).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThat 
defaultunderlying 
defaultrisk management logic remains
default,
default has stood the test of time
default and should be re-endorsed
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen I 
defaultdecided to launch
default work to construct CONTEST in October 2002 we 
defaultwere unsure
default what should be the 
defaultultimate 
defaultaim to which all those involved in 
defaultthe UK 
defaultcounter-terrorism
default effort
default, directly and indirectly, should bend their ef
defaultforts.  For the United States, 
defaultsuffering from the aftermath of 9/11
default,
default the 
defaultoverriding 
defaultgoal was 
defaultto defeat terrorism and 
default&#xa0;
default“use every tool available to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy their capacity to conduct acts of terror. The final element to the Defeat goal is an aggressive, offensive strategy to eliminate capabilities that allow terrorists to exist and operate - attacking their sanctuaries; leadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and finances”.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter much debate, we concluded
default on the other hand
default that
default whilst sharing that absolute determination to protect
default the public, for the UK the
default appropriate strategy should start from denying the terrori
defaultsts that which they most sought, namely the creation of conditions of insecurity and fear amongst the public.  The strategic aim of CONTEST 
default– to reduce the risk in order to be able to maintain normality - 
defaulthas remained 
defaultconstant
default since then
default,
default 
defaultfrom its acceptance as gove
defaultrnment strategy in 2003 to date
default. Formally: 
default&#xa0;
default“The aim of CONTEST is to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe caveats 
default‘freely’ and ‘with confidence’ 
defaultthat we added 
defaultare, however, 
defaultvery important 
defaultespecially 
defaultwhen it comes to the Pursue strand.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultBy 
default‘
defaultfreely
default’
default should mean
default without having to sacrifice the values and liberties of a free democratic society. 
default 
defaultFurther tuning of counter-terrorism powers in the light of experience and of shifts in the modus operandi of terrorist groups must be expected, such as has already happened with TPIMS, 
defaultstop and search powers and reducing the length of time for which people can be held before charge for terrorist offences to 14 days.  But further 
defaultchanges 
defaultshould be at the margins, since the fundamental approach to 
defaultUK 
defaultCT legislation is sound in relation to the likely 
defaulttrajectory of the threat over the next few years.
default  Improved miniaturisation and reliability of the relevant technologies may, however, make it 
defaulteasier
default remotely to monitor the whereabouts 
defaultand communications 
defaultof 
defaulttagged convicted terrorist 
defaultoffenders 
defaultreleased 
defaulton licence in the community
default, an issue that will increase in salience as more of those guilty of terrorism related offences come to the end of their terms of imprisonment.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe caveat ‘with confidence’
default is also important.
default 
defaultWe can see the nation enjoying national security when there is maintenance of trust in the ability of the authorities to enable normal life to continue, 
defaultthat is, with 
defaultan absence of fear of attack, with 
defaultmarkets stable, inward investment
default flourishing
default, international travel safeguarded, overseas visitors a
defaultrriving and welcomed and so on.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultBy th
defaulte
default fundamental standard 
defaultof that aim the CONTEST strategy is
default succeed
defaulting
default, as was well demonstrated by the safe
default and secure
default Olympic Games last year
default.  
defaultI see no reason to 
defaultalter the aim
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe success of Pursue (and equivalent efforts by allies 
defaultand partners overseas) has been
default 
defaultnot 
defaultonly in disrupting networks in the UK and their links overseas (including a significant number of major plots that have been well reported
default in the media
default), but also making it much harder 
defaultfor violent jihadists 
defaultto operate in the UK without detection.  The effect has, as the Committee
default has recognised, been a
default shift 
defaultin the UK 
defaultfrom large-scale plots that require long term planning, organisation (including support from trained jihadists overseas) and finance 
defaultto smaller, cruder local attacks.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should be b
defaultorne in mind, however, that such a
default 
defaultmutation
default 
defaultin the threat 
defaultcould quickly reverse if the pressure was taken off, and if jihadists were to regain the initiativ
defaulte in havens overseas such as 
defaultYemen
default,
default and as 
defaultal-
defaultShaba
defaultab
default threatens in
default Somalia.  
defaultThe 
defaultAQ 
defaultprinter cartridge plot 
defaultout of Yemen 
defaultuncovered at Luton airport showed how terrorists far afield can threaten our security.
default  It must also be remembered that an increased threat of individual acts of violence increases the 
defaultdifficulty of the 
defaultdemands on the intelligence and security services to forestall attacks whilst still avoiding oppressive and counter-productive surveillance of the community
default as a whole
default.  And as the aftermath of the Woolwich murder showed the authorities also need to be able to stifle provocations from the extreme right that could threaten to undermine harmony in our town and cities.. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch developments in the terrorist threat will intensify the tension between nations that unilaterally defend their interests with military means - including by targeted killing and in 
defaultfuture by offensive use of 
defaultcyberspace – and those who seek collective security
default under international human
default rights 
defaultlaw
default.  A current example is the use of international humanitarian law to justify 
defaultlethal 
defaultUS armed 
defaultUAV
default attacks 
defaultoutside a recognised battle-space 
defaulton those regarded by their past 
defaultor current 
defaulthostile 
defaultterrorist activity
default as having foregone their non-combatant immunity.  Other nations such as the UK will be seeking to defend themselves within the different legal construct of international human rights law, authorising lethal force only when hostile intent is actually being shown. We will see more examples of overlapping legal regimes operating in a single geographical space as nations try to protect their interests against terrorist and criminal movements in ungoverned spaces overseas. 
defaultThe Committee will, I am sure, consider the ethically ambiguous position of the British public
default that has
default benefitted in that respect from the US armed UAV 
defaultprogramme 
defaultthat has removed several leading ter
defaultro
defaultrists who had been associated with plans to attack the UK and UK interests, measures that would not 
defaultlegally 
defaultbe permitted to the UK
default under the 
defaultoverseas part of the 
defaultPursue strategy
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultTerrorists will also adapt 
defaulttheir methods 
defaultto minimise the risk of failure
default.  In
default the future the biggest change in the conflict environment may well be in cyberspace
default,
default given our increasing dependence on cyber systems and the connectivity provided already by 8 billion users of mobile devices
default,
default and this may 
defaultmake it more likely that 
defaultviolence
default is expressed against us 
defaultfrom a safe distance lowering the risks to the attackers and lowering their threshold of violence.
default&#xa0;
defaultApplying the principle of 
defaultsubsidiarity
default, security issues that can be handled locally should be: there is no need for the concept of national security to become unnecessarily centralised. 
default 
defaultPersonal security, in the sense of absence of fear in one’s home or workplace or when travelling, has traditionally been seen as a matter for local police services.  
defaultThese services, for example, play an important part in everyday preventive policing 
defaultrelevant to the success of both
default the Pursue and 
defaultthe Prevent stra
defaultnds,
default something that needs to be recognised by the new Policing and Crime Commissioners
default at a time when policing resources are under huge strain
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultEspecially since 9/11
default, however, it has become increasingly clear that important aspects of personal security are now national policy issues, because they have international roots in the activities of terrorists
default that see themselves as sharing a global religious ideology.
default 
default  T
defaulthere is 
defaultthus 
defaulta continuing need for a 
defaultstrong 
defaultnational counter-terrorism strategy to direct and align efforts supported by effective 
defaultnational 
defaultintelligence and police capability
default working in harmony.
default  The recent transfer of policy responsibility for the subject of serious and organised crime within the Home Office to OSCT to sit alongside counter-terrorism policy is prudent, given that we may see increasing overlap, or at least links, between criminal and terrorist gangs and that will include issues such as countering terrorist financing and terrorist access to cyber hacking capabilities.
default  
defaultOne consequence of the spread of cyber attack capabilities is that no longer can the 
defaultinternational community impose sanctions (such as the UN sanctions on Iran) and not expect the nation concerned to fight back with cyber means either directly or by proxies.  Another is that commercial companies overseas will find themselves the subject of cyber 
defaultor other form of 
defaultattack (for example after an environmental disaster or simply because they represent Western 
default‘Crusader’ 
defaultcapitalism).  It will be important that OSCT, with the agencies involved, look
defaults
default broadly at how such hostile long term developments can be countered under a future Pursue strategy.
default&#xa0;
defaultDoes that also argue for transferring the responsibility for police leadership in counter-terrorism from the Metropolitan Police Service (the Met) to the National Crime Agency
default (NCA)
default?  
defaultOne of the great successes of the last decade for the UK has been the partnership between the police service and the intelligence and security community
default, and their relationship with the Crown Prosecution Service, something 
defaultwith which that most nations struggle
default.  This 
defaultfortunate position 
defaultrests on established relations of trust between 
defaultdifferent 
defaultorganisations that have, rightly, different powers
default,
default mandates
default and cultures
default.  That cooperation has been successfully tested in circumstances of terrorist attack and attempted attack
default, and in the successful conviction of terrorists in the Courts
default.  Of course, the present arrangements involving the Security Service and the Met and the other police services in England and Wales and Scotland are not the only possible ones
default, nor necessarily
default the most economical.  But they have evolved under fire and I would be very cautious about seeking to replace them with a theoretical structure that might look tidier on paper, such as giving the lead to the NCA, until we have seen both a significant diminution in the thre
defaultat and 
defaultan NCA that has established itself firmly as being on the top of its game in relation to serious organised criminality. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, given the serious counter-terrorist effort still required in the UK, I would see great advantage in an all party statement from 
defaultthe Committee
default that the NCA 
defaultshould
default be given at least 5 years to bed down before the topic of counter-terrorism 
defaultresponsibility 
defaultis reconsidered.  What would erode unity of purpose and divert valuable nervous energy from the Pursue CT mission would be for officers on all sides to feel uncertain about the structure and their place in it over the next few years.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe purpose of Pursue is to stop terrorist attacks in this country and against our interest overseas. This means detecting and investigating threats at the earliest possible stage
default and 
defaultdisrupting terrorist activity before it can endanger the public and, wherever possible, prosecuting those responsible. 
default The key to Pursue therefore is pre-emptive intelligence, soundly assessed.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch intelligence can come from three sources: 
defaultvolunteered from the community; accessed from intelligence sources, including traditional and new 
defaultsecret sources
default (such as social media intelligence)
default; and acquired from overseas liaisons.  Although intelligence oversight is the province of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, the Home Affairs Committee may wish to reaffirm the importance of all three of the
defaultse
default avenues for accessing pre-emptive intelligence to allow terrorists to be identified, networks and attacks to be disrupted and those responsible for criminal acts brought to justice.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLooking ahead, it will be essential to an effective Pursuit campaign for the authorities to be able to continue to access and 
defaultanalyse
default 
defaultstored 
defaultcommunications meta-data and thus 
defaultuncover 
defaultthe communications of terrorist suspects and their 
defaultbackers and 
defaultfinanciers
default, even when these are hidden in the 
defaultvast global volumes of the 
defaultinternet.  Following the 
defaultcontroversy over revelations by
default Mr Snowden of details of the capabilities of the US and UK intelligence communities to achieve precisely that there is the danger that 
defaultwell-meaning but 
defaultexaggerated 
defaultconcerns over privacy
default, international information sharing
default 
defaultand the effectiveness of oversight will hinder 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture ability to track terrorists
default at home at abroad.  T
defaulthe Pursue effort
default would be seriously undermined by misguided efforts to rush in new European or national regulation
default or by failure by Parliament to keep up to date UK legislation on internet communications data
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is likewise
default important to Pursue that the 
defaultdetailed 
defaultsources 
defaultand methods 
defaultof intelligence 
defaultwork 
defaultand 
defaultof 
defaultinvestigations 
defaultby police and Security Service do not become known to the terrorists themselves
default thus making their ambitions to harm us much easier to achieve
default.
default  The proceedings of relevant criminal and civil cases have already revealed much of how the security authorities operate, and 
defaultjudicial proceedings in this country 
default- civil as well as criminal - 
defaultmust be such as to be able to handle sensitive and secret material to 
defaultpre
defaultserve the interests of national security 
defaultwhilst dispensing
default justice.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe spread of existing 
defaultand developing 
defaulttechnology will create dangers, for example with ever more sophisticated IEDs drawing on mobile phone and shaped charge technology, improvised communications networks being used by terrorists (as seen in the Mumbai attack), and improvised weapons systems where current conflicts already provide a reservoir of weapons, including surface to air missile systems as well as a training and hardening experience for British jihadists who are likely to seek to import their new skills into domestic ter
defaultr
defaultorism. The protection of UK and Western interests overseas
default,
default such as in aviation, oil and extractive industries
default,
default may well be
defaultcome
default more difficult, as was seen in the attack earlier this year by a 30 strong armed AQIM jihadist group on the BP/Statoil natural gas facility
default at
default 
defaultIn 
defaultAmenas
default 
defaultin south eastern Algeria
default near the Libyan border
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother long term factor that should be considered when examining the future of the Pursue strand is that m
defaultost of the additional global population growth 
defaultthat 
defaultexperts predict
default 
defaultwill end up in the overcrowded urban littoral of developing 
defaultnations
default.  The capacity of these urban 
defaultmega-cities
default will be greatly exceeded in terms of security, governance, and basic utilities such as water and sanitation. In the 
defaultvast slums of 
defaultcoastal urban sprawl will hide terrorists, religious fanatics, and violent criminal and pirate gangs with international connections to the West
default including in the UK
default.  Safeguarding 
defaultUK and 
defaultWestern interests and citizens, and when necessary organising rescue and evacuation
default,
default is likely to be a preoccupation of military 
defaultand security 
defaultplanners.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat will be very different 
defaultin future 
defaultis that all of these many hundreds of millions of people living on the margin will nevertheless be electronically interconnected by their mobile devices
default,
default 
defaultexposed to ideologies hostile to us 
defaultand aware of global events as they happen.  The implications 
defaultfor counter-terrorism strategy and the Pursuit of ter
defaultr
defaultorists 
defaultwill be profound
default.
default 
default There should therefore be no let up in the 
defaultwork by HMG to co-operate
default with governments overseas and international organisations to improve global responses to terrorism at source whenever it appears.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the international dimension of our major security risks that drives the need for a redefinition of national security. 
defaultThe increased vulnerability of advanced cyber-networked societies and reliance upon complex just in time global l
defaultogistic networks and
default product sourcing widens the boundary of everyday security.   Interdependent markets, global travel patterns and labour migration interacting with transnational terrorism and piracy all 
defaultinternationalise
default domestic security concerns.  
defaultSuccess in counter-terrorism 
defaulttherefore 
defaultdepends on inte
defaultrnational collaboration
default including with countries whose legal outlook and respect for human rights differ from our own
default. 
default That should not stop us standing up for our values, whilst
default 
defaultencouraging and 
defaultsupporting 
defaultkey 
defaultpartners
default 
defaultto 
defaultbuild up 
defaulttheir capacity to investigate and prosecute terrorists overseas
default.
