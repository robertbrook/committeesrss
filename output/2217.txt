[[[ – Written Evidence]]]&#xa0;RE: Have your Say – Amendments relating to Rights of Way Issues in the Draft Deregulation Bill CM8642&#xa0;I write in support of the coalition of groups that  have been submitting suggested changes to aforesaid  bill. These changes will  afford  certain  clauses within the  section relating to rural byeways. Unsealed and Unclassified Country Roads (UCR's and UUCR's) and Byeways Open to all Traffic (BOAT's). These country roads and lanes are  of ancient  heritage,  used before  the advent of motorised transport  and the current legislation applied to these  lanes is being misappropriated by persons in a way that  is very much against the  public interest.&#xa0;The National Park in which I live The Peak District  National Park (NP) is under constant attack  and threat from off-roaders from home and abroad as it very accessible from major the  conurbations that  surround it ie: Sheffield, Manchester,  Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester  to name but a few. The "pastime" that  is known as off-roading  has increased exponentially in the six years I have lived in this area  and has now achieved plague proportions to the  detriment  to the environment of the  NP&#xa0;Use of recreational  offroading by MPV'S (Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) and Offroad Motorcycles (Trail bikes) is not only destroying these  iconic routes  but it is destroying the very fabric  of our countryside. This is happening particularly in our National Parks which are  supposed to be a haven of tranquillity as an escape from our urban industrial sprawl and where wildlife, flowers etc.  can flourish. The ecology and environment of our country suffers enough from pollution from motor vehicles without taking them into fairly  pristine countryside where in reality they  have no place, obviously there  is a place for  agricultural,  forestry use and bona fide  rescue services.&#xa0;There  has been and still is, massive amounts of money from the  public purse being used to maintain these  byeways to an unnecessary high level only to see them repeatedly destroyed  within days by inappropriate use Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (4x4's  and Quad Bikes) and Trailbikes. Cash is also being wasted with Public Inquiries which take up an inordinate amount of Local Government resources during any time never mind during a time of austerity. The level of bureaucratic  waste is enormous and usually is never mentioned in the final cost of these  exercises  and it is all funded by the  UK taxpayers!&#xa0;There should also be rights of appeal against refusals  by Highway Authorities to make Traffic  Regulation Orders excluding all recreational  motor vehicles. With the exceptions of course for farm vehicles ,and other  previously mentioned exemptions forestry and bona fide  rescue services.&#xa0;There  is another  cost  borne by the  businesses that  operate  with our National Parks and AONB's. Off-roading  is a transient “hobby” the  persons who indulge in off-roading usually come and go within one day and spend very little  in local businesses if anythingat  all.&#xa0;A  problem associated  with off-roading  is the  enforcement of the  law relating to this misuse and the cost of the same. NP Rangers should be given the same enforcement rights as Traffic  Wardens which would enable them to enact fixed  penalty fines to transgressors of the  laws. The cost of enforcement  will  be appropriated  in this case from the  money saved by not having to repair  the  very serious damage caused by off­ roading.&#xa0;What I am saying here is the rougher the  road the  more the off-roading  fraternitywill  be attracted towards it,  if it is reasonably maintained to allow use by only bicycles, walkers and horse riders the cost will  be minimal  by any comparison.&#xa0;In conclusion I suggest that  this deregulation bill offers itself  as an extremely opportune moment to change the current  legislation in a way that  will  benefit  the  vast majority of users of our very precious countryside instead of a few generally unruly users.&#xa0;Thank you for offering  me an opportunity to take  part  in this consultation.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
