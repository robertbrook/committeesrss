defaultSetting aside the obvious conflict of interest (the end of the Code would/will have a huge impact upon our business) I would like
default to make the following comments:
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultHouse Builders will always build to the absolute statutory minimum. 
defaultWhether it is SAP or CSH, Developers will always look to achieve the absolute minimum above what is required. If Code is removed, then overall standards will drop.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultI feel it is reasonable to have a mechanism where some sites are built to a higher standard than others – to mitigate perhaps building on a green field etc.

defaultHouse Builder

defaultsional people very capable for dealing

defaultimplies that the regulations should be simplified or ‘
defaultdumbed
default down’. The major House Builders all use standard specifications and 
defaulthousetypes
default that are already compliant with minimal changes between sites.   
default&#xa0;
default4. 
default              
defaultHow will the removal of the Code allow more houses to be built? It will allow House Builders to make more money (all seems to be reporting healthy profits at the moment) but I struggle to see that more units will be built to address the housing shortage. Certain sites will always be more challenging to build for different factors and regardless of adherence to Code requirements. Also the increase of house prices outstrips the financial cost of Code implementation.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultGiven that a house should last at least 80 years, any improvements made at inception result in the maximum benefit. Lowering quality to achieve a short-term gain seems very shortsighted and will have a long-term negative impact. We should be building dwellings that are more sustainable and efficient for the future, not less.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultWe must not forget the people who will live in these houses, be they the purchaser, tenant or future occupier. Any reduction in statuary requirements will result in poorer quality homes being built and it will be the inhabitants who pay the price, not the developers. There are over 100,000 Code accredited units now in Britain to the benefit of all who live in them.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultThe Code for Sustainable Homes has been set up to fail. When it was controlled by the BRE (and 
defaultEcoHomes
default before it) it was updated every 6 months to ensure it kept pace with Regulations and best practice. Many of the criticisms of the Code could be easily dealt with by updating it timely.
