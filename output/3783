What evidence is there to support this view?defaultThe following background may be helpful:
defaultPrions are infectious pathogens which cause lethal degenerative brain diseases in humans and other mammalian species. These diseases include scrapie in sheep 
defaultand
default goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in human
defaults. Prions are distinct from other infectious agents in 
defaultthat they 
defaultlack their own genetic material. They are thought to be composed of misfolded and aggregated form
defaults
default of one of the body’s own proteins, the prion protein, and propagate by a process of seeded p
defaultrotein polymerisation
default (for review see
default1
default)
default. 
defaultThe prion proteins in different mammalian species are closely similar in structure and p
defaultrions from one species are able to infect another although usu
defaultally with much lower efficiency than between individuals of the same species.
default 
defaultVariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) 
defaultwas first recognised in the UK in 1995 and 
defaultis caused 
defaultby 
defaulta 
defaultstrain of prions quite distinct from those causing classical CJD and which was 
defaultshown to the same as that causing BSE
default2-4
default. 
defaultExposure of the UK population to BSE prions via dietary and other routes was widespre
defaultad. It is estimated that up to three million UK cattle were infected with BSE of which around 750,000 were slaughtered for human consumption
default5
default. In addition to primary infections from direct dietary or other exposure to BSE prions, concerns of secondary, human-to-human transmission have 
defaultaffected endoscopy, ophthalmology, surgery, dentistry, organ transplantation, blood products/transfusion, and emerging stem cell therapies. S
defaultecondary 
defaultinfe
defaultctions have 
defaultbeen documented from use of contaminated blood and blood products
default6-8
default. 
defaultAlthough the number of clinically recognised patients with vCJD has been thankfully relatively small (~200), the number of silent infections 
defaultappears to be 
defaultfar l
defaultarger.
defaultP
defaultrion infections are associated with long 
defaultasymptomatic incubation periods. Studies of the epidemic prion disease kuru in Papua New Guinea
default,
default and of iatrogenic CJD resulting from exposure to contaminated human growth hormone
default,
default demonstrate incubation periods spanning decades
default. Cases of iatrogenic CJD oc
defaultcur every year in the UK, with recent incubation times estimated to be over 35 years. Approximately 3% of patients exposed to human growth hormone have developed clinical disease. I
defaultncubation periods in excess of 50 years have been documented in kuru
default9
default. 
defaultIt is important also to appreciate that these incubation periods arise from same species (human-to-human) 
defaulttransmission, cross-species transmissions are typically associated with much longer incubation periods which may approach the natural lifespan of the species concerned. 
defaultAnother important consideration is that 
defaultit has been know
defaultn
default for some years that infection
default of animals with prions from another species can result in a long
default-
defaultterm infection or carrier state. Such subclinically infected animals may not develop the neurological disease during their lifespan but develop high levels of infectious prions. Transmission
default of such prions to more animals of the same species is typically associated with 100% lethality
default10
default.
defaultUK prevalence estimates
defaultMy laboratory reported in 1997 that in vCJD, in sharp contrast to classical CJD where prio
defaultns are largely confined to the brain and spinal cord, prions were 
defaultmuch 
defaultmore widespread 
defaultin the body 
defaultand may be readily detected in so-called lymphoreticular tissues including the tonsil 
defaultand appendix
default11, 12
default. I 
defaultsuggested at
default that time to the Department of Health that this finding potentially allowed an estimate of the prevalence
default of silent vCJD prion infection in the community by an anonymous screen of archived or discarded surgical appendix or tonsil specimens. 
defaultA number of such studies have since been conducted
default13-17
default. 
defaultA retrospective study of 12,674 archived surgical lymphoret
defaulticular specimens (predominantly appendix) in 2004 found three positives and estimated a prevalence of infection in the UK population of 237 per million (95% confidence interval 49-692 per million)
default14
default. Based on this study a prevalence estima
defaultte of 1 in 4000 was recommended by the 
defaultformer 
defaultSpongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) for managing public health risks
default18, 19
default. Further studies of tonsil specimens did not significantly refine these estimates
default15, 16
default and a further study was initiated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on advice from SEA
defaultC with the aim of analysing a minimum of 30,000 appendix samples. The study found 16 definite positive appendices out of 32,441 suitable samples examined
default,
default equating to a final prevalence estimate of 493 per million (95% CI: 282 to 801 per million)
default17
default.
default The prevalence in those born in 1941-60 (733 per million, 269 to 1596 per million) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 (412 per million, 198 to 758 per 
defaultmillion) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled. 
default This rate is consistent with the range of previous studies but is more precise and has a higher central estimate of around 1 infection in 2000
default equating to around
default 20-30,000 infected carriers in the UK
default. 
defaultThe extraordinary range of incubation periods seen in natural human prion infections and the existence of subclinical carrier states in animal models exposed to prions from another species offer potential explanatio
defaultns for the huge discrepancy between estimates of infection prevalence and clinical cases
default20
default. While such carriers may live a normal lifespan without overt neurological disease, same species subpassage of infectivity is associated with 100% lethality
default10
default arguing that asymptomatic human carriers would pose a distinct risk of transferring a fatal prion infection to others via medical and surgical procedures. Although the risks of iatrogenic prion transmission through s
defaulturgery and solid organ transplantation should not be underestimated, the greatest threat to public safety is thought to be posed by the transfusion of prion-infected blood. The reality of vCJD transmission by this route has been known for some years and st
defaultudy of a small cohort known to have received blood from donors who subsequently developed vCJD suggests the risk is very high to such recipients
default6, 7, 21
default. Emerging experimental evidence from sheep scra
defaultpie
default22
default (thought to be a good model of vCJD
default) are unexpectedly indicating blood transfusion may be a more efficient infection route than direct inoculation into the brain. Indeed, as little as 200
default
defaultl of infected blood is 
defaulte
defaultfficient in transmitting disease by transfusion in sheep
default23
default.
defaultIt is conceivable that there could be some hitherto unknown explanation for abnormal PrP in the appendix, unrelated to vCJD prion infection (
defaultthat is, 
defaultfalse positive
defaults
default). Further work looking at this possibility is being done by HPA using
default appendices removed before the BSE epidemic. However, b
defaultased on a wealth of data from examination of 
defaulthumans and animal tissues
default, a
defaultbnormal 
defaultprion protein 
defaultin the appendix 
defaultis highly likely to be an accurate 
defaultdiagnostic 
defaultmarker for vCJD infection. 
defaultI
defaultt should be note
defaultd that even the alarming estimate of 1 in 2000 infections in the UK population 
defaultcould 
defaultbe an underestimate since the sensitivity of the method used on appendix samples in carriers is not known and there could be significant numbers of false negative
default (true ca
defaultrriers in which abnormal prion protein is not detected in the appendix by these methods)
default, indeed disease-related PrP is sometimes not detected in appendix samples 
defaultfrom
default patients who have died of definite vCJD 
default24
default. 
defaultIn summary, our best estimate today is that ~1 in 2000 of the UK population is infected with vCJD prions. However, it is important to understand that what is really important from a public health risk management perspecti
defaultve is how many people ha
defaultve
default detectable prions in their blood rather 
defaultthan 
defaulta
defaultppendix 
defaultsince it is blood that presents the greatest risk of transmission to others. Consequently, 
defaultprevalence studies using a blood test are 
defaultalso 
defaultneeded (see below).  
defaultdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default defaultHow defaultmight this subclinical infection rate translate to future cases of vCJD?default&#xa0;default What are the key uncertainties in the relationship between subclinical and clinical vCJD?defaultIn order to predict the number of future cases of vCJD we 
defaultwould 
defaultneed to know 
defaultwhat 
defaultproportion
default of subclinical carriers will develop clinical disease, the
default range of 
defaultincubation 
defaultperiods
default, and the mortality from other causes in this group
default prior to the development of clinical prion disease
default. 
defaultIt is possible that, as in some animal models, many of these indi
defaultviduals will be healthy carriers throughout their lives even if they live to advanced age. However, it will be many years before we know how many such subclinically infected individuals 
defaultultimately 
defaultdevelop disease. 
defaultRecently published 
defaultexperiments in mice th
defaultat were genetically engineered to 
defaultmake 
defaulthuman prion protein showed that inoculation of these animals with vCJD usually result
defaulted
default in prion infection in 
defaultlymphoreticular 
defaulttissue, 
defaultbut 
defaultonly a minority of 
defaultthese 
defaultanimals developed clinical disease in their lifetime
default25
default. These experiments are a striking parallel with the current situation in the UK with a remarkably high prevalence of vCJD infection, but a much lower incidence of clinical disease
default20
default.
defaultWe do not under
defaultstand what determin
defaultes whether a person will 
defaultremain a 
defaulthealthy carrier
default of 
defaultprion infection or develop 
defaultthe clinical state, for example whether there are environmental triggers that might lead to a carrier developing the disease. We do know
default,
default however
default,
default of powerful genetic factors that affect susceptibility to, and incubation periods, of prion diseases including vCJD. 
defaultThe most important of these is a polymorphism in the human prion protein itself which exists in two common forms known as M and V so there
default are three genetic types in the population: MM, MV and VV
default26, 27
default. All definite vCJD patients to date have been MM (a genetic type seen in abou
defaultt a third of the population). It is likely that clinical cases will occur in the other genotypes (VV and MV) but may have longer average incubation periods and also may present with a different pattern of disease that may not meet the diagnostic criteria o
defaultf vCJD and indeed may be mistaken for classical CJD
default28, 29
default. One pa
defaulttient with probable vCJD was of the MV genotype
default30
default. 
defaultAll three genotypes were represented in the 16 appendices found to show subclinical vCJD infection in the HPA prevalence 
defaultstudies. 
defaultOther genes have been identified with an effect on disease susceptibility or incubation period (for review see
default31
default)
default.
defaultdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default defaultWhat are the likely routes of infection for vCJD? How have the potential modes of transmission changed over time?defaultThe most likely cause of the primary epidemic of vCJD was 
defaultdietary 
defaultexposure to food products 
defaultcontaining brain or spinal cord tissues from cattle 
defaultinfected with BSE. 
defaultBSE prions also readily infect sheep and it is conceivable sheep-passaged BSE prions could also have been involved. Bovine products were widely used for other 
defaultpurposes, for instance in cosmetics and production of certain medicines including vaccines although no epidemiological link with vCJD has been demonstrated. The number of primary vCJD cases has fallen steadily in recent years. Secondary 
defaulttransmission 
defaultis now
default the principal concern 
defaultthrough blood
default, blood products, tissue or organ donation and contamination of surgical (including dental) instruments
default. 
defaultWhile transmission of classical CJD by surgical instruments and tissue grafts has been well documented, to date vCJ
defaultD transmission between humans has only been documented by via blood transfusion and use of blood products. However, the apparently high carrier state of vCJD prion infection in the UK population and much wider distribution of prions outside the brain and s
defaultpinal cord in vCJD would argue that secondary vCJD cases arising from contaminated surgical instruments or tissue or organ transplantation should be anticipated in the years ahead. 
defaultdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default defaultWhat procedures are currently in place to monitor, control and pdefaultrevent further spread of vCJD across the UK population? What more could be done to reduce the risk posed by vCJD?defaultMonitoring of vCJD clinical incidence is primarily the responsibility of the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit 
default(NCJDRSU) 
defaultin Edinburg
defaulth. Most cases are identified following the referral of 
defaultsuspect cases by local neurologists, psychiatrists, general physicians and GPs to NCJDRSU or the NHS National Prion Clinic
default (
defaultNPC
default) in London
default. Telephone conversations several times weekly, and a formal mo
defaultnthly meeting between 
defaultthe NCJDRSU and NPC
default,
default 
defaultensures complete case coordination. There are concerns that cases 
defaultmight be missed in elderly patients
default where other causes of dementia are common
default, either because the classical clinical features of 
defaultv
defaultCJD are not manif
defaultest, or that investigations required to raise concerns about CJD are not requested, or are misinterpreted. 
defaultSeveral measures have been taken to minimise the risks of transmission by blood 
defaulttransfusion 
defaultor 
defaultuse of 
defaultblood product
defaults
default. 
defaultThe ongoing disruption and cos
defaultts to the NHS as a consequence of 
defaultthese 
defaultmeasures
default -
default of uncertain efficacy or necessity
default -
default&#xa0;
defaultare
default&#xa0;
defaultremarkable. From 1997-2005 a series of measures were introduced, including leucodepletion of blood, sourcing of plasma from non-UK sources, exclusion of transfusion
default recipients from donation, use of recombinant clotting factors for patients with bleeding disorders and ceasing the use of UK plasma for fractionation and export
default32
default.
defaultIn 2010 the cumulative costs to the NHS Blood and Transfusion service were estimated at £540M, with a recurrent annual cost of £40M. Costs associated
default with other parts of the NHS have not been precisely estimated, however, the recurrent annual cost of synthetic clotting factors for patients with bleeding disorders is approximately £200M
default33
default.
defaultConcern regarding secondary transmission of vCJD has also had major effects on public health policy internationally. For exa
defaultmple, the USA and Australia exclude those with a cumulative residence of six months or more in Europe as blood donors
default,
default with considerable disruption to the blood supply in some areas
default and for the US military
default. 
defaultWhat more could be done to reduce the risk posed
default by vCJD? Risk could be effectively managed by: 
default(i) 
defaultthe development of a blood test to allow screening of donated blood for 
defaultvCJD 
defaultprion 
defaultinfection 
defaultthereby allowing exclusion of infected units from use for blood transfusion or production of blood products; (i
defaulti) screening patients due to undergo certain surgical procedures involving tissues at higher risk for prion infection (for example brain, spinal cord, the back of the eye, or certain dental procedures involving nervous tissue) so that particular precaution
defaults could be taken with those testing positive to minimise risk of infection of other patients; (iii) use of effective prion decontamination methods 
defaultto prevent vCJD transmission on surgical instruments
default (prions 
defaultstick avidly to surgical stainless steel and oth
defaulter surfaces and 
defaultare partially resistant to normal hospital sterilisation methods)
default; (iv) effective treatments for prion infection are being developed and might allow not only treatment of patients with the disease, but also treatment of asymptomatic infecte
defaultd individuals (for example those testing positive on suitable blood or other tests) to eradicate the infection before symptoms develop.
defaultOver a decade ago, 
defaultthe Department of Health invited and funded a large number of research proposals to develop novel met
defaulthods for prion decontamination. This led to several products that might be used in a hospital environment. The MRC Prion Unit undertook a significant research project funded by this programme and developed an effective enzyme/detergent mixture that effecti
defaultvely destroyed prions on metal surfaces
default34, 35
default. We were successful in obtaining an industrial partner (DuPont) to turn this laboratory research into a practical product but this was not used in the NHS and is no longer in produ
defaultction. The product was formulated for use as a 
defaultsimple 
defaultpre-soak to prion decontaminate instruments before they went into the standard hospital washer
default-
defaultdisinfector machines. The 
defaultlack
default of take up of this or other prion decontamination technologies 
defaultin the NHS 
defaultprobably
default precluded further commercial investment to develop a second generation product which might have been integrate
defaultd
default into washer
default-
defaultdisinfector
default cycles for 
defaultimproved
default ease of use. 
defaultExtensive research effort internationally has gone into developing a blood te
defaultst for vCJD. My Unit developed the first such test which was reported in the 
defaultLancet
default in 2011
default36
default. 
defaultI
default discussed the test at high level with the Department of Health (Public Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer) in 2011 who advised they were not in 
defaulta 
defaultposition to fund further evaluation or pre
defaultvalence screening and recommended transfer to a commercial partner. Despite further discussions with diagnostics companies
default,
default facilitated by MRC Technology
default,
default no such 
defaultcommercial 
defaultpartner was identified. The clear feedback 
defaultwas 
defaultthat further 
defaulttest development and 
defaulte
defaultvaluation of the test specificity and a UK prevalence study to determine the market for such a test would be needed to make a business case. In order to maintain momentum in translating our technology 
defaultto protect the public health 
defaultthe Unit has, with additio
defaultnal assistance from MRC, confirmed our initial specificity estimates with a much larger control 
defaultcohort. This study was initiated following discussions with Professor Mark Turner (Chair, Prion Working Group of the National Blood Service) and Dr Lorna Willia
defaultmson (Medical &amp; Research Director, NHSBT) regarding the requirements of the UK’s blood services. 
defaultThe NHS Blood and Transfusion (NHSBT), in consultation with other European partners, formalised a common technical specification requiring screening tests achi
defaulteve a minimum diagnostic specificity of 99.5% determined from a cohort of 5000 samples
default37
default.
default 
defaultWe have now analysed 5000 anonymous donor samples provided by the American Red Cross. This is a cohort of samples from a nation with very low exposure to BSE. The conclusion of this study has been no pos
defaultitive reactions from the total of 5000 US samples
default demonstrating adequate 
defaults
defaultpecificity
default for our proposal to 
defaultconduct 
defaulta 
defaultlarge 
defaultscale comparison of 
default 
default20,000 
defaultanonymous blood samples from 
defaultthe 
defaultUK and USA.
default 
defaultThe establishment of accurate prevalence estimates for 
defaultprionaemia will provide the essential information to determine if routine screening for vCJD infection in blood donations, and in patients prior to high risk surgical procedures and tissue and organ donation
default,
default is required. This is not only important from th
defaulte perspective of risk management and protecting the health of the public but also to 
defaultdemonstrate a business case to justify the 
defaultcommercial investment required to 
defaultproduce a 
defaultrobust 
defaulthigh throughput test from our laboratory prototype.
default The primary benefit of co
defaultmmercialising the assay would be the availability of a cost-effective screening test for use with donated blood and organs to prevent iatrogenic infection and safeguard the blood supply. The ability to screen human blood may ultimately obviate the need to 
defaultimport frozen plasma from the USA and allow UK based industries to recommence processing and sale of UK sourced plasma and plasma products.
defaultIn addition to routine screening applications, knowledge of the background level of infection in the general populat
defaultion is required for the interpretation of test results if offered to individuals deemed to at risk of iatrogenic disease some of whom have already sought testing. After the successive tragedies of HIV and HCV infection in groups 
defaultmultiply exposed to blood p
defaultroducts, 
defaultthere is understandably heightened concern about risks of prion disease transmission in blood products. A useable predictive test in these groups may offer an opportunity both for individuals to resolve issues of personal risk, and for anonymous s
defaulttudies to resolve issues of risk for groups of individuals following the formal notification exercise instigated by the HPA. 
defaultFinally, the large international research effort on understanding prion diseases since the arrival of BSE has led to them becoming
default arguably the best understood cause of dementia. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the fundamental molecular mechanisms seen in prion disease may be relevant for much commoner neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and motor neuro
defaultne disease (see
default38
default for lay review). 
defaultA number of potential therapeutics are in development at the MRC Prion Unit and elsewhere internationally that might allow both effective treatment and post-exposu
defaultre prophylaxis to prevent development of clinical disease in healthy but infected individuals.
