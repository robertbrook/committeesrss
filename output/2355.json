(Reclassifying green lanes to become restricted byways will eliminate altogether the costs and bureaucracy involved in the processing of rights of way claims on them. The downgrading of BOATs to restricted byways would have\n \na net nil effect in terms of red tape/bureaucracy. The creation of a right to appeal against a highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order would not be deregulatory but it does, however, fit squarely within the government's localism agenda.)\n&#xa0;\nEverything suggested will have the key benefits of protecting the environment of the national parks and non-vehicle users, and it would eliminate the waste of the public money\n \nwhich is being spent by highway authorities on repairing and re-repairing unsealed lanes damaged by 4x4s and motor bikes.\n&#xa0;\nOverall\n \nthe\n \neconomic\n \nbenefit\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nBritish\n \ntourist\n \nindustry\n \nwould\n \nbe\n \nsignificant.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDavid\n \nLeng\n3 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nEnclosures not published here.\n"
