[[[Written evidence submitted by the Association for the Conservation of Energy]]]The Association for the Conservation of Energy aims to reduce overall energy demand to ensure a secure and sustainable energy future. Through our lobbying, campaigning and research we help to achieve sensible and consistent policy, legislation and targets. ACE works to raise a positive awareness of energy conservation and encourage increased investment in all energy-saving measures. We welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to this inquiry, and are grateful to the Environmental Audit Committee for it. The main points provided in evidence are:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;If you had the chance to bring in a new piece of legislation, what would it be? Each year, backbench MPs enter a ballot for private member's Bills that gives them just this opportunity. Those who come near the top are then bombarded by campaigners seeking a legislative vehicle for their pet issue. Alternatively, an MP who has long harboured a desire to right a perceived wrong might get the opportunity to do so. The Government may also offer one of the high-ranking MPs an off-the-shelf Bill, something they are keen to see in law, but have not specifically timetabled. This year's ballot has been held and the lucky MPs have now made their various dispositions. Top of the pile was Michael Fallon, the Conservative MP for Sevenoaks. His Planning and Energy Bill is specifically designed to re-enforce the "Merton rule'', a planning policy which requires all new buildings over a certain size to cut their carbon emissions by 10 per cent through the use of on-site renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or a wind turbine. I must confess that I had never heard of this rule, despite being a resident of the south London borough that pioneered it. &#xa0;Now Mr Fallon is very much a member of the Thatcherite free market, No Turning Back wing of the Conservative Party. He is not someone you would automatically consider a tree hugger. He would as likely have been in Bali with the climate change zealots over the past fortnight, as he would join the Labour Party. So it is a sign of the political times that Mr Fallon has come top of the private member's ballot and has opted for an environmental measure that, arguably, places extra regulatory pressures on house builders. &#xa0;There is a dilemma here. The Government wants the industry to supply two million new homes by 2016. But the builders say the Merton rule will make this more expensive and want flexibility. The British Property Federation says: "The industry must not be straitjacketed into a single method which may not always work.'' &#xa0;Mr Fallon and others are worried that the Government is ready to water down the Merton rule, which is considered to be one of the few genuine drivers of renewable energy technologies in Britain. Over the summer, Yvette Cooper, the Housing Minister, proposed new planning guidance under which it would be possible to meet the 10 per cent rule by using off-site renewables. In other words, instead of integrating a wind turbine into the new development, the developers could invest in an offshore wind farm which might have been built anyway, thereby failing to improve the provision of non-carbon energy. &#xa0;Miss Cooper has since said that the Government remains committed to the rule. But Mr Fallon, supported by former environment ministers from across the political divide, remains suspicious and wants to put the rule in statute - not to force councils to do it but to prevent the Government removing the option. &#xa0;Free-market conservatives instinctively shy away from regulation, but they recognise posturing on the Left when they see it. On this issue, as on so many others, Labour is good at talking about a problem but poor at delivering the answer - not because they don't care, but because they approach everything from a statist viewpoint. Setting targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions is the easy bit; achieving them is far more difficult. What is most ingenious about the Merton rule is not its potential for energy saving but that councils can adopt it on a voluntary basis and negotiate it locally with developers. Apart from Merton, 25 other boroughs have followed suit. Another 100 want to change their local plans to include the provision. They are doing it without Whitehall having to tell them to. The House Builders Federation would prefer to see a national strategy, rather than leaving this to councils. But is this not just the type of localism we should encourage? &#xa0;2 October 2013&#xa0; http://www.r-e-a.net/news/new-building-regulations-a-missed-opportunity-for-cost-effective-emissions-reduction https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/226965/Part_L_2013_IA.pdf  http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/MAINSD%26C%20SPG%2020130730.pdf; p.38 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/philipjohnston/3644783/Hot-air-is-never-going-to-save-the-world.html http://www.conservatives.com/~/media/Files/Green%2520Papers/Housing-Green-Paper.ashx%3Fdl%3Dtrue; http://www.conservatives.com/~/media/files/downloadable%20files/lce.ashx
