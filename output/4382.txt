[[[Mike Penning MP]]], Minister for Disabled People, 

[[[Dr Bill ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]], Director for Health and Wellbeing, Chief Medical Adviser and Chief Scientist, and 

[[[Jason Feeney]]], Benefits Director, gave evidence.

[[[Q1 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I welcome you to your first appearance before this Committee, Minister?  It is almost three months since you took up your position.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That long?

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Hopefully, it has been enough time to get to grips with your brief.  I wonder if you could introduce your team for the record, please.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: I am Jason Feeney.  I am the Benefits Director at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for Personal Independence Payment (PIP).

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Bill Gunnyeon, Chief Medical Adviser and Director of Health and Wellbeing, DWP.

[[[Q2 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] And you, Minister.  Well, as I say, it is almost three months since you took up the post, so I wonder if you could just very briefly—because we do have a lot of detailed questions—explain which parts of your new job you have found the most challenging.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: May I firstly explain to the Committee that it is a brand new portfolio that the Prime Minister has asked me to take on?  It is a Minister of State portfolio for disabled people, but like any portfolio in government, it actually has myriad other responsibilities as well.  I appreciate you did say “briefly”, Madam Chair, but it is rather a long list.&#xa0;

[[[Q3 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] We have got the list in front of us, so we understand.  I have got a question about the overlap with the Employment Minister.  My question was about “challenging”: what surprised you?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The biggest thing is that it is such a huge portfolio, and a very important portfolio, which is overarching across government.  It is not just within the DWP.  The Prime Minister has specifically asked me to be responsible for the disability portfolio across government to bring government together in a more collegiate way, and I have responsibility to go into the different departments and ask those relevant questions and do those relevant things.  At the same time, there is also the responsibility that goes across government to do with the Paralympic legacy.  It is obviously very important that we build on the legacy from the Paralympics and the Olympics.&#xa0;

[[[Q4 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] I understand that you are working on a DWP disability strategy.  What are going to be the priorities for that strategy, and is that going to include all this cross-cutting government stuff that you just described?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes, it will be.  When we publish it, it will be very much across government.  The key to this is opportunity.  One of the conscious things that I have been looking at very carefully is making sure that we give everybody an opportunity, and that they do not feel trapped within the welfare system, and we must make sure that, at the same time, other Departments step up to the plate by actually working together.  That is very much my portfolio, and I think one of the reasons why the Prime Minister made it a Minister of State role was to give me, if you wish, the clout to go out there and make that sort of thing happen.&#xa0;

[[[Q5 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Is there anything in particular that strikes you as being top of that list of priorities?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: PIP and WCA, which I know the Committee want to talk about this morning, are very challenging.  There is no point hiding away from that, but at the same time, I think it is absolutely right that the reforms that are coming through are done correctly, with the right quality, and at the same time give people the information they need.  It is a challenge; there is no argument about that.  I accept that.&#xa0;

[[[Q6 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] There is some confusion amongst us, certainly, about who is responsible for what with regard to WCA and ESA.  It seems to be shared between you and the Minister for Employment.  Is there a nice, handy definition as to which is your part and which is her part?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.  I have WCA, and she has the rest.&#xa0;

[[[Q7 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] So you are responsible for the medical assessment side of things?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.  &#xa0;

[[[Q8 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] What about ESA and how it is dealt with through Jobcentre Plus?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That is very much hers.&#xa0;

[[[Q9 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] That is the other side of it.  So, you are responsible for it up until a decision is made by a decision-maker, and then it goes on to her.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.  Of course, we are working very closely together, and we have had several discussions as to making sure how my side of that fits firmly into her side, but the Jobcentre Plus side clearly sits with the Employment Minister.&#xa0;

[[[Q10 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] What about the mandatory reconsideration of appeals?  Where does that sit?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That part still sits with me, as I understand it.  &#xa0;

[[[Q11 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] So, until there is a final decision?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It is the Justice Department that actually has the final decision, obviously, because of the tribunals, but the process, if you wish, sits with us.&#xa0;

[[[Q12 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] So, the whole process up to when somebody is in ESA payment; then it goes to the other Minister.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: If I am wrong at any time, pick me up.  Three months in, I am still learning a lot.

[[[Chair:]]] I think that is clear.  Thank you very much.  There have obviously been two big decisions that you have taken, Minister.  I think the first one landed on your desk the first week, and it was about the Independent Living Fund and the court case.  Glenda has some questions on that. &#xa0;

[[[Q13 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] On the Court of Appeal decision on the closure on the Independent Living Fund, have you decided how you are going to respond?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: No, I have not; I will be the decision Minister for that, but I have not received a submission from my officials.  I understand that the court ruling was very much that the Minister had not been given enough written advice around the Equality Act.  I have to say to the Committee that I have not received a submission yet, and of course I cannot in any way indicate what my decision might be, simply because that would prejudice the case as we go forward.&#xa0;

[[[Q14 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Should you not be pushing for that?  There are 22,000 ILF users.  They are in a state of great uncertainty.  Should that not be on the top of your list?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It is very much on the top of my list to get it right, and that is the important thing.  The submission will be different, based on, obviously, the court ruling and information that has come in subsequently since the decision was made on ILF, but it would be wrong and improper—I am sure you will understand, Madam Chair—if I in any way indicate how I am going to make a decision.  I accept it is a very important decision, but I am also sure that the Committee would accept that we have to make sure that I make the decision in an impartial way, and based on what I see in front of me.  I am not seeing anything yet.&#xa0;

[[[Q15 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] But you said you are gathering information.  From whence is that information coming?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I am not gathering information.  Nothing has been submitted.  My officials will continue to gather information, and then I will wait for that submission to come.  I cannot, and I will not, interfere with that process, because otherwise I think you will find that I might possibly be back in the same court situation as before.  I have to look at it as it is submitted to me, but I understand, based on the court ruling, and on the information that has become available since the initial decision, that it will be enclosed in the documentation, but I do not know, because I do not have it yet.&#xa0;

[[[Q16 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] What reasons are your officials giving you for not being able to submit something for your consideration?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Because it is not ready yet.&#xa0;

[[[Q17 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Why?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Because they are gathering information.&#xa0;

[[[Q18 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] From whom?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That, I cannot go into.  You can go around in circles on this, but I will not, in front of this Committee or anywhere else, explain where I may be going on the decision.  It will come to me, and it must be right, and I am sure the Committee would accept that.  The court ruling was quite specific that information had not been given in writing to the Minister to enable her to make the decision based around the Equality Act.  I will make sure that that does not happen to me.&#xa0;

[[[Q19 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] So, you do not know to whom your officials are referring for the information that they will eventually present to you for a decision.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I would expect them to be going to a wide range of stakeholders, and also looking at the information as we go forward.  That is what you would expect me to say.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] I would not, actually, but that is a step forward.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will not be drawn on that.&#xa0;

[[[Q20 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] However, at least you have mentioned stakeholders, which leads me on to my next question, even though, given you do not even know how you are going to respond, I am not sure you will be able to answer this one, either.  When you eventually come to a decision, how are you going to communicate with the 22,000 ILF users who have been, and continue to be, affected?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Once the decision is made, we will use every communication facility possible to make sure that they are communicated with.  It will be—without being rude—quite a big decision, whether I make the decision one way or another.  There will be no shortage of coverage of that decision, will there?  That will be out there, but we will communicate with those users as well.&#xa0;

[[[Q21 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Do you mean you expect them to read it in the newspaper?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: No, I said we will communicate with them directly.  We will do so.&#xa0;

[[[Q22 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] In what way?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I think, by “communicate directly with them”, that indicates we will communicate directly with them, not through a national newspaper.&#xa0;

[[[Q23 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] But there are variations of disabilities among people who are dependent on the Independent Living Fund.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Of course there are.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] We already have examples from other parts of your Department where people ring people, for example, who are hearing disabled, or where people who are visually impaired receive letters.  I am asking whether you are aware of all the difficulties here; whether you will be able to meet all those difficulties; and whether you have a fund to enable you so to do.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We have the ability to do so and make sure that the mistakes that you have alluded to do not happen, as best I can do that.  Again, you are drawing me into an area on what decision is going to be made, and I am not going to be drawn into that area.&#xa0;

[[[Q24 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] That is not my question.  There will have to be a decision; whether it is pro or whether it is con, 22,000 people will expect to be informed.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We will be communicating.  I cannot make that plainer.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] I asked you how you will enter into that communication process.  You have indicated that you are aware of the variations of disabilities within that particular cohort, and you did not answer my question about whether you will have the money so to do.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We have the money.&#xa0;

[[[Q25 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] You definitely have the money?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Fine.  

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Before you go on, Glenda, can I just ask Debbie to come in?  I will come back to you.&#xa0;

[[[Q26 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Minister, I appreciate you have only been in the job a few months, but do you not find it strange, to say the least, that the Minister for disabled people did not have evidence about the law as far as the Equality Act was concerned and the policy that was being introduced?  Do you not find that staggering?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I read the ruling from the Court, as, I am sure, members of the Committee and others have.  I do not think that was what the judgment said.  I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that it was not put in a way that is basically there in black and white.  I do not think there is any doubt that the Minister was informed, but the ruling is the ruling.  I am not going to go back on that.  We accept the ruling completely, and we will redress, based on the ruling.&#xa0;

[[[Q27 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Does that not show how wrong the Government has got it?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: No, I do not think that is the case.  No.&#xa0;

[[[Q28 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Still on the Independent Living Fund, how many transfer reviews have been carried out with ILF users?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I am sorry.  I will have to write to the Committee on that.  I was asked to come and talk about PIP, Madam Chairman.&#xa0;

[[[Q29 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] We understand that transfer reviews were being written.  They then stopped because of the decision of the court, but we understand that they are being activated again, and the DWP has asked for copies of these transfer reviews; in other words, the reviews were for people who were on ILF who are going into whatever it was going to be.  I am just wondering why that has happened.  It would be very useful if you could relay it to the Committee.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will write to the Committee.

[[[Chair:]]] I know there are a number of people asking for it.  Sorry, Glenda, have you finished your question?

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] No, you carry on.&#xa0;

[[[Q30 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] I appreciate that you do not yet know what the future is going to be, but when the decision was made, the clear impression that most ILF people got was that the ILF would not now close in 2015.  We do not know what is going to happen in the future, but the understanding is that it would not close under the original timetable.  Can you confirm that that is the case, and that what you are looking at means that the decision to be implemented will be later than the 2015 deadline, or are you still thinking you will be on track to close ILF—if that is the decision that is taken—by 2015?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I have not made a decision.  Once I have made a decision, one way or the other, we will look at whether the implementation date is still obtainable.  That would have to be done depending on when I get that submission.  I have not had the submission, and as yet I do not know when that submission is going to come to me.  It is probably a hypothetical, but how we can do that depends on what the decision is, and it will be affected by how long it is before I can make that decision.&#xa0;

[[[Q31 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] You will appreciate that people who get ILF are the most disabled people in society, and they had a collective sigh of relief, because they thought they had got a stay of execution.  They were very worried about the future of what is happening with ILF, and they thought they had got that stay of execution with the court case.  Although they realise that might be just a temporary stay of execution, they thought they had some more time in which to prepare for the future, but from what you are saying this morning, they might not.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: With the greatest respect, Madam Chairman, “stay of execution” is very emotive language.  

[[[Chair:]]] That is how they feel.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I appreciate that has been out there, but that is not the intention of the Government.  I do not think it is useful to use that sort of language.  I have to say that I need to make a decision based on the evidence that is presented to me.  As yet, I have not had that evidence presented to me; thus, I cannot make a decision on start date or not start date.  I cannot be any more explicit and honest with the Committee than that.&#xa0;

[[[Q32 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] You do appreciate just how anxious this group of people are.  The Independent Living Fund does exactly what it says on the tin: it gives them independence to live and to work, and to have a full life in society.  They are very concerned and very worried about what the future holds for them.  The quicker you can get the decision right, but also let them know, the better.  I just want your assurance that you understand the sensitivities around this.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I really understand it, but as you just alluded to a moment ago, I have to get it right, so that, whatever the decision is, we do not end up in another set of court cases based on procedure, which is basically where we were on the other one.&#xa0;

[[[Q33 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] With respect, Minister, you have not managed to define—certainly to my satisfaction—“get it right”.  Get it right for whom?  For you, for your officials, for the Department, or for those people who are dependent upon the Independent Living Fund?  In your consultations on this, will you also be consulting with local authorities?  What we have seen already is that the reductions in local authority funding have reduced the kinds of services that constituted part of the programme of assistance to people on the Independent Living Fund.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: To be perfectly honest with you, Madam Chair, I do not think anything that I say would make you happy.  On that basis, I accept that, whatever I say, we will be in that position.  Are we consulting with local authorities?  Yes, I do intend to do so.  Do I intend to speak with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government?  Yes, I do, and we will work very closely with them, to answer the latter part of your point.  I am trying very hard to be as open and honest with the Committee as possible without jeopardising a decision that I have not already made.&#xa0;

[[[Q34 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Minister, what I would just flag for all of us on the Committee is that the Government in 2007 first commissioned a review into ILF and identified that we had various anomalous positions, administering large amounts of cash&#x2011;limited discretionary funding, so what I can say to the Minister is that the Coalition was following the direction of travel of the previous Government on this.  I would ask one final question, having put that on the table.  Clearly, it is important that the 22,000 people that my colleagues have alluded to, while they are up in the air, receive communication from the Government.  Can you confirm whether or not the Government is actually communicating with them, just to explain why it is up in the air, or is there no communication at all, and they are waiting until you have made the decision?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I am not aware that we have written independently to each individual one of them, but we have done our level best to make sure that people know what is going on.  Could that have been done better?  I do not know, but I think it is very important that we get the decision out as soon as possible.  On your first point, this is not something that was invented by the Coalition Administration.  This was started under Labour in 2007, and to be perfectly frank, they dragged their feet and dragged their feet and dragged their feet.  We are where we are today, making really difficult decisions, but trying to make sure that the amount of money that we spend today is actually out there continually, whether we carry on spending it the way we are or whether or not we move it to local authorities.&#xa0;

[[[Q35 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Could I just have, for clarity’s sake, complete confirmation that as soon as a decision is made—even if, hypothetically, it is to go back to court or what have you—those 22,000 people will be communicated with individually as soon as practically possible?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will go further than that: they will be communicated with in the appropriate way, which is what the hon. Lady was alluding to a moment ago.  &#xa0;

[[[Q36 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] And you will write to us with the details of that?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you very much.  We are now on to another decision that you had to make, which was the PIP implementation, and Nigel has some questions on that.&#xa0;

[[[Q37 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Minister, could you tell us how many PIP claims are currently in payment?  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: At the moment, we have made 30,000 decisions on PIP claimants, and we have awarded benefit in roughly 15,000 of those cases.&#xa0;

[[[Q38 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] How many applications have you had to make 30,000 decisions?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: We are publishing the statistics on PIP in the spring, but at the moment, we are getting around about 30,000 to 35,000 a month in full running.&#xa0;

[[[Q39 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] So, roughly how many have you had?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: It will be around the 200,000 mark.&#xa0;

[[[Q40 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] And you have decided 30,000, so one in seven.  How many were you expecting to be in payment by this stage?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: I have not got a forecast number to give you on that.  We are experiencing, for a variety of reasons, that claims are taking longer to go through the process.  I can go into more detail on that, if you would like me to.  For a variety of reasons, the claims are taking longer.  The important thing—because of the nature of the claim and the nature of the benefit—is that we get the decision right, so I am focusing my attention and energy on making sure that we preserve the quality of the decision.&#xa0;

[[[Q41 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] I think we will come back to that question of why they are taking longer in a bit, but can we just move to the decision in October to slow down the roll-out of the natural reassessments?  Could you perhaps talk us through why that was necessary, and why it was done like that?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That would probably be easier for me, and then Jason might come back on that.  I was generally—and so was the Secretary of State—concerned about quality, and what the backload was going to be.  I wanted to make sure, particularly, that we were getting the decision right.  We had already rolled it out across basically middle England, but the areas we were struggling to meet—this is public knowledge—were those on the Atos roll­out, and so we decided to phase that in through postcode to make sure that we were getting that right.  That is why the Ipswich and Norwich areas were phased in.  We intend to announce a new batch before Parliament rises for the Christmas recess, which will come on-stream on 13 January, and then another batch will come in on 3 February.  We will continue to roll it out to get it right, rather than having a spike.  Bill, do you want to pick up on the logic of that?

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: It may be that we will pick it up, because I think you were going to talk about duration, and maybe we can talk about the assessment then.  I am happy to comment now, if you would like.  One of the important things in the whole process is that we have introduced a new assessment, and obviously we have discussed before the Committee how that was developed previously.  It is new.  We obviously want to ensure that healthcare professionals get properly up to speed, understand what they are doing, and that we are able to ensure that they are doing things correctly.  There are huge advantages—from my point of view, certainly—in taking a phased, controlled approach to rolling out the assessment, particularly, so we can actually ensure that healthcare professionals are getting the feedback, they are achieving the right standard, and are applying the criteria correctly and consistently.  That has been one of the considerations in looking at a phased approach.              

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] “A phased roll-out” seems to be the Department’s buzzword for the week.  I think I have heard little else.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: “Getting it right” is also a buzzword, to be fair.  &#xa0;

[[[Q42 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Presumably, there must be some financial implications of slowing this down.  You are getting fewer assessments done and fewer people moved through the system.  Have you quantified what the budgetary impact is?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: In the short term, there will be some AME consequences.  In the DEL, or delivery, side of it, we estimate that we will sit within the budgets that we had for that—I think that is right—as we go forward.  While we are not bringing through the quantity that we expected to come on to PIP, by getting that right, some of the consequences of appeals, etc., etc., will benefit from getting the decision right rather than getting it wrong.  When I came into the Department and was given PIP, and I looked very carefully at the documentation in front of me, there were expectations of a brand-new benefit with so many face-to-face assessments—which was really important, because so few face-to-face assessments were done under the previous benefit—and it was really crucial that we got that right.  If you wish, I am partly to blame, if not completely to blame, for actually saying, “No, we will not go to the spike.  We will phase this in.”  The Secretary of State was in agreement with me on that, because that is the way we get the quality right.  As we get the quality right, we will get the speed of the assessments right.  I do appreciate that for people who are waiting for a decision, this is really hard.  I am personally driving as fast as I can to get the decisions made quicker, but get them right.&#xa0;

[[[Q43 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Speaking as an MP for an East Midlands seat where we are rolled out, are you happy with how it is performing now?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: To be perfectly honest, yes, I am.  There are areas on PIP, in particular—for instance, on appeal, and I will let my colleagues comment on this—where we are nowhere near what we would have expected to be on.  That is probably a dangerous thing to say before a Committee that is being published, because everyone will go out there and think, “Well, should we or shouldn’t we?” but the key on this is that we get the decisions right.  We have some figures, although it is very early days on PIP, that it is nowhere near what we would expect on appeal or going to tribunal.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: The Ministry of Justice are publishing their figures on appeals up to, I think, 28 September tomorrow.  That is my understanding.  They, of course, hold the figures on appeals, because appeals for PIP are directly lodged under appeals reform with the Ministry of Justice.  Certainly, we have made decisions, as I said, on 30,000 claimants.  15,000 of those people have been told that they are not entitled to PIP, and we have had very small numbers of appeals and, actually, smaller numbers of reconsiderations than we expected.  That is because we have put a huge amount of time and effort into the design of PIP.  Learning the lessons from Harrington and others means making sure that we get as much evidence as we can up front in the claim process, so that we get all the information needed for the assessment providers to get the quality of decision that we need.  The other thing that is proving really interesting and important in the implementation of PIP is the time and effort we have put into training our decision-makers to do the outbound call.  If the decision is a negative decision—somebody is not entitled to PIP—the decision-maker themselves makes the outbound call, or contacts the individual claimant to explain why that is and why that decision has been reached.  The notifications we send out are much clearer than standard computer-generated letters.  They are more personalised than we have seen previously.  All those factors mean people feel as if they have had the opportunity to have their say on the claim form; they have had a face-to-face assessment; they have been encouraged throughout the process to provide the evidence; and they have had a clear explanation as to why the decision that has been reached has been reached, and we have put time, effort and money into supporting that.  That is what is driving the low levels of recons and appeals that we are seeing.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: An offer I could make to the Committee, Madam Chair—and I hope you will take this up—is to do as I did, when I went into the PIP centre in Bootle, and sat and listened to the calls as they were going out after the decision was made to refuse, to actually explain what was going on.  One of the things I found particularly useful about that was, frankly, the surprise of someone calling them and telling them; so, not computer-generated, but actually a proper person at the end of the phone that knew about their case and was talking about it.  This is something else we may look to roll out for other benefits, because I think it actually works.  By all means, I am sure the Committee, if they had time, would like to go and also do that.  It was really useful to me to understand how PIP was working and how the decision making was working.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] We do like to get out and about, so we will probably take you up on that.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Bootle is a good place to do it.&#xa0;

[[[Q44 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Does your appeal rate run differently for new PIP claimants who have not claimed DLA in the past, and people who have had DLA but are now being told they cannot have it?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We have got new claims, which are out and rolled, and then there are the four natural reassessments, which we are phasing through.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: The areas, as the Committee probably knows, of natural reassessment include those people who have had a fixed period award of DLA, and that is expiring.  We have those people who are reaching 16 and going on to adult PIP and adult benefits.  We have got those people who report a change of circumstances that is pertinent to the level of benefit that they are receiving, so we are not reassessing people for DLA; we are reassessing them onto PIP.  There is also a small number of people currently on DLA who decide they are self-selecting; they would like to be assessed for PIP.  Those are the people that we are handling through natural reassessment.The Committee will also know that we are going to move to what we call the mandatory assessment, but not until October 2015.  We will have a good gap between the commencement of natural reassessment and the commencement of mandatory reassessment, so that we can learn some of the lessons from the natural reassessment process.  Those are the people that we are dealing with.  You are absolutely right that you would naturally expect to have more challenges to the decisions from somebody who has been in receipt of DLA for a period.  If they are told that they are not entitled to PIP, or told that they are entitled to a lower amount of benefit, then naturally you would expect more contesting of that decision.&#xa0;

[[[Q45 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills: ]]]Are you seeing that?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: We are not that far in.  We are only six weeks into natural reassessment, so it is too early.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The timetable for the whole run of that PIP is until October 2017, when we shall have everybody within our system.  We will be on track.  That is the intention.&#xa0;

[[[Q46 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] I totally agree with you, Minister, on the importance of getting it right and the quality of the assessment.  I think it was actually you, Chair, that pointed out in a Westminster Hall debate how ambitious the time scales and the volumes that were being proposed for the assessment were, and we expressed at that time concerns that they would be achievable.  Perhaps you can clarify for me what you mean when you say that you are still on budget.  If the volumes are lower than anticipated and you are having to stretch it out, how can you be on budget, and how can you be making the savings that you said you were going to be making?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: As you have heard, although it is early indications, the amount of appeals are nowhere near where we would have thought, so the amount of people actually getting it—if you wish—is better than where we were.  The phasing actually means that people will stay on DLA, as you have heard, and we will phase that all through to 2017, but the budget is over that expanded period.  I am not saying that there is no effect on AME, but the effect on AME is minimal.&#xa0;

[[[Q47 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Do you have a figure?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Not at this present time, no.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: We will not be able to clearly estimate an AME impact until we are clear what the completion of natural reassessment timetable is, as the Minister indicated.&#xa0;

[[[Q48 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] It is the chicken and the egg, is it not?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: As the Minister indicated earlier, we are hoping to announce before recess the next two phases of natural reassessment, and the postcodes that will be affected by that.  We have not made a decision about when we are going to do the rest yet.&#xa0;

[[[Q49 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Would you be able to supply something later to the Committee in writing?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We will.  The interesting thing is that there is a massive effect on whether you get the decision right at the initial stages, because that saves a huge amount of costs going forward.  That is the point, yes.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] As we mentioned.&#xa0;

[[[Q50 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] I wonder when you would expect to be able to publish some interim figures.  You have given us some figures today.  Parliamentary written questions asking for figures have been knocked back on the basis that you wanted to give the full statistical version, but you have given some figures today, and it would be helpful.  It could be pointed out that interim figures on universal credit, applying to 2,000 people, have been issued already, and this appears to be 30,000.  Would it be possible, with all the caveats of statistical reliability, to publish some?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The hon. Lady is absolutely right: the biggest issue is around the caveats.  Also, to be fair to me—which I am sure the Committee wants to be—it is not fully within my remit.  In other words, with the report, the Justice Department will be publishing tomorrow the areas around the tribunals and the appeals on that side, but we will bring them together as soon as we can.  The dates I released a few moments ago were coming out for the first time.  I wanted to come to the Committee and be open and honest, so I got those figures pushed so that I could announce them today, and when I am not in front of the Committee I will be writing to the Committee on a regular basis giving those sorts of updates.  Anybody who knows me knows that my attitude to PQs is to answer them as openly and fully as possible, otherwise you will get a load of extras back.  There is no benefit in not answering absolutely as fully as possible, so that is what we are trying to do.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: The agreed position for PIP statistics was that we would publish those in the spring.  I know that our statisticians are working with the UK Statistics Authority to see whether we can release some interim figures.  The figures that I have given you today are my operational figures, as the operations director delivering this.  The official figures will be in the spring.  I know that we are actively looking at seeing whether we can release a smaller sample of statistics much sooner than that, and our statisticians are working with the authorities to get the clearance to do that.&#xa0;

[[[Q51 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Will there be comparative figures with DLA?  The statistics do not make any sense on whether the PIP is performing better or worse than previous DLAs; you need a comparison of how many new DLA claims were turned down at first assessment.  Was it 50%?  You are saying it was 50% for PIP.  Was it 50%?  Was it more than that?  Was it less than that?  What proportion of new claims went to appeal, as opposed to existing claims going to appeal?  Again, that is the comparator.  What were the figures for DLA?  We often get from the Government what the new figures are, but we never have the comparative figures.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will do my level best.  If they come back to me, Madam Chair, and say to me, “That is not possible,” I will push back and ask why.  Of course, on natural reassessment, which is so early on now—we are very early on that—that figure will not be a proper comparison yet.&#xa0;

[[[Q52 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] No, I understand that, but it is the new claims.  The new claims have rolled out across the whole country.  There are no DLA new claims, apart from where somebody is 16 and is in an area that has not gone to natural reassessment.  There are no DLA new claims, but there are the 30,000 decisions that have been taken on PIP, so the real figures we need to be able to judge the effectiveness of PIP are the equivalents for new claims for DLA.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: We can take that request through to the statisticians.  One thing I would say on the figures—even those that I have given you today on the 30,000 decisions and 15,000 awards—is that those figures are distorted by the number of special rules terminally ill cases.  I know we will come back to that.

[[[Chair:]]] We are definitely coming back to that, yes.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Reading that as a 50% award rate is a misrepresentation.

[[[Chair:]]] That also helps to explain why, anecdotally, we think nobody is getting any decisions, but we have got questions on that coming up.  To carry on with the impact of these changes, the changes you announced are slowing down, we have some more questions from Stephen.&#xa0;

[[[Q53 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Minister, one of the things you were talking about on the level of appeals is that, obviously, we are not really moving into the historical DLA yet.  Could I receive confirmation that, in any Department press release—when we get the figures tomorrow, for next week, or what have you—that there is a recognition that yes, there may be lower appeals, but that does not necessarily mean that that will be the case when you start moving into the historical ones?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: You are absolutely right.  While we are pleased as to how it is running—it is not perfect, otherwise I would not be phasing, but particularly on new claims—the obvious caveat, which I hope we have given to the Committee already this morning, is that this is very early.  That is the crucial thing.  While the figure of 50% is skewed, not least because of the types of cases that we are getting early on at the moment—as my colleague has indicated—it is very important that it is not done as a straight comparison.  If we did it that way, that would not be fair.&#xa0;

[[[Q54 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] I am glad to hear that.  I will be watching the DWP press office on this one quite closely.  From some of the things that have come up over the last few years, if the DWP goes out and uses the low appeals as evidence that “It is all working, and everything is tickety-boo”, I doubt very much that you will still be receiving a low number of appeals when you move into historical DLA recipients.  Are you on board with that?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes, absolutely.&#xa0;

[[[Q55 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Thank you.  In December 2012, the Department estimated that by the time the reassessment was complete, 55% of the total 1.75 million existing DLA claimants would receive either no award or a decreased award as a result of reassessment for PIP.  Does that still remain the Department’s estimate of the likely outcome of DLA reassessment?  You said in 2012 that 55% of the total 1.75 million existing DLA recipients either were going to receive a decrease, or not be moved on to PIP.  Is that still the sort of percentage you are looking at?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.  That is exactly what we will be looking at.  The crucial thing about that—and we will come on to this in a moment, I am sure—is the amount of face-to-face assessments that are done.  They were just not done before, and that is the 10%.&#xa0;

[[[Q56 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] I realise that.  That is quite a high percentage but, on the record, you are agreeing that is where the Department figure is.  Moving on: this time last year, the Department was expecting around 87,000 DLA reassessments to be carried out in the quarter beginning March 2014.  That is 87,000 DLA reassessments, quarter beginning March 2014.  I appreciate you have been talking about step by step, which—as my colleague, Debbie, reminded us—not only the Chair but a number of us have been advising for a while, so I am all for that.  But what is your new estimate of the rate of reassessments from next March, taking an account of the delayed step-by-step implementation that you are talking about?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: It is similar to the response to the money question, which is that until we have made final decisions about what the full roll-out of natural reassessment will be, it would not be possible to estimate how many we think we will be doing in the first quarter of next year.&#xa0;

[[[Q57 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] When would you hope to be able to make that decision, or that estimate?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I have announced the two dates for the phased roll-out.  That has been announced, and we will give the geographical areas for that before Christmas.  After Christmas, I will announce the next phase.  Depending on the evidence I am getting as to how this part of the phase is working and how Atos are coping with that, the answer to the question may differ.  If I push this too far, the quality will drop, and that is not what we want.  We need to phase it through correctly, but we need to make sure that I get the dates out there and that everybody knows, including the delivery company, as soon as I can after Christmas.  But I have to do that on an evidence base.  &#xa0;

[[[Q58 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] I understand that, and that makes sense, Minister, but obviously March 2014 is coming down the track.  If I could just ask one more question in this particular area: what do you think are the odds of the Department being able to make that projection before March 2014?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I would expect to make it before 2014.  I will be very disappointed if I cannot, to be fair.

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Before March 2014? 

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q59 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Okay, thank you.  The peak in the number of DLA reassessments was due to occur from March 2016 to September 2017.  That was the original projection.  The Department envisaged around 155,000 people being reassessed each quarter.  Are you able to give any indication of how many will now need to be completed in each quarter during this period take into account the slower start to reassessment, or is that all going to be depending on what figures you get early in the New Year?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: There are no changes to our plans for what we are calling the mandatory reassessments—those people that are still receiving DLA that have not been picked up through natural reassessments.  That peak occurs when we are doing the mandatory reassessment.  We have no plans to change those assumptions at this point in time, so we still intend to start that process in October 2015, and we still intend to end that process in October 2017.  It will obviously take, after October 2017, a number of weeks for people to go through the process, so we fully expect everybody to be completely reassessed for PIP by May 2018.&#xa0;

[[[Q60 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] So the original timetable still stands: end 2017?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q61 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] That is for all the DLA reassessments?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Yes.

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] The historical ones.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: In October 2017, we should be off DLA.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: That is right.  We will be.  We will be reassessing people.  The last people who will be called for reassessment will be in October, and it will take a number of weeks then to go through the reassessment process, so it will be spring 2018 before we see the last people on DLA of adult age.&#xa0;

[[[Q62 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Obviously, we are using Atos and we are bringing Capita in, and I am assuming there are discussions out there with other possible providers.  Minister, are you confident that the current contractors and other possible new ones that you are talking about are equally signed up to delivering that on the initial, original timetable by end 2017?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes, because, one, we would not bring a contractor in that could not give us that commitment.  I am now seeking—and there are very detailed negotiations going on with some of our existing providers—an assurance that they can do that.  That is very important.&#xa0;

[[[Q63 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Can I ask that the Department—occasionally, it did not do this as well as I think it could have done—put in some definite penalty clauses, then, within the contracts for this delivery?  I am delighted that you are confident that it will be still be by end 2017—fingers crossed—but I would be very concerned to discover, a year or so down the line, that there is slippage on that, perhaps because the contractors cannot cope.  Are there any thoughts within the Department of inserting penalty clauses on those agreements?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: There are penalty clauses now, with both of the providers, Capita and Atos.  The Department is very much taking that forward where they may be in breach of contract.  There are penalty causes in there, and they are very severe.&#xa0;

[[[Q64 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] For the timetables up to 2017?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.

[[[Chair:]]] We have some more questions on contracts that will be coming up.  Sheila, you wanted to come in?  &#xa0;

[[[Q65 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] It was just a quick point on the question, again, of, I suppose, statistics.  One of your predecessor Ministers came to this Committee when we were discussing the need for reform, and, I think, put on record that 50% of DLA applications were unsuccessful at first.

[[[Chair:]]] It was 55%.  We have just checked.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] It was about how important it is to have comparators, both to reassure people and understand what difference a change makes.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Speaking partly as a constituency MP—we all are as well—I can see that, but if you look at the appeals, it is the way that the appeals were working on DLA as well.  That is the comparison that needs to be worked on as well.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: We have been working extraordinarily hard with organisations throughout the country that work with potential PIP claimants.  We have engaged with over 6,000 organisations.  We have, on the internet, the PIP checker, which is a tool that you can use to see whether you may be entitled to any of the PIP payments, and that is getting around 100,000 hits a month at the moment.  There is a lot of emphasis on helping people to understand what they may or may not be entitled to.  It will be interesting over time—again, it is way too early to draw any conclusions from that now, other than the amount of hits we are getting on the website—to see whether that is having an impact in terms of the award rates.  They may well be different to DLA, for a good reason.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The other thing it would do—and we will have to put it alongside the first DLA applications—is that, because of the PIP checker and the number of hits we are getting, the early anecdotal evidence is that people are being advised they do not qualify, so they are not applying.  You would think they would be relatively the same going through, so we will see how that goes forward, but the PIP checker seems to be very popular, I must admit.&#xa0;

[[[Q66 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Just on that: will you also be publishing a breakdown of people who fail, post-the assessment, and whether they are in or out of work?  Is it possible to do that as well?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The Employment Minister and I are going to be working very closely on that as to where, if you wish, within the system—I know that is a terrible word—they are.  Yes, you are absolutely right.&#xa0;

[[[Q67 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] And those stats will be published as well, will they?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Yes.

[[[Chair:]]] We have some more questions on the application process, and Anne Marie is going to ask those.&#xa0;

[[[Q68 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] If I may.  We have talked a little bit about the delay in the claimant journey, and we have not really got to look at the detail of this.  What is your current estimate as to what the time should be from start to finish to process the PIP claim?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Our estimates were, originally, that it would be a 12 to 15-week timeline in terms of getting through the process, right through from application and initial phone call to the decision.  The process is taking longer than that in most cases, and there are probably three main reasons for that.  The first reason is that—and I will follow these in the sequence of the claim, as it is easier to follow it in that way—in terms of the initial phone call, we have got more people not getting through the security questions than we expected.  More people are falling out of the security questions.

[[[Chair:]]] We are going to have questions on the appropriateness of the phone application.  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: That builds in a few days’ delay while we then contact the claimants and try to establish that we are confident about their identity, and they can get through the security process.  Of course, in this area, more than most benefits, it is always a challenge for us, and we put a huge amount of time and effort into balancing out having a secure gateway to the benefit to protect the taxpayers’ money and having an accessible process.  That is quite a difficult challenge in this area, so we put huge amounts of time and design into that.  We have more people falling out of the security questions, and we are doing some work on that to see whether we can broaden the range of security questions that people are asked, so that we can increase the chances of people getting through the process without reducing any security.&#xa0;

[[[Q69 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] What are the second and third points?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: There are three points.  The second point is that claimants are taking longer to return the claim forms.  Once they have made the initial registration over the phone, which is capturing basic information, then they are sent a claim form that is “How your disability affects you”, and, as I said earlier, a lot of that focuses on making sure they have a mix of tick-box areas and free-text areas.  There is strong encouragement for the claimant at that point to provide any medical evidence they have available to them, and claimants are taking longer.  You have got four weeks to return that form; they are taking longer than four weeks to return that form, on average, so that is building in time delay.  The last area that is building in the delay is that it is taking longer for our assessment providers to undertake the assessment, book the appointment, go through the assessment process, have that through their audit process, and then back to my decision-makers to make the final decision.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: This is a really important area.  One of the first things I asked when I came in was that very same question: “Why does it take so long?”  One of the areas I pushed on, and  I am going to ask my Chief Medical Adviser to explain what he explained to me, was that I said, “One, I can understand that the push for quality”—because there were issues to do with quality—“is pushing that this way.  Is there any way we can make sure that we can close that gap while trying to keep the quality?”&#xa0;

[[[Q70 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Do you have a view as to what you feel an acceptable timeline would be?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: What we set down originally was right, otherwise there would be no point setting that in the first place, but we are beyond that.  What I need to do, initially, is get us back into that, and then we can assess whether we can shorten that.  When I said to Bill, “Can you address quality and time?” that was where the problems were really being pushed.

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: As Jason has indicated, the assessment part itself is only one of the components in the whole process that has an influence on the total time.  It was always going to be the case that when we introduced a new assessment—and this is a brand new assessment; it is clearly very different from DLA—one of the challenges we were going to have, of course, was that there are no healthcare professionals who have actually had experience of undertaking this assessment.  Indeed, that has other implications, because it also means that there are no healthcare professionals who have got the experience to actually check and audit the quality of what is happening.  The initial phase of new assessments was always going to take longer than we expected once it got to a steady state where people have got the experience.  One of the challenges, of course, is that the early stage is actually the most important stage in making sure that people actually are undertaking the assessment correctly, applying the criteria correctly and consistently, and reaching carefully considered recommendations for the case manager.  Feedback is, obviously, important in that.  That is one of the things that inevitably, to begin with, has caused some delay, because it is taking time.  There are always going to be more cases that need feedback to the healthcare professional, that need amending, and that will gradually improve.  One of the interesting things that has actually contributed to some of the total assessment part—so actually reviewing the information that has been provided by the claimant, doing the assessment, then producing the report—is that initial review of the evidence.  As Jason said, claimants are invited on the form that they submit to provide any evidence, and also indicate the range of different people from whom evidence might be sought.  Encouragingly, they are actually providing a lot of evidence, which is clearly very helpful, and that may have an implication in terms of the likelihood of getting the right outcome in the longer term.  Of course, reviewing that evidence obviously takes time in order to decide, then, whether a decision can be made without a face­to­face assessment, or whether a face­to­face assessment should take place.&#xa0;

[[[Q71 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] That is very helpful, but essentially, here, we are talking about two areas, are we not?  One is process, and the other one is the challenge of actually doing the assessment.  On process, you have talked about challenges with regard to what the claimant is not doing.  What about within DWP itself?  Process is two ways.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We accept that.  For instance, as Jason was saying, the rule is four weeks.  Now, we could be rigid on the four weeks and say that, after four weeks, the claim lapses, because it actually sits on the system to show us that we are still in a process, and that is where some of the delay may sit.  We do not do that, not least because people have individual circumstances, particularly people with mental health issues, and there may be really good reasons for other people, such as being in the hospital.  What we are looking at is to now extend that—I use the word “exceptional”—in “circumstances” for another four weeks, but then we will look at stopping that.  The open claim runs on the PIP computer system even if that person has decided, perhaps, not to do it.  You are absolutely right.  The other area where it really does cause us some problems, as well, is that whilst some put an awful lot of evidence in, others do not, and that is the process where the phone really comes into its own.&#xa0;

[[[Q72 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] One of the challenges that is causing the problem is, by the sounds of it, that the claimants do not know what it is they need to put on these forms.  What is it you are going to do to try to assist that process?  It must be win-win to get that right.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: There are two things.  It is absolutely win-win to get it right, and as Jason was saying, working with stakeholders and, generally, people who are helping, we communicate with 6,000 different groupings to do that.  The area I am particularly looking at is “Can we get away from the paper base?”  The phone call is made—and we will come on to that, probably, in a moment—but then it is a paper system.  Is there a way, for instance, that we could move to a PDF system, so people can do it on their screens safely and securely and actually come back into us?  Particularly, this is an issue with people with terminal illnesses, and I was working with Macmillan only the other day talking about this, as to how we could move to that next stage.  That would, I think, massively speed it up if we can get a nice, simple programme that has that form, but obviously security is the issue.&#xa0;

[[[Q73 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] We will move to the terminally ill in a minute, because that is a separate area, which, I think, is of concern to all of us.  My concern with your solution is that it requires IT and IT capability, and a number of these individuals, I suspect, will not have the skill.  In a sense, I suppose I am looking for someone or some body or some system to support these individuals—which is affordable within your overall budget—to make sure that these claims are made quickly and on time, so that you can deal with them with the information that you do actually need.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: One size will not fit all, and that is obvious, but we have actually been pleasantly surprised by the sheer amount of people using IT as a facility.  It is much greater than we expected.  Obviously, one size will not fit all, but we need to communicate better how much information we need so that, for instance, we do not get information on the very last day while we are at tribunal, which we knew nothing about.&#xa0;

[[[Q74 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] How are you going to do that?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That is work in progress.  As Jason was saying, we have to better communicate that.  As I say, we will come on to the telephone conversations, but we will work better—and we need to work better—explaining to people when they make that initial call to launch their application what we need from them.  I think that is absolutely crucial.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: One thing I would say is that we do have an implementation stakeholder forum, which is a broad representation of charities and third party organisations.  We have got a sub-group of that implementation stakeholder forum that is a continuous improvement group.  There is nothing like live-running to test something, and we have already made some changes to the claim form; we have already made some changes to the leaflets that we put out and the information we have got on the websites in response to that live learning; and we are working with the sub-group of the continuous improvement group just to see what things we can do and what tweaks we can make to make this process work better.

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Let us move then to the telephones.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] Before you move on to the telephones, I have got Nigel, Debbie and Sheila who want to have a go, and then we will come back to you.&#xa0;

[[[Q75 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] I was first.  I obviously have some constituency experience of Capita assessments; they are the assessor for my area.  The complaints that keep being raised are that, one, that it is quite hard to get an assessment booked, and then when you do, they get cancelled at the last minute and you cannot get another one booked.  It is certainly our experience that it is extremely hard to get any information out of Capita about what is going on and when they can fix these problems.  What is the understanding you have from the Department about how some of these contractors are actually performing?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The problem at the moment, to do with the commentary as a constituency MP, is that it is quite anecdotal.  You hear things and you hear things, but what we are doing is pulling in the analysis, and one of the questions I have been asking is, “How many people have had their appointments cancelled?  How quick were some of these appointments?”  Of course, some people are requesting to tape their appointment—and they are entitled to do so—on recording equipment, so that sometimes is affecting how long a consultation takes place.  Of course, the other criterion that we are very much looking at is the distance criterion, as to people coming in and whether they are capable of coming in, and then the home visit.  That area is one that I am particularly looking at, again, at the moment.  We will have the data.  It is fairly early, but we will have the data.  Actually, to be fair, the more that constituents let individual MPs know and let us know, that helps as well, because that gives me comparison.&#xa0;

[[[Q76 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] I assume you impose targets on Capita and Atos for how long they can have to assess somebody, and how long to write the report up afterwards.  Are you measuring their performance against those targets?  I presume they are missing them horribly.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Certainly, the appointments are taking longer than they were contractually obliged to be, and they are getting shorter.  We have worked on that, and I know that Bill has been working very hard on that.

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: It is important to make clear that there are not targets for the duration of the assessment.  Clearly, that is important, because one of the things we want is to make sure that people actually get the time they need.  Now, we inevitably—as we developed the assessment—made some assumptions about how long things might take on average, but the reality is that what we want is to ensure that the assessments are done as efficiently as possible but, most importantly, that they are done properly and to the right standard.  Obviously, because we are in a relatively early stage, we are starting to gather evidence about how long things take.  We will be looking at that in due course, but we know—and we have experience from other assessments—that, as healthcare professionals get experience and get familiar, things take less time, and that is true, I think, in any setting—and particularly in any healthcare setting.  Once you become familiar with what you are doing, things become quicker.  If I go to a very different assessment, the WCA, when Professor Harrington recommended introducing the Personalised Summary Statement for the healthcare professional at the end of the assessment report, that increased the time of the assessment initially by quite a lot, because it was something new.  It took healthcare professionals time to get used to doing that, and then we saw, gradually, things coming down.  We got more or less back to where we had been before.  There are things that will settle down as healthcare professionals get better at it, and the same with the auditing process, because at the moment it takes auditors longer: they are still inexperienced at auditing, and therefore doing it properly will take time.  We know that as auditors get more experienced, things speed up as well.  Those will speed up, but there is no target that providers have to meet in terms of the actual assessment duration, because it is important that they do the job properly.  Clearly, the assessment duration has an impact on how many people can be done in a session, and so on.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: One thing I would say is, because the two providers have got completely different delivery models in that sense—Capita’s is much more home visit-based than Atos’s—it will give us, over time, an opportunity to compare and contrast and see which of those models either best suits claimants, or provides best value for money for the taxpayer.  Having the two providers with two different delivery models will be of use to us over time, in terms of determining the best way forward.  The other thing is that there is a target that the providers have to do 97% of the assessments within a six-week period.  Bill is absolutely right: there is no target on the length of the individual assessment itself, but they have to turn it around, if you like, within that six-week period.  There are a number of things that are contributing to them taking longer than six weeks to do that.&#xa0;

[[[Q77 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] What percentage are they hitting at the moment?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: I do not have those numbers available.&#xa0;

[[[Q78 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Could you encourage Capita and, I presume, Atos, to be a little bit more constructive in how they deal with complaints?  If you ring the Department, all you get is, “It is with Capita,” and it has been with them for many, many more weeks than it ought to have been.  If you ring Capita, all you get is not very much.  It becomes a bit frustrating for somebody really quite vulnerable and quite desperate to get his benefits sorted when it seems the most you can find is, “It is with Capita somewhere.”

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I am going to pass to Jason in a second.  We are in quite detailed negotiations, as I said, with one of the providers at the moment in general terms.  One of the things I also intend to do is bring in, frankly, the top bods in both and talk about compassion.  While they are under a contractual push from us to deliver and to do this, that does not stop people having compassion when they are talking to people down the phone.  One of the complaints I have had from my own constituents is: “I am just a number.”  Even if you can find out the information, it is very difficult.  There is this balance between what we, as a Department, can give and the other responsible parties—Atos, Capita, or other providers we move to, as we alluded to earlier on, particularly in WCA—but there is no excuse at all for people not having a genuine understanding of the issues and concerns that that person has that has been on the phone.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: What I would just add to that is that we are not getting many complaints that I am aware of about the nature of the assessment, or the way people are treated during the assessment.  I am not picking up any issues or noise around how people are treated now.  I take your point that the providers could be clearer in terms of where an individual is in their process, and that is something I am happy to take away and discuss with the providers.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Chair:]]] That is certainly a big complaint.&#xa0;

[[[Q79 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] I am conscious of time, so could you keep your answers as brief as possible?  I am surprised that, in terms of the contracts, there was not more reassurance given; for example, that either Capita or Atos had piloted or tested the time with some degree of reliability that would give you reassurance as procurers that it was going to be within the 12 to 15 weeks.  Surely, they would have said, “12 to 15 weeks.”  You would have said, “Great; what is your evidence to support that?  How can we make sure it is reliable?”  Park that one there.  You said 12 to 15 weeks was the original time; what is it now, and what is the biggest block?  What is the biggest delay, compared with what you thought?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Let me answer the first point.  They were piloted, but in any pilot, you do not get as big a spectrum of what is going on.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] It is a poor pilot, then.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: As they have brought in their clinical expertise, they have done a lot of training as we have expanded this out, which is one of the reasons that I am still phasing on PIP.  Jason can take the other part.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: On the length of time, that would be one of the areas on which our statisticians are working with the UK Statistics Authority to see whether we have got sufficient robustness around those numbers to be able to publish them.  I put the same caveat I would on the award rates, which is that over half of the awards we have made so far are to terminally ill people.  I know we might want to come back to talk about that, but they are, of themselves, going through the process much quicker than normal-rules claims.  It will be one of those areas we will look to cover, and if we can get approval to do an early release of some statistics on PIP, that will be the sort of statistic we would be looking to put in there.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] We would be very grateful.  That would help us in our assessments.&#xa0;

[[[Q80 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] We have heard a lot about the delays that may be caused by taking a more relaxed attitude to people getting the information in, and that is actually a very good thing.  It is something that a lot of the organisations had asked for at the outset, because they thought four weeks was too short, so that is good.  However, what I am seeing in my constituency is that there are lengthy delays between people having put that information in—as long as two months—and there being an assessment; and more than a month after that before it even leaves the provider, who happens to be Atos.  Are you satisfied that there really is enough capacity in the organisations, both in terms of staff and places?  One of the things that has been said is that the number of assessment centres has turned out to be much lower than the providers promised.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Can I just clarify that we are talking about PIP, not WCA?

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] I am talking about PIP.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Okay.  The obvious reason why we are phasing is capacity; making sure that the capacity is capable, in those areas, to make sure that we can actually phase that through.  That is exactly the criteria I will be looking for.&#xa0;

[[[Q81 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Will that have a financial impact, though?  If they have not got the capacity, having won the contract—because, after all, they bid for the contract—and the problem now is they either do not have enough assessment centres or enough staff to do the kind of testing that you want to see in terms of quality, then will that not have a financial impact on either the providers or yourselves?  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Perhaps I can help clarify.  The point you need to remember is the fact that this is a new assessment process.  Providers, inevitably, made assumptions on how long it might take for healthcare professionals to get up to speed, for auditors to get up to speed; and how many would be needed.  Now, it is always difficult when you have not done something like this before, and what inevitably happens is that once you start delivering, you learn, and then you have to adjust things.  I think the providers have been doing that: they have increased the number of auditors, having recognised that the auditing process was more challenging than they had perhaps anticipated.  As has been mentioned, there are two different delivery models, which we were very keen to see.  Capita’s is more an in-house, and with a significant home assessment component; Atos are using a supply chain.  Both have attractions, and we will be able to learn from this.  I think Atos, for example, have perhaps realised that, initially, the supply chain model—when you are trying to get new healthcare professionals up to speed and you are trying to audit and provide feedback—does actually make it more time consuming than perhaps had been anticipated.  Coming back to what Mr Mills said earlier, we have been working very closely with both providers.  There are weekly meetings with the providers to review issues and so on, and there is a huge amount of work being done in partnership and by providers to quickly learn the lessons and improve.  I do not think it is a capacity issue overall.  I think it is an issue where there has probably been an underestimation at the beginning of how challenging the process of establishing a new assessment and delivering it was.  That is actually being addressed now, and things will without a doubt improve.&#xa0;

[[[Q82 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] The delays cannot all just be about the slowness to fill in the form.  I have a constituent who started the process at the end of June; had their face­to­face assessment on 22 August; and up until yesterday, which was the last chance I had to check, still has not had a determination.  I also have a letter here from a Welsh MP—I am an Atos area; this is from a Capita area—with an assessment carried out in July, and who still has not got a determination.  Through Twitter and others, that is a common thing.  What month would people who are now getting their determinations in December have had their assessments?  Is it July, or is it earlier than that?  There must be a backlog building up of all of these things.  It is not just Atos and Capita; it must be DWP as well. 

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Do you want to cover that from your perspective?

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Just to finish: in terms of the assessment process, we know that part of the reason there has been delays is that when you have got new healthcare professionals, they have done their training and are then allowed to start doing assessments, but one of the important things is that we actually know that they are doing them properly and consistently applying the criteria and the right standards.  They are subject to 100% audit of their cases until they demonstrate they have achieved the required standard.  Now, that is a lot of auditing, inevitably, to begin with.  If it takes time before they reach that consistent standard, then there is obviously more auditing involved, and that has contributed to backlogs initially, and we have worked with the providers to look at how we can actually ease that process.&#xa0;

[[[Q83 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Where are these cases?  Are they sitting on an auditor’s desk somewhere, waiting to be audited?

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: A case is audited; if it does not meet the required standard, then it is passed back with feedback to the healthcare professional, so that they can review it and amend it.  Obviously, it is important that when we get reports through to the Department, they are of the right standard, so that the case manager who is making the decision is likely to reach the right conclusion and make the right decision.  That, obviously, builds in delay, and then it comes back again to be checked.  That is starting to ease, because we have now got an increasing number of healthcare professionals who are fully approved, who have actually demonstrated they can meet the standard, and therefore are no longer on 100% case audit.  But this is a problem that we will learn lessons from as well, about the challenges of a new assessment.&#xa0;

[[[Q84 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] How can the auditors do their job?  They have not sat in on the face­to­face.  The face­to­face is, we have been told, the most important bit.  They have not sat in on the face­to­face, so they have not seen the interview.  The claimants hear nothing; they have no idea.  They try to phone, as Nigel says, and go round in circles—“It is sitting somewhere”—and cannot find out, so they hear nothing.  How can the auditor judge without having gone through the process, and without asking the claimant for more information?

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: The claimant has provided a lot of information about their condition, their disability, and the impact it has.  One of the things we want to see in the assessment is that the assessor has actually explored all those areas and has documented them properly—has carefully considered what a typical day is, the issues there, and that that is documented.  Without all of that information, they cannot then consider how to apply the descriptors, and then we want to be sure that the descriptors have actually been applied correctly, and that the evidence is there to support the descriptor choice—that is quite important—and then, at the end of it, that the assessor has clearly justified the conclusion that they have reached.  One of the important parts is making sure that whatever the claimant has highlighted in all the evidence that has been submitted has been properly explored during the assessment by the healthcare professional.  Obviously, if it is not documented, one has to assume that it has not been explored.  It may have been, but it needs to be documented.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: That is exactly the question I asked when I very first arrived: “We are auditing 100%?”  That is based on the quality situation.  The rationale is very simple.  If we do not do that, and we are confident that they are qualified, we get further down the situation, and then the tribunal judge turns around and says, “You have not taken all of this into consideration”, and then that is where we get to.  &#xa0;

[[[Q85 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Some of your Atos and Capita healthcare professionals have now been fully audited; they are 100%.  How quick will the journey be of someone applying for PIP today who gets one of these ones that does not have to be audited?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Again, I would imagine it would be in the 12- to 15-week window.&#xa0;

[[[Q86 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] So, they could end up getting a determination quite a long way before someone who applied six months ago?  Is that possible?

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: It is possible that somebody applying later than somebody else could get a decision earlier than somebody else.&#xa0;

[[[Q87 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Even before we get to the face­to­face thing, there is an issue that has been raised by the Disability Benefits Consortium.  They say that face­to­face assessments are problematic due to administrative problems.  People have received their invitation to an assessment after the assessment date itself; they have not been notified of cancellations and, again, PIP providers have been slow in sending their report back to the Department for decision-making.  That has nothing to do with people being sensitive or compassionate.  It is just the bureaucracy, which is not working.  What is being done to make sure it does work?  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: This is part of the conversations we have.  We meet with the providers on a weekly basis to look at their performance.  You are absolutely right: that whole space of the nature of the communications, the missed appointments and the number of re-appointments.  &#xa0;

[[[Q88 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] With respect—and I know we are talking about PIP—all these criticisms were laid at the door of the providers when they were doing the WCA.  If they did not learn from that, what are you actually pushing them to learn from this?  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: What I would say is we have learnt an awful lot of lessons, in both the Department and the providers, from the WCA in terms of communication with claimants.  We are in very early stages of this benefit; we are in very early stages in terms of rolling out the scale of this change.  This is the biggest change we have had in the disability benefits space for 20 years.  Inevitably, in the first three, four or five months there is going to be an issue of people bedding in to the process, whether it is healthcare professionals or whether it is issues about handling enquiries from claimants.  I do think that we are seeing a continuous improvement of that.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I also completely accept as a constituency MP that that is not acceptable.  If the bureaucracy is breaking down, then the end result is we will penalise them financially, but actually I would rather not do that.  I would rather them get better, but the only way you can put your foot to the door on the two providers that we have at the moment and the new providers when they come on-stream will be: “You either get this right and you address your bureaucracy, otherwise I will penalise you financially.”  Admittedly, one of the providers, as we have noticed, Capita is providing a completely different type of scheme under PIP from Atos, and of course it was Atos in WCA.  They were operating in a completely different environment in delivering.  The majority in Capita are home visits rather than being called into an assessment.&#xa0;

[[[Q89 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] I am grateful that obviously you are going to examine them closely, but the real burden is being borne by the claimant at the moment.  There is no excuse.  Surely, nobody needs training to ensure that they post an invitation for an appointment in time for the claimant, who will be disabled, to be able to make the necessary arrangements to go to that appointment.  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: The nature of the contract is that they have to give two weeks’ notice for when the appointment is, so clearly that is a failure to comply with the contract.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: They would be in breach of contract.  &#xa0;

[[[Q90 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] You still keep talking about the bureaucratic structures.  Fine, we hope they are going to be improved in the future, but the issue is the claimant.  They are the ones who are carrying the burden at the moment.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The only way we can improve that situation for the claimant, on whom I completely accept the burden is currently, is to put the contractor’s feet to the fire and say, “You either do this contractually or you will suffer the financial penalties.”  They are in this for a profit because that is what they are there for.  If I take that away from them, then they will address that, and they are, to be fair.  It is better than it was, but not perfect, and it will need to continue to get better and better.  The one thing they do not like is me instructing my civil servants to invoke penalty clauses.  That is the last thing they like.  &#xa0;

[[[Q91 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] When will this actually happen?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It is happening now.  &#xa0;

[[[Q92 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] When will the decision be if you are actually imposing these financial penalties on the providers?  When are they going to have to actually pay that money and how much will come out of their budgets that you are already paying?  Is that not going to have a knock-on effect in making their present service even worse?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: No, because they have a contractual obligation to actually make sure they deliver it.  That means they will have to put some more money into the pot from wherever they are.  That is the nature of the contract.  They wanted to be in this business—and we are not talking particularly about WCA, but Atos bid in on WCA under the previous administration at a rate that was ludicrous, because they wanted the business.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] We told them at the time.  

[[[Chair:]]] I think we have that very question.  

[[[Glenda Jackson: ]]]We have that one covered.  

[[[              ]]]

[[[Mike Penning]]]: To be fair, clearly the Government did not, because the Government accepted a contract with them, but there we are.                

[[[Chair:]]] We have questions on exactly that point coming up, so I will leave it.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: To be fair, we do need the feedback and we do need to identify there are problems, but there has been a huge amount of partnership working with the contractors.  They have been very committed to trying to improve things and to try to learn lessons.  We continue to try to do that.  Obviously, we know we have contractual remedies, as the Minister has said.  It is ideal if we can avoid having to use those, because you have highlighted the fact that it is about the claimant first and foremost.  The feedback is important; we need to address the issues that have been raised with the providers as part of our ongoing process of reviewing things and trying to make sure that we sort things quickly so that actually it does not impact upon claimants.  I am sure Jason would confirm that we have been doing that on a number of issues, and these are further issues that we can actually feed back.  &#xa0;

[[[Q93 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] I am going to cover telephone claims, then evidence gathering and then the terminally ill.  I am conscious that we are not halfway through the questions and we are well past halfway through the time so, certainly on the telephone, please could we keep that one relatively quick?  I suspect there is a relatively straightforward answer.  I think it is agreed that there are some individuals who find the process of speaking on the telephone difficult.  You have already mentioned that you are introducing an IT capability.  What else is happening and what else are you doing to try to help those who cannot use the telephone?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will let colleagues talk about that.  When I was at Transport and I had DVLA, everybody said that we could not use DVLA online as much we were, because there were loads of people that could not do it.  Actually, the vast majority of people use DVLA online mostly to deliver their road tax and things like that perfectly well.  We must not underestimate the capabilities of people to be able to use IT, but there also has to be a backstop for them.  In theory, in speed terms, by phone is a speedier way of doing it, because it is logged from that moment; your claim is logged and then the forms come out to you, so you are on the system.  &#xa0;

[[[Q94 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] If you cannot physically pick up the phone and make the call because of your disability, what then?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We have measures in place to be able to help people in that way.  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: You can do it in writing and we have other areas that we are working with like textphone, and we are running a pilot at the moment for claimants who are deaf.  They can email us directly; we have run that pilot for four weeks.  There has not been as much take-up and interest as we had expected, so we have extended that pilot for another four weeks.  We are continually looking at ways in which we can provide access to the benefit through multiple channels, accepting the fact that, particularly given the nature of the potential claimant base, not everybody is going to be able to use a phone or is comfortable using the phone.  Again, it is multiple-channel choice that we are trying to develop and, as we are with this pilot, even extending that further than perhaps we originally intended to do.  We are absolutely committed to try to open access to the benefit as much as we can.  &#xa0;

[[[Q95 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Are these alternatives easy to find out about? 

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: All of the information is on the departmental website and gov.uk as well.  Part of the reason we are working with so many—over 6,000—organisations is to try to increase the awareness of what the channels are and what the process is.  It helps us as well as helps the claimant if people understand how they can approach us, how they can contact us and how they can make a claim to benefits.  That is why we have got 6,000 organisations on the distribution list.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Bits of paper get lost, and what I am desperately trying to do is limit it down.  I know we will come on to the terminally ill in a second, but that is another area where I am desperate to try to progress it as fast as possible.  Less paper means speed, I hope.  &#xa0;

[[[Q96 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Let’s move then to evidence gathering.  We have talked about the overall assessment process and the challenges that that gives rise to: people being asked to do things that they did not do before in the medical profession.  They are being asked to look at different things, so it is not just a question about what your illness is; it is about your capability and capacity, which is different.  There is an issue, however, about the evidence gathering and then how that evidence is interpreted.  Clearly that plays a part in the whole delay process.  To what extent is there clarity about what evidence can be accepted, who can take responsibility for collecting it and who will pay for it?  Certainly, within my own constituency, there are concerns among GPs, who have absolutely no idea what they can do, when they can do it, and they still do not seem to understand this concept of capacity/capability as opposed to physical illness.  When someone comes in and says, “Please can you write me a letter?” they get the wrong sort of letter.  There is all of that piece, and I do not know how you are resolving that.  Then clearly, there are the assessors themselves trying to look at all these bits of paper that do not necessarily answer the questions that they really need to have answered.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: You are absolutely right.  There are two big issues here.  One is getting the right information on the right piece of paper in front of the assessor at the time.  I hope to meet the BMA in the very near future to talk about two areas: one, making sure in the paper terminology they get enough information that they know what they need to put on the form.  I hope, interestingly enough, to get away from forms with GPs as well.  This is one of my passions.  If you go to see your GP, he or she does everything on her screen at the moment, from the prescription right the way through to asking you questions that you do not know why they are asking—there is a box on their screen saying, “Tick this.  You will get paid a bit more money.”  That is what happens.  I want a box on their screen they can hit; once we send them the PDF, they can fill it in and that comes back.  Without being rude to GPs, it is idiot-proof as to what they have to put on there.  We have to work with the BMA and we have to work with other medical professionals to make sure that we get in the information that we need as early as possible.  As I alluded to earlier on, one of the big frustrations for us is that evidence comes in right at the last minute.  It is often on the day of tribunal.  We have never seen it and quite rightly we lose the tribunal because it is based on the evidence, but we have not seen that evidence.  On the technical side of it, I will ask my Chief Medical Adviser to talk about it.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Clearly, in PIP we have made some changes and, as I said earlier, we are getting more information at the start when the individual returns the form.  What is important then is that the healthcare professional assesses that and determines whether in fact they have enough evidence to make a decision.  Clearly, if they have, it saves a face-to-face assessment where there is enough evidence.  If there is not, the opportunity is for them to consider at that point whether they want to seek further evidence or not.  Again, we ask claimants to indicate who the best person to seek any further information from is, because it might not always be the GP.  It might be their cancer specialist; it may be a community mental health nurse or whatever.  We ask that.  The important thing is that, when we seek that evidence, what we are seeking is first and foremost factual evidence—that we ask the right questions of the healthcare professional that we are seeking the evidence from.  That is one of the problems we have had, and we have done quite a lot of work looking at this in relation to other assessments.  It is making sure that we ask properly targeted questions so we get the evidence that we need.  The Minister has highlighted one of the challenges is how we can make this as efficient a process as possible and how we can do it in a way that GPs and other healthcare professionals can fill out easily, so that there is a good chance that we will then get it back quickly so all the evidence is available and it does not delay the assessments available at the time of the assessment.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: There is a really important issue there.  If we can get the information back as definitive as possible, more people will not need to go to face-to-face assessments.  As a percentage, we would have expected to be in upper 70s; we are in the 90s, and the reason for that is we just do not have enough information to say “Okay, we’ve looked at what the situation in your personal case is.  We accept your position because of the evidence base for it and we do not need to bring you in for a face-to-face assessment.”  I think we will be better at that if we can do what we have just alluded to, which is actually get more information in as early as possible.  Of course, that will take the pressure off, because that is talking about 15% or 16% of people that are coming for face-to-face assessments that we think probably do not need to.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: In addition to that, as healthcare professionals get more experienced, it becomes easier to make decisions on the basis of the evidence without face-to-face.  Clearly, though, the policy intent was that the majority of people would actually have a face-to-face assessment as the best way, obviously, of trying to properly and objectively assess their capability.  &#xa0;

[[[Q97 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] How are you going to monitor the process?  You clearly understand there is an issue about evidence gathering—where it comes from, timelines, who knows what to get when and who is paying for it—and there is a challenge about how it is then used.  What process have you put in place and will you put in place to monitor that these two bits work: both that you get the information in the timeliest way in the form that you need it, and secondly that it is actually used?  You can have all that data, but if you then do not use it, you have a similar problem.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Quality assurance is the reason they are going around the 100% for some of them who we would not have actually audited properly and said, “You are qualified to do that.”  The other area can actually sometimes be enormously trivial.  For instance, while I was at Bootle, people were filling in “Nationality”, for instance, and they said “Church of England”.  That is not a criticism of an individual; they just did not understand what we were asking.  That was in the written-based version of that.  Then the system will accept that very often, and then the system will say, “No, that’s clearly not a nationality,” and then people have to go back and make phone calls.  It is getting the information as early as possible correct, so that we can then move that down through the system.  That is where the quality assurance is crucial, which is why I and the Committee complained about how long it takes.  Quite rightly, Bill is saying to me, “Mike, I’ve got to get it right,” because otherwise we are not there.  &#xa0;

[[[Q98 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] In terms of standing back and monitoring, all the things you want to change are great, but we need to monitor that has actually happened.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Clearly, there are a number of different points where that has picked up.  Partly, auditing is looking at whether in fact the healthcare professional had all the evidence and whether they should have asked for more evidence they did not have.  Then obviously when we do ask for evidence it is, “Do we get it back?” and “How quickly do we get it back?”  Because it is early, we do not have figures on that yet, but we obviously do monitor that: how often do we ask for further evidence from healthcare professionals, and how quickly is it returned?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Probably the most important piece of evidence that the Committee will be able to see will be the independent review that has to report in 2014.  That will actually set that out.  Sorry, I thought that was very important.  &#xa0;

[[[Q99 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Dame Angela Watkinson:]]] I have just a brief point of clarification about the initial telephone applications.  Where people have possibly speech and language difficulties, sight or hearing impairment, do you accept information from third parties?  Are they allowed to have somebody with them assisting them in their telephone application?  It is not a security issue that a third party cannot do it for them.  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: We do allow that sort of assisted call.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It is exactly like we have done with the previous form-filling.  Macmillan nurses used to fill in the form and then send it off.  We accepted that as not only the person helping them fill in the form, but their evidence as to the condition of the individual.  That is one of the issues that they do not want to do; they do not want to phone because that takes time.  We are trying now to work on a methodology so that we can do that quicker.  

[[[Chair:]]] I think we might have questions on the form coming up.  &#xa0;

[[[Q100 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Minister, I think it was your predecessor but one who told us that under this new system, assessments would take as long as they needed to take and all sorts of good things like that, which sounded good.  Some of us—I think maybe the whole Committee—said then, “How does that sit with trying to do such a big change, reassessing so many people within a timescale?”  There have been some timescale changes, which is good.  Listening to what you have said, it all sounds good, but are you going to look again at your timescales?  If you are going to spend that amount of time on getting this right, is it not going to be very difficult, is it not, to carry out these assessments in time?  People need to know and get some of their anxiety lifted as to when this is going to be happening.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I have looked very carefully at this as a brand new Minister.  That is one thing about being a new Minister: you come in afresh and you can ask why.  I do think we can meet the timescales on PIP.  I also thing that, as I alluded to earlier on, one of the areas that we can work much better on if we have the information is not calling so many people in for those face-to-face assessments.  &#xa0;

[[[Q101 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Indeed, a recommendation I think we made.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: In hindsight, what a wonderful recommendation.

[[[Chair:]]] I hope you have read all our reports.  We were hoping to get on to a whole load of questions about the Work Capability Assessment.  We are not; we are running out of time, but I think this session is really useful because we do have a lot of detailed questions on PIP.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It is a very detailed subject.

[[[Chair:]]] We might ask you to come back, but I will say that at the end of the meeting.  Anne Marie is now going on to the terminal illness, and we have heard quite a number of complaints about this.  &#xa0;

[[[Q102 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Clearly, those people who are terminally ill are a group of people that we are all very concerned to ensure get sensibly and sensitively supported.  Macmillan and, indeed, others—we have had something in from Parkinson’s as well—have really come up with some fairly unhappy statistics.  They say that the research they have undertaken results in evidence that 26% of people with cancer die before they receive payments.  They have raised concerns about these individuals worrying, therefore, with regard to debt issues.  These are just the sorts of things you do not want people who are terminally ill to have to worry about.  With that backdrop, clearly the question from the Committee to you is: what exactly is the process that you follow for PIP claimants in this particular circumstance?  How does that differ from DLA?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Let me just quickly say that I am ever so conscious about that.  I have had constituents in a similar situation before I became the Minister, and subsequently since.  We have to get it right, because these people need the help as fast as they possibly can.  I have met with Macmillan and we have agreed to work together.  I am happy to work with any organisation that works with these people who are in such a difficult time in their lives and for their families and loved ones.  I will ask Jason to do the more technical stuff, but I alluded to one of that areas that Macmillan said to me was delaying and making things take longer.  It was the fact that we had gone to a phone system rather than a paper-based system, because,   particularly for them trying to help their patients, this was causing more delay to them when they were visiting.  In other words, they would just sit there usually and fill out the form; we accept Macmillan’s diagnosis and professional comments.  That would go and then that was basically where the system was.  The key now is there is a phone conversation that takes place that, understandably, Macmillan does not want to be involved in because that holds their nurses in there too long.  Then the DS1500 comes out, which we accept Macmillan or other professionals that are looking after the individual can sign and we are very happy with that, and then it goes back in.  Once it is back in, that is very quick.  It is that piece that we need to squeeze, and that is why I am looking at whether there are other ways we can do it.  I think it is just as quick to fill a form in as it would be to have a PDF sitting on your iPad and hit a button; it goes back in.  It could have the DS1500 on there already if it is a SecureNet 2.0, for instance, or whatever else it may be. Jason will explain the exact process.  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: I will try to keep it brief, because I know there are other questions to come in.  When we looked at PIP in terms of the design, we looked at where we were on DLA.  Very briefly, on DLA you had fill in a form and you had to get the DS1500 form, which is a confirmation of the diagnosis.  Then at that point you put that in and then your claim started when we received that as a Department—when the form would have been filled in and posted, and everything else.  We said, “How can we make that a better process and a quicker process?”  One of the reasons we moved to the design we have for especially those terminally ill claimants for PIP is that it secures the date of claim earlier, so people will get paid the money from an earlier date than they would otherwise have done because it starts from the point at which you contact us.  There is also no form-filling to go through.  I know Macmillan has an issue with this, but for the majority of claimants there is no form filling and we capture the information on the phone.  Perhaps colleagues have been in this area for some time; we had lots of concerns previously about the nature of the DLA claim form, so we wanted to take the claim form out of the process for terminally ill claimants.  They do not have to go through a face-to-face assessment either.  The whole purpose of the design is to give a really quick, fast track process.  As the operational director for delivering PIP, I would absolutely say that the service that we gave for some terminally ill claimants at the beginning of PIP was not up to standard.  It certainly was not where we would be expecting it to be.  I am not going to try to pretend otherwise.  There were some awful experiences that people went through.  There are complexities around that: people are not always immediately diagnosed as terminally ill, they become terminally ill and things like that.  Nevertheless, the service was not where we would want it to be.  There is nobody more committed than our staff to delivering that fast track service.  We have made a number of changes to the process since we have introduced it.  One of the things we have done is we now have dedicated teams in each of our centres.  I have a dedicated team to the terminally ill claims.  We have introduced improvements to the tracking process so that we can track those claims not only when they are with us, but when they are with the assessment provider as well.  One of the big improvements I think we will see is when we increasingly roll out the IT tool that the providers are using: the PIP assessment tool.  We have had examples in the last few weeks now where we have sent the claim over to the assessment provider; they have looked at the evidence that has been provided and returned it to us within a day.  We are beginning to see that coming down.  Most are being dealt with now within 16 days.  We have had roughly 8,000 terminally ill claims and we have cleared 7,000 of them.  I would not deny that there were issues earlier on.  I think we are addressing those.  There are further changes we could make going forward: we are looking and exploring at the moment about whether you have a dedicated, separate telephone line or a dedicated telephone number for terminally ill claims as well.  I would not deny that there have been issues.  We have introduced a number of changes that have seen us improve our performance over recent weeks and there is still more we can do.  The Minister is absolutely right that, if we can get the electronic transfer or speed up the transfer of the confirmation of the terminally ill diagnosis, that will be the single biggest thing that moves us forward in terms of elapsed time.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The DS1500.

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q103 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] There is still quite a lot of paperwork and bodies involved.  I appreciate what you are talking about in terms of using technology and that dealing with these phone calls is clearly causing a problem.  Given that you accept Macmillan when they say, “This individual is certified terminally ill,” do you need to involve the Atoses or Capitas

[[[Mike Penning]]]: No, they are not involved in it.  

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] They are not involved at all. 

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Not in that process.  &#xa0;

[[[Q104 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] In the sense that they are just an extra post box, could you not take out the post box?  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: Bill might want to come in in terms of validating the diagnosis or validating the nature of the terminal illness.  &#xa0;

[[[Q105 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] If it worked before for the DLA to do it fairly quickly for terminally ill cases, why can you not just use that system?  All of the criticisms of the DLA forms may or may not be right, but there seemed to be a very quick process for people who were terminally ill previously.  

[[[Jason Feeney]]]: One of the things we would lose if we went back to that is people would get paid from a later date, so they would lose benefit in essence.  You will get benefit from an earlier date under PIP than you would under DLA.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I know there are issues to deal with so that people make a phone call, but if you make a phone call, there is one piece of paper, which I am going to try and eliminate, which is the DS1500.  That is the only piece of paper; the claimant may not even see it actually, because it will go to whoever has actually diagnosed them with a terminal illness.  We are turning that around within the hour, so it is an hour in and an hour out there.  If we could get the GP, Macmillan or others to be able to help them to have the capability, whoever it is, to get that DS1500 back signed, that would massively speed up the situation, which is the biggest thing that I have been pushing for as well as the other measures that were taking place before I arrived.  It is to actually see how we can remove all the paper and just get on and do it.  &#xa0;

[[[Q106 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] I think the Minister has just answered my question.  The healthcare professionals have been mentioned several times by Dr Gunnyeon.  For me, the GP is the key here, because for somebody who is ill and ends up being diagnosed as terminally ill, the GP could have a hotline, the tick-the-box or whatever it is that could just cut through all the paperwork and, therefore, you could come through instantly.  The GP is key to that.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It is not always the GP, to be honest with you.  Sadly, we lost a family member this year from cancer.  It was the Macmillan nurses who took the responsibility through once he came out of hospital.  The GP’s involvement was very minimal.  I do not think he even knew he was terminally ill, to be honest.  &#xa0;

[[[Q107 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] I am familiar with that sort of situation.  I agree; Macmillan or the GP, whoever it is—the most appropriate people who are closest to the terminally ill patient.  It would be the appropriate person; I accept that.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: We may be able to create a situation whereby we speed it up.  PDF is the obvious one because insurance companies do not send forms to GPs these days.  Security around this and people’s personal data will be really vital, not just the nature of the illness they have, but actually this is their personal data and we would not want that out anywhere else.  Security is key to that.  &#xa0;

[[[Q108 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Are you going to be introducing a target-processing time?  You had one under DLA, but you do not have this for PIP.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: This Government does not believe in targets.  One of the reasons they have always said this—and I remember when I was shadow Health Minister for three and a half years we discussed this time and time again—is because if you fix targets, you will end up doing the easier version of things and the more difficult things just tend to get left.  I do not want to do that.  I do not see any reason why this could not be turned around in seven days.  That would be my perfect situation.  I have seven days written down in here.  My officials have heard me say this to them before.  I cannot say that every single one would be turned around in seven days, but seven days must be better.  It is a lot better than what DLA was.  DLA was not perfect in any shape or form, and those of us who have been constituency MPs over a period of time would have seen where the DLA let people down as well.  It was not perfect.  &#xa0;

[[[Q109 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] But generally it was quite quick.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: It was quite quick, but there were still mistakes.  The forms got lost and things like that.  &#xa0;

[[[Q110 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Whatever the criticisms of the rest of it, they actually did have quite a quick turnaround.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: If we end up with seven days, it will be a lot better than it was before under the 14-day rule.  &#xa0;

[[[Q111 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Minister, I entirely understand what you say, but I guess they do say, “What gets measured gets done.”  In a sense, if you do not want to have particular targets, how are you going to get the pressure on all of those involved to try to make sure that your seven-day ideal is met?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: My size 10 boot is what it is going to be.  I have a passion about this, not just because it has touched my life, but I think it is a moral position that we should be in.  Forget everything else: as long as I am the Minister, and I am sure other Ministers will read what I am saying today, I want to see seven days.  I cannot see any reason why we cannot hit seven days.  They will have to explain to me why we cannot hit seven days or even less if we can get electronic transfer of information coming through securely.  &#xa0;

[[[Q112 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Anne Marie Morris]]]

[[[:]]] Will you be in a position to collect and monitor this so that at least you could then publish to our Committee any of the targets?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I am asking for data on that, and I do not see any reason why we could not supply the Committee on that.  &#xa0;

[[[Q113 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] This is the criteria in the assessment of the moving around activity.  Essentially, why did you reject the overwhelming views of respondents to your consultation about changing the moving around activity criteria from 50&#xa0;metres to 20 metres?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will ask my Chief Medical Adviser in a moment to answer that question.  Why was it 50 metres in the first place?  It was an arbitrary figure.  The situation today is with 20 metres; it is 20&#xa0;metres or more if it is not safe for you to do so.  We had set a position as to what it was.  We were challenged that we had not consulted; the consultation came back and we came to the conclusion that Bill will give you information on.  I will say that I asked for evidence on, for instance, why it was 50 metres or why it was not 100&#xa0;metres, or 2&#xa0;metres or whatever.  It is an arbitrary figure.  Of course it is a figure that has to be set and we have made the decision to switch to 20.  Bill will probably explain all the medical and technical reasons why.   

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Obviously, we discussed it when I was last here with the previous Minister.  It is important to remember the policy intent behind PIP and the assessment.  It was actually to identify as accurately as we could those who faced the greatest challenges in participating on a daily basis in society.  Mobility was clearly a challenging one, and one of the things that we did was to recognise that in DLA, other than for individuals who were able to do it through deeming provisions, those who had mental, cognitive, intellectual and indeed sensory impairments generally could not achieve higher rate mobility; it was only those with physical impairments.  The whole mobility area when we developed the assessment was designed to try to ensure that we properly reflected both.  When it comes to the physical side of things, there is no gold standard way of assessing.  The assessment development group as we were developing the assessment spent a lot of time looking at this.  We looked at different ways of doing it.  There was not anything that was perfect.  In the second draft of the criteria, we tried to do something that reflected aids and adaptations that was designed to have the same policy intent as in fact the subsequent 20&#xa0;metres and 50 metres does.  It was very clear to us as a result of the response to the second draft of the criteria that it was not clear at all to people and, in fact, it was confusing.  As a consequence of that consultation—I do want to emphasise again we looked very carefully at that—we made a lot of changes to the second draft criteria.  The one that clearly caused lots of confusion was Activity 12, which is moving around.  We looked again at that, and in order to try to identify those who faced the greatest challenge in moving around, we felt that, within those who could walk not more than 50&#xa0;metres, there were those who were more significantly constrained.  That is why we made a clear distinction.  Remember that those who are able to walk more than 20 metres, but not more than 50&#xa0;metres, qualify for standard rate PIP.  A lot of people could walk more than 20 metres, but if they cannot do that reliably—and again we had a lot of discussion about that, and subsequent to the last time I was before the Committee, the Government amended the regulations to include reliability criteria in the regulations—they will still qualify for the enhanced rate of PIP, as will those who have the most significant constraints on their mobility.  &#xa0;

[[[Q114 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Does that mean they have to be assessed again?  Are they going to have to go through that process again, or is it simply an appeal?

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Sorry, in terms of?  I am probably misunderstanding.  

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] You have just said that people who can manage slightly more than 20 metres, but are still experiencing physical difficulties—

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Cannot do it reliably, so safely and—

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Do they appeal or are they reassessed?  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: That would be part of the assessment.  Can I also emphasise that the issue of reliability, being able to do things reliably, was always a part of the assessment?  The issue before was whether it was in the regulations or not.  Then as a result of our consultation, we have committed to some other measures to make sure that that is also acted upon, because I know the Committee had concerns about whether, even if it was in the regulations, it would necessarily be applied.  We are therefore looking at making sure that we have the requirement for the healthcare professionals to demonstrate that they have considered that during the course of reaching their conclusion.  &#xa0;

[[[Q115 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Do you stand by the Government’s own figures that 428,000 people will no longer qualify for the enhanced rate of benefit?  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: I think there has been a lot of confusion about the figures.  If I can clarify, the 428,000—because it has been presented on some occasions as that is the difference between the moving around activity change from the second draft to the final draft—is the predicted difference between those who got DLA higher rate mobility had we not reformed DLA and those who will get PIP enhanced rate as a result of the final draft of the criteria.  It is that difference.  &#xa0;

[[[Q116 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Do you have a reliable figure of people who will be impacted against because of this change?  One of the things that is consistently brought up to us is that this means people with disabilities are going to be trapped in their own homes, quite apart from the 50,000 who are presently in work who the Disability Benefits Consortium say probably will lose their job.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: There are also people with cognitive, mental, intellectual and sensory impairments, who would not previously have been able to get the enhanced rate, who now qualify for the enhanced rate.  There are people with non-physical impairments now who would qualify who would equally have faced the challenges of being able to move around.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Madam Chair, my officials have just indicated, and I am sure the Committee is aware, that there is an application to judicially review the decision outstanding as well, so I am slightly constrained.  &#xa0;

[[[Q117 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Do you have an estimate of the savings in PIP expenditure as will arise from your decision?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I do not have that in front of us, but I will write to the Committee and give that to you.  &#xa0;

[[[Q118 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] In the interests of time, Chairman, a lot of the questions I was going to ask have already been asked.  

[[[Chair:]]] That is just as well because we only have 10 minutes.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I am sorry.  

[[[Graham Evans:]]] I was just wondering, Minister: the Atos contract is a loss-making contract from their point of view.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: The WCA?  

[[[Graham Evans:]]] Yes.  I was just wondering how concerned you are if you are dealing with an organisation—you mentioned using your size 10 boot to try to encourage them to meet their contractual obligations—as main contractor that is loss-making.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: On the WCA contract in particular, the first thing I would say—and I cannot go into too much detail—is there are global negotiations going on with Atos to do with their contracts within my Department.  At the same time, we have already issued to the European Journal that we intend to go out to tender for other suppliers for the facilities on WCA.  At the moment, Atos is the sole provider and they will not be going forward.  They have a contract with us until 2015.  Our tender is for contracts beyond that.  I want to make sure that this market is opened up to more providers and make it worthwhile for those providers to come in.  You are absolutely right, and I have seen the evidence that was given to this Committee way back, that it was not possible to make a profit based on the tender that Atos had.  That was a decision they made and a decision that the Government at the time knew, and still accepted.  That will have to be for them and those Ministers at the time to address.  We are picking up the mess behind that.  &#xa0;

[[[Q119 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] Can you reassure the Committee that lessons have been learnt when renegotiating the contracts after 2015?  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Absolutely, lessons have been learnt.  If you look at the Atos contract within PIP, it is a completely different sort of contract that they can earn some money on if they deliver what we are asking them to deliver.  If they do not, then it is not a size 10 boot that will actually sort this issue out.  It will be the penalties.  The crucial thing is making sure of what we all want: that the customers, the people here that are in need—and I use the word “customers” because I think in real terms that is the sort of customer care we should be putting into this—actually get the delivery and service that they deserve.  That is where we are, but I have been very careful not to go around blaming somebody else.  The mess we picked up with WCA is astronomical.  &#xa0;

[[[Q120 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] Dr Gunnyeon, are you confident with the healthcare professionals you have been referring to that a) there are enough of them, and b) they are up to the job?  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: In terms of the WCA?

[[[Graham Evans:]]] Yes.

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: Obviously, I am conscious of time.  Clearly, when we identified a quality issue, the improvement plan that Atos put in place involved some retraining and then re-accreditation of all their healthcare professionals.  They have gone through that and that has been quite a big exercise, but I think an incredibly important one.  A lot of healthcare professionals have left the business either by deciding they did not wish to try to re-accredit or they did not meet the standards.  I think now we are in a very much better position and the quality of WCA assessments is very much better than it was.  We have looked very recently again not just at monitoring the quality, but actually looking at a sample of the cases, and they are very different now.  They are much better.  I am confident that now the quality is getting back to pretty much where we would have always wanted it to be.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Certainly, from the conversations I have had at board level with Atos—because we have taken it to a level where they had to really realise just how bad this was for their reputation in the UK, with other contracts in other Departments as well—they do get it that they have to step up to the plate and provide.  We are not mucking about here; this is really serious stuff.  &#xa0;

[[[Q121 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Just very briefly: I do not know if you saw this; it was published yesterday.  This is people’s experience, and they are saying that WCA has not improved.  It is The People’s Review of the Work Capability Assessment: Further Evidence.  It is people’s experience of this year, and they are saying that it is still not up to scratch.  I appreciate that we are not going to go into this, but I cannot let you make a statement like that without it being challenged, because that is not people’s experience.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: I understand that entirely.  If I could just, in my defence, say that I have been absolutely clear on what I believe the situation is.  That is very recent, though.  Remember that the problems were identified last year.  

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] But they are still saying there are problems.  

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Gunnyeon]]]: The improvement plan was not put in place until June.  In fact, there was a real challenge because it took a considerable amount of time for all healthcare professionals to be re-accredited.  That was not finished and there are still some moving through it who were off on maternity leave or on sickness absence at the time.  That was not completed until early October, so unless that evidence is based on the past six or eight weeks, I would not have expected that there would necessarily not still have been problems identified.  Clearly, I am concerned by any feedback, but I think if we were looking at that report this time next year that had been done in the year from now forwards, I would hope it would be very different.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will respond and make sure that we learn any lessons from the report.  &#xa0;

[[[Q122 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] All of that is going to be an evidence session in itself.  We had quite a lot of questions on WCA.  Rather than rushing through and not getting them in detail, I wonder if you would be kind enough to come back to talk about WCA.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I would, Madam Chair.  Could I also say that it would be important when I come back to have something to say?  

[[[Chair:]]] It is going to be in the new year now anyway.  

[[[Mike ]]]

[[[Penning]]]: I will contact the Chair once these global negotiations have gone, because this is one particular contract that we are referring to, and then of course I need to issue the tender documents for the new providers.  &#xa0;

[[[Q123 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] There are a number of things we have touched on today where you have said there are statistics for the earlier PIPs coming out tomorrow, so that will be in the public domain.  I understand that fourth Annual Review, Dr Litchfield’s first, is coming out tomorrow as well.  We are very keen to speak to Dr Litchfield, and we have to make that appointment through the DWP.  They say that his contract has effectively ended, so I wonder if you could help facilitate him coming in front of the Committee.  I am sure he would be delighted to explain his findings, so I am hoping that you will be able to instruct the Department that they should give us every access to him that they can.  That would be most helpful.  Is that something that you would be—?

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will look at the legal—I will have to just look at whether contractually I can do that.  If I can, I will do it.  &#xa0;

[[[Q124 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] I do not think Dr Lichfield knows that he has been turned down.  It is the way the process works that we have to do it through DWP.  If you can give us his phone number, we will be quite happy.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I will write to you tomorrow.&#xa0;

[[[Q125 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] That would be very useful, as is your agreement to come back, because we obviously have a lot of questions around the WCA and Atos’ performance.  The new thing, which we have not had a chance to speak to any Minister about, is the mandatory reconsideration, and we are building up quite a lot of evidence around that.  That only came in October, so all of these things are important and are certainly important to the people—

[[[Mike Penning]]]: In the meantime, if there are any other questions you have not had the opportunity to ask me today, perhaps if you write and ask me those questions, we can give you some evidence.  When I come to the evidence session, I will be better informed.  &#xa0;

[[[Q126 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] There is obviously a lot of anecdotal stuff about just how long the claims process is taking.  Six months does seem ridiculous, even if it was the early ones.  There is also a complaint we have not raised about the suitability of some of the assessment centres.  There is a rumour going around that, if you get to the assessment centre, then you are going to get turned down because they have made it particularly difficult.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I have heard that rumour.  

[[[Chair:]]] I know in Aberdeen they are moving it into the city.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I think you are moving into the same office.  

[[[Chair:]]] Possibly.  They have to sort out the access problems.  At the moment, they are in a small town 16 miles north of Aberdeen to cover the whole north-east.  That is a problem, too.  Thank you very much for your evidence.  

[[[Mike Penning]]]: I thoroughly enjoyed it and it has been very useful to me.  

[[[Chair:]]] I am always worried when Ministers say that.

[[[Mike Penning]]]: When I was on a Select Committee, I used to think the same.  I think it has been very useful. &#xa0;

[[[Chair:]]] Can I thank you and your officials coming along this morning for what were very detailed questions but I think very useful, because it has clarified a number of points? 

[[[Mike Penning]]]: Three months in, my brain is pretty frazzled, but I will get there.  

[[[Chair:]]] Thanks again.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              Oral evidence: Personal Independence Payment implementation, HC 911                            33
