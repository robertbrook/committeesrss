"&#xa0;\nRMP 07&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Royal Mail Group&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is pleased to respond to the Select Committee for Business, Innovation and Skills on its short inquiry into \nthe \nGovernment’s \nintention to conduct a sale of shares in Royal Mail\n.\n \nThe Government’s intention\n is to dispose of a majority stake, taking into account shares sold and those transferred to employees as part of the employee share scheme.\n \nThe Government will retain flexibility around the size of stake to be sold, as this will be influenced by market co\nnditions at the time of the transaction, investor demand and the objective to ensure that overall value for money for the taxpayer is achieved. \nRoyal Mail welcome\ns the Government’s\n decision. The company needs to be \nflexible, responsive,\n \nand have future acc\ness to \ncapital.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is also pleased that\n the Government has decided to allocate 10% of the\n shares\n in\n the company to\n all eligible employees\n free of charge. Employees of the Group will have a real stake in the company and a significant voice\n in its future\n.\n This is the largest \nfree stake of any major UK privatisation\n.\n More employees will be able to participate in the\n Royal Mail\n Free Share scheme than in any other UK privatisation for almost 30 years.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is the sole provider of the \nUniversal\n Postal\n Service in the UK, serving more than 29 million addresses, 6 days a week. Our Universal Service obligations are outlined in th\ne Postal Services Act 2011. They are \nset out in detail in the Universal Service Order. This statutory document is\n set and regulated by the \ncommunications regulator Ofcom\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the Universal Service provider, Royal Mail has a legal obligation to provide a uniform-priced Universal Service across the UK\n, including remote and rural areas\n. \nW\ne\n maintain a \nsubstantial \nnetwork\n across the UK – a network with the ability to deliver to every household and collect from every collection point, six days a week\n.\n  Any change to this obligation would require an affirmative vote in both Houses of Parliament.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPost Office Ltd has been \nformally separated from Royal Mail Group since April 201\n2\n. We\n continue\n as sister companie\ns\n with \nsubstantial\n shared interests\n. Post Office \nis an important retail outlet for\n Royal Mail services under a long term commercial \ndistribution \nagreement.\n The mutual \ncommercial success of both companies is best served by Royal Mail and Post Office working closely together for the benefit of \ncustomers. \nA successful, com\nmercially viable Royal Mail can\n generate more business for the Post Office and help secure its nationw\nide network of branches.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn December 2008, Richard Hooper published an independent report into\n the UK postal services sector. His report \noutlined steps to make \nthe Universal Service sustainable. Hooper made four \nkey \npolicy recommendations:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHooper made clear that his “recommendations are a package…Each element of the package is needed if the universal service is to be sustained.”\n \nHooper updated his review in the sum\nmer of 2010. His update argued that “private sector capital would inject private sector disciplines into the company and would reduce the risk of political intervention in commercial decisions, thus accelerating modernisation.” Hooper also considered alter\nnative not-for-profit and not-for-dividend models, but concluded that these would not be \n“\nappropriate or workable.\n”\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government facilitated \nthe \nimplementation of Hooper’s recommendations through the Postal Services Act 2011. \nThis\n allowed \nthe \ntransfer\n of\n \nthe Group’s \npension \nliabilities for pre-April 2012 service and certain pension assets relating to the Royal Mail Pension Plan\n,\n to \nGovernment. The Government also \nappoint\ned\n Ofcom as the new postal services regulator. Ofcom has since reformed the regulat\nory framework for postal services in the UK.\n \nT\nhe Government aims to complete \nthe \nimplementation of Hooper’s package of reforms through a sale of shares in Royal Mail in this financial year.\n The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has sai\nd that “now the time has come for Government to step back from Royal Mail and allow its management to focus wholeheartedly on growing the business and planning for the future.”\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrivatisa\ntion will give Royal Mail flexible\n access to private capital. This \nwill\n be a positive step for Royal Mail and the Universal Service.\n Royal Mail wants to combine the best of the public and private sectors.\n \nFor Royal Mail to innovate and \nremain competitive in the marketplace\n,\n it\n need\ns to continue its\n transformation. \nDeutsch\ne Post has invested more than £20bn in its business since it was floated in 2001 whilst delivering one of the highest quality universal services in Europe. In comparison, since Royal Mail began its modernisation programme in 2006/7, it has invested c.£2.8b\nn on modernisation. \nRoyal Mail needs to increase revenue from the growing parcels market. This is \na \ncompetitive\n market\n and investment in new technology will be crucial. \nHaving \nflexible\n \naccess to \ncapital would help to deliver our long term strategy, leading\n to a sustainable Universal Service.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Universal Service&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is the designated provider of the universal postal service, committed to providing the high quality U\nniversal \nS\nervice\n that the Government\n and regulator have\n set down. We ar\ne honoured to provide the universal service.\n Royal Mail Group’s strategic vision is to be recognised as the best delivery company in the UK.\n We believe that the nationwide network we maintain in order to deliver the Universal Service puts us in a strong position to compete and meet emerging customer demand. \nT\nhe ability to visit every address in the UK, six days a week\n provides commercial advan\ntages to Royal Mail\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Postal Services Act 2011 protects the high-quality Universal Service\n enjoyed by customers across the UK\n. Its protections would continue to apply following any sale of shares\n in Royal Mail\n. The protections include a uniform service\n to rural areas, to which Royal Mail must continue to deliver the same high-quality service or risk large fines.  It also protects specific services, such as the Articles for the Blind scheme, which provides free postal services to blind or partially sight\ned people.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Postal Services Act 2011 sets down the minimum requirements of the universal postal service in law. These minimum requirements include the collection of letters every Monday to Saturday and a delivery service at affordable prices in accorda\nnce with a uniform tariff throughout the UK.  The requirements are set out \nin S\nection 31 of the Postal Services Act 2011.  Any change to these minimum requirements would require the approval of both houses of the UK Parliament. The requirements are:\n&#xa0;\nUniversal Service requirementApplies after privatisation6 day a week delivery to the home or premises of every individual in the UK\nYes\n6 day a week collection from every access point (e.g. post boxes and post offices) in the UK\nYes\nA uniform, \naffordable tariff across the UK\nYes\nThe provision of a registered items service at a uniform tariff\nYes\nThe provision of an insured items service at a uniform tariff\nYes\nFree postage for the blind and partially sighted\nYes\nA free service of conveying \nqualifying legislative petitions\nYes\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst and Second Class stamped and franked mail, and Royal Mail First and Second Class parcels to 20kg, are part of the Universal Service.  That means they have to be offered on a universal (“one-price-goes-anywhere”) tariff at affordable prices.  Ofcom ha\nve recently concluded that these services meet the needs of the vast majority of postal users and there is no case for changing the terms of the Universal Service (Ofcom Review of postal users’ needs, 27 March 2013). \n&#xa0;\nPrices&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012, Ofcom said that Roya\nl Mail’s fi\nnancial position meant there was\n \n“\na risk to the financial sustainability of the Universal Service”. Ofcom recognised the need for Royal Mail “to materially increase prices in order to support the sustainability of the universal service.” \nRoyal \nMail increased stamp prices in April 2012 to help to address the threat to the sustainability of the Universal Service.\n Royal Mail also reconfigured its parcels tariffs in 2013\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStamp prices, whether set under public or private ownership, are subject to \nsignificant competitive pressures. Customers have many alternatives to the post. \nOfcom have reported that more than \n37 billion te\nx\nt messages were sent in 2012\n. \nMore than half of adults own a smart phone, \nand 49% regularly use smart phones to access the int\nernet\n [Ofcom Communication Markets Report, August 2013]\n. \nHouseholds and businesses increasingly use e-mail to communicate in preference to post. \nThese are just a few examples of the proliferation of alternatives to the post, which naturally mean that Royal\n Mail must be cautious in its pricing and customer strategies.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK stamp prices are among the best value in the EU. In five of the six weight steps for First Class and Second Class mail, the cost of UK stamps are ranked in the bottom half of prices when \ncompared with other EU countries. In some cases, the UK is the cheapest.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfcom is legally obliged to ensure an affordable postal service and can reintroduce regulation on any Universal Service product. Ofcom concluded in March 2013 that Royal Mail’s servi\nces were affordable to consumers and small and medium sized businesses.\n Ofcom said (in their report on the affordability of postal services, published 19 March 2013):\n&#xa0;\n“The evidence we have collected indicates that universal postal services are affordable \nfor both residential consumers (including low income and other vulnerable consumers) and businesses (including small and medium businesses) at current prices. We have reviewed the price changes that are due to take effect from 2 April 2013 (as announced by\n Royal Mail in March 2013), and consider that universal postal services will continue to be affordable following these changes.”\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2013 there was no increase in the price of first class or second class stamps for letters. Ofcom has also set safeguard pri\nce caps on Second Class stamped mail in 2012, which also covers Second Class parcels up to 2kg. The cap\n calculation\n is set for seven years (from April 2012). \n&#xa0;\nQuality of service&#xa0;\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is regulated by Ofcom.  The regulator sets a minimum delivery \nstandard for the whole of the UK.  Currently the target for First Class mail is 93% delivery the next working day.  For Second Class mail the target is 98.5% delivery within three working days. Royal Mail has amongst the highest service specifications of a\nny major EU member\n state. These\n include:\n&#xa0;\nService specificationsPerformance measureStandardDelivery routes completed each day\n99.9%\nAccess points served each day\n99.9%\nPostal packets deemed delivered\n99.5%\nFirst class mail delivered next working \nday\n93.0%\nSecond class postal packets up to 1kg delivered within 3 working days\n98.5%\nSecond class postal packets more than 1kg delivered within 3 working days\n90.0%\nSpecial Delivery up to 10kg delivered by 13:00 next working day\n99.0%\nInternational \nMail going to the EU delivered within 3 working days\n85.0%\nFirst class mail delivered next working day in each of 118 postcode areas\n91.5%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail’s Quality of Service report for 2012/13 reveals that the vast majority of mail was delivered in \nline with its targets. Royal Mail narrowly missed the 93.0 per \ncent First Class mail target with 92.4 per cent of this mail delivered the next working day, when taking into account disruption from external events.\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn a very competitive market, Quality of Service is one of the key drivers of success. That would not change if Royal Mail were \nprivatised\n. The Quality of Service regime that applies to Royal Mail under public ownership will continue to apply under private\n ownership - Ofcom has specified the minimum standards un\nder the Universal Service Order\n.\n We are the only postal operator in the UK who has to meet these high standards and regularly publish performance results.\n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence from elsewhere in Europe shows tha\nt postal operators maintain or improve their quality of service following privatisation.\n Both Deutsche Post and Austria\n Post deliver more than 95% of letters the day after posting. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the past decade, the postal services sector has changed \ndramatically\n.\n A decline in mail volumes has coincided with the liberalisation of the market and the emergence of competition. In recent\n years, we have seen a significant\n increase in the number of parcels being sent. All of this has meant a difficult proces\ns of change for our people. Many of Royal Mail’s employees have seen changes to their working practices as the company \nhas adapted its operations\n to the changed mix of mail. \nMore than 50,000 people have left the business since March 2003.\n \nChange will conti\nnue and the company will \nemploy fewer people in the future,\n whoever owns it. The company remains committed to the overarching objective of achieving this without compulsory redundancies.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail Group\n’s\n vision \nis \nto be \nrecognised as \nthe most successful\n delivery company in the UK. Our strategy is underpinned by three priorities: capitalising on growth in online retailing to grow our parcels businesses; continuing to m\nanage\n structural decline in the letters market by maximising the value of mail; and by being customer-focused. We believe we can drive sustainable, profitable growth that will enable us to obtain ongoing access to external capital and secure a sustainable futur\ne for our Company. \nThe company will need to be smaller and more efficient in the future regardless of ownership.\n Delivering this strategy will require significant change. We will consult on any changes with the CWU, Unite, and our people.\n&#xa0;\nEmployee terms and conditions&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll terms and conditions and collective agreements that apply to employees would remain in place were there to be a change in ownership of the company, on the same basis that they apply to employees now. Royal Mail will continue to have a pr\nedominantly full time workforce, supported by part time workers, with a national split of around 75% full time workers to 25% part time. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese \njob security\n, and other, commitments are part of current agreements with the Communication Workers Union. If \nand when any changes are proposed, Royal Mail will, as now,\n \nand where appropriate, discuss these with the unions with a view to reaching agreement.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have proposed a three year agreement with the CWU, protecting terms and conditions and committing to sig\nnificant pay rises\n for employees in the core business\n. The agreement would include a pay increase of 8.6% over the three year period. This is highly competitive, and is believed to be one of the best pay deals on offer from any major UK company at this tim\ne.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is \nalso \nseeking to create a legally binding and enforceable contract with the CWU. The proposed contract would mean pay and protections for employees could not be changed for the three-year period of the contract without CWU agreement. Royal\n Mail believes \nthat this has not been done before for any major \nUK \nprivatisation\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, as part of the proposed agreement, Royal Mail is committed to provide and enhance existing services to customers using the current workforce and there will be n\no change to the current structure of \nthe \ncompany in relation to these services.\n&#xa0;\n No additional outsourcing of services is expected during the period of the agreement.\n&#xa0;\nEmployee shares&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government has said that it intends to give 10% of the shares in \nRoyal Mail to eligible employees free of charge at the time of the Initial Public Offering. This will be the biggest free share offer of any major privatisation for almost 30 years.\n&#xa0;\nEmployee share offers in previous privatisations &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYear\nOverall stake in\n company allocated to employees\nOverall free shares (as a % of overall company shares)\nBritish Aerospace\n1982\n3.3%\n0.09%\nBT\n1984\n5%\n0.13%\nBritish Gas\n1986\n5%\n0.14%\nBritish Airways\n1987\n9.5%\n0.35%\nBritish Steel \n1988\n6.2%\n0.16%\nWater Plcs\n1989\n3%\n0.07%\nRoyal Mail2013-1410%10%&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail welcomes the Government’s decision on free share allocation. Eligible employees will automatically have a meaningful stake in the company and the potential to benefit from its future success. \nAcademic studies have shown that \nmost\n UK employees who engaged with their employee share ownership plan were more motivated and committed to their employer\n, and many\n \nfelt that participating in an ESO gave them a greater sense of personal ownership for their job or a greater sense of personal ownership for the company. \n(\nLoughborough University four-year study into the human impact of HMRC-approved all-employee share pla\nns, 2012).\n&#xa0;\n4.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShares will be allocated \nto all eligible staff equally, reg\nardless of grade or pay levels\n. The allocation will be pro-rated based on an employee’s paid hours to differentiate between full and part time workers. \n&#xa0;\n4.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEmployees will be able to see t\nhe value of their shares any time that the stock market is open. They will also be able to vote in key decisions on how the company is run. The company will use this opportunity to engage\n with employees even more, as well as actively communicating the bene\nfits of free shares\n. We will conduct major internal communications programmes around the company’s results and commercial strategy. \n&#xa0;\n4.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe overwhelming majority of Royal Mail Group employees in the UK, including employees working in Parcelforce Worldwide, \nwill be eligible for free shares if they meet certain criteria. Employees of GLS and other subsidiaries and joint ventures are not eligible to receive free shares.\n \nThe free employee shares will be of the same class as those available for wider sale. \nEmploy\nees will therefore obtain voting rights and will be eligible to receive dividends like other shareholders. \n&#xa0;\n4.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail employees who are eligible for an automatic free share allocation under the employee share scheme will also have the option to buy addit\nional shares through the\n Employee Priority Offer\n. Eligible employees will be given priority when those shares are allocated. \n&#xa0;\n4.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe free shares to be offered on a flotation are not related to section 31 of the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013. The free sh\nares are to be awarded under the long-standing, HMRC approved share plan known as a Share Incentive Plan. Further details have yet to be announced but, under HMRC rules, employees cannot be asked to pay anything or give anything up, including employment ri\nghts, to receive free shares.\n \nRoyal Mail will write to all employees nearer the time of the issue. Employees will be given the option to opt-out of the employee share offer if they do not wish to participate for any reason.\n&#xa0;\nWorking with our unions&#xa0;\n4.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking together with our colleagues and unions\n is\n the best way to be successful. We work together with both the CWU and Unite on a range of issues, including reform of the regulatory regime, \nnew ways of working, our Agenda for Growth, \nworkplace safety, an\nd the issue of dangerous dogs. \nWhilst we do not agree on everything, we value the input our unions give us and the work that they conduct throughout the business. We will continue to \nwork closely\n with our union colleagues during the on\n-\ngoing transformation\n of the company.\n&#xa0;\n4.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is currently negotiating a legally binding agreement on pay, terms and conditions for employees. \nThe CWU have said that they will ballot for industrial action should \nprogress not be made by September 2013\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven the suggestion\n of industrial action is not\n in the best interests of the company, its customers, or its employees. Royal Mail’s revenue is increasingly \ngenerated by\n parcels – 48% of total revenue in 2012-13. This is a very competitive sector. Our customers have many choi\nces and can easily switch their business to competitors.\n \nAny disruption to our service is not helpful.\n&#xa0;Pensions&#xa0;4.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail’s main pension plan – the Royal Mail Pension Plan\n (RMPP)\n – was closed to new members in March 2008. At the same time, members\n’ benefits ceased to build up on a final salary basis and switched to Career Salary Defined Benefit. Despite these changes, the Plan remained one of the largest defined benefit schemes in the UK (based on membership and assets). \nThe company made s\nignifican\nt pension deficit cash contributions on top of its ongoing pension costs\n.\n \nIt\n recognised a deficit on its balance sheet which ranged from £2.7bn to £7.5bn. This meant Royal Mail faced issues with respect to Going Concern, it was balance sheet insolvent and \nit carried material pension risk and volatility.\n&#xa0;\n4.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe European Commission granted State Aid approval on 21 March 2012, allowing the transfer of almost all of the pension liabilities and assets of RMPP built up until 31 March 2012 to be transferred to Gover\nnment. The transfer left RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis at the time of the transfer, and immediately removed the requirement for the company to make further deficit cash contributions. \n&#xa0;\n4.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDefined benefit pensions are becoming increasingly costly fo\nr all the remaining employers who offer such a scheme because of conditions in the financial markets, including very low gilt yields. \nT\nhe proportion of companies that closed their defined benefit schemes to existing employees climbed to 31 per cent in 2012\n. This is an increase of more than a third from 23 per cent in 2011\n (Source: NAPF)\n.\n&#xa0;4.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the transfer \nof the majority of the assets and liabilities in the RMPP \nto the Royal Mail Statutory Pensions Scheme, t\nhe Government \nnow \nstands behind the \nbenefits\n \nRoyal Mail Pension Plan \nmembers built up\n until 31 March 2012. The Government is legally responsible for the\n pension members of the P\nlan built up until that date\n. However, the \npredicted cost of the Plan going forward\n has been affected by\n falling gilt yields\n, as outlined above.\n&#xa0;\n4.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail has a proposal to keep the Royal Mail Pension Plan open for existing members, subject to certain conditions, at least until the end of the\n Company’s\n next periodic review in March 2018\n. \nThe consultation o\nn the proposal closed on 25 August 2013\n.\n The company is now considering / reviewing member feedback and continuing discussions with its unions.\n&#xa0;\n4.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposal would\n use some of the \nc.\n£2 billion of assets left in the Plan\n at the time of\n the transfer to Gover\nnment last year to keep the Plan open\n until at least the conclusion of the next periodic review in 2018, and subject to conditions\n.\n Compared to many other define\nd benefit pension schemes, the C\nompany is in a\n strong position. Many employers have announced t\nhey are closing their\n schemes. We have a proposal to keep the\n Plan open.\n Plan members will not have to pay more, and retirement age and\n accrual rates will not change.\n&#xa0;\n4.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMembers’ pension benefits are important. Royal Mail knows how much members\n value the \nbenefits provided. Royal Mail already puts approximately £400\n million in cash in\nto the Plan every year and will\n keep doing so.\n We believe this is the largest ongoing contribution of any UK company. \nAn\n agreement on our pension proposal would, subject to its\n conditions,\n be legally binding on the Company.\n The agreement would be binding on new owners of the Company.\n This has been confirmed by Government. It would be reconfirmed by\n Government at the time of \nprivatisation\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPost Offices&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Post Office is the nationwide network of branches offering a range of Government and financial services, as well as the sale of Royal Mail’s services on its behalf. It plays a key role in many local communities. \nR\no\ny\na\nl Mail \na\nnd \nP\no\ns\nt\n \nOffi\nc\ne\n \nL\nt\nd h\na\nve sign\ned a \nl\nong \nt\nerm ag\nr\ne\nement,\n \nwhich p\nr\no\nvides the \nf\nr\na\nme\nw\no\nr\nk\n \na\nr\no\nu\nnd which the t\nw\no busine\ns\nses \nw\no\nr\nk\n \nsince they be\nc\name si\ns\nt\ner\n \nc\nomp\na\nnies \nin\n \nApril 2012. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe long-term commercial agreement ensures that Royal Mail services \nwill continue to be\n available through all post offices in the future.\n In January 2012, then Postal Services Minister Edward Davey said:\n&#xa0;\n“Concerns people had about the Post Office becoming independent from Royal Mail were always misplaced as that separation is part of our cu\nre, but the ten year deal struck between Royal Mail and the Post Office will give subpostmasters and others greater confidence.”\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Post O\nffice Ltd’s Network Report 2013, it said that there has been “greater stability over recent years than has been the c\nase for the previous quarter of a century.”\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is in both Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd’s interest to ensure a strong, comprehensive post office network. Combined with Government funding of the Post Office and allowing Royal Mail to access external capit\nal, separation will safeguard the future of both companies and the commercial relationship between them. \nSeparation has also given Post Office management greater freedom to focus on its customers and growing its revenue base.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContinued\n transformation of R\noyal Mail would result in more business – particularly from the growing parcels market - going through post offices, and a stronger post office network. At the same time, the Post Office Network Transformation programme will result in longer opening hours \nat post offices, and greater flexibility for postal services users. This will allow Royal Mail’s customers greater access to parcels services and benefit both companies. \n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal \nMail, working with the Post Office, will later this year \nlaunch \nthe UK’s large\nst ‘click and collect’ network to support online shopping growth by providing greater choice of convenient parcel delivery options for online retailers and their customers.\n \nPost Office has the largest retail network in the UK, making branches the ideal loc\nations to provide convenient, secure parcel collection facilities. 99 per cent of the population lives within three miles of a Post Office branch. Around 10,500 Post Offices will be taking part in the initiative which will enable online retailers to offer \nshoppers the opportunity to order items for collection at their local \npost office \nbranch.\n&#xa0;\nHeritage&#xa0;\n5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is proud of its heritage. It is one of the best \nknown and trusted \nbrands in the country. There would be no incentive to rebrand or change its iconic visual symbols like post boxes. \nTo do so would require very significant expenditure and \nwould \nrisk alienating our customers.\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Sovereign will continue to approve all \nstamp issues. The Secretary of State has the power to ensure her image\n, and the image of subsequent Monarchs,\n appears on stamps. This process is safeguarded in the Postal Services Act 2011 (Section 62 – “UK postage stamps bearing an image of Her Majesty”\n a\nnd Section 10, Interpretation Act 1978 – “References to the Sovereign”\n).\n&#xa0;\n5.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail established the B\nritish \nP\nostal \nM\nuseum and \nA\nrchive\n in 2004 to manage the public records of The Royal Mail Archive. Stamps form part of the public record and could only be s\nold with the agreement of the National Archive and other Government bodies. The long-term funding agreements signed between Royal Mail \nand the BPMA will continue beyond privatisation.\n Royal Mail has also gifted Calthorpe House, the site of the BPMA’s new s\ntorage and exhibition centre, to the museum.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government’s recent reforms have put Royal Mail back in a position to compete and grow. The transfer of the \nto the Government of the Group’s pension liabilities for pre-1 April 2012 service and \ncertain assets relating to the Royal Mail Pension Plan,\n and reform of the regulatory framework, alongside an acceleration in the company’s transformation programme, have returned Royal Mail to profit. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe challenge is now to maintain this positive moment\num. \nPrivatisation will allow the company to innovate, invest, improve our services, win new business, deliver the high quality Universal Service, and continue to be \na very substantial employer in the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\n"
