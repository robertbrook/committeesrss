[[[JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE DRAFT DEREGULATION BILL]]]Call for Written Evidence 15 September 2013&#xa0;Dear Sir/Madam&#xa0;

[[[Widening the debate]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I discovered by chance the invitation to comment on the Draft Deregulation Bill while looking at the Red Tape Challenge website. I was concerned to read that it was proposed that there may be a duty to promote economic growth – on a planet of finite resources – perhaps not the best idea. Of course there are no easy answers, but accepting the limits to growth would certainly help to appraise alternatives.  There are many different viewpoints and I would hope the debate was wider so that other viewpoints could be considered and “flaws” ironed out. The time scale for the debate should not be fixed so to speak at 3 months. It should be ongoing.&#xa0;Many people, economists8 and organisations with something important to say will be unaware of the consultation, such as CASSE9 (the Centre for the Advancement of a Steady State Economy). The deadline should be extended and the debate ongoing. I would like to make some general comments.&#xa0;I believe there are fundamental flaws in the concept of the red tape challenge, for example the embarrassing list of members interests on the ACRE13 web site. Will the introduction of a duty to have regard to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator.  I feel there is

[[[ no true]]] or limited “independence” with regard to food safety regulators for example and many food sovereignty and humanitarian organisations, members of the public and NGOs are aware of this. FSA, FDA, EFSA.... revolving doors ......  all have come under harsh criticism despite some good work in some areas.&#xa0;I disagree that there should be legislation with regard to a “duty to promote economic growth”.  I would not acknowledge such legislation neither would many others.The various view points of the individuals and organisations listed below should be taken into account.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Leave no stone unturned]]]There are many other organisations and individuals that I have not listed which would be able to provide feedback and alternative view points to those proposed. Lord Heseltine and Milton Friedman are not of course the only people to have ever held an opinion, leave no stone unturned!&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for reading this submission.&#xa0;&#xa0;15 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1 http://eradicatingecocide.com/supporters/endorsements/2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Campesina&#xa0;4 http://www.grain.org/entries?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=Carlyle+group  http://www.grain.org/article/entries/128-the-soils-of-warIn this Briefing, we look at how the US’s agricultural reconstruction work in Afghanistan and Iraq not only gives easy entry to US agribusiness and pushes neoliberal policies, something that has always been a primary function of US development assistance, but is also an intrinsic part of the US military campaign in these countries and the surrounding regions. Seen together with the growing clout that the US and its corporate allies exercise over donor agencies and global bodies – such as the World Bank, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centres, which influence the food and farm policies adopted by the recipient countries – this is an alarming development. These are not unique cases born from unusual circumstances, but constitute a likely template for US activities overseas, as it continues to expand its “war on terror” and pursue US corporate interests.&#xa0;5 http://www.tni.org/archives/acts_sustainableLiberalisation of the energy sector is on the increase on a global scale.

[[[The need for real transparency]]]While more and more MEPs and citizens groups demand that the looming EU-US negotiations be conducted in an open way, our disillusioning attempts to gain some basic information about who’s behind the launch of these negotiations show that the Commission doesn’t care about openness. It seems determined to bar the public from any kind of meaningful information about the world’s biggest trade deal ever to be negotiated. If MEPs are serious about their calls for more transparency and their duty to hold the Commission accountable, they are up against a serious smokescreen.&#xa0;7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Towns

AGRA Watch thought it was important to follow-up on these claims, thus Phil Bereano wrote to Steiner to request more specifics about the Foundation’s funding of projects dedicated to agroecology. In Steiner’s reply, he outlined the Foundation’s various goals for reducing poverty, namely “sustainable productivity growth.” He also supplied us with a specific list of the Foundation’s agroecology projects. Our research team looked more deeply into these projects, and concluded that they do not live up to our definition of agroecology.&#xa0;http://www.seattleglobaljustice.org/about/Thank you for your interest in Community Alliance for Global Justice!

Through this approach, we can build on the millennia of open-sourced "research &amp; development" that farmers have already completed, recreating a self-regenerative food system that will not only feed us all abundantly and sustainably, but will bring us within reach of solving the apex problems of our times. &#xa0;13 http://www.gmfreeze.org/site_media/uploads/publications/FCZ_ACRE_Consultation.pdfResponse by GM Freeze to ACRE Consultation on Managing the Footprint of Agriculture: Towards Comparative Assessment of Risks and Benefits for Novel Agricultural Systems &#xa0;13 http://www.defra.gov.uk/acre/about/members-interests/&#xa0;14 http://www.sgr.org.uk/projects/military-influence-scitechSGR has long been concerned about the military influence on science and technology. In 2003, we began project work in this area, carrying out research, education and advocacy activities. Our main outputs are listed below.In short, SGR believes that the military exerts far too much influence over science, engineering and technology in the UK and elsewhere - and this leads to an over-emphasis on weapons and technology based approaches to tackling conflict. We believe there needs to be a major shift in both resources and emphasis away from military science and technology towards areas such as cleaner technology, research on non-violent conflict resolution, and science and technology for poverty alleviation. The concept of 'Security' also needs to be considered much more broadly to include many of the pressing issues that face the world today - issues which can be addressed by drawing upon the expertise that resides in science and technology.SGR gives lectures on this issue - see our Forthcoming Events page for the latest information. A major new report will be published in the next few months.&#xa0;15 http://www.econexus.info/node/185    http://www.econexus.info/sites/econexus/files/A_Foreseeable_Disaster-HOTL-Agrofuels-     July2013.pdfhttp://www.etcgroup.org/issues/bioeconomyhttp://www.etcgroup.org/content/new-biomasstershttp://www.etcgroup.org/content/who-will-control-green-economy-0http://www.etcgroup.org/content/etc-group-advocates-global-ban-terminator-and-other-gene-switching-technologies-impact-foodhttp://www.etcgroup.org/content/nanotech-unpredictable-and-un-regulated15The ETC Group releases a new Communiqué today (08.07.2004)&#xa0;that provides an update on policy discussions related to nanotech health and safety issues and the glaring lack of regulatory oversight. According to the ETC Group, governments on both sides of the Atlantic are reluctantly and belatedly conceding that current safety and health regulations may not be adequate to address the special exigencies of nano-scale materials. In sharp contrast to the political climate one year ago, the potential health and environmental risks of some nano-scale technologies are being openly discussed in Europe and North America. Since mid-2002, ETC Group has called for a moratorium on the use of synthetic nanoparticles in the lab and in any new commercial products until governments adopt "best practices" for research."Ironically, governments are talking about the need to be proactive, failing to admit that they're at least one decade late: nanotech products are already commercially available and laboratory workers and consumers are already being exposed to nanoparticles that could pose serious risks to people and the environment," says Pat Mooney, Executive Director of ETC Group in Ottawa. The US government estimates that one million new workers will be employed in nanotech-related industries within the next decade. And the global nanotech market is expected to tip $1 trillion in just seven years, according to Mike Roco of the US National Science Foundation.&#xa0;"Only a handful of toxicological studies exist on engineered nanoparticles, but not-so-tiny red flags are popping up everywhere," points out Jim Thomas, ETC Group Programme Officer based in Oxford, England.

When will they address seriously the wider concerns related to social and economic impacts of technologies converging at the nano-scale?" asks Kathy Jo Wetter, ETC Group researcher in Carrboro, North Carolina, USA.&#xa0;16http://www.waronwant.org/past-campaigns/mining-conflict-and-abuseWar on Want believes that the UK government must acknowledge the harm being done to local communities in developing countries as a result of British mining companies' activities.http://www.waronwant.org/past-campaigns/banking-funding-the-arms-tradeHigh street banks are using our money to fund companies that sell arms used against civilians in wars across the world, including the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are financing an industry that sells arms to countries committing human rights abuses such as Israel, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. Money from our savings and current accounts is being used to fund companies that produce pernicious weapons like depleted uranium and cluster bombs.As a result of the financial crisis there are now unprecedented calls for regulation of the banking sector. War on Want is calling on the government to ensure that all banks are made to publish the full details of their loans, holdings and other banking services to the arms trade. The government must also introduce regulation which prevents high street banks from supporting the arms trade.&#xa0;17http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/Blogs/other_blogs/1527511/texacos_pollution_of_ecuadors_indigenous_lands_brought_to_light_in_new_dvd.htmlhttp://www.permanentculturenow.com/nicola-peel-talk-amazon-how-one-person-can-make-a-difference/&#xa0;18http://www.i-sis.org.uk/closedLoopCircularEconomy.phpAlso plenty of information on this website regarding GMO safety. Essential reading.19http://rajpatel.org/2009/10/27/the-value-of-nothing/This short, timely and inspiring book reveals that our current crisis is not simply the result of too much of the wrong kind of economics. While we need to rethink our economic model, Patel argues that the larger failure beneath the food, climate and economic crises is a political one. If economics is about choices, Patel writes, it isn’t often said who gets to make them. The Value of Nothing offers a fresh and accessible way to think about economics and the choices we will all need to make in order to create a sustainable economy and society.&#xa0;

Whatever she thought of doing, she did it. That's what I have read over the years. And knowing the determination with which she destroyed public sector science, I can understand why and how she earned the title Iron Lady. Nevertheless, let me share this story of how Britain's only woman Prime Minister, the unyielding Margaret Thatcher, eclipsed one of the world's best known research centre in plant sciences, which was emerging as a global leader in plant molecular biology and genomics.&#xa0;I am talking of the&#xa0;famed Plant Breeding&#xa0;Institute (PBI) at Cambridge...”&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[On Ronald Regan - random internet bits and pieces]]]“Reagan was, in the Stalinist sense, the greatest Marxist of the twentieth century. Thanks to 

[[[effective propaganda]]], Americans love him just as much as the old party apparacthiks loved Stalin. Time will tell whether Marx was right or wrong. But if “Social Conflict Theory”, the “real” Marxism, turns out to be an accurate model, the future will be ugly for all of us. And, we’ll have Ronnie Reagan to thank for it.”“More than any recent U.S. president, Ronald Reagan has been lavished with honours, including his name attached to Washington’s National Airport. But the conviction of Reagan’s old ally, ex-Guatemalan dictator Rios Montt, for genocide means “Ronnie” must face history’s judgment as an accessory to the crime.”“It was not until 1999, a decade after Ronald Reagan left office, that the shocking scope of the atrocities in Guatemala was comprehensively detailed by a truth commission that drew heavily on U.S. government documents declassified by President Bill Clinton. On Feb. 25, 1999, the Historical Clarification Commission estimated that the 34-year civil war had claimed the lives of some 200,000 people with the most savage bloodletting occurring in the 1980s. The panel estimated that the army was responsible for 93 percent of the killings and leftist guerrillas for three percent. Four percent were listed as unresolved.”http://www.globalresearch.ca/ronald-reagan-accessory-to-genocide-ex-guatemalan-dictator-rios-montt-guilty-of-mayan-genocide/5334855&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
