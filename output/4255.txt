[[[Re: Education Select Committee Inquiry into Academies &amp; Free Schools]]]&#xa0;I am writing this submission as a parent of school aged children and a member of a group of like-minded people. Parents are becoming increasingly concerned over the lack of engagement with, and representation of, parents in their children’s education, particularly relating to the academy and free schools programme. &#xa0;

[[[Executive ]]]

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;There has been a great deal of debate lately over the electorate’s lack of engagement in politics and democracy in this country and this is a typical example of why people feel disenfranchised. As parents, wishing to help our children in their education, we are effectively sidelined for all the significant decisions involved in whether, or how, a school becomes an academy and on having any real influence over the governance and ethos of these establishments.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The effectiveness of ]]]

[[[academisation]]]

[[[ in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes.]]]&#xa0;1.1.              The current academies programme has only been operating for a little over three years now and I believe that it is too early to draw any concrete conclusions over the effectiveness of this policy when it comes to the quality of education for our children and young people, including those considered disadvantaged.&#xa0;1.2              We are told that it is too soon for the academy programme to have had any effect on the 2012 PISA tests, the results and rankings of which have recently been released. Yet, we are also told that the academy programme is having an immediate transformative effect on education, resulting in apparently overnight boosts to examination results in those new academies. Clearly, there is a discrepancy here and test and examination results are only part of the picture in any case. &#xa0;1.3              Where is the evidence of real, substantive improvement in the quality of our children’s education in academies? Or are the improvements on paper only, e.g. better exam results due to successful academy headteachers being more “clued up” on the easier exam syllabi, how to teach to test, how to target “failing” pupils for intervention work shortly before exams (after years of poor progress) or how to exclude “difficult” students? How often are apparent improvements due to other variables, such as manipulating the intake, through changing admission arrangements? &#xa0;1.4              Since “outstanding” schools that convert to academy status are not subject to Ofsted inspections, it is nigh on impossible for them to lose their “outstanding” ratings. But, of course, standards can fall as well as rise. So, data that shows increasing numbers of “outstanding” and “good” academies, does not take into effect the fact that falling standards might not be routinely picked up. Only if test or exam passes dramatically fall or a whistleblower alerts the authorities to problems, would Ofsted step in.&#xa0;1.5              How does hiring non-qualified teachers raise standards? The most successful education systems in the world value their teaching professionals, hold them in high regard and, insisting on high qualifications.&#xa0;1.6               How can it be deemed important for maintained schools to follow the National Curriculum, yet not for academies and free schools, where controversial curricula, can be taught?&#xa0;1.7               Academies are allowed to give priority in their admission arrangements to children eligible for Free School Meals. How many actually do this? Surely, if all schools, including successful maintained schools and faith schools were compelled to give priority to FSM children, we would see a marked improvement in outcomes for these groups as they would have better access to good schools.&#xa0;1.8               Some sponsored academies that change their admission arrangements, actually reduce the numbers of Free School Meal and Special Education Needs pupils, e.g. by bringing in “Fair Banding” whereby children with higher academic achievements from further afield can displace local disadvantaged children.&#xa0;1.9              It is an accepted view in most circles that children’s educational outcomes are affected by the levels of parental involvement and support and that the best schools work in collaboration with parents to help their pupils reach their potential. Unfortunately, converting a school to an academy does nothing to address this issue. In fact, my own experience with one academy is that the level of communication with parents went rapidly downhill within months of its conversion. Gone were the regular newsletters, parent post and the yearly traditional written parent reports. A more expensive uniform was introduced for the academy’s sixth form, without consultation with parents, which is clearly not in the best interests of poorer, disadvantaged families.

[[[The process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              Parents are sidelined from all the important decisions, both over whether schools convert in the first place, and over how they are run once they become academies.&#xa0;2.2               The Academies Act 2010 states “Consultation on conversion:Before a maintained school in England is converted into an Academy, the school’s governing body must consult such persons as they think appropriate. The consultation must be on the question of whether the school should be converted into an Academy. The consultation may take place before or after an Academy order, or an application for an Academy order, has been made in respect of the school.”&#xa0;2.3              There are cases where parents have not been consulted until after the Secretary of State has signed the academy order and chosen the sponsor, e.g. Roke Primary School, Croydon. How can such a consultation be meaningful?&#xa0;2.4              Parents have little or no say over the trustees or the sponsor, which can have a huge effect on a school, with many ramifications. The ethos of a school can be significantly altered on becoming an academy, depending on the trustees and governors. It is even possible for academies to introduce a faith ethos into a formerly non-faith designated school, without consulting parents. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5              Parents generally do not have a free choice over which school or academy their children attend in the first place, but when the governance and ethos of a school dramatically changes part way through a child’s time at that school, as is possible on academisation, it is not easy and certainly not ideal for the parents to have to look for alternative educational provision.&#xa0;2.6               There have been many cases in the news lately where previously good schools have received “requires improvement” or “inadequate” Ofsted judgments and these have often led to “compelled” or “forced” academisation, despite overwhelming opposition from the schools, parents and other local people. Whereas, clearly, poor standards cannot be allowed to go unchallenged, in some of these cases, e.g. Bournville School and Sixth Form in Birmingham, a good school which has decided not to convert to academy status, has been subjected to an Ofsted inspection shortly thereafter, subsequently downgraded and forced into becoming a sponsored academy. It makes many local people question the role of Ofsted in the academy programme and whether it is an impartial body.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[he role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 3.1               Since this inquiry was announced, the Secretary of State has announced Regional School Commissioners and panels of headteachers to oversee academies and free schools in the future. Will this new arrangement lead to conflicts of interest? Will heads on the regional boards press for "failing" academies to join their own academy chains?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 4.1              There should be a local level of oversight and accountability. I do not think the newly announced Regional School Commissioners and panels of headteachers will be sufficient.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;4.2              The Local Authority or another local body (elected by and accountable to the public), should be responsible for coordinating important functions, e.g. school admission arrangements; school places; coordinating partnerships between schools to narrow the gap, raise standards and share best practices; helping parents and families where they have issues with schools and academies, e.g. expensive school uniforms or poor communication; and providing advice and guidance to heads and governors at all schools and academies, when needed. Not all academy heads and governors have the expertise they need, e.g. over legal duties, whereas Local Authorities have decades of experience in such areas.&#xa0;4.3              Obviously, parents can take up issues over policies and practices directly with academies, through the academies’ own complaints procedures. But these can take months to reach conclusion and there is no recourse if the parents are dissatisfied with the outcome, other than raising the issue with the Department for Education. In any case, I expect the DfE will only be interested in significant issues such as financial mismanagement or serious failings in key measures. Many parents may be wary of making official complaints in the first place, fearing negative ramifications for their children. &#xa0;4.4               Academies have to include parent governors on their boards, but it can be as few a two parent governors for academies over 1200+ pupils and often their existence is not promoted and parents not encouraged to contact these people who are supposed to be a voice for all parents within an academy or school.&#xa0;4.5                Therefore, it is imperative that parents have a local, accessible service for raising issues over the running of all schools, including academies and free schools.&#xa0;4.6              To give one example of where I believe local coordination is vital within the education system: Local police have recently informed schools in my area of some potentially serious incidents involving one or more adults targeting young girls. The police asked the schools and academies to relay the information to students and parents. It seems not all academies have done so. The Local Authority should be able to compel all schools to do this.&#xa0;

[[[hat role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements.]]]&#xa0;5.1               I am not clear how academy chains are accountable to anyone other than shareholders, if linked to businesses or private sponsors. They are not subject to Ofsted inspections. &#xa0;5.2               How much oversight and accountability is there in the system? How do we know that contracts for services for academies in a chain are put out to competitive tender? Or are companies owned by or run by friends, family and associates of the directors given favourable treatment in the handing out service contracts, as alleged at the Kings Science Academy. Individuals and companies providing services to academies can do so for profits. But, there seem to be many cases where the academy sponsors and chains are directly linked to businesses that are run for profit, or the lines are blurred.&#xa0;5.3              Amongst my other concerns is that one academy chain can have a near monopoly over schools in a particular location. For instance, I understand that in Pimlico, London, 3 out of 4 primaries are part of the same academy chain (Lord Nash's Future Academies Chain). This cannot be good for parental choice or healthy competition.&#xa0;5.4               Once a school joins an academy chain, the governing body for the chain can apparently reorganize classes, merging schools or moving classes or year groups between different academies in the chain, without any requirement to hold a consultation with parents, e.g. Chumleigh Academy Trust, Devon.&#xa0;5.5              As academy chains grow and reap the cost benefits of the economy of scale, the reverse may occur within Local Authorities, to the point where maintained primary schools may be effectively forced to join academy chains as services provided by the LA become too expensive.&#xa0;5.6              Can academy chains become too big to fail, e.g. E-Act?&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply; and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 6.1               Is it really in the best interest of a primary school to be part of an academy chain led by a secondary academy? Will the leadership at the secondary be best placed to advise on primary matters? Will there be conflicts of interest when league tables start giving more weight to progress measures rather than just raw test or exam results, e.g. could a lead secondary academy be tempted to suppress high achievements in primary academies in its chain, to take the credit itself by showing apparently impressive progress with its own intake? Is the power skewed in academy chains towards the secondary academy(ies) in the chain?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 6.2               However, a single primary school may be too small to go it alone as a converter academy, with all the demands of autonomy, but without the benefits of Local Authority support. It would have little "buying power" for services and would not be able to do all the functions itself. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[hat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools?]]]&#xa0;7.1              Partnerships, federations or better support from the local authority are measures that have worked in the past. &#xa0;7.2               There was much talk of successful academies sponsoring failing schools, but so many of these academies do not seem interested in helping other schools with large numbers of pupils eligible for Free School Meals or with Special Educational Needs or schools located in poorer areas.&#xa0;7.3              One local secondary academy trust has recently taken over a “failing” primary school. It has turned it around from an undersubscribed junior school, with nearly one third of its students qualifying for Free School Meals, into an oversubscribed primary academy with its latest intake of 30 pupils including just ONE pupil eligible for FSM.  The academy trust could have given preference to FSM children in its local secondary academy’s and its sponsored primary academy’s admission arrangements. It did not. Instead it chose to give feeder status for admissions to the “outstanding” secondary academy to that primary academy. Almost overnight the sponsored primary academy “improved” by becoming oversubscribed in its admissions. Pupils there are now guaranteed a place at the successful secondary academy. Has there been an improvement in teaching or educational outcomes at the primary academy? It is too early to know. But certainly, it does not appear that many FSM children will benefit if there has been.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
