Poll results available at \nhttp://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/jwnzb06i31/YG-Archive-131112-TimesPCCs.pdf\n p.82: Independent Police Commission (2013) \nPolicing for a Better Britain: Report of the Independent Police Commission\n – available at \nhttp://independentpolicecommission.org.uk/uploads/37d80308-be23-9684-054d-e4958bb9d518.pdf\n House of Commons Home Affairs Committee (2013) \nPolice and Crime Commissioners: Power to remove Chief Constables,\n Sixth Report of Session 2013-14, London: The Stationery Office Limited.\nhttp://www.police-foundation.org.uk/news/93/22/Tom-Winsor-gives-the-Foundation-s-John-Harris-Lecture/d,News-main\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24148129\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2516121/Crackdown-police-chiefs-luxury-cars-tax-break.html\n and see for example \nhttp://www.northyorkshire-pcc.gov.uk/taking-action/making-decisions/decisions-made/0812013-review-of-chief-police-officer-remuneration-terms-and-conditions/\nhttp://www.thamesvalley-pcc.gov.uk/Document-Library/Letter-to-council-leaders-11-11-13.pdf\n At present, at least one PCP (in West Yorkshire) receives additional funding from local sources while others rely solely on the funding provided by the Home Office.\n See, for example, \nhttp://www.westmidlands-pcc.gov.uk/consultation/budget-and-precept-2014-15\n and \nhttp://www.sussex-pcc.gov.uk/precept-consultation/\n Poll results available at \nhttp://thecentreground.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Centreground-Results-131108-Police-RESULTS.pdf\n Their annual report on police funding stated that: \n“HMIC is deeply disappointed with progress on collaboration … the pace of change on collaboration is too slow”\n (\nHMIC (2013) \nPolicing in Austerity: Rising to the Challenge,\n London: HMIC\n)\n.\nGilmore, M. (2013) ‘Police and Crime Commissioners One Year On’ in \nThe RUSI Journal,\n 158: 5, p.48-55.\n For example, five forces in the South West of England have agreed to pursue a new regional forensic services collaboration (\nhttp://www.avonandsomerset-pcc.gov.uk/News-and-Events/News-Archive/2013/November/South-West-Forces-agree-Regional-Forensic-Collaboration.aspx\n), while collaboration between Sussex and Surrey police forces was extended from 1\nst\n October 2013.\n This was recently recognised in a collaboration agreement between Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire – for details see \nhttp://www.bedfordshire.pcc.police.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/105-Collaboration-expansion-Dec-13.pdf\nGilmore, M.

(2013) ‘Opening the castle gates: how PCCs can deliver the public’s priorities’ in Chambers, M.
