defaultWritten evidence submitted by Peter Chesterdefault (VEP 0012)defaultSummarydefault1.
default              
defaultTo summarise the points I wish to make is to simply say that in socially excluding 'all' prisoners from the democratic process of Government is to exclude them from respect for the 'rule of law', which may result in an increasing radicalisation of prisoners seeking other ways and means to express their grievances, at great costs to society and the government.

default              
defaultI am a prisoner who has now served 36 years so have great knowledge of the changes affecting prisons and prisoners, their marginalisation by Government and the Media, and over the past 15 years the growing radicalisation of prisoners of all ethnicities and backgrounds. Myself I have sought change through law and the 
defaultdemocratical
default process raising issues with M.P.'s as Mr Tony Benn, David 
defaultHinchcliffe
default, and Mr Greg Knight, also Lord 
defaultHylton
default and other Peers, seeking to advocate such avenues to other prisoners as an alternative to becoming 
defaultracicalised
default, as I formerly was in attacking prison staff and smashing cells up. My Christian faith and now being able to seek redress of grievances through the courts and Parliament, where the prison complaints process is neither fair nor 
defaultindependant
default, and this includes the IMB and Prison Ombudsman, has helped me to help others use the socially accepted methods to resolve issues and seek change.

defaultThe Committee are aware of 
defaultther
default factual information of the judgements of the ECHR on the blanket ban being unlawful and need to consider option c in light of this.
default4.
default              
defaultThe recommendations I 
defaultbeleive
default the Committee need to seriously consider making in their report is that the limiting of prisoner voting or continuation of the present ban will see the radicalisation of more prisoners through their exclusion from the political process.
default SubmissiondefaultSet out below are my opinions as a serving post—tariff life sentence prisoner on the draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill:—
defaultIn respect of the option of (a) of disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more from voting, this besides being discriminatory, will do nothing to enhance the respect of prisoners for the 'rule of law', and the vast majority of prisoners who are being radicalised something the Government have voiced great concern about are serving more than 4 years.
defaultIn respect of the option of (b) of disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than 6 months the above also applies, of this being discriminatory, and doing nothing to enhance the respect for the 'rule of law', with most prisoners being radicalised serving longer than 6 months, though it cannot be established that prisoners serving such short sentences are not also open to radicalisation.
defaultIn respect of option (c) of continuing to disqualify all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting, being a restatement of the existing ban (which blanket ban) the ECHR have both given and ratified a judgement of being unlawful, this enhances prisoners disrespect for the 
default'rule of law' in a society they are excluded for the political process, and having no other way to express their views, etc, many more will become radicalised.
defaultAdditional Questions default1.
default              
defaultJustification for denying prisoners the right to vote is exactly as the question says 'historical', where society has moved on in many areas of change, as with abortion, homosexuality, same sex partnerships (soon to be marriage), and marital rape, all of which were formerly criminal offences, or allowed by the Government or not allowed and the time has come to now allow prisoners the right to vote.
default2.
default              
defaultThe right to vote is considered to be a human right because it prevents discrimination and does 
defaultno
default exclude any group or body of person from society and the democratic process, protecting the most vulnerable even giving them a voice. As Nelson Mandela stated "It is said that no—one 
defaulttruely
default knows a nation until one has been inside the jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones." Again in the words of Winston Churchill "The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country."
default3.
default              
defaultThe punishment of prisoners is their 
defaultincarcaration
default for whatever period of time their lawful sentence proscribes, not the way they are to be treated while undergoing this confinement, if they are to eventually return to society rehabilitated, which oppression, suppression and repression of exclusion from the political process does 
defaultnoting
default to enhance rehabilitation and respect for the 'rule of law'.
default4.
default              
defaultThe financial implications for maintaining the current ban on prisoner voting are astronomical, in a time of ever increasing austerity measures across society, even more so should the 
defaultthe
default present case in respect of a breach of EU Law as opposed to a breach of ECHR Law be successful, EU Law being binding both on our domestic courts and Parliament, and should the UK seek to leave the EU it will lead to bankruptcy of the UK.
default6.
default              
defaultAs above the option of (a) in keeping the law as it is excluding all prisoners from voting, it will lead to compensation claims from most prisoners, at a time of austerity measures and rising UK debt, as well as sending a message to other countries who are closely watching the outcome of the Government's compliance, that the UK has no respect for the 'rule of international law', while calling other countries to abide by this.
defaultIn respect of (b) and (c) it will send the message that it is alright to discriminate against some prisoners, and thus why not against other members of minorities, 
defaulterroding
default all human rights laws which are deemed objectionable to any particular Government, as happened in Nazi Germany where all the opposition was murdered or imprisoned by the Government.
default9.
default              
defaultIt is notable that countries like Russia and China who the UK often criticise or seek to ostracise for human rights violations give the right to vote to prisoners, as do South Africa a country formerly of apartheid and discrimination, Article 14 of which the UK Government
defaulthelped draw up and ratified the European Convention of Human Rights states that there is to be no discrimination of any people, minority, or class, on any grounds which includes that of prisoners and their right to vote, yet the UK unlike communist or former communist countries still deny such basic a right to its citizens.
defaultAs a Christian I 
defaultbeleive
default in the 'rule of law' and of Government being both accountable and responsible to the courts, the people and to God, and when the law makers become the law breakers, then I 
defaultbeleive
default that God will as His Word says "work righteousness for the oppressed", as He has lead me to do in seeking the right for 'all prisoners' to vote in the Supreme Court and European Court of Justice of the Union.
