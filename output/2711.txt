[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;2.1              I am the Cabinet Member for Environment at Enfield Council and my portfolio includes local traffic and transport matters. The Council is the traffic and highway authority for most roads in the borough, including all of those with level crossings. I am also a ward Councillor for Southbury Ward, which has been significantly impacted by the recent closure of the level crossing in Lincoln Road.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Level Crossings in ]]]

[[[Enfield]]]&#xa0;3.1              There are currently three level crossings in Enfield:&#xa0;&#xa0;3.2              The crossings in both Ordnance Road and Green Street are automated crossings, whereas the crossing in Lincoln Road is manually operated (see photo).&#xa0;3.3              Data provided by Network Rail for the period between 2005 and October 2012 indicates the following number of incidents:&#xa0;

[[[Lincoln Road]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]038&#xa0;&#xa0;3.4              A ‘misuse’ is when the crossing is used incorrectly, but does not come close to causing an incident (e.g. a pedestrian jumping over the barrier and crossing when no train is near). A ‘near miss’ is when an incident is almost caused (e.g. pedestrian jumping over the barrier almost gets hit by a train).&#xa0;3.5              It should be noted that the Lincoln Road level crossing has a relatively good safety record, with a low level of misuse compared to the two automated crossings in the borough.&#xa0;3.6              The Council understands the inherent risk associated with level crossings and there have indeed been several serious incidents in Enfield, including recent fatalities. In addition to the fatalities at Ordnance Road and Green Street highlighted in the table above, two 16 year old boys were killed on the Pegamoid footpath crossing in March 2006. This crossing was closed shortly afterwards following consultation with the Council.              &#xa0;3.7              The Council therefore supports Network Rail’s efforts to improve the safety of the railway and is committed to work in partnership to help achieve this objective. However, railways can lead to significant severance and level crossings play a vital role in maintaining local connectivity in some parts of the borough. Whilst safety is critical, the impact of level crossing closures needs to be properly understood by all parties before decisions are made. Indeed, the importance of early discussion with the local traffic authority is reflected in the legislation relating to changes to level crossings and the guidance issued by the Office of Rail Regulation. Network Rail’s own policy on managing level crossing safety also talks in terms of ‘partnership working and taking an holistic approach to reducing level crossing risk’.&#xa0;3.8              However, a recent example in Enfield provides evidence of how not to handle a level crossing closure, where a ‘safety’ concern at a crossing in Lincoln Road was used to justify closure without any engagement with either the local authority or the local community.

[[[History of ]]]

[[[Lincoln Road]]]

[[[ Level Crossing]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;4.1              When the construction of railways was authorised, mainly in the 19th century, the individual enabling Act of Parliament specified how the railway was to cross other ways (for example roads and footpaths), either by bridge or on the level. Where the crossing was on the level, the arrangements for protecting the users, both railway and highway, were specified. &#xa0;4.2              The railway to Enfield Town was constructed under powers contained in The Enfield and Edmonton Junction Railway Act 1846. The site of the level crossing in what is now Lincoln Road was referenced as an Occupation Road. However, there is no power in the Authorising Act for the railway to cross the road at grade, which was a requirement for all railways authorised after s. 46 of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 came into force. &#xa0;4.3              Network Rail records indicate that the crossing has been staffed since at least the late 1880s. Closure to vehicles at night is documented back to at least 1939, but it is presumed that the hours of manning were the result of a contractual agreement dating from the time when the land served by the level crossing was agricultural. Network Rail argue that there are now no successors in title who may be entitled to use the crossing as of right, the area having been built up many years ago.  Network Rail also highlight that the then Enfield Urban District Council was advised of the crossing’s occupational status in June 1947. &#xa0;4.4              Network Rail have confirmed that signs describing the opening times of the crossing were recorded as present in 1956. The hours were proposed to be reduced to 0800–1800 Monday to Saturday in February 1994, although manning appears to have reverted to 0600 to 1800 at some time after that. Network Rail also argue that the regular closure of the crossing to vehicles at night and on Sundays is evidence that a right of way for vehicles cannot have been established.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Closure of the Crossing]]]&#xa0;5.1              A brief chronology of the closure of the Lincoln Road level crossing is summarised below:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.2              As mentioned above, the number of incidents recorded at the Lincoln Road level crossing appears relatively low when compared with the other crossings in the borough.&#xa0;5.3              The only information provided to the Council by Network Rail to indicate their safety concerns is reproduced below:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.4              Network Rail explained more about their thinking in their letter to Nick be Bois dated 4th June 2013 in which they state:&#xa0;‘It is felt that the narrow and humped nature of the crossing would push vehicles onto the pedestrian walkway, putting foot users at risk of injury. It was proposed, therefore, that some mitigation work be implemented before re-opening to vehicles. &#xa0;However, as the level crossing is due for closure, the expense of any mitigation work would be unjustifiable, and so the decision has now been taken to keep the crossing closed permanently’.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;6.1              Whether or not the level crossing in Lincoln Road is a public or private right of way is irrelevant to most people. The fact remains that many local people used the crossing on a regular basis and its closure has had a significant impact. &#xa0;6.2              Network Rail failed to consult or engage with the Council in its capacity as the local traffic authority about the closure of the crossing this has prevented the Council from effectively carrying out its duties in properly managing traffic in the area. Network Rail also failed to undertake any consultation with the local community priority to the closure. Regardless of the status of the crossing, this is simply unacceptable. &#xa0;6.3              The recent report from the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission into Level Crossings is a timely and detailed review. I understand that the recommendations in the Commissions’ report are aimed at:&#xa0;&#xa0;6.4              The Council generally supports the Law Commission’s recommendations and welcomes the clarification of the legal basis for the closure of crossings. However, following our recent experience with the Lincoln Road level crossing, I would recommend that
