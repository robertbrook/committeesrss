"Written evidence from the British Association and College of Occupational Therapists (LTC 46)&#xa0;Introduction and Summary&#xa0;The College of Occupational Therapists\n, the professional body representing over 29,000 occupational therapists and OT staff, \nis pleased to \nrespond\n to the Health Select Committee Inquiry into \nthe Management of L\nong \nTerm C\nonditions.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe College of Occupational \nT\nherapists believe\ns\n that OTs c\nan\n pla\ny a greater role in supporting \npeople to be treated outside of hospital. \nOTs are already he\navily involved in \nenabling community care and COT b\nelieve\ns\n that investment in OTs is cost effective, saving the NHS money in both the short and \nlong\n term. \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe government should \nutilise \noccupational therapists’ skills\n, which are already available, and further develop their roles, in order for more people to be treated outside hospital.\n \nThey should also \ntake greater account of \noccupational therapists’ \nability to use both a medical and a social model of health and disability when working with clients. \nFinally, the government should plan for the long term, so that \nthe impact of interventions can be evaluated comprehensively.\n \n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe pattern of service provision for people with long term conditions\n appears to be \npiecemeal, with some examples of good practice and other reports o\nf lack of investment and coordination of services.\n \nOne of our members reports, for example, that specialist services provided by acute services are not followed up in the community,\n even when such \nintervention would only need to be brief.\n \nCOT would like to see a consistent approach to service design and delivery, taking into account the examples of good practice which are available.\n \nFor example:-\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOccupational therapists\n are involved in \nEarly Supported Discharge (ESD) services f\nor people who have had a stroke. \n‘A National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellenc\ne assessment of \nits (Camden Reach Early Discharge Service\n) approach showed that savings of £83,000 per 100,000 population can be achieved through reduction of an average of 10 stroke bed days and by reducing ongoing dependence on social care packages by an average of 19 hours per week.’\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOccupational therapists working for social services also enable patients to return to, or remain in\n,\n the community \nby providing\n home adaptations, making moving and handling recommendations and \ndelivering\n \nreablement\n services\n.\n \nS\nuch activities also result in cost-savings.\n For example\n, o\nne exa\nmple of a \nreablement\n service including\n occupational therapy \nshowed\n that outcomes \nimproved for citizens over a four week period, increased the skills of rehab support workers and saved an estimated £780 per citiz\nen over the \nreablement\n period\n. \n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nccupational therapists \nare employed \nin A&amp;E departments to prevent unnecessary admissions\n by\n conduct\ning rapid assessments, arranging \ndischarge home with the necessary care arrangements and equipment in place, or \ntransferring patients to more appropriate services by using\n links with intermediate care and social services. This result\ns\n in significant cost savings\n. \n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOT would like to see greater AHP involvement in commissioning decisions, alongside GPs, nurses and doctors based in secondary care.\n \nUseful sources of assistance in the commissioning of community based care are the Allied Health Professions (AHP) AHP Toolkits\n, developed by the AHP Leads working with NHS London.\n \n‘\nThey define exactly how each AHP, including occupational therapists, contribute to each step of the pathway, and base this on clear evidence.’ (COT 2013 p7).\n. \nThe toolkits have been produced for six major care pathways, including stroke, \nmusculo\n-skeletal conditions, cancer and diabetes. \n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOccupational therapists tend to take a functional approach when working with individuals, taking into account how they may be affected physically, cognitively and psychologically by their condition or conditions.\n \nThis helps the person to be seen ‘as a whole’; ‘Techniques used may be rehabilitative (enabling a person to regain reduced abilities) educational (for example, managing fatigue that may be associated with the condition) or adaptive (for\n \nexample, finding new, easier ways of carrying out tasks, often using equipment or assistive technology).’\n.\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany services are commissioned based on outcomes which relate to single conditions, and this negatively affects the ability of NHS and social care providers to treat people who have several long term conditions.\n \nCommissioning problems could be addressed by using functional as well as condition specific outcome measures.\n \nThe NHS Outcomes Framework does include ‘functional ability’ as one of the overarching indicators for long term conditions, but this is then measured by usi\nng employment as an indicator. Al\nthough employment is important, f\nunctional ability incorporates many factors such as mobility, se\nlf care, domestic activities\n. COT would like to see a greater variety of functional and occupational performance measures included within the framework. \n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne way in which o\nccupational therapists work with people who may have several long term conditions is through their approach to vocational rehabilitation.\n \nIn relation to this, The AHP Advisory Fitness for Work Report has been launched recently.\n \nThis tool has b\neen developed to enable AHPs\n to advise on the functional impact of a patient’s condition on his/\nher ability to work and to recommend workplace adjustments. \nThe focus on functional ability helps to tailor intervention to the person’s needs, rather than towards specific condition(s)\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOccupational therapists are well placed to contribute to obesity prevention and management.\n \nFor example in primary care, they have a role in prevention of obesity in ‘high risk’ groups, such as people with disabilities.\n \nIn tertiary care the occupational therapy role within bariatric teams includes addressing problems with daily activities, improving mobility within home and community, increasing physical stamina, teaching relaxation and communication skills and use of techniques such as motivational interviewing to change activity patterns and eating habits\n. Occupational therapists also have a major role in the prescription of bariatric equipment as necessary, making the judgement between ensuring safety and optimising activity levels. \n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOT would like to see\n occupational therapists role in health pr\nomotion and prevention work, such as obesity management \nrecognised, for\n example, by including it in service \nand person specifications\n. \n&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOccupational therapists have a significant contribution to make to\n the \nprovision of integrated care, working across health, social care, housing, employment, cha\nrity and independent sectors\n.\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne example of effective integrated care is the \nNeuro\n Case Management Service in Sheffield.\n \nThe service integrates care across health, social and voluntary sector, whilst providing personalised care.\n \nThe team consists of three occupational therapists and one nurse, working as case managers, with the four health professionals being responsible for a case load of over 800 people.\n \nThe service ha\ns been commissioned to provide:\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe implications of an ageing population include that more people will be living with several long term conditions including dementia\n, \nmusculo\n-skeletal conditions and general frailty.\n \nMore people will also be living with mental health issues.\n \n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany recommendations have already been made on how to improve capacity and quality of care\n \nfor people with dementia\n.\n \nThe role which occupational therapists can pl\nay includes:\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the population ages, it is important that older people’s mental well-being is supported and maintained.\n \nOTs\n can improve mental well-being by promoting physical activity when working with older people, as evidenced by N\nICE Public Health Guidance\n 16\n.\n \nOTs also\n have a key \nrole in \nreablement\n, admissi\non avoidance \nand falls prevention\n. \n7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the longer term, it will be \nimportant to improve health equality\n, both as an end in itself and to reduce the overall increases in demands on services brought about by an ageing population.\n \nThis will require the social determi\nnants of health to be addressed by\n \no\nccupational therapists\n and\n other health professionals\n.\n \n7.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOT would like the government to recognise and promote the important role which occupational therapists can and do play in addressing the mental and physical health needs of older people, as well as their role in addressing the social determinants of health.\n \nThe latter aspect of their role will help to manage future demands on services for older people.\n \n&#xa0;8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nccupational therapists have always recognised\n the fundamental link between physical and mental health\n, and work to address both aspects, within the constraints of the services in which they work.\n \nCOT\n would like to see this role recognised and suppo\nrted in commissioning decisions\n. \nExamples of conditions for which occupational therapists address the psychological and cognitive aspects of long term physical conditions include rheumatologic conditions\n, limb amputation\n stroke\nacquired brain injury\nand progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis\n and Parkinson’s disease\n.\n8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Mental Health\n Network publication, \nInvesting \nin emotional and psychological wellbeing for patients with long term conditions\n provides many examples of the importance of addressing \nthe mental health needs of people with long term physical health conditions\n.\n \nMany of\n the services mentioned\n are characterised by the ability to treat both the physical and psychological aspects of the condition and a multi-disciplinary approach to intervention, with teams including allied health professions such as occupational therapists, as well as physicians and clinical nurse specialists.\n8.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn example of a service which treats mental health issues arising from living with long term condition(s) is the Norfolk and Suffolk Wellbeing Service.\n \nPsychological Therapists and Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners use a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) based approach to treat anxiety and depression.\n \nIntervention includes delivering an 8 week workshop specifically for those with anxiety and/or depression who are living with any diagnosed long term physical health condition\n.\n \n&#xa0;9.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe College would like to see ser\nvices organised around a broad spectrum of conditions,\n over longer time frames\n, and using holistic approaches\n,\n in order for personalised care to be improved.\n These principles are illustrated in the example below:-\n9.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOccupational therapists enabled K, a woman with learning disabilities and morbid obesity, to regain her independence.\n \nK was a 45 year old woman, living with her husband.\n \nShe had a number of health and functional problems which had gone undetected, including morbid obesity (her weight was 33 stone), diabetes, respiratory failure and poor mobility.\n \nShe remained in bed for 24 hours per day. OTs helped K by improving communication skills, goal setting, improving diet and exercise, and enabling mainstream health and social services to work more effectively with her.\n \nThe outcome was that K lost 12 stone and is now able to manage her diabetes herself\n.\nAdditional comments10.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to provide more effective management for people with long term conditions, it may be useful to consider the definition of ‘health’ rather than ‘long term condition’.\n \nThe Ottawa Charter states that\n,\n ‘\nHealth promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. To reach a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the environment.’\n \nOccupational therapists are well placed to promote health amongst people with long term conditions\n as\n their approach focuses on all three elements of health.\n \nMay 2013|\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n \nSkrypak\n,M. \nBasu-Doyle\n, M., Barron, S., (2012) \nWhy early discharge in stroke care can be vital for recovery.\n \nHealth Service Journal 06/01/2012.\n \nAvailable at:- http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/best-practice/care-pathway-resources/why-early-discharge-in-stroke-care-can-be-vital-for-recovery/5038502.article\n \nAccessed 22/04/2013.\n College of Occupational Therapists (2012) Evidence Fact Sheet 10:- \nReablement\n.
