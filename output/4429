defaultAssociation of Directors odefaultf Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT)default represents local authority county, unitary and metropolitan Directors who manage some of the most pressing issues facing the UK today. 
default 
defaultOperating at the strategic tier of local government, we are respons
defaultible for delivering public services that primarily relate to the physical environment and the economy, but which have a significant impact on all aspects of the nation’s well-being.
defaultAt the local level, ADEPT members, with our wide-ranging responsibilities 
defaultand cross-cutting professional knowledge, have a unique understanding of the opportunities and barriers facing their respective places. 
default 
defaultBecause we start from a place-based approach, we automatically join up policy areas that in Whitehall are spread across
default a number of different Departments.
default&#xa0;
default We therefore see ourselves as having a key role in supporting and helping to deliver sustainable economic growth and quality of life and are keen to work with Government, business and the voluntary sector to make the mo
defaultst of the opportunities available.
defaultAlthough our members are predominately from English authorities, we are closely affiliated with CSS Wales, the Society of Chief Officers of Transport in Scotland (SCOTS) and the Northern Ireland Road Service

defaultThe Planning Officers Societydefault was formed in April 1997 by the amalgamation of the former County Planning Officers Society, District Planning Officers Society and t
defaulthe Metropolitan Planning Officers Society. With the formation of a single Local Government Association it was decided by the constituent societies that a single voice for local authority planning 
defaultpractitioners would be the most effective way of pursuing go
defaultod and effective planning practice within local government. In March 2011 POS became a Registered Charity.
defaultThe Society's aim is to ensure that planning makes a major contribution to achieving sustainable developments, from national to local level, in ways,
default which are fair and equitable and achieve the social economic and environmental aspirations of all sectors of the community.

defaultLocal highway and transport authorities are publicly accountable
default bodies
default and recognised by their communities 
defaultas being responsible for the roads and transport 
defaultsystems within the areas.  They are best placed to understand the problems and make decisions on behalf of their communities.

defaultThe allocation and bidding mechanisms for local transport expenditure have been undergoing change for many years.  Annual bids fo
defaultr funding using Transport Policies and Programmes submissions were replaced from 2001 by five-yearly Local Transport Plans which bid for five year allocations of block funding for Integrated Transport and Maintenance, while retaining a separate bidding rou
defaultnd for major schemes over £5
default 
defaultmillion.  Subsequently
default,
default in December 201

default, the bidding process for block allocations was replaced by an indicative allocation
default based on calculated formulae
default.

defaultWhen the Department for Transport announced their decision to devolve decision-making on local major transport schemes in September 2012 their stated reasons were 
defaultthat it will:
default 
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities generally welcomed 
defaultthe principle of 
defaultdevolving 
defaultdecision-making and accountability to the local level, and finding ways of delivering schemes which minimise the administrative burden and costs on both central and local government
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, many 
defaultfelt that the 
defaultarrangements proposed in the consultation pa
defaultper fell far short of the optimum means of achieving this.  The (then) proposed Local Transport Bodies created further layers of unnecessary bureaucracy, which would complicate decision making and inevitabl
defaulty
default lead to additional costs
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSubsequently, the d
defaultecision to allocate large amount
defaults
default of transport funding via the Single Local Growth Fund 
defaultto
default Local Enterprise Partnerships has created considerable complexity
default in terms of how Local Transport Bo
defaultdies
default work
default.  W
defaulte believe 
defaultthis 
defaulthas 
defaultthe capacity to 
defaultundermine the 
defaultoriginal
default rationale by which decision-making for local major transport schemes was to be 
defaultdevolved
default 
defaultas real power is not being handed to local communities
default.  
defaultIn addition, apart from the already confirmed figures for
default each LTB area (which represents only 
defaulta small
default proportion of the total funding
default demand
default), we understand that the initial funding announcement in July 2014 will only confirm a funding allocation for 2015/16, which does not provide the certainty that authorities need to deliver major schemes whose constru
defaultction is likely to span financial years, or indeed the impetus to expedite preparation of schemes when there is no certainty of future funding.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultcompetitive element of the 
defaultSingle 
defaultL
defaultocal Growth Fund came as something of a surprise to autho
defaultrities
default 
defaultand 
defaultdoes not provide long-term certainty compared to 
defaulta formulaic allocation of funding via Local Transport Bo
defaultdies
default.  G
defaultiven the importance of this funding to the local economy, we believe that the short timescales which have been given for the preparation of Str
defaultategic Economic Plans will not produce an optimal result in ensuring that 
defaultallocated
default fundin
defaultg does align properly with need.
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe creation 
defaultof new
default organisations, Local Transport Bodies, to administer devolved local major transport scheme funding created 
defaultunnecessary
default bureaucracy.  
defaultThe allocation of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships means that since local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of most schemes, three organisations are 
defaultnow involved in what would now seem
default to be an unn
defaultecessary and con
defaultvoluted decision-making process with accountability still 
defaultlying
default with the Local Highway authority as part of their statutory duties.
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that a far more effective model would be to follow the original proposal for devolution of fundi
defaultng via a formulaic process (perhaps amended to encompass wider priorities), but with funding allocate
defaultd directly to local authorities who are the Highway and Transport Authorities. Associated with this should be
default a requirement for local authorities to
default demons
defaulttrate meaningful engagement with 
defaulttheir local business communities
default and LEPs
default, instead of the heavy-handed evaluation process
default that is being recommended by
default the Department for Transport
default.
default 
defaultL
defaultocal authorities are publicly accountable bodies
default with formal scrutiny arr
defaultangements and engagement with local communities and businesses is now second nature.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiving responsibility for spending decisions to the LEP does effec
defaulttively engage stakeholders from
default&#xa0;
defaultthe business community.
default&#xa0;
default However, it risks decision making being based 
defaulton a narrow viewpoint without the full understanding of the evidence base or of competing policy objectives.
default&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultMost
default upper-tier local authorities 
defaultmaintain 
defaultor can call on 
defaulta professional team of highway and transport 
defaultofficers with a wide breadth of experience across the field and a deep knowledge of the transport issues facing the
defaultir localities
default.  
defaultThe capacity of any authority with respect to major transport schemes is heavily linked to the level and certain
defaultty
default of funding
default which is available for delivery of such schemes.  When funding is short, there is inevitably a vicious circle in that local authorities will not maintain capacity at a level beyond that which they can reasonably expect to be justified.  However, the struc
defaulttures are already in place which would allow that capacity to be easily expanded to meet the needs of increased funding, but an element of up-front pump-priming is need
defaulted
default to allow short-term expansion or a long-term 
defaultfunding commitment so that local authori
defaultties can have confidence to expand their capacity.  
default2.2
default              
defaultLocal Transport Authorities have spent decades through the TPP and LTP process analysing
default and understanding local transport issues and through evidence based policy determining the transport measures appropriate to the needs of local people and businesses. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default The most efficient means for LEPs and LTBs to undertake these functions is to engage 
defaultwith existing expertise within their constituent Local Authorities.
default2.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultprofessional
default team supports and advises elected 
defaultCouncillors
default who are able to directly reflect the views and 
defaultpriorities
default of their constituents in their decision making.
default  E
defaultlected member
default structure
defaults included either an elected Mayor or a Cabinet portfolio structure 
defaultwith executive responsibility and established scrutiny mechanisms.  Budget and consultation processes are well established, and engagement with the private sector takes place thr
defaultough the Local Enterprise Partnerships and more directly
default when needed
default.
default2.4
default              
defaultTogether, the professional officers and elected members are already responsible for local major transport schemes from problem identification through to delivery, with the only decis
defaultions which are taken elsewhere being the statutory processes (such as Side Roads Orders and Compulsory Purchase Orders) and the allocation of funding which are 
defaultboth 
defaultundertaken 
defaultby the Department for Transport. However,
default local authorities are 
defaultincreasingly 
defaultexp
defaultected to procure or provide a significant amount of the funding and to bear risk of cost-over runs.
default2.
default5
default              
defaultLocal Enterprise Partnerships will maintain a similar team of 
defaultprofessional officers with knowledge of 
defaultstrategic leadership, ambition and vehicles for 
defaultidentifying clear investment priorities and interventions necessary to stimulate private sector led economic growth
default.  
defaultHowever, very few Local enterprise Partnerships have 
defaultspecialised
default knowledge of the assessment, prioritisation and delivery of local transpo
defaultrt schemes, relying on 
defaulttheir local highway/transport authorities 
defaultfor advice in this area
default.
default2.
default6
default              
defaultWe believe that the optimum delivery body already exists – i
defaultn the shape of local highway and transport authorities
default – 
defaultwho 
defaultalready possess all the skills and democr
defaultatic accountability to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes.
default3.1
default              
defaultLocal authorities have dealt with schemes c
defaultrossing their boundaries for many years without the need to establish 
defaultcomplicated 
defaultarrangements.  The usual arrangement has been to reach agreement that one authority acts as lead for promotion and delivery of the scheme.  This has worked well on many occas
defaultions and there is no need to establish bureaucratic structures to enable such schemes, particularly if funding mechanisms – such as formulaic allocations 
default–
default 
defaultencourage local authorities to work in partnership rather than competition with each other.
default3.2
default              
defaultWe therefore believe that funding should be allocated to local authority level, and where a cross-border 
defaultissue 
defaultexists it should be funded jointly by those authorities affected as, if it is a major issue, it will
default already
default be recognised as such by all those i
defaultnvolved.
default3.3
default              
defaultAn over-arching regional body is likely to be in a position to determine wider benefits but is unlikely to prioritise schemes with primarily local impacts.
default4.1
default              
defaultViewed nationally, the relationship is obviously mixed, reflecting different histories and priorities.  Engagement between local authorities and the business community (including Local Enterprise Partnerships) will be str
defaultonger in some areas than others.  
default4.
default2
default              
defaultW
defaulte believe that 
defaultoverlapping LEPs create 
defaultfrequent 
defaulttensions and unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing priorities and common delivery agendas.
default4.
default3
default              
defaultWe also believe that there are frequent examples of government 
defaultdepartments not supporting common agendas, such as past actions by the Highways Agency, whether due to policy or pursuit of performance indicators with respect to congestion on their network, which have tended to inhibit development.  The over-proscriptive
default regime laid down by the Department for Transport for Local Transport Bodies
default does not encourage true localism and the principles of
default devolution.
default5.1 
default              
defaultThe local authority road network represents 98% of England’s roads by length and carries two-third of all road traffic, and we do not believe that the importance of this network is recognised in
default the amount of funding made available for investment.  While we are aware that there has been significant variation in the funding 
defaultavailable
default over time
default, 
defaultwe have not been able to find clear figures to demonstrate this point, and would suggest that it would b
defaulte useful for the Select Committee to ask the Department for Transport to produce their spending figures on local major transport schemes over the last 30 years, to show both the relative changes and the frequent changes in funding levels.
default5.2 
default              
defaultLocal Major 
defaultTransport Schemes are complex and time-consuming projects.  Choosing the most appropriate route requires extensive 
defaultconsultation and
default environmental analysis.  In addition, statutory orders are required, which mean that for most schemes the preparatory proces
defaults will take a 
defaultperiod
default of years, and cost a seven-figure sum.
default  
defaultAn
defaulty
default funding stream which includes a bidding process therefore 
defaultmeans that local authorities must expend 
defaultconsiderable
default time and cost in preparing schemes with no 
defaultcertainty that they will be funded, 
defaultparticularly where an advanced state of scheme preparation means that a scheme will have a greater chance of success in bidding.
default5.
default3
default              
defaultIn more recent 
defaulttimes
default, the much reduced level of funding available for 
defaultmajor schemes
default,
default 
defaulttogether with the uncertainty of the bidding process 
defaulthas meant that if a scheme is unsuccessful in 
defaultreceiving 
defaultfunding the
defaultn
default delay
defaults
default running into a period of years
default 
defaultw
defaultould occur
default or
default 
defaultthe scheme 
defaultmight not 
defaultbe delivered at all.  This means 
defaultthat any statutory orders 
defaultobtained in expectation of funding are likely to expire and
default, therefore, 
defaultadditional costs
default will be incurred
default in obtaining them again.
default  Substantial abortive costs are incurred in scheme preparation if the bid is unsuccessful. 
default  
default5.
default4
default              
defaultThis has placed much m
defaultore e
defaultmphasis in recent years 
defaultfunding
default larger or
default major transport schemes through other sources
default and Government funding pots
default.  However, 
defaultmany 
defaultfunding streams have often been announced at short-notice and the funding has usually had time limitations meaning that a 
defaultscheme
default has to be at a very advanced stage of preparation to be deliverable within such a time period.  
default5.
default5
default              
defaultThe announcement of a much increased level of funding allocated for local major transport schemes over an extended period of years earlier this year
default was therefore very welcome.  However, 
defaultthe formulaic allocation meant that it was in many cases insufficient to deliver larger schemes.  A
defaults outlined in our response to other questions, the allocation of this funding via a 
defaultcompetitive process with
default LEPs 
defaultand 
defaultwith 
defaultonly 
defaultshort-term
default confirmed funding (beyond the initial allocation to LTB areas) 
defaultcreates considerable complications 
defaultand means that there 
defaultwill not be the 
defaultdegree of funding certainty 
defaultnecessary to ensure effective
default preparatory
default 
defaultinvestment in major schemes
default.
default Consideration should be given to the establishment of a funding stream to allow local highway and transport authorities to undertake the preparatory works for major schemes in order to get them to a state of readiness for when funding is eventually forthc
defaultoming.
default 
default5.6
default              
defaultLTP has been very successful in delivering smaller scale schemes, particularly safety schemes and schemes promoting sustainable transport.
default&#xa0;
default This is a mature process which local authority structures have adapted to.
default&#xa0;
default Recent reduction in LTP fund
defaulting has in many ways been offset by the introduction of LSTF.
default&#xa0;
default LSTF programs have comprised specific packages of LTP schemes designed to meet LSTF criteria.
default&#xa0;
default The delivery timing of LPPF schemes and the requirement to deliver immediate impact on growth has 
defaultlimited the potential to access this funding stream, particularly for smaller and more rural authorities.
default6.1
default              
defaultAs far as 
defaultwe understand the process, Local Transport Bodie
defaults no longer have a defined role in the process given that f
defaultunding is being devolved to 
defaultLocal Enterprise Partnerships. At present,
default it is not evident 
defaultas to how 
defaultLEPs 
defaultwill be
default required to involve LTBs.  Although w
defaulte suspect that most will do
default so, the lack of clarity
default 
defaulthas caused confusion, especially given 
defaultthe extensive work that local authorities an
defaultd LEPs went through to deliver the
default government
default’s proposals 
defaultfor LTBs
default.
default 
default6.2
default              
defaultWhile there was no overlap between Local Transpo
defaultrt Bodies, there
default are examples of
default overlap
defaultping
default LEP
defaults whereby in these areas
default two different LEPs 
defaultcould be bidding for 
defaultthe same transport investment.  Not only does this create significant duplication in the bidding process, but there will be a need to resolve b
defaultetween the two LEPs how allocated funding will be determined in those areas of overlap.  This is likely to further delay the delivery of schemes.
default6.3
default              
defaultThere is also much concern within the profession that the inclusion of a significant element of Integrated
default Transport (IT) Block funding within the Single Local Growth Fund is likely to inhibit the delivery of the small-scale sche
defaultmes which the IT Block is used to deliver.
default 
defaultSuch schemes often demonstrate very
default high value for money
default, which could now be reduced as a 
defaultresult of extra cost
defaults
default associated with the more convoluted bidding process
default and bureaucracy
default for the Local Growth Fund. 
defaultMoreover, the inclusion of top-sliced budgets that would have traditionally been used for Highway and Transport schemes into a fund that is
default un-ringfenced means that the level of uncertainty for local highway authorities is likely to be increased.
default6.4
default              
defaultThe key benefit is certainty of funding which will significantly reduce the amount spent on scheme development: money that can be redirected to scheme delivery.
default&#xa0;
default Providing funding to all LTBs on a formula basis will inevitably reduce the proportion of 
defaultavai
defaultlable
default funding that can be awarded to any single individual LTB and this will impact on the potential to deliver larger schemes. Our concern is that removal of the ring-fence around transport spending will reduce overall transport spending, retarding develo
defaultpment of the transport network.
default6.5
default              
defaultIn addition, as highlighted in our earlier answers to questions 1 and 5, we understand that beyond the allocations made to each LTB area, the only funding which will be confirmed in July 2014 is for 2015/16, which will m
defaultean that authorities will not have the funding certainty required to deliver major schemes which span financial years.
default7.1
default   
defaultVery often the main barrier to private sector investment in essentially publicly owned         infrastructure 
defaultand new and innovative funding mechanism is EU procurement rules cou
defaultpled with the risk appetite 
defaultand confidence 
defaultof all parties, particularly in these austere times. Linked to this is the need to establish revenue streams that provide appropriate payback to the investors in a reasonable period of time. Local authorities can be best placed to take the longer term view
default and provide some form of security which could encourage the private sector to share risk differently and make investments in infrastructure that they would not otherwise make. For example,

default8.1
default              
defaultThe current lines of accountabi
defaultlity for decision making are very clear.  Local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of schemes.  The Department for Transport is responsible for allocating funding in many instances and for processing certain statutory processes (Sid
defaulte Roads Order and Compulsory Orders).
default  Local authorities and the Ministers (through Parliament) are ultimately responsible to the electorate.
default8.2
default              
defaultIn the past the local highway and transport authority would have had complete control over decision making  th
defaultrough due diligence and due process as a publicly accountable body responsible for the delivery and the maintenance of transport infrastructure. The system now being proposed is unnecessarily complicated and broadly as follows:
defaultThere is considerable scope within this process for the priorities of Local Authorities, Local Transport Bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships to be in conflict, and neither LTBs or LEPs are publicly accountable in this same way as local authorities. 
default8.3
default              
defaultWe believe that this makes clear that the process for local decision making is much more complex than is currently the case, and we believe unnecessarily so.
default 
defaultUnder the current system where local decisions are made by elected members the lines of 
defaultaccoun
defaulttability are long-established and clear.
default&#xa0;
default Subsequent to the introduction of the Single Local Growth fund decision making will reside with LEPs.
default&#xa0;
default Lines of accountability have yet to be clarified.
default&#xa0;
default For example, what would be the outcome in the event that a L
defaultEP and local elected members could not
default reach agreement on priorities?
