[normal]Written submission [bold]from[bold] [bold]the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT)[bold] &amp; the Planning Officers Society (LTD0021)[bold]Summary[bold]Introduction[bold]The 
[normal]Association of Directors o[bold]f Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT)[bold] represents local authority county, unitary and metropolitan Directors who manage some of the most pressing issues facing the UK today. 
[normal] 
[normal]Operating at the strategic tier of local government, we are respons
[normal]ible for delivering public services that primarily relate to the physical environment and the economy, but which have a significant impact on all aspects of the nation’s well-being.
[normal]At the local level, ADEPT members, with our wide-ranging responsibilities 
[normal]and cross-cutting professional knowledge, have a unique understanding of the opportunities and barriers facing their respective places. 
[normal] 
[normal]Because we start from a place-based approach, we automatically join up policy areas that in Whitehall are spread across
[normal] a number of different Departments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We therefore see ourselves as having a key role in supporting and helping to deliver sustainable economic growth and quality of life and are keen to work with Government, business and the voluntary sector to make the mo
[normal]st of the opportunities available.
[normal]Although our members are predominately from English authorities, we are closely affiliated with CSS Wales, the Society of Chief Officers of Transport in Scotland (SCOTS) and the Northern Ireland Road Service
[normal]: S
[normal]enior figures from these organisations 
[normal]play
[normal] an active role on the ADEPT management board
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The Planning Officers Society[bold] was formed in April 1997 by the amalgamation of the former County Planning Officers Society, District Planning Officers Society and t
[normal]he Metropolitan Planning Officers Society. With the formation of a single Local Government Association it was decided by the constituent societies that a single voice for local authority planning 
[normal]practitioners would be the most effective way of pursuing go
[normal]od and effective planning practice within local government. In March 2011 POS became a Registered Charity.
[normal]The Society's aim is to ensure that planning makes a major contribution to achieving sustainable developments, from national to local level, in ways,
[normal] which are fair and equitable and achieve the social economic and environmental aspirations of all sectors of the community.

[normal]Local highway and transport authorities are publicly accountable
[normal] bodies
[normal] and recognised by their communities 
[normal]as being responsible for the roads and transport 
[normal]systems within the areas.  They are best placed to understand the problems and make decisions on behalf of their communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The allocation and bidding mechanisms for local transport expenditure have been undergoing change for many years.  Annual bids fo
[normal]r funding using Transport Policies and Programmes submissions were replaced from 2001 by five-yearly Local Transport Plans which bid for five year allocations of block funding for Integrated Transport and Maintenance, while retaining a separate bidding rou
[normal]nd for major schemes over £5
[normal] 
[normal]million.  Subsequently
[normal],
[normal] in December 201
[normal]0
[normal], the bidding process for block allocations was replaced by an indicative allocation
[normal] based on calculated formulae
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The benefits of these changes in relation to block funding
[normal] to 
[normal]local authorities 
[normal]have been:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When the Department for Transport announced their decision to devolve decision-making on local major transport schemes in September 2012 their stated reasons were 
[normal]that it will:
[normal] 
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities generally welcomed 
[normal]the principle of 
[normal]devolving 
[normal]decision-making and accountability to the local level, and finding ways of delivering schemes which minimise the administrative burden and costs on both central and local government
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, many 
[normal]felt that the 
[normal]arrangements proposed in the consultation pa
[normal]per fell far short of the optimum means of achieving this.  The (then) proposed Local Transport Bodies created further layers of unnecessary bureaucracy, which would complicate decision making and inevitabl
[normal]y
[normal] lead to additional costs
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Subsequently, the d
[normal]ecision to allocate large amount
[normal]s
[normal] of transport funding via the Single Local Growth Fund 
[normal]to
[normal] Local Enterprise Partnerships has created considerable complexity
[normal] in terms of how Local Transport Bo
[normal]dies
[normal] work
[normal].  W
[normal]e believe 
[normal]this 
[normal]has 
[normal]the capacity to 
[normal]undermine the 
[normal]original
[normal] rationale by which decision-making for local major transport schemes was to be 
[normal]devolved
[normal] 
[normal]as real power is not being handed to local communities
[normal].  
[normal]In addition, apart from the already confirmed figures for
[normal] each LTB area (which represents only 
[normal]a small
[normal] proportion of the total funding
[normal] demand
[normal]), we understand that the initial funding announcement in July 2014 will only confirm a funding allocation for 2015/16, which does not provide the certainty that authorities need to deliver major schemes whose constru
[normal]ction is likely to span financial years, or indeed the impetus to expedite preparation of schemes when there is no certainty of future funding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]competitive element of the 
[normal]Single 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal Growth Fund came as something of a surprise to autho
[normal]rities
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]does not provide long-term certainty compared to 
[normal]a formulaic allocation of funding via Local Transport Bo
[normal]dies
[normal].  G
[normal]iven the importance of this funding to the local economy, we believe that the short timescales which have been given for the preparation of Str
[normal]ategic Economic Plans will not produce an optimal result in ensuring that 
[normal]allocated
[normal] fundin
[normal]g does align properly with need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The creation 
[normal]of new
[normal] organisations, Local Transport Bodies, to administer devolved local major transport scheme funding created 
[normal]unnecessary
[normal] bureaucracy.  
[normal]The allocation of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships means that since local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of most schemes, three organisations are 
[normal]now involved in what would now seem
[normal] to be an unn
[normal]ecessary and con
[normal]voluted decision-making process with accountability still 
[normal]lying
[normal] with the Local Highway authority as part of their statutory duties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that a far more effective model would be to follow the original proposal for devolution of fundi
[normal]ng via a formulaic process (perhaps amended to encompass wider priorities), but with funding allocate
[normal]d directly to local authorities who are the Highway and Transport Authorities. Associated with this should be
[normal] a requirement for local authorities to
[normal] demons
[normal]trate meaningful engagement with 
[normal]their local business communities
[normal] and LEPs
[normal], instead of the heavy-handed evaluation process
[normal] that is being recommended by
[normal] the Department for Transport
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal authorities are publicly accountable bodies
[normal] with formal scrutiny arr
[normal]angements and engagement with local communities and businesses is now second nature.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Giving responsibility for spending decisions to the LEP does effec
[normal]tively engage stakeholders from
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the business community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, it risks decision making being based 
[normal]on a narrow viewpoint without the full understanding of the evidence base or of competing policy objectives.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Most
[normal] upper-tier local authorities 
[normal]maintain 
[normal]or can call on 
[normal]a professional team of highway and transport 
[normal]officers with a wide breadth of experience across the field and a deep knowledge of the transport issues facing the
[normal]ir localities
[normal].  
[normal]The capacity of any authority with respect to major transport schemes is heavily linked to the level and certain
[normal]ty
[normal] of funding
[normal] which is available for delivery of such schemes.  When funding is short, there is inevitably a vicious circle in that local authorities will not maintain capacity at a level beyond that which they can reasonably expect to be justified.  However, the struc
[normal]tures are already in place which would allow that capacity to be easily expanded to meet the needs of increased funding, but an element of up-front pump-priming is need
[normal]ed
[normal] to allow short-term expansion or a long-term 
[normal]funding commitment so that local authori
[normal]ties can have confidence to expand their capacity.  
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Local Transport Authorities have spent decades through the TPP and LTP process analysing
[normal] and understanding local transport issues and through evidence based policy determining the transport measures appropriate to the needs of local people and businesses. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The most efficient means for LEPs and LTBs to undertake these functions is to engage 
[normal]with existing expertise within their constituent Local Authorities.
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]professional
[normal] team supports and advises elected 
[normal]Councillors
[normal] who are able to directly reflect the views and 
[normal]priorities
[normal] of their constituents in their decision making.
[normal]  E
[normal]lected member
[normal] structure
[normal]s included either an elected Mayor or a Cabinet portfolio structure 
[normal]with executive responsibility and established scrutiny mechanisms.  Budget and consultation processes are well established, and engagement with the private sector takes place thr
[normal]ough the Local Enterprise Partnerships and more directly
[normal] when needed
[normal].
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Together, the professional officers and elected members are already responsible for local major transport schemes from problem identification through to delivery, with the only decis
[normal]ions which are taken elsewhere being the statutory processes (such as Side Roads Orders and Compulsory Purchase Orders) and the allocation of funding which are 
[normal]both 
[normal]undertaken 
[normal]by the Department for Transport. However,
[normal] local authorities are 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]exp
[normal]ected to procure or provide a significant amount of the funding and to bear risk of cost-over runs.
[normal]2.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Local Enterprise Partnerships will maintain a similar team of 
[normal]professional officers with knowledge of 
[normal]strategic leadership, ambition and vehicles for 
[normal]identifying clear investment priorities and interventions necessary to stimulate private sector led economic growth
[normal].  
[normal]However, very few Local enterprise Partnerships have 
[normal]specialised
[normal] knowledge of the assessment, prioritisation and delivery of local transpo
[normal]rt schemes, relying on 
[normal]their local highway/transport authorities 
[normal]for advice in this area
[normal].
[normal]2.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that the optimum delivery body already exists – i
[normal]n the shape of local highway and transport authorities
[normal] – 
[normal]who 
[normal]already possess all the skills and democr
[normal]atic accountability to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes.
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Local authorities have dealt with schemes c
[normal]rossing their boundaries for many years without the need to establish 
[normal]complicated 
[normal]arrangements.  The usual arrangement has been to reach agreement that one authority acts as lead for promotion and delivery of the scheme.  This has worked well on many occas
[normal]ions and there is no need to establish bureaucratic structures to enable such schemes, particularly if funding mechanisms – such as formulaic allocations 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]encourage local authorities to work in partnership rather than competition with each other.
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]We therefore believe that funding should be allocated to local authority level, and where a cross-border 
[normal]issue 
[normal]exists it should be funded jointly by those authorities affected as, if it is a major issue, it will
[normal] already
[normal] be recognised as such by all those i
[normal]nvolved.
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]An over-arching regional body is likely to be in a position to determine wider benefits but is unlikely to prioritise schemes with primarily local impacts.
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Viewed nationally, the relationship is obviously mixed, reflecting different histories and priorities.  Engagement between local authorities and the business community (including Local Enterprise Partnerships) will be str
[normal]onger in some areas than others.  
[normal]4.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]e believe that 
[normal]overlapping LEPs create 
[normal]frequent 
[normal]tensions and unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing priorities and common delivery agendas.
[normal]4.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]We also believe that there are frequent examples of government 
[normal]departments not supporting common agendas, such as past actions by the Highways Agency, whether due to policy or pursuit of performance indicators with respect to congestion on their network, which have tended to inhibit development.  The over-proscriptive
[normal] regime laid down by the Department for Transport for Local Transport Bodies
[normal] does not encourage true localism and the principles of
[normal] devolution.
[normal]5.1 
[normal]              
[normal]The local authority road network represents 98% of England’s roads by length and carries two-third of all road traffic, and we do not believe that the importance of this network is recognised in
[normal] the amount of funding made available for investment.  While we are aware that there has been significant variation in the funding 
[normal]available
[normal] over time
[normal], 
[normal]we have not been able to find clear figures to demonstrate this point, and would suggest that it would b
[normal]e useful for the Select Committee to ask the Department for Transport to produce their spending figures on local major transport schemes over the last 30 years, to show both the relative changes and the frequent changes in funding levels.
[normal]5.2 
[normal]              
[normal]Local Major 
[normal]Transport Schemes are complex and time-consuming projects.  Choosing the most appropriate route requires extensive 
[normal]consultation and
[normal] environmental analysis.  In addition, statutory orders are required, which mean that for most schemes the preparatory proces
[normal]s will take a 
[normal]period
[normal] of years, and cost a seven-figure sum.
[normal]  
[normal]An
[normal]y
[normal] funding stream which includes a bidding process therefore 
[normal]means that local authorities must expend 
[normal]considerable
[normal] time and cost in preparing schemes with no 
[normal]certainty that they will be funded, 
[normal]particularly where an advanced state of scheme preparation means that a scheme will have a greater chance of success in bidding.
[normal]5.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]In more recent 
[normal]times
[normal], the much reduced level of funding available for 
[normal]major schemes
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]together with the uncertainty of the bidding process 
[normal]has meant that if a scheme is unsuccessful in 
[normal]receiving 
[normal]funding the
[normal]n
[normal] delay
[normal]s
[normal] running into a period of years
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]ould occur
[normal] or
[normal] 
[normal]the scheme 
[normal]might not 
[normal]be delivered at all.  This means 
[normal]that any statutory orders 
[normal]obtained in expectation of funding are likely to expire and
[normal], therefore, 
[normal]additional costs
[normal] will be incurred
[normal] in obtaining them again.
[normal]  Substantial abortive costs are incurred in scheme preparation if the bid is unsuccessful. 
[normal]  
[normal]5.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]This has placed much m
[normal]ore e
[normal]mphasis in recent years 
[normal]funding
[normal] larger or
[normal] major transport schemes through other sources
[normal] and Government funding pots
[normal].  However, 
[normal]many 
[normal]funding streams have often been announced at short-notice and the funding has usually had time limitations meaning that a 
[normal]scheme
[normal] has to be at a very advanced stage of preparation to be deliverable within such a time period.  
[normal]5.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]The announcement of a much increased level of funding allocated for local major transport schemes over an extended period of years earlier this year
[normal] was therefore very welcome.  However, 
[normal]the formulaic allocation meant that it was in many cases insufficient to deliver larger schemes.  A
[normal]s outlined in our response to other questions, the allocation of this funding via a 
[normal]competitive process with
[normal] LEPs 
[normal]and 
[normal]with 
[normal]only 
[normal]short-term
[normal] confirmed funding (beyond the initial allocation to LTB areas) 
[normal]creates considerable complications 
[normal]and means that there 
[normal]will not be the 
[normal]degree of funding certainty 
[normal]necessary to ensure effective
[normal] preparatory
[normal] 
[normal]investment in major schemes
[normal].
[normal] Consideration should be given to the establishment of a funding stream to allow local highway and transport authorities to undertake the preparatory works for major schemes in order to get them to a state of readiness for when funding is eventually forthc
[normal]oming.
[normal] 
[normal]5.6
[normal]              
[normal]LTP has been very successful in delivering smaller scale schemes, particularly safety schemes and schemes promoting sustainable transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is a mature process which local authority structures have adapted to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Recent reduction in LTP fund
[normal]ing has in many ways been offset by the introduction of LSTF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] LSTF programs have comprised specific packages of LTP schemes designed to meet LSTF criteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The delivery timing of LPPF schemes and the requirement to deliver immediate impact on growth has 
[normal]limited the potential to access this funding stream, particularly for smaller and more rural authorities.
[normal]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]As far as 
[normal]we understand the process, Local Transport Bodie
[normal]s no longer have a defined role in the process given that f
[normal]unding is being devolved to 
[normal]Local Enterprise Partnerships. At present,
[normal] it is not evident 
[normal]as to how 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]will be
[normal] required to involve LTBs.  Although w
[normal]e suspect that most will do
[normal] so, the lack of clarity
[normal] 
[normal]has caused confusion, especially given 
[normal]the extensive work that local authorities an
[normal]d LEPs went through to deliver the
[normal] government
[normal]’s proposals 
[normal]for LTBs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]While there was no overlap between Local Transpo
[normal]rt Bodies, there
[normal] are examples of
[normal] overlap
[normal]ping
[normal] LEP
[normal]s whereby in these areas
[normal] two different LEPs 
[normal]could be bidding for 
[normal]the same transport investment.  Not only does this create significant duplication in the bidding process, but there will be a need to resolve b
[normal]etween the two LEPs how allocated funding will be determined in those areas of overlap.  This is likely to further delay the delivery of schemes.
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]There is also much concern within the profession that the inclusion of a significant element of Integrated
[normal] Transport (IT) Block funding within the Single Local Growth Fund is likely to inhibit the delivery of the small-scale sche
[normal]mes which the IT Block is used to deliver.
[normal] 
[normal]Such schemes often demonstrate very
[normal] high value for money
[normal], which could now be reduced as a 
[normal]result of extra cost
[normal]s
[normal] associated with the more convoluted bidding process
[normal] and bureaucracy
[normal] for the Local Growth Fund. 
[normal]Moreover, the inclusion of top-sliced budgets that would have traditionally been used for Highway and Transport schemes into a fund that is
[normal] un-ringfenced means that the level of uncertainty for local highway authorities is likely to be increased.
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]The key benefit is certainty of funding which will significantly reduce the amount spent on scheme development: money that can be redirected to scheme delivery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Providing funding to all LTBs on a formula basis will inevitably reduce the proportion of 
[normal]avai
[normal]lable
[normal] funding that can be awarded to any single individual LTB and this will impact on the potential to deliver larger schemes. Our concern is that removal of the ring-fence around transport spending will reduce overall transport spending, retarding develo
[normal]pment of the transport network.
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, as highlighted in our earlier answers to questions 1 and 5, we understand that beyond the allocations made to each LTB area, the only funding which will be confirmed in July 2014 is for 2015/16, which will m
[normal]ean that authorities will not have the funding certainty required to deliver major schemes which span financial years.
[normal]7.1
[normal]   
[normal]Very often the main barrier to private sector investment in essentially publicly owned         infrastructure 
[normal]and new and innovative funding mechanism is EU procurement rules cou
[normal]pled with the risk appetite 
[normal]and confidence 
[normal]of all parties, particularly in these austere times. Linked to this is the need to establish revenue streams that provide appropriate payback to the investors in a reasonable period of time. Local authorities can be best placed to take the longer term view
[normal] and provide some form of security which could encourage the private sector to share risk differently and make investments in infrastructure that they would not otherwise make. For example, 
[normal]N
[normal]orthamptonshire County Council ha
[normal]s 
[normal]introduced 
[normal]a 
[normal]Revolving
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]nfrast
[normal]ructure 
[normal]F
[normal]und
[normal] based on the following general principles: 
[normal]This approach has allowed a £100m programme of projects to commence as a result of upfront funding in the order of only £10m. 
[normal]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]The current lines of accountabi
[normal]lity for decision making are very clear.  Local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of schemes.  The Department for Transport is responsible for allocating funding in many instances and for processing certain statutory processes (Sid
[normal]e Roads Order and Compulsory Orders).
[normal]  Local authorities and the Ministers (through Parliament) are ultimately responsible to the electorate.
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]In the past the local highway and transport authority would have had complete control over decision making  th
[normal]rough due diligence and due process as a publicly accountable body responsible for the delivery and the maintenance of transport infrastructure. The system now being proposed is unnecessarily complicated and broadly as follows:
[normal]There is considerable scope within this process for the priorities of Local Authorities, Local Transport Bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships to be in conflict, and neither LTBs or LEPs are publicly accountable in this same way as local authorities. 
[normal]8.3
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that this makes clear that the process for local decision making is much more complex than is currently the case, and we believe unnecessarily so.
[normal] 
[normal]Under the current system where local decisions are made by elected members the lines of 
[normal]accoun
[normal]tability are long-established and clear.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Subsequent to the introduction of the Single Local Growth fund decision making will reside with LEPs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Lines of accountability have yet to be clarified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For example, what would be the outcome in the event that a L
[normal]EP and local elected members could not
[normal] reach agreement on priorities?
