"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) [OD016]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\nPublicly funded and collected \ndata \ncan have a significant value for economic growth, for health and for society more broadly. The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the \nMedical Research Council (MRC) are committed to \nthe RCUK Common Principles on Data Policy\n, which set out an overarching framework for individual research councils’ data policies\n \n. The RCUK principles \nrecognise that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest and should be made openly available with a\ns\n few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.  Research data generated by research council funding must be discoverable, accessible and usable. In addition to funding research programmes which generate data\n,\n the research councils also support infrastructure, build capacity in key disciplines and deliver a policy framework for data sharing and preservation which ensure the research community and others can maximise the value of data.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Why is open data important?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nAs noted in the introduction above, the research councils are committed to the principle that publicly-funded data should be openly available to the maximum extent possible, this may include open-data publication or some form of managed access to ensure data are safe. \n \n It is also important to ensure\n that \ndata made open\n \nare\n used and re-used by suitably qualified, trained and experienced researchers as effectively as possible\n; this is\n in order to \nmaintain the integrity of the data and to ensure the trust of research participants, both of which are essential to \nmaximise its contribution to informing public policy and services\n. This is particularly important when bringing together data produced by different government departments or public bodies where individual’s identities may inadvertently be discoverable; thus suitable governance arrangements may need to considered to undertake cross-departmental analyses.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhy does the Government need an open data strategy?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow can those engaged in open data, and those engaged in producing Government statistics work together effectively to produce new data?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow can more statistics and administrative data of all kinds become more freely available?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs open data presented well and of adequate quality?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow successful has the Government’s Open Data initiative been in changing behaviour in the Civil Service and wider public sector?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhich datasets are the most important?&#xa0;\nHow effective is the work being undertaken by the Cabinet Office to monitor the progress of Departments in publishing their agreed datasets?September 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/DataPolicy.aspx\n \n \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/UK%20Data%20forum%20strategy_tcm8-28338.pdf\n \n \nhttp://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/\n \n \nhttp://caldicott2.dh.gov.uk/\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\n \n \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-esrc/information/data-policy.aspx\n and\n \nhttp://www.mrc.ac.uk/Ourresearch/Ethicsresearchguidance/datasharing/Policy/index.htm\n \nhttp://ukdataservice.ac.uk/\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/TNSBMRBRCUKOpendatareport.pdf\n \nhttp://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/\n \n \nhttp://www.theodi.org\n \n \nhttp://www.oecd.org/sti/sci-tech/new-data-for-understanding-the-human-condition.htm\n \n \nwww.esrc.ac.uk/adt\n \nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-we-are/services/vml/index.html\n \n \nhttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/datalab/\n \n \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/research/data/sds.aspx\n \n \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/funding-opportunities/27813/Precall_Business_and_Local_Government_Data_Research_Centres__Big_Data_Network_Phase_2.aspx\n"
