[normal]Under the Go
[normal]vernment’s proposals, the Community Rehabilitation Companies 
[normal](CRC’s) 
[normal]wi
[normal]ll supervise many of the
[normal]se
[normal] offenders
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I can explain the thoro
[normal]ugh initial training that Probation Offender Managers undergo
[normal], the mandatory qualifications that are required
[normal] to be an Offender Manager
[normal] and the follow up training on risk assessment, victim awareness and many other areas that are vital for staff managing o
[normal]ffenders.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How can I say this with such confidence in the future when l do not know what training [bold]C[bold]RC staff will have beyond their initial induction which appears to be focusing on an introduction to the company?  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]How can I honestly reassure victims [bold]who are anxious, or who have little faith in the C[bold]riminal [bold]J[bold]ustice [bold]S[bold]ystem[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]This helps the Victim Liaison Officer to manage the case
[normal].  
[normal]It also helps the victim to have trust in the Victim Liaison Officer if they are knowledgeable about and understan
[normal]d the situation and reduces the 
[normal]embarrassment
[normal], anger and distress they may feel by having to recount the 
[normal]circumstances of the offence and their 
[normal]situation to an uninformed Victim Liaison Officer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There has been no assurance that there w[bold]ill there be shared IT systems with the CRC’s[bold].[bold]  
[normal]Will Victim Liaison Officers have access to CRC’s offender records?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]W[bold]ill I be wholly reliant on CRC staff to inform me when a development occurs?  [bold]My conc[bold]erns [bold]are[bold] that [bold]if this is the case, [bold]w[bold]ill the first that a victim knows of an offender’s release[bold] from prison[bold], be when they pass them on a street, or are assaulted by them[bold] [bold]again?   [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Victims worry that confidential information will be disclosed.  I am currently able to reassure them that we abide by Data Protection Policies an
[normal]d 
[normal]can 
[normal]tell them exactly where information is stored
[normal] and who has access to it
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Can I be confident in the future that this information will be only viewed by the Offender Manager [bold]in the CRC[bold], or other appropriate staff who have a legitimate need to view that[bold] information[bold] [bold]and [bold]that it [bold]will[bold] [bold]be stored securely?  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
