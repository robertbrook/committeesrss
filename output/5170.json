"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Dr. Andrew Blick, Lecturer, Institute of Contemporary British History, King’s College London (FTF 06)&#xa0;&#xa0;1. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was a major constitutional innovation, and though it had merit it was – as this Committee has already noted - introduced without sufficient opportunity for parliamenta\nry scrutiny or wider public consultation. It is therefore appropriate to substitute this lack of prior consideration with subsequent assessment, of the sort this Committee is carrying out.\n&#xa0;2. There will certainly be many important \nconstitutional \ndimension\ns to the impact of the Act. This evidence submission is concerned with two in particular: the role of the Ci\nvil Service and the context of c\noalition government. It considers these issues in particular through assessment of the \nCabinet Manual \nand \nMinisteria\nl Code\n,\n and mechanisms \nthat these documents \ndescribe.\n&#xa0;\nThe Civil Service and pre-election talks\n3. \nThe present rules governing contact between civil servants \nand opposition parties in advance of a General Election are set out in the present edition of the \nCabinet Manual\n (paragraph 2.21)\n. \nThough this text appeared in final form \nafter the advent of the first coalition government\n \nsince 1945, and following the passing of the \nFixed-term Parliaments Act 2011\n, \ncertain\n changes to the existing rules\n, taking into \naccount the\nse\n \ntwin developments, are necessary. They should be announced as soon as possible, and then eventually be included \nin a revised text of the manual.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nA first set of issues \ninvolves the timing of these talks a\nnd the means by which they come \nabo\nut\n. The manual states:\n&#xa0;\nAt an appropriate time towards the end of any Parliament, as the next general election approaches, the Prime Minister writes to the leaders of the main opposition parties to authorise pre-election contacts with the Civil Service.\n&#xa0;\n5\n. \nSince we now have a clearer idea of when an election is likely to take place, \nit \nis\n appropriate to fix a \nprecise \ntime at which this \nauthorisation is issued\n (assuming the Opposition wants to hold talks)\n, replacing the present vagueness\n (‘an appropriate time’)\n. This amendment of the rules could \nalso create a \nfirm \npresumpti\non that this process \nwill\n begin\n at this \nallotted \ntime\n, \nlessening\n any discretion available to the Prime Minister that may exist \nunder the present wording\n.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nC\nlarification of how precisely this contact is triggered is \nalso \nrequired. The manual tells us that ‘\nThe Cabinet Secretary has overall responsibility for co-ordinating this process once a request has been made and authorised by the Prime Minister.\n’ This sta\ntement seems to imply that a request must come from somewhere other than the Prime Minister (presumably the opposition leader or leaders), and that the Prime Minister can then consent to it. Yet the earlier part of the description cited above seems to sugg\nest that the Prime Minister \nstarts\n the \nprocess\n.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nA reworded \naccount\n,\n creating\n a broad principle that such contacts were automatic \nand setting out a timeframe for their commencement\n,\n could bypass present confusion\n \nregarding when, how, and at whose initiative this process begins, as well as adapting arrangements to the era of fixed-term Parliaments\n.\n Any timetabling should build into it flexibility to allow for the contingency of an early General Election taking plac\ne\n, as provided for under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act\n.\n Yet it should ensure that, if a Parliament runs for the standard period, the talks begin at a defined point.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nA minor point is that the reference to ‘main opposition parties’ in the \nC\nabinet Manual\n text cited above is confusing. Presumably at present there is only one ‘main opposition’ party.\n&#xa0;\n9. \nA second \ngroup\n of concerns involve \nwho is doing the talking, and about what. The manual tells us that\n: ‘\nThe meetings take place on a confidential basis, without ministers being present or receiving a report of discussions’. The reason that the UK Civil Service is able to perform this function is because of its long-established tradition of party-political im\npartiality. \nSenior officials are required to serve existing ministers with loyalty while retaining the ability to serve future such office-hol\nders, of whatever\n party, equally well. A particular value of t\nhis principle is that it can provide for stable tran\nsitions from one government to another, either following elections or possibly at other points.\n C\nontinuity\n, taken to excess,\n \nw\nould be a proble\nm from a democratic perspective. But\n the possibility for smooth changeovers, \nprovided it is\n accompanied by meaning\nful \nshifts\n of \npolicy \ndirection as appropriate, has attractions\n, particularly \nbecause of\n its potenti\nal contribution to effective administration\n.\n&#xa0;\n10. \nThe pre-election talks described in the manual are possible precisely because of th\nis\n tradition of impartia\nlity, and they contribute to the continuity that \nimpartiality helps bring about. It is against this background that \ncertain \nCivil Service \nreforms the government is implementing \nrequire careful consideration. There seems to be an intention to give \nsecretaries of st\nate enhanced discretion in selecting the senior officials closest to them and in senior roles in departments\n, through such \ninitiatives\n as the introduction of Extended Ministerial Offices\n. \nThese\n changes\n, which are underway,\n seem to\n entail k\ney civil servants having a clearer personal link to the particular politician \nwho influenced their appointment to a given role\n. This practice raises general questions about the extent to which the Civil Service \ncan\n continue to be a provider of stability ac\nross different governments; and has specific implications for the practice of pre-election talks. \nOfficials who have a close association of this kind with a serving member of a government would not be well placed to take part in such contacts with the oppo\nsition, \ngiven the delicate nature\n of such discussions\n.\n&#xa0;\n11. \nThe manual also sets out the purpose and nature of these talks. It explains that they are intended ‘to allow the Opposition’s shadow ministers to ask questions about departmental organisation and \nto inform civil servants of any organisational changes likely to take place in the event of a change of government.’ The manual goes on to note that ‘Senior civil servants may ask questions about the implications of opposition parties’ policy statements, a\nlthough they would not normally comment on or give advice about policies.’ These stipulations seem to be appropriate when the Civil Service \nis\n de\naling with an opposition par\nty, though the use of the \nword ‘normally’\n could be a significant\n, if imprecise,\n qua\nlification.\n&#xa0;\n12. \nHowever, the manual is\n silent regarding how the Civil Service might engage with a party that holds office\n in a coalition, and \ncould\n therefore find itself either in a single \nparty government or a differently composed coalition following a forthcoming General Election\n. \nIs it appropriate, for instance, for officials to advise Conservative ministers in the coalition on negotiations with t\nhe European Union leading to a referendum on continued membership, should the Conservative Party win the next General Election? Equally, can officials discuss with Liberal Democrat ministers matters that they might seek to make part of a coalition programm\ne were a\nn agreement reached with \nLabour after the next General Election? \nIs it, indeed, appropriate to discuss the specifics of a possible renewed Conservative-Liberal Democrat programme\n with politicians from these parties (presumably presently serving min\nisters)\n? \nIf the Civil Service has not yet considered these matters, it needs to. Any guidance that exists, or is produced in future, should be made public.\n&#xa0;\nCollective responsibility\n&#xa0;\n13. \nThe \nMinisterial Code\n iterates a key principle of UK government (that\n long predates the \nappearance of the code itself): the collective responsibility of ministers. In the words of paragraph \n2.1 \nof the code: ‘\nThe principle of collective responsibility, save where it is explicitly set aside, applies to all Government \nMinisters’.\n \nParagraph 2.3 of the codes states:\n&#xa0;\nThe internal process through which a decision has been \nmade, or the level of Committee by which it was taken should not be disclosed. Decisions reached by the Cabinet or Ministerial Committees are binding on \nall members of the Government. They are, however, normally announced and explained as the decision of the Minister concerned. On occasion, it may be desirable to emphasise the importance of a decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of Her \nMajesty’s Government. This, however, is the exception rather than the rule.\n&#xa0;\n14. Paragraph 8.3 states that:\n&#xa0;\nMinisters should ensure that their statements are consistent with collective Government policy. Ministers should take special care in referring to \nsubjects which are the responsibility of other Ministers.\n&#xa0;\n15. \nAbsolute maintenance of these \nprinciples is difficult even under single-\nparty government\n, given competition between ministers and party factions, and constant media scrutiny\n. \nThe problems have \nintensified under the coalition. \nThe present government\n has, on the one hand, a need to function effectively, necessitating a degree of cooperation between its different components. \nOn the other hand, \nthe two parties comprising the coalition also have an e\nlectoral need to differentiate themselves from each-other.\n This imperative \nhas led to senior ministers appearing publicly to disavow decisions that must have been taken at Cabinet level and therefore should be subject to collective responsibility\n, for inst\nance over health reforms early in the present Parliament\n. There is even a tendency for governmen\nt members to list policy ideas emanating from the other party in the coalition they successfully vetoed;\n or \nconversely programmes they \nwould like to have introduced but \nthat their \ncoalition partner\n prevented\n. These \nglimpses behind the curtain of collective responsibility, even if they are \nto an extent \nstage-managed between the parties, are difficult to reconcile with the \nMinisterial Code\n,\n and are problematic\n in themselves\n. They can create confusion about what present government policy is, including over crucial issues such \nas UK membership of the European Union.\n This doubt can in turn undermine confidence in the government, and make democr\natic accountability difficult.\n&#xa0;\n16. \nThis rupture in collective responsibility is likely to widen as the General Election approaches\n, and campaigning becomes the overriding priority\n. Since it is difficult to imagine complete reversal of the tendency towards\n open dissent that has intensified under the coalition, it might be better swiftly to publish \nsome rules of engagement. They could \nset out a framework enabling public representatives of parties\n – perhaps not ministers –\n to set out publicly what party polic\ny was in contentious areas, stipulating the timing and form of such pronouncements, and who could make them.\n&#xa0;\n14 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
