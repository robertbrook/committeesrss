"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the UK Major Ports Group (WRT 009)Summary1\n              \nThe arrangements for winter resilience for transport have improved greatly since the winter of 2009/10. The strategic importance of ports to the UK economy is now much better recognised in planning arrangements. Moreover much of the strategic stockpile of \nsalt and grit is being stored at ports which can provide the necessary space, access to supply lines, and handling and distribution expertise. It is essential that ports and main connecting road and rail links continue to be given priority in winter resili\nence planning. \nIntroduction2\n              \nUKMPG is one of two associations representing ports in the UK.  Our 9 member groups handle over 70 percent of the UK’s international trade by volume, and therefore play a significant role in supporting the UK economy and prom\noting exports.  UK ports are privately financed and do not seek any financial help from the taxpayer.  \n&#xa0;\nWinter 2009/103\n              \nDuring \ns\nevere winter weather in January 2010\n,\n \nsome ports began to encounter problems because they were not getting the salt they neede\nd to keep\n \nfull operations going. These delivery problems ap\npeared to be linked to the \nGovernment’s \nthen \nprioritisation programme with the Highways Agency and local authorities being given priority for supply over all other customers. On behalf its members \nUKMPG pressed strongly for ports to be given high priority for salt supplies not only as an essential part of the nation’s transport infrastructure  network but also because of their role in the distribution of imported salt and grit. The Department of Tra\nnsport acted on these concerns and facilitated the distribution of salt and grit supplies to ports which needed them.\nQuarmby Report4\n              \nIn February 2010 the then Secretary of State for Transport announced that severe winter planning would need to be handled\n more strategically in future and that the Government would be commissioning a review. In the event this review was carried out by a small team led by David \nQuarmby\n CBE. \n \nUKMPG inputted to this review and \nwe \nwere pleased to see that the final report publis\nhed in October 2010 stressed the strategic importance of ports and the strong economic case for maintaining access to ports during \nsevere winter conditions. The main recommendations affecting ports were that \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nports should increase their own pre season salt\n stock holdings to \nminimise\n reliance on in season re-stocking\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthere should be a dialogue between ports and relevant highway authorities to ensure there is clear agreement on boundaries and responsibilities\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe relevant access roads should feature on the hi\nghway authorities priority gritting network\n&#xa0;\n5\n              \nPorts moved quickly to respond to the report where necessary strengthening the links with highway authorities and also participating in the development of the national \nstrategic \nsalt stockpile managed by the H\nighways Agency. \n&#xa0;\nSubsequent guidance&#xa0;6\n              \nIn Autumn 2011 Department for Transport officials wrote to ports in England inviting them to participate in strengthening contingency planning for the forthcoming winter. \nDfT\n commended ports for improved performance\n during the severe weather in the previous winter which had much to do with greater strategic stockpiles of salt and improved planning. In the light of this experience and the implementation of the \nQuarmby\n review \nDfT\n drew up an overall action plan for port\ns for winter 2011/2. The main new elements of this were\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA standardized ports industry template on severe weather planning designed to ensure consistency of approach and strengthened co-ordination between the ports sector and the Government. This was drafte\nd  by \nDfT\n in consultation with ports and others concerned\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA full induction and training \nprogramme\n on ports issues for the new DCLG regional resilience teams who had now replaced the Government Office emergency planning network\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPorts were asked to consider \nhow their response to bad weather conditions could be strengthened and to share conclusions with \nDfT\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPorts were strongly encouraged to establish effective links with the new regional resilience teams by for example inviting them on familiarization visits\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\nhere needed, ferry ports were asked to establish robust communication links with port operators at the other end of the route to identify potential problems at an early stage\n7\n              \nSome of the actions that ports themselves have taken to improve winter resilien\nce on port sites include\n              \n-    Building new storage facilities for salt and grit\n              \n-    Acquiring additional snow ploughs and gritting machines\n              \n-    Trialing de-\nicer\n sprays on cranes\n              \n-    Arrangements put in place to lease additional snow clearance \nvehicles at short notice\n              \n-   Working closely with the Met Office via Local Resilience Forums to receive bespoke severe weather forecasts and alerts\n              \n-  Developing Business Resilience and Continuity \nprogrammes\n to cover all issues connected with extreme wea\nther including snow and flooding, and carrying out regular test exercises.\nCurrent position&#xa0;8\n              \nMajor ports are satisfied that prioritization and planning arrangements are now much improved since the problems encountered in winter 2009/10. Should there be a\n recurrence of severe wintery conditions in winter 2013/4, ports will work closely with customers, stakeholders and other infrastructure providers to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum. It is essential that connecting infrastructure to and fro\nm ports receives priority for snow and ice clearance etc – ports are liaising closely with h\nighway authorities and Network R\nail on this. It also remains important that ports have guaranteed salt and grit availability in the event of severe weather. \n&#xa0;\nO\nctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
