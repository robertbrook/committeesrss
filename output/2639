defaultWWC0025default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence from UCAS Submission defaultUdefaultnder-achievement in education by white working class childrendefault&#xa0;defaultExecutive SummarydefaultUCAS believes that tackling the issue of educational disadvantage must extend beyond the schooling years and that a holistic view needs to be taken by all those involved in education and progression.  This submission looks at the Higher Education (HE) application rates for working class pupils, application rates to HE by ethnic group and the split by sex. It suggests that it is not just the disadvantaged white males who are under-represented and that attention should focus on a wider group of disadvantaged male applicants.  It highlights the importance of transparent information and guidance alongside sustained outreach from an early age, as well as the need to address the importance of different qualification routes.

defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUCAS is the UK provider of shared admissions services for Higher Education (HE).  UCAS’ mission is to help 
defaultall 
defaultapplicants to make the right choices for the right reasons with the right outcomes whether this is in their transition to work based, vocational training and apprenticeships or in taking other academic routes as well as facilitating (where appropriate) access to Higher Education.  
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUCAS is seen by schools, colleges, universities and 
defaultstudents
default as a credible source for information on both the process of making applications and the range of education and training opportunities available.  UCAS therefore has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that all young people are engaged in exploring and making informed learning and career choices, and that they are supported in realising their aspirations and potentia
defaultl
default.  UCAS also has a central role in supporting the higher education and schools and college sector through the provision of data that will help to identify potential barriers to young people achieving their aspirations through progression into HE. 
default&#xa0;

defaultUCAS Progress
default is a division of UCAS and is a UK provider of Course Search and Application services and online information and career planning tools for 12-19 year olds, currently focused
default on supporting applications to p
defaultost-16 education and training.  
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUCAS provides impartial information and advice, career and course information services which are available to 640,000 Year 10 and Year 11 learners, and application services to post-16 opportunities at over 4,000 schools, 6

defaultWhy UCAS wishes to submit evidence to this Committee?default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUCAS recognises that there are
default a multitude of factors which contribute to under-achievement in education by white working class children, and that there has been extensive research conducted in this area. We believe that the issue of tackling educational disadvantage extends beyond the schooling years
default,
default and UK universities also recognise the moral, social and economic imperative to address educational disadvantage. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEvidencedefault7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst UCAS is not 
defaultin a position to define what constitutes ‘underachievement’ for the purposes of this submission, UCAS can provide evidence on those students who apply to HE but are unsuccessful in gaining a place at any HE institution (including through Clearing).   We recognise that underachievement for the purposes of this Select Committee extends beyond this remit, including individuals who
default don’t 
defaultreach the stage of aspiring to apply to HE, but UCAS considers it useful to look at any patterns which may affect underachievement in accessing HE.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUCAS 
defaultholds data on 
defaultappl
defaulticants who apply to HE from dis
defaultadvantaged backgrounds. In addressing some of the factors considered to be responsible for under-achievement, evidence provided will take into account factors such as parental occupation and POLAR2 data 
defaultof those applying to HE, 
defaultdifferences between males and females applying to HE and the mixed profiles of qualifications types. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUCAS can offer the following information for consideration by the Committee
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultHE Application Rates for Working Class Pupils default&#xa0;default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHere we assume POLAR2 as a proxy for defining areas
default 
defaultwhich are more likely to contain working class families and pupils and take analysis from the UCAS 2013 Demand Report
default.
default 
defaultThe focus is on application rates which are a measure of the proportion of the population submitting an application for 
defaultHE
default through UCAS.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther details on POLAR and its relativity to other measures of advantage in England can be found on the HEFCE website

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUCAS data (
defaultFigure 7 UCAS 2013 Demand Report
default) 
defaultshows the application rates for English 18 year olds by POLAR2, where quintile 5 (Q5) represents the most advantaged areas and quintile 1 (Q1) the most disadvantaged areas. Application rates for 18 year olds in England from all backgrounds have increased since 2004, with the largest increases for young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. The application rate of young people living in the most disadvantaged areas has increased by over 70 per cent (proportionally) between 2004 and 2013. This compares to an increase of 10 per cent proportionally in the most advantaged areas. 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2013, 18 year olds living in the most advantaged areas are 2.7 times more likely to apply for 
defaultHE
default than those living in the most disadvantaged areas. This is substantially less of a differential than in 2004, when 18 year olds living in the most advantaged areas were 4.3 times more likely to apply for 
defaultHE
default than those living in the most disadvantaged areas. This reduction is a result of the relatively larger growth in demand from disadvantaged areas over this period.

default 
defaultPupils in independent schools are treated as not in receipt of 
defaultFSMs
default for this measure. On these definitions around 13% of the 18 year old population were in receipt of 
defaultFSMs 
defaultwhen aged 15. The application rate for 18 year olds in 2013 who were previously in receipt of 
defaultFSMs
default is 15% compared with 33% for those not in receipt of

defaultFSMs
default.
default&#xa0;default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2012, when the higher and more variable fees were introduced, the application rate of those not in receipt of 
defaultFSMs
default fell by 1.5 percentage
default points (4.7%

defaultis extended within the report to consider application rates by POLAR2 to Higher Tariff Institutions (Fig.23) and also by the ethnicity of those in state education.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdministrative records (source National Pupil Database, Department for Education) record an ethnic group for pupils in English state schools. This allows, through the same record linking method as used for the free school meal application rates, the application rate of pupils in each ethnic group to be estimated (this will be slightly lower than the actual value because only unambiguous links between the data sources are used). 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a large range in the population size of the different groups. For instance, there are around 500,000 pupils recorded in the White ethnic group compared to around 2,000 pupils recorded in the Chinese ethnic group. This analysis uses the major group level classification of ethnic groups; it is possible that more detailed ethnic groups would show different application rate levels and trends. 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFigure 10 shows the application rates by ethnic group estimated using this method. The application rate of pupils from all ethnic groups increases over the period. All ethnic groups also show the national pattern of a decrease against trend in application rates in 2012 followed by a return to increases in 2013 at approximately the trend rate. There are differences in both the level and trend rate of growth between groups. 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAcross the period, the Chinese ethnic group have consistently higher application rates, more than 50 per cent on this measure, compared with the other groups. The Asian ethnic group
default have a
defaultn application rate of around 40% 
defaulton this measure in 2013. The Black, Mixed, White and Other ethnic groups have application rates in a relatively 
defaultnarrow range in 2013 between 29% 
default(White) and 3
default4% 
default(Black). The largest increase in application rates across the period, and the largest increase in 2013, is observed for the Black ethnic group, for these pupils the applica
defaulttion rate has increased from 20% in 2006 to 34% 
defaultin 2013 (
defaulta 70% 
defaultproportional increase).

defaulty age 19. 
defaultThe analysis in 
defaultthe 
defaultUCAS 2013 Demand Report 
default(
defaultFigure 8
default)
default shows how this national rate is a mixture of different rates for men and women. For the cohort aged 18 in 2012, more (49
default%
default) women than men (38
default%
default) applied to 
defaultHE
default by age 19. For
default this cohort young women are 29% 
defaultmore likely to apply than young men. This difference is slightly larger than in recent cycles, but within the range seen over the period.
default&#xa0;default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf we compare POLAR2 quintiles against the mean proportion of men and women between 2006 and 2013 (
defaultT
defaultable 1), we see that the percentage of men applying to HE decreases as the extent of disadvantage increases, but the reverse is the case for females.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdditional data that the Committee may want to consider is the qualification type held by applicants and the effect that this has on entry rates. For example, 
defaulty
defaultoung people in more advantaged areas are substantially more likely to enter HE and hold
default 
defaultA
default-
defaultlevels than those living in more disadvantaged areas.
default 
defaultMore data on this can be found in the UCAS 2012 End of Cycle Report. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne area that we would highlight as becoming more important in understanding the trends for HE admissions between different groups is the nature of qualification chosen post 16. In particular, the balance between a set of A levels and Vocational Qualifications, especially BTECs. 
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFE analysis shows that the proportions of young people attaining level 3 through a BTEC qualification has increased very rapidly (from 3% of 19 year olds in 2004 to 16% in 2012 
default2012
default), and the proportion qualified to level 3 with (solely) A levels is in sharp decline. The increase in the proportion of level 3 holders who have vocational qualifications has been disproportionately large for those in more disadvantaged groups where it is now the case that more gain level 3 through BTECs than A levels.  
default&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSeparate 
defaultDfE
default data on exam entries shows that the proportion of students entered for purely academic qualifications has been in steady decline in recent years – from 70% in 2008 to 51% in 2012.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe see this reflected in our application data with around half of higher performing accepted applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds holding BTECs, compared to fewer than one in ten from more advantaged groups. This may restrict choice for certain types of applicants as higher performing students holding BTECs are almost entirely absent from certain types of institutions.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusions default&#xa0;default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe data shows us that whilst applications to 
defaultHE
default from the more disadvantaged groups 
defaultare 
defaultincreas
defaulting
default, there is still a gulf between those app
defaultlying from quintile 1 (most dis
defaultadvantaged areas) and quintile 5 (most advantaged). 
defaultPupils who had not been receipt of 
defaultFSMs 
defaultwere more than twice as likely to apply to 
defaultHE
default in 2013 than those who had been in receipt of 
defaultFSMs
default.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultData on the application rates by ethnic groups show
defaults
default that whilst the Chinese and Asian ethnic groups have relatively high application rates, 
defaultthe Black, Mixed, White and Other ethnic groups have application rates in a relatively narrow range in 2013 with White applicants having the lowest application rate across the period. The largest increase in 2013, is observed for the Black ethnic group, where the application rate has increased has increased 
defaultfrom 20% in 2006 to 34% in 2013 (a 70% 
defaultproportional increase). 
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also evident that there are large disparities between applications to 
defaultHE
default from men and women, again further compounding the gap between the educational achievements of boys and girls during their secondary education.
default&#xa0;
default31.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt can be concluded that in terms of aspiring to 
defaultHE
default, the gap between young men and women applying is significantly worse for men. Young women were a third more likely to enter 
defaultHE 
defaultin 2012 than men, and the majority of the fall in entry rate in 2012 was amongst men. Amongst 18 year olds, women were a third more likely to enter 
defaultHE
default in 2012 than men
default. W
defaultomen remain more likely to 
defaultenter 
defaultHE
default than men are to 
defaulteven 
defaultapply
default 
defaultto HE
default.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe proportion of men applying to 
defaultHE
default also reduces as POLAR2 quintile increases (i.e. the extent of disadvantage increases).  So the more disadvantaged young men are, the less likely they are to aspire to pursue 
defaultHE
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendationsdefault34.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo be able to address the issue of under-achievement in education by white working class children, an holistic approach needs to be taken by all those involved in education and progression, starting from early years through to secondary and higher education and into employability and lifelong learning.  This requires consistent and regular intervention, targeted particular at those groups who are most at risk of dropping out of education or becoming a NEET.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur evidence also suggests that it is not just the disadvantaged white males who are under-represented, certainly in applying to HE.  Our data would suggest that the Committee needs to focus on the needs of a much wider group of disadvantaged male applicants including the black and mixed ethnic groups. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default38.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis evidence is concurrent with other research which shows that long term, sustained  outreach is key to raising aspirations from an
default 
defaultearly age. OFFA is urging universities to consider drawing up plans for working with primary school children to raise their ambitions towards HE. 
defaultE
defaultxploring and explaining possible outcomes and career paths can have a motivational effect on how students view the purpose of education and training,
default 
defaulthow they engage with their studies and develop positive aspirations. 
defaultUniversities need to continue to reach out to all potential applicants
default, for example through
default 
defaultthrough
default consistent and targeted outreach in the form of summer schools and visit days.  
defaultC
defaultase studies
default also show that enabling
default undergraduates
default or
default student mentors 
defaultto spend time in 
defaultschools is an excellent way of 
defaultins
defaultpiring young people
default by showing what can be achieved and the barriers that others have overcome.
default 
default. 
defaultS
defaulttudents who have participated in university summer schools are already expressly
default 
defaultencouraged to include this information in their UCAS applications, and this information can be taken into consideration by admissions staff when applications are being assessed. 
default&#xa0;
default39.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdditionally, we would recommend to the Committee that if under-represented children are to have a fair chance of entering the more selective universities, the issue of decreasing participation in A levels must be addressed.
