"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from the RAC Foundation (SRN0057)\n&#xa0;\nAt the Better Roads evidence session yesterday in discussion with Mr Stringer I promised to provide references to specific road schemes.\n&#xa0;\nThey are as follows\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/providing_and_funding_strategic_roads-arup-\n071111.pdf\n&#xa0;\n(especially the table in Appendix A)\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.racfoundation.org/assets/r\nac_foundation/content/downloadables/providing%20and%20funding%20strategic%20roads%20-%20january%202012%20update.pdf\n&#xa0;\nhttp://\nwww.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/road_programmes_england-smith-june2013.pdf\n&#xa0;\nThe third of these is the most recent and dates from June 2013.\n&#xa0;\n Since then, of course, there have been several further announcements and some \nof the schemes have been given a firm go-ahead (including the A14).\n&#xa0;\n We are in the process of compiling a more up to date list.\n&#xa0;\nWe very much welcome the Department for Transportâ€™s commitment to create a Roads Investment Strategy and hope that the process \nof developing that will lead to a coherent government statement of which roads will be improved or built, in what sequence and how they will be paid for.\n&#xa0;\nYours sincerely\n&#xa0;\nStephen Glaister CBE PhD FICE FTRF FCGI\nDirector\nRAC Foundation\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
