"PUB0007&#xa0;Written evidence from Daphne Havercroft&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;My name is Mrs Daphne \nHavercroft\n. I am a resident of South Gloucestershire. I have seven years experience as a member of the public participating in and \nobserving\n public and patient involveme\nnt in local NHS service changes. I have also contributed to \nand o\nbserved \nlocal health authority scrutiny of these matters. \nI am a public member of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. \nI am providing this evidence in a personal capacity.\n&#xa0;\nEvidence&#xa0;My reason for giving evidence to the Committee is that ther\ne is an assumption in the Open Public Services White Paper that people know better than politicians and that giving the people more control over services they receive will lead to better pub\nlic services. This assumption needs to be thoroughly tested. Unles\ns \ns\ntrong governance policies are in place \nat local level \nand audited\n to e\nnsure that\n they truly deliver\n full openness and \ntransparency\n,\n \nincreased \ndelegation of powers and responsibility to local level has the potential to do more harm than good.\n&#xa0;I have answered some of the \nCommittee’s \nconsultation questions below and given examples as evidence to support the answers.\n&#xa0;\nTo what extent is the Government’s public service reform programme succeeding in:&#xa0;a. Empowering citizens?b. Improving public services?c. Ensuring that public services are accountable to the people who use them, and to elected officials?&#xa0;Currently citizens are not empowered and never will be unless \norganisations providing public s\nervice\ns\n \nare seen to be \ntruly accountable \nto\n the public\n. \nCurrently l\nocal organisations providing public services have the freedom to avoid public accountability\n with impunity\n if they wish to do\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the challenges and opportunities in moving power away from Whitehall and into the hands of citizens?&#xa0;The challenge is\n to genuinely move \npower into the hands of citizens\n. \nThere is an assumption that all citizens want it. I am not convinced this is a correct assumption because empowerment carries respon\nsibility which requires citizens to commit time \nto exercise their rights. Many may not be willing to allocate time to this. Consequently there is a risk \nthat power \nwill move\n to\n organisations and groups which claim to represent \nlocal interests and serve the public \nbut in fact may \nnot do so. \n&#xa0;How successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening up public services to grassroots community groups, rather than to large private or third sector organisations?&#xa0;I have not seen any clear evidence of local success, rather the reverse. For example th\ne Councils of Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset have awarded contracts to run local \nHealthwatch\n to a third sector organisation which has a history of winning contracts \nwith them. \nThere is no publicly available \ninformation \nto explain \nthe \ngovernance arrangements for\n local \nHeal\nthwat\nch\n, including arrangements for \npatient\n and public\n \npart\ni\ncipa\ntion\n in meetings and \nan explanation as to \nhow the business of the meetings \nwill be recorded\n and published\n. \nOver s\nix months \nafter it was established, n\no information is publicly available to show whether any grassroots community groups are part of Local \nHealthwatch\n.\n&#xa0;How does the Government ensure that public services develop the right kind of leadership as they become more open, more subject to scrutiny and more customer-focused?&#xa0;A considerable \namount of documentation \nexists \nwhich describes good \nleadership \npractice – for example Nolan Standards, Code of Conduct for NHS Managers, Centre for Public\n Scrutiny Documents\n. There a\nre many examples where these practices are not followed\n locally, \nto the detriment o\nf openness, and public scrutiny and accountability. \n&#xa0;For example \nNHS Foundation Trusts can be completel\ny unaccountable to local people\n if they choose to be.\n In the case of \nthe Foundation Trust of which I am a public member, i\nt is impossible to contact the public and patient governors without going through the Trust. It is impossible to have meetings and conversations with public and patient governors without them being chape\nroned by the Trust Board Secretary. The Trust Board Chair (as is the statutory role of all Foundation Trust Chairs) also chairs the Governors' Membership Council, thereby having the opportunity to control and influence its meeting agendas and discussions. \nConsequently the extent to which a Foundation Trust Board holds itself accountable to patients and the public depends entirely on the extent to which it chooses to do so.\n \n&#xa0;\nAnother example is \nan organisation set up in Bristol, described as\n a dynamic collab\noration between six \nNHS organisations serving the area, the city’s two universities and its local authority. It aims to \ngenerate significant health gain and improvements in service delivery in Bristol by integrating, promoting and developing Bristol's stre\nngths in health services, research, innovation and education.\n It is inspired by \nthe success of similar collaborations in the USA, Europe and East Asia\n. It aspires to c\nloser working with patients, the public and communities. \n&#xa0;\nI\nn response to an FOI request \nit said its Board meetings are held eve\nry two months, are not open to \nthe public and the minutes are not published. \nIt has significant opportunity to influence the health and wellbeing of local people, yet \nit is not constituted and governed in any way whic\nh would give citizens real empowerment a\nnd scrutiny of how well the partnership services the local population and the extent to which it provides value for public money. \nCitizens should have a say in the qualities required of people appointed to leadershi\np roles. Where appropriate, applicants for the roles should be required to hold appropriate professional qualifications as a condition of appointment. To serve citizens properly, \nleaders must be appointed based not on who they know, but what they know and \nhow well they perform as leaders. \n&#xa0;How realistic is it that “choice” can be exercised in public service provision or should we be looking instead at greater control by users so they can ensure that public services become more responsive to changing needs?&#xa0;If users see evidence that \nproviders of public services are open and accountable, the\ny are\n less likely they are to \ndemand more choice. \nHowever t\nhere is a long way to go before users have the control intended by Open Services White Paper. \n&#xa0;\nHow do we make sure that all citizens are able to influence public services?&#xa0;Organisations which offer public services must be required to commit to delivering minimum s\ntandards of governance. Their success in meeting those standards \nmust be externally and\n independently audited. \n&#xa0;\nOrganisations must have policies in place to demonstrate that all citizens can influence their servi\nces. \nThey must provide citizens with evidence\n that they follow these policies. \nThe sort of behaviours used by\n some \nservice provide\nrs try to obstruct citizens\n’ rights\n to influence services are as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;What safeguards should be in place to deal with service providers who fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficient quality? &#xa0;They should be served with improvement notices. If they fail to improve, sanctions should \nbe applied,\n including contract \ntermination\n if necessary. \n&#xa0;How do we ensure that best practice is shared so it can be replicated in the context of greater diversity of provision?&#xa0;D\nefine and \nagree what “best practice”\n means\n, then gather case studies\n which demonstrate best practice which\n can be used as a resource for citizens, local public\n service commissioners and providers. \n&#xa0;What progress has been made in setting up mutuals as an effective way of delivering public services?&#xa0;It is assumed that \nthey will act in the best interests of the public. \nThere is a risk that they will not. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary &#xa0;The principle of \ngiving\n \nmore power to cit\nizens good, but I am not convinced that the majority of citizens want it and have the time to devote to it. M\ny experience is that the culture and leadership of some organisations which have responsibility for public services is nowhere near sufficiently de\nveloped to provide genuine transparency, openness and public accoun\ntability. \nO\nrganisations such as \nmutuals\n, \nwhich are not subject to the \nFOIA\n, \nare \ntaking over responsibility for services which were prev\niously managed by public bodies\n which were subject to \nthe FOIA.\n \nThis is an obstacle to greater openness, transparency and public accountability. \n&#xa0;\nIf services are decentralised at a faster rate than local providers develop strong leadership and commitment to public service values and accountability, the conse\nquence for citizens will be that they wi\nl\nl be disempowered and silenced.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n November \n2013 \n"
