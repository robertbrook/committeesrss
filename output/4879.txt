[[[David Anderson Q.C.]]]

[[[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]]]September 20131&#xa0;               I have recommended that subject to resources, the operation of two further anti-terrorism laws (ATCSA 2001 and CTA 2008) should also be considered for independent review: The Terrorism Acts in 2011, June 2012, 12.1.               https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/the-terrorism-acts-in-2012/                https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/report-on-terrorism-prevention-and-investigation-measures-act-2011-in-2012/                https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/report-on-the-terrorist-asset-freezing-etc-act-2010-in-20112012/                www.terrorism-legislation-reviewer.independent.gov.uk                E.g. during the passage of the Justice and Security Act 2013, and in debates on the proscription of organisations.               See Gillan and Quinton v UK (2010) 50 EHRR 45 (Terrorism Act stop and search) and, most recently, R v SSHD ex p Beghal [2013] EWHC 2573 Admin (Schedule 7).               I consider the charging figures to be more informative than the figures for “terrorism-related arrests”, which may be criticised for subjectivity: see The Terrorism Acts in 2012 (July 2013) at 8.3-8.8.               The killings of Mohammed Saleem and Drummer Lee Rigby in April and May 2013 were both investigated as terrorism by the police.  Suspects have been charged with murder in each case.               Detention of undeportable foreign nationals in Belmarsh (Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001), replaced in turn by control orders (Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005) and TPIMs (Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011).               Particularly in the Terrorism Act 2006: see my report The Terrorism Acts in 2011, June 2012,                Such measures may also encourage the terrorists.  As Jonathan Evans of MI5 said in 2010: “In recent years we appear increasingly to have imported from the American media the assumption that terrorism is 100% preventable and that any incident that is not prevented is seen as a culpable government failure.  This is a nonsensical way to consider terrorist risk and only plays into the hands of the terrorists themselves.” Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of al-Qaida, confirmed the point in a recent message marking the 12th anniversary of 9/11: “We must bleed America economically by provoking it, so that it continues its massive expenditures on security.”                 See the overview in my report The Terrorism Acts in 2012 (July 2013), 1.7-1.11.  The first two developments were prompted by judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, as was the requirement that the gist of the national security case against them be provided to control order and now TPIM subjects.               See, e.g., The Terrorism Acts in 2011 (June 2012),  7.74 and 9.70.               The Terrorism Acts in 2011 (June 2012), 7.71-7.73.               The Terrorism Acts in 2011 (June 2012), chapter 9; The Terrorism Acts in 2012 (July 2013), chapter 10.               The Terrorism Acts in 2011 (June 2012), chapter 4; The Terrorism Acts in 2012 (July 2013), chapter 5.               Control Orders in 2011 (March 2012), 6.13-6.14; TPIMs in 2012 (March 2013), 11.30-11.32.               Descriptions of each current TPIM subject, taken from open sources, are given in TPIMs in 2012 (March 2013), chapter 4.  Two of them are believed to have been involved in the 2006 airline liquid bomb plot, and have been under control orders or TPIMs since 2007 and 2008 respectively.  A number of others are believed to have links with terrorism in East Africa.               TPIMs in 2012 (March 2013), 11.33-11.38.               https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Justice_and_Security_oral_evidence_for_clickable_pdf.pdf, evidence of 16 October, QQ 72-82.               http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/eu-sub-com-f/Protocol36OptOut/VolofevidenceP36asat110113.pdf, pp. 1-4.  That evidence was summarised and supplemented in The Terrorism Acts in 2012 (July 2013), 3.17-3.23.               TPIMs in 2012 (March 2013), 11.3-11.10.  No former controlled person was ever successfully prosecuted for a terrorist offence: Control Orders in 2011, March 2012, 3.19-3.21, 3.51.               TPIMs in 2012 (March 2013), chapter 10.
