Subsequently the credibility of the IPCC’s treatment of science has taken some serious blows:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nthe “hockey stick” was the star of Assessment Report 3 (AR3) in 2001 and was included in AR4 in 2007.  The hockey stick claimed that the global temperature declined since about 1000 to the end of the nineteenth century,\n when it has been increasing due to CO2\n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nthe report falsely claimed that “more likely than not human activities have contributed to an increase in tropical cyclone intensity” \n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nCanadian journalist Donna Laframboise showed that contrary to IPCC claims \nthe reports are not based exclusively on peer reviewed input from leading scientists were not true\n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nthe \nIPCC had to withdraw its claim that the glaciers in the \nHimalayas\n were likely to melt by 2035\n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nthe \nNongovernmental Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) \nwas set up to provide an alternative – and less politically alarmist slanted - story\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGlobal CMIP5 RCP45 39 models, annual Tas reference base 1979-1983, 7-yr running average\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere has been increasing realization that the IPCC’s interpretative material – in \nparticular the Summary for Policy Makers but also so\nme of the base science – is not independent but there is a political agenda behind some – if not much – of it\n:-  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“The \nclimate summit in Cancun —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War\n…One must say clearly \nthat we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governme\nnts of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe IPCC’S Fifth Assessment Report\n&#xa0;\nThere are a few improvements in the science in AR5 – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick, and has dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and that flooding and drought will become more serious.  The main shortcoming is that the report is\n unable to explain the 16 \nor 17 year pause in global warming.   Next, despite the expenditure of hundreds of £M on climate models they do not track global temperature accurately. The (leaked) final draft Summary for Policy Makers identified that \n“Models do\n not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\n–15 years”\n.  \nThis admission di\nsappeared in the f\ninal version\n, which massaged the inaccuracy of the models\n. \n&#xa0;\nRichard Lindzen, Professor \nEmeritus, \nProgram in Atmospheres\n, Oceans, and Climate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n, observed:-\n&#xa0;\n“I think that \nthe latest IPCC report\n has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.\n&#xa0;\n They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…\n&#xa0;\nTheir excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the h\neat is hiding in the deep ocean.\n&#xa0;\n However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…\n&#xa0;\nIf climate science were a “normal” science failure of the models to predict the temperature pause would lead many scientists to conclude that the assumptions underlying the models were wrong and we should go back to the drawing broad.  But climate science is politicised with extensive commercial, reputational and grant funding vested interests hanging on it.  So the IPCC tries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly to claim an increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and observations increase.  &#xa0;\nDon Easterbrook, Professor of Geology at W\nestern Washington Uiversity\n, \ncomments “the IPCC report must be considered the grossest misrepresentation of data ever published…After all these years, IPCC still doesn’t get it\n - \nwe’ve been thawing out from the Little Ice Age for several hundred years but \nstill are not yet back to pre-Little Ice Age temperatures that prevailed for 90% of the past 10,000 years.\n”  He states the IPCC makes a number of false claims including:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEasterbrook concludes “These are only a few examples of the highly biased, \nmisrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”\n1.3\n              \nThe possible effect of the sun on the climate\n&#xa0;\nTh\ne IPCC d\nismisses \nthe effect of \nthe sun on the clim\nate because it limits \nits analysis to solar irradiance\n, which only changes by 0.1% across the 11 year solar cycle\n.  But this is only part of the \nsun’s \nstory. \n“\nIn the subdomain of irradiation, strong fluctuations do indeed occur, of up to 70%.  Ultraviolet \nlight is converted to heat in the ozone layer and ionosphere and, as a result, leads to a formidable temperature rollercoaster with magnitudes of change reaching several degrees Celsius – all synchronized with the 11-year solar cycle…Furthermore, the sun’s\n magnetic field also fluctuates in sync with the 11-year solar cycles, and all this has a profound impact of 10-20% on cosmic rays…These cosmic particles seed clouds in the lower atmosphere, which cool the earth.  \nIn other words, intense solar activity leads to less cloud cover, resulting in more warming, whereas weak solar activity leads to more cloud cover and so causes cooling…”&#xa0;\nA recent NASA press release comments:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nThere is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these \napparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate.

A\ns Peter Lilley MP pointed out in a recent speech in Westminster Hall, the increase in \nChina\n’s CO2 emissions in 2011 was 200Mt more than the total emitted b\ny the \nUK\n. In \na presentation on \n14 October 2013\n to the World Energy Congress Wood Mackenzie forecast that global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25% by the end of the decade slightly overtaking oil. \nAnd while we obsess about driving \ncoal plant, \nGerm\nany\n and the \nNetherlands\n are just completing \nten 900MW \nhigh efficiency coal plants.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe carbon budgeting process and the Climate Change Committee should be scrapped as a pointless waste of money.&#xa0;\nBOTH THE IPCC AND THE CCC HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE A SOUND ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF CLIMAT SCIENCE.  WE NEED A TRULY INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT UNDERTAKEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO VESTED COMMERCIAL OR REPUTATIONAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME.&#xa0;\n2\n.\n              \nTHE CHANGING CONTEXT\n&#xa0;\n2007, when the Fourth AR was published, was the height of the IPCC’s prestige and \npublic belief in \nthe case for concern about anthropogenic climate warming (ACW).  The IPCC and Senator Al Gore\n were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and a survey showed that 90\n% of people were concerned about ACW.  In \nBritain\n the concern was manifest in the Climate Change Bill.  Subsequently the \ncredibility \nof the IPCC\n’s treatment of science has taken some \nserious blows\n which are described in the following section\n.  The IPCC has\n promoted some obviously flawed science; the models it uses failed to track temperature, notably the pause in temperature rise; climategate; challenges from internet blogs; \nand an \nincreasing realization that the IPCC is a political body.\n&#xa0;\n2\n.1\n              \nFlawed scienc\ne promoted by the IPCC\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn a blog titled “Systematic misrepresentation of the \nScience of Disasters and Climate Change” Roger Pielke Jr, \na p\nrofessor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, pointed out that the IP\nC\nC’s supporting evidence for claiming that climate change was responsible for a \npro\nportion of damages from \nrecent natural disasters \nwas a\n non-peer reviewed paper by Munich Re Insurance. He wrote a book “The Climate Fix” which sets out the story\n of\n how \nthis \npaper \nran and ran, and how the IPCC distorted a pape\nr\n from a workshop which \nhe (\nPielke\n)\n had organised\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nthe writing of \n28 out of 44 chapters included at least one individual affiliated with the WWF\n; \n15 chapters were led by WWF-affiliated scientists\n \n&#xa0;\n*\n              \nin three instances, chapters were led by two WWF-affiliated \ncoordinating lead authors\n&#xa0;\nShe reported on her blog on 4/4/13 that the IPCC selected three scientists\n,\n who had variously worked for the US Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, WWF, and a doctor who was urging other doctors to “Educate and encourage pati\nents…in climate change action”\n,\n to be in charge of a chapter in the forthcoming working Group 2 AR5 report and to work on its Summary for Policy Makers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n.2\n              \nThe IPCC climate models failed to \ntrack \nthe global t\nemperature\n p\nause\n&#xa0;\nThe global temperature has remained constant since 1998.  This led to increasing criticism of the climate models which the IPCC increasingly relied on\n. Professor Christy\n has recently c\nompared the performance of 39 climate model that \nwere \nused in \nAR5 \nover the period 1975 to 2012 with measured temperature data.  The models over back-cast temperature significantly in a range 0-0.7\no\nC.\n&#xa0;\nGlobal CMIP5 RCP45 39 models, annual Tas reference base\n 1979-1983, 7-yr running average\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are \nnumerous recent blogs about the failure of the models\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn a recent paper\n he concludes:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nAfter thirteen years and two new generations of climate models (CMIP-3, -5) the\n \nresults still suggest that \nmodel-averages are unable to represent (1) the observed\n \nmagnitudes of tropical temperature trends throughout the tropospheric levels, and (2)\n \nthe relationship between the temperature trends of the surface and troposphere. The\n \ndisparity remains.\n”\n&#xa0;\nIf climate science were a “normal” science failure of the models to predict the temperature pause would lead many scientists to conclude that the assumptions underlying the models were wrong and we should go back to the drawing broad.  But climate science is politicised with extensive commercial, reputational and grant funding vested interests hanging on it.  So the IPCC tries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly to claim an increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and observations increase.  &#xa0;\n2\n.3\n              \n“\nClimategate\n”\n&#xa0;\n“Climategate” \n- t\nhe release of e-mails from the Climat\nic\n Research Unit \na\nt the University of East Anglia \n(UEA) \nin November 2009\n -\n cast light on the modus operandi of the IPCC and an aspect of its “science” base.  It revealed a story \nof hiding and manipulating data;\n attempting to censor publication\n of pa\npers \nthat did not follow the ACW line\n;\n refusing reques\nts under Freedom of Informa\ntion;\n and rigging the peer review process.  \n&#xa0;\nUEA commissioned two Inquiries and the House of Commons Science\n and Technology Committee held a\n hearing.  All three were superficial whitewashes.  None of these inquiries interviewed critics of the IPCC authors and \nn\none subjected the information provided by IPCC authors to cross examination\n.\n&#xa0;\n2\n.4\n              \nChallenge\ns\n from \ninternet\n blogs\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe conventional publication channel of scientific journals \nhas been \nincreasingly challenged by some very good blogs\n such as:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n.5\n              \nThe IPCC is a political body\n&#xa0;\nThere has been increasing realization that the IPCC’s \ninterpretative \nmaterial – in particular the Summary for P\nolicy Makers\n but also some of the base science\n – \ni\ns politicized.\n  \nT\nhe editing of Chapter 8, Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes, in \nAR2 o\nf 1995 was a cause célebre.   The final draft prepared by scientists stated that there was insufficient evidence \nto support ACW, but the lead author then excised denials or doubts of any scientific evidence of ACW, replacing them with statements to make the Scientific report consistent with the Policymakers’ Summary which claimed there is “a discernible human influen\nce on the global climate”\n.\n  \nThis example reflects the political agenda. T\nimothy Wirth, \na close political ally of \nGore’s and now \nPresident of the UN Foundation, \ncommented\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“Ev\nen if the theory of global warming is wrong we will be doing the right thing in\n terms of economic and environmental policy.”\n&#xa0;\nC\nomment\ns by two l\neading people \ninvolved in the \nIPCC \nmake t\nhe political agenda clear\n:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“The \nclimate summit in \nCancun\n —- is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War.”\n&#xa0;\n“One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”\n&#xa0;\n              \n“\nIf global emission rights are distributed – If this happens, on a per capita basis, then \nAfrica\n will be the big winner, and huge amounts of money will flow there.”\n&#xa0;\n              \n“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is \nenvironmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n “\nI am not going to rest easy until I have articulated in every possible form the need to bring\n about major structural changes in economic growth and development. That’s the real issue. Climate change is just a part of it.”\n&#xa0;\nPachauri has publicly admitted that government bodies influence \nhow the IPCC operates and reports\n, commenting\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“We are an intergovernmental body and we do what the governments of the world want us to do,” he said. “If the governments decide we should do things differently\n and come up with a vastly different set of products we would be at their beck and call.”\n&#xa0;\nPachauri is here letting the cat out of the bag.  The first word of IPCC is intergovernmental, and governments are political bodies\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe hypothesis implicit in all \nIPCC writings is that dangerous global warming will result from human related CO2 emissions.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n              \nTHE IPCC’S FIFTH ASSESSMENT \nREPORT\n&#xa0;\nThere are a few improvements in the science\n in AR5\n – the IPCC has dumped the hockey stick and reinsta\nted the Medieval Warming Period, and \nhas dropped claims that hurricanes will increase in intensity and \nthat \nflooding and drought will become more serious\n.  \nBut it is strangely quiet about the feedback of climate sensitivity, which has inflated the estimate\ns of future supposed warming by CO2\n, and \nit is slightly\n more modest in its estimates of future warming.  \n&#xa0;\nThe main shortcomings are that the report is unable to explain the 16\n or \n17 year\n pause in global warming, a shortcoming which is linked to the secon\nd shortcoming.  Namely despite the expenditure of hundreds of £\nM\n on climate models\n they do not track global temperature accurately.  Furthermore there are factual errors in the report, and it does not take account of the increasing evidence for the influen\nce of the sun\n on the climate\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n.1\n              \nFinessing the temperature pa\nu\nse\n&#xa0;\nTh\ne full \nScience \nr\neport \ncomments\n:\n-\n&#xa0;\nThis difference between simulated and observed trends could be caused by some combination of (a) internal climate variability, (b) missing or incorrect\n radiative\n&#xa0;\nforcing, and (c) model response error.\n&#xa0;\nThe relevant text is in Box 9.2 of the full report and runs to\n five\n pages of incomprehensible jargon and gibble gabble\n which does not explain the pause\n.\nAnother storyline is that 16 or 17 years is not long\n enough to reliably assess trends in climate change, and so we must wait some more.  But this principle was not applied \nby the “warmists” \nduring the 1980s and 1990s when a decade of warming was enough to set the alarm bells ringing on \nACW due to \nCO2 and a \nfew more years \nring them louder t\no scare us.\n&#xa0;\nPaul Homewood\n shows \nhow the IPCC graphs misrepresened \nthe longer term temerature trend\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nTheir base period of 1951-2013, against which they have measured post 1998 trends, includes:-\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \n28 years of cooling \n– 1951-79\n2.\n              \n22 years of warming – 1979-2001\n3.\n              \n12 years of cooling again – 2001-2013\n&#xa0;\nSo, in total, during 40 out of the 62 years there has been a cooling trend. They are comparing a statistically insignificant amount of warming since 1998, with three \ndecades of cooling. The result is to make this small trend sound much more significant than it is.\nIt would surely have been more honest to have compared the post 1998 trend with the 1979-98 period. If they had have done this, of course, most people would r\nealised that the much trumpeted global warming really had stopped for the time being. And, in the IPCC’s eyes, that was not the message they wanted people to hear.”\n&#xa0;\nRichard Lindzen, Professor \nEmeritus, \nProgram in Atmospheres, Oceans, and Climate, Massachu\nsetts Institute of Technology\n, observed\n:-\n&#xa0;\n“I think that \nthe latest IPCC report\n has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence.\n&#xa0;\n They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase…\n&#xa0;\nTheir excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the h\neat is hiding in the deep ocean.\n&#xa0;\n However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans…\n&#xa0;\nFinally, in attributing warming to man, they fail to point out that the warming\n has been small, and totally consistent with there being nothing to be alarmed about.\n&#xa0;\n It is \nquite amazing to see the contortions the IPCC has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going.”\n&#xa0;\n3\n.2\n              \nMassaging the models\n&#xa0;\nThe \nfinal draf\nt SPM \n(which was leaked) \nidentified \nthat \n“Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\n–15 years”\n.  \nThis admission di\nsappeared in the f\ninal version. \n&#xa0;\n \nMcIntyre\n \npoints out that a draft of the report \n“clearly showed the discrepancy between models and observations, though IPCC’s covering text reported otherwise…Needless to say, this diagram did not survive.  Instead, IPCC replaced the damning (but accurate) diagram with a new diagram in which the incons\nistency has been disappeared…N\now here is the replacement graphic in the Approved Draft: this time, observed values are no longer outside the projection envelopes from the earlier reports. IPCC described it as follows:-\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nEven though the projections from \nthe models were never intended to be predictions over such a short time scale, the observations through 2012 generally fall within the projections made in all past assessments\n.”\n&#xa0;\nMcIntyre explains how the IPCC massaged the exhibit to arrive at this result,\n and  comments “\nNone of this portion of the IPCC assessment is drawn from peer-reviewed material.  Nor is it consistent with the documents sent to external reviewers.”\n&#xa0;\nOne implication of the failure of the models – which are structured based on CO2 driving climate change and excluding the possible effects of the sun - is that it is not possible to differentiate between natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate warming.  Notwithstanding this failure, the report and SPM frequently and without justification assert of various phenomena that they are due to “greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing”.  A second implication is that the models are of no use for projecting or forecasting global temperatures, let alone regional temperatures.&#xa0;3\n.3\n              \nFactual errors and misrepresentation\n&#xa0;\nDon Easterbrook, Professor of Geology at Western Washington Uiversity\n, \ncomments\n “the IPCC report must be considered the grossest misrepresentation of data ever published…After all these years, IPCC still doe\nsn’t get it—we’ve been thawing out from the Little Ice Age for \nseveral hundred years but still are not yet back to pre-Little Ice Age temperatures that prevailed for 90% of the past 10,000 years.\n”\n  He points out a number of errors\n:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEasterbrook co\nn\ncludes “Th\nese are only a few examples of the highly biased, misrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”\n&#xa0;\nThe NIPCC “Scientific Critique of IPCC’s 2013 Summar\ny for Policy Makers”\n identifies a number of “Misleading or Untrue Statements” including:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBob Tisdale pointed out that in Figure SPM.10 the IPCC showed the temperature increasing \nby \n0.25\n0\nC\n when there was no such increase\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.4\n              \nThe possible effect of the sun o\nn\n the climate\n&#xa0;\nTh\ne IPCC d\nismisses \nthe effect of \nthe sun on the climate because it limits \nits analysis to solar irradiance\n, which only changes by 0.1% across the 11 year solar cycle\n.  But this is only part of the \nsu\nn\n’s \nstory.  \nIn “The Neglected Sun”, recently published by Professor Fritz Vahrenholt\n and \nSebastian Lüning\n, the authors point out \n“ the IPCC “\noverlooks a crucial detail.  In the subdomain of irradiation, strong fluctuations do indeed occur, of up to 70%.  Ultraviolet light is converted to heat in the ozone layer and ionosphere and, as a result\n, leads to a formidable temperature rollercoaster with magnitudes of change reaching several degrees Celsius – all synchronized with the 11-year solar cycle…Furthermore, the sun’s magnetic field also fluctuates in sync with the 11-year solar cycles, and al\nl this has a profound impact of 10-20% on cosmic rays…These cosmic particles seed clouds in the lower atmosphere, which cool the earth.  \nIn other words, intense solar activity leads to less cloud cover, resulting in more warming, whereas weak solar activity leads to more cloud cover and so causes cooling (emboldening added)…And just a few per cent variation in cloud cover results in a change in the earth’s irradiative energy budget equal to the projected amount of the warming the IPCC claims that anthropoge\nnic CO2 causes.”\n&#xa0;\n“Fluctuations in solar activity are manifested over a wide range of cycles and have characteristic cycle lengths of between 11 and 2,300 years. \nEspecially important in today’s context is the 1000 year cycle, which led to unusually high irradiation intensities during the second half of the twentieth century. Over recent decades, the sun has been in one of its most active phases of the last 10,000 years.  Solar magnetic field activity more than doubled between 1901 and 1995.  Similar irradiation maximums occurred 1,000 years ago (the Medieval warm period) and 2000 years ago (the Roman warm period).  In both periods, pronounced climate warming took place.  The Roman warm period, the Medieval warm period and today’s Modern Optimum (since 1850) are well documented.  Between those warm periods the sun’s activity decreased and this led to distinct cold phases – the Vandal Cold Period and the Little Ice Age…”(emboldening added)&#xa0;“We are by no means claiming that CO2 has had no impact on today’s \nclimate events.  However, we are able to show that at least half of the warming of the last 30 years can be attributed to the sun and oceanic oscillations.  CO2 could be responsible for the other half of the warming, but its share may be even less than tha\nt…Taking both the important natural and anthropogenic climate factors into account, we can expect a slight cooling of about 0.2-\n0.3\n0\nC\n by the year 2035.  Only cooling can be expected from the sun over the coming decades.”\n&#xa0;\nA recent NASA press release commen\nts:-\n&#xa0;\n“\nThere is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these apparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate.

After 1900 there is an increasing excess in the temperature which is ascribed to ant\nhropogenic\n&#xa0;\n activity.\n&#xa0;\n After the impressive Grand Maximum of the 20th century the sun went through an exceptional\n&#xa0;\n not before observed phase transition that lasted relatively long, i.e. from about 2005 till \n2010.”\n&#xa0;\nJasper Kirby, Head of fthe CLOUD \nExperiment at CERN\n, recently\n gave a thorough review showing strong  correlations between cosmic rays, solar cycles and earth’s climate\n.  He projects a possible mini ice age by 2015 similar to the Dalton or Maunder minimum\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nTHE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHA\nNGE (CCC)\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee has just published what is in its Chapter 1 “Update of climate science” an uncritical endorsement of AR5\n.  It begins by stating:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUncritical acceptance \nof the IPCC story\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEven the IPCC did not run this spin\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC backed off making an estimate of climate sensitivity, see footnote 17\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt \nrecasts a number of well worn \ncanards\n including:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSee 3.3. for the facts on continuing sea level rise for which there is no evidence of an acceleration rise, \nand “\nNor is there any basis for blaming it on CO\n2\n because sea level has been rising for 150 years, long before CO\n2\n levels began to rise after \n1945”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis claim is just \nnot \ntrue; the ice in \nAntarctica\n is incre\nasing \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGlobal surface temperatures are the highest since temperature records began 150 years ago, but were at least as high in the Medieval and Roman Warming Periods when the level of CO2 was less.  While similar \nfluctuations have been seen and are to be expected, that is no indication of long term warming\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe magnitude of feedback is an open question.  Einstein once observed that his theories could be disproved by o\nne experiment whose results did not concur with theory\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee clearly \nbelieves in models, and makes no comment on their failure\n.  As Julius Caesar long ago observed “Fere liben\nter homines quo\nd volunt credunt”\n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n              \nTHE COMMITTEE’S QUESTIONS\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee invites responses\n \nto \nthe following questions:\n-\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addresses criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions? \n&#xa0;\n              \nThe \nheadline \nconclusion\ns\n are flimsy; the IPCC has addressed some of the criticisms but not the main ones \nabout the extent of man’s effect on the climate.\n  There is extensive scope to question the\n AR5’s \nconclusion\n \nabout a very basic \nissue\n, namely \n“Statistical Analyses of Surface T\nemperatures in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report” by Douglas Keenan\n \nexplained the complexities, uncertainties, in developing trends from time series data, in particualr the pitfalls in choosing\n statistical \n models. He then shows the simplistic manner \nin wh\nich the IPCC \nadopted a model\n; and \nargu\nes\n that (S 10.2.2) “[the IPCC] effectively acknowledges that we do not understand the data well enough to choose a statistical \nmodel.”  He concludes “\nSimply put, no one has yet presented valid statistical analysis of a\nny observational data to show global warming is real. Moreover, that applies to any warming - whether attributable to humans or to nature.  This is implied by S 10.2.2 and indeed is clear from statistics”\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of \nviews among climate scientists?\n&#xa0;\n              \nIt reflects the views of “state scientists” in Britain (i.e. those directly \no\nn the government’s payroll inclu\nding the Met Office\n, and those in universities seeking gra\nnts \nfunded by the government\n,\n \nwho must be\n politically c\norrect).  But it does not reflect the views of many “free” \nclimate scientists \nin \nNorth America\n, ANZAC, and some continental countries\n.  \nThe fact that virtually all, if not all, working climate scientists in Britain are directly or indirectly state scientists is probably the reason why there are (to my knowledge) no sceptic scientists in Britain&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nCan any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?\n&#xa0;\n What areas need further effort to reduce the levels\n of uncertainty?\n&#xa0;\n              \nFew, if any, areas can be regarded as settled.  \nThere are ma\nny a\nreas \nthat need research, perhaps starting with a better understanding of the \neffect of the sun on the climate and all that entails\n; the functioning of clouds and water vapou\nr; the sensitivity of temperature to CO2, which is fundamental to forward temperature estimates if CO2 is\n taken as a driver of temperature\n; and the dynamics of oceans.  In a seminar last year in the House of Commons Professor Lindzen commented \nthat \n“climat\ne science is an immature science”, i.e. there is a lot to learn.  He went on to add “It cannot even forecast the past, let alone the future”\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nHow effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying\n&#xa0;\n what is meant by uncertainty in scientific\n terms ? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?\n&#xa0;\n              \nThe a\npp\nroach of claim\ning \n90% \nin AR4\n and \nin AR5\n \n95% probabili\nties \nof confidence in belief of this and that \nis bizarre, increasing \nthe IPCC’s confidence \nas \nt\nhe divergence\n between models and re\nality increased. The probablity figures have \nnothing to do with scien\ntific o\nr statistical methodology\n,\n but \nall to do with \npolitics \n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?\n&#xa0;\n              \nNo – it attempted to finesse \ntheir \ninaccuracy\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?\n&#xa0;\n              \nNo – it fudged\n the issue\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? \n&#xa0;\n              \nWeaken, if not \neliminate\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nWhat implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis repo\nrt have for policy making both nationally and internationally? \n&#xa0;\n              \nIt should have\n little either nationally or internationally because \nit \ndoes not make a scientific (as opposed to PR) case \nfor \nACW\n&#xa0;\n9.\n              \nIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing \nscientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?\n&#xa0;\n              \nNo to the first sentence; yes to the second\n&#xa0;\n10.\n              \nTo what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis s\nummary? \n&#xa0;\n              \nIt i\ns a political document like its predecessors\n,\n \ncrawled over by officials from various governments \n&#xa0;\n11.\n              \nIs the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? \n&#xa0;\n              \nMost inappropriate\n because the conclusions drawn \nfrom \nthe science are so weak\n&#xa0;12.\n              \nWhat relevance do \nthe IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? \n&#xa0;\nTHE VERY COSTLY GREEN/DECARBONISING AGENDA IS NEITHER PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS BASIC OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS:-&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nNOR WILL OUR EFFORT DO MUCH IF ANYTHING TO SAVE THE PLANET.  Britain emits about 1.2% of the world’s greenhouse gases. \nAlthough we may virtually eliminate the 30\n Mtoe of coal\n we used in power plants in 2012, between 2001-09 the use of coal in China and India increased by 967Mtoe\n and is forecast to increase by a further 3300TWh p.a. by 2035, which is about 30 times the current output of Britain’s coal plants (109TWh in 2011). \nA\ns Peter Lilley MP pointed out in a recent speech in Westminster Hall, the increase in China’s CO2 emissions in 2011 was 200Mt more than the total emitted by the UK\n. In \na presentation on \n14 October 2013\n to the World Energy Congress Wood Mackenzie forecast\n that global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25% by the end of the decade slightly overtaking oil\n on energy source.  \nWhile the British government is obsessed with driving unabated coal plants off the system, ten 900MW new coal plants are being completed in Germany and the Netherlands.  \n&#xa0;\n              \nThe lunatics really are running the asylum now – and \nincompetent\n lunatics in DECC do not care a jot for the customers’ pockets.\n&#xa0;\nThe carbon budgeting process and the Climate Change Committee should be scrapped as an irrelevant waste of money.&#xa0;BOTH THE IPCC AND THE CCC HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE A SOUND ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF CLIMAT SCIENCE.  WE NEED A TRULY INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT UNDERTAKEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO VESTED COMMERCIAL OR REPUTATIONAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME.&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nI studied engineering at the universities of \nBristol\n and \nVirginia\n and some economics at the LSE.  I wa\ns on the board of London Electricity.  In  February \n1987 \nI was \nthe first person in \nBritain\n to propose a competitive restructuring of the electric industry\n.  Following the election of June 1987 I \nwas involved with \nSecretary of State \nCecil Parkinson and civi\nl servants\n in the early days of restructuring.  Subs\nequently\n I have \nworked on electric markets from \nNorway\n to \nNew Zealand\n via \nNorth America\n.  I wrote \n“\nThe British Electric Industry 1990-2010: the rise and demise of competition”\n.\n \n My interest in climate sci\nence was stimulated by the effect it has had on the British government’s belief in anthropogenic climate warming, which has led to very expensive policies for renewables and nuclear power.\n The Neg\nle\ncted Sun published by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian \nLüning.\n See “Wind – \nWhitehall\n’s pointless profligacy” by Alex Henney and Fred Udo (and other papers).\n \nIn \n2007 Mr. Justice Burton in \nLondon\n identified nine factual errors in Gore’s video and book “An inconvenient truth”, and commented the film was used \n“to make a political statement and to support a political programme”.\n One false claim was that there was a \nreduction in the population of polar bears when in fact there has been an increase, see \nvarious blogs on polarbearsscience.com. \n Memorandum by Prof\nessor Paul Reiter, Institut Pasteur, Paris to the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs, The Economics of Climate Change, 31 March 2005, \nHL Paper No. 12-II\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/gw_hurricanes/\n. \n The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken For the World’s Top Climate Expert.\n See Annex 1 of \na\n submission to the Science and Technology Committee Inquiry into “Climate: public understanding and it\ns policy implications”, Alex Henney, 2013.\n \nJohn Christy is Professor of Atmospheric Science and Director of the \nEarth\n \nSystem\n \nScience\n \nCenter\n at the \nUniversity\n of \nAlabama\n in \nHuntsville\n, and is \nAlabama\n’s State Climatologist.
