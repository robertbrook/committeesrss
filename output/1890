defaultThe 
defaultEnvironment Agency is the principal environmental regulator in England. As part
default of our role we consider the impacts
default of climate risks in our work including
default manage 
defaultflood risk and coastal erosion management, 
defaultsafeguard
defaulting
default water resources and protect
defaulting
default the water and wetland environment. 
defaultWe have a new role to provide advice and support t
defaulto help businesses, public sector and other organisations adapt to a changing climate (this is known as the Climate Ready Support Service). The role is for England but the products generated are available across the UK.
defaultWe also
default administrate
default 
defaultthe economic in
defaultc
defaultentive schemes such as the EU Emissions Trading System, the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and Climate Change Agreements. We do not have any direct influence over the remaining emissions from homes and surface transport such as cars and trains.
defaultOur engagemen
defaultt is generally with and through partners and trusted inter
defaultmediaries. We work 
defaultclosely with Government bodies such as Natural England, Public Health England and the Met Office, through trade and professional bodies, and with local authorities and local resil
defaultience fora. 
defaultA
defaultudience 
defaultneeds vary considerably and we
default adjust our messages
default accordingly
default. Messages that focus on climate impacts such as flooding 
defaultare better understood 
defaultthan those concerned with climate science.  We have found that using more active language, 
defaultsuch as ‘adapting to a changing climate’ and being ‘Climate Ready’ helps audiences to move on from the idea of climate change being remote and something they need to believe in, to needing to take action now.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultOur Climate Ready Support Service
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur Climate Ready Support Service provides
default online advice, a help desk and 
defaulttailored support to help organisati
defaultons adapt to 
defaultextremes of weather and 
defaultthe changing climate. We operate the service for England only, but our tools and resources are available online for use across the UK.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe service focuses on priority risks and sectors in the National Adaptation Programme, published by government in July 2013. It is therefore aimed at organisations rather than the general public. The priority sectors for the service are: local government,
default the built environment, the natural environment, infrastructure, health and wellbeing, agriculture and forestry, business and services. 
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe service aims to build climate resilience in these sectors and organisations. We are clear that that the purpose of our advice is 
defaultto help organisations
default understand how a changing climate affects their interest
defaults and how they can take actions to avoid and 
defaultreduce the consequences.
default   
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur advice is delivered with and through other government delivery bodies, service providers and sector representatives. We use existing communication channels and networks where possible to ensure that customers can readily fin
defaultd advice from trusted and familiar sources in a language that they understand.  Our approach is to build capacity in those other organisations rather than to create a dependency on the services of the Environment Agency.  Our advice is tailored to customer
default needs to help them take appropriate action. For the majority of 
defaultorganisations
default, this means thinking first and foremost about their organisation rather than climate science.
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe provide access on behalf of Defra to the UK Climate Projections, which provide t
defaulthe latest information on how the UK climate may change. We 
defaultalso work with researchers and R
defaultesearch Councils through the ‘Living With Environmental 
defaultChange’
default (
defaultLWEC)
default programme to summarise 
defaultevidence on future climate impacts. 
defaultLWEC
default is producing a series of repor
defaultts that summarise impacts for policy makers and businesses. These are designed to be accessible to lay audiences, though are not specifically aimed at the general public.
default&#xa0;
defaultInteractions with Local Government
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe work closely wit
defaulth local government through 
defaultour
default Climate Ready Support Service and 
defaultour 
defaultwider roles. We have supported the Local Government Association’s ‘Climate Local’ initiative with staff secondments. The initiative supports councils’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to improve their resilience
default to future climate through sharing information and developing action plans. Seventy-three councils have joined the initiative to date.
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe provide adaptation training to councils, including a learning aid for councillors on the roles, opportunities and driv
defaulters for council led action
default on climate change. We will
default run training events in the autumn/winter 
default2013/14 
defaultfor local authorities to promote available information and resources.
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe support the Local Adaptation Advisory Panel, which brings together local authori
defaultties, government departments and delivery bodies to understand what support councils need to adapt to future climate. This is a key mechanism for local government to feedback to central government on adaptation legislation, policy and delivery programmes. 
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are helping to develop practical tools to promote local adaptation. This includes working with Climate UK to make Kent County Council’s ‘Severe Weather Impacts Monitoring System’ available to all local authorities, helping them to record the impacts of
default severe weather on their services and aid future service planning.
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also provide
default support to councils and their partnerships through our local advisory and statutory planning role. This includes Local Nature Partnerships and Local Enterprise Partnerships,
default who we work with on major developments and support in producing European Structural and Investment Fund Strategies.
default&#xa0;
defaultWorking through Climate Change Partnerships
default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal delivery of our Climate Ready Support Service is provided by working in partnership with a network of Climate Change Partnerships, through their Climate UK umbrella organisation. The Partnerships work through stakeholder networks to share learning an
defaultd build local climate resilience in businesses, local government, and communities. They have close relationships with business organisations such as Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, as well as with utilities, banks, insurers, lo
defaultcal authorities, community engagement groups, tourism bodies, universities, and industry associations. 
default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Partnerships promote and support practical adaptation action. Recent examples include: 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorking with local communities to map vulnerable and resilie
defaultnt road networks.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProviding county councils and their local partners with an online system for logging the costs (in money and reputation) of extreme weather on an ongoing basis.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloping an accredited qualification in Business Resilience, and testing it
default with 150 small businesses.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRunning business resilience training days, including a Business Resilience Health Check, for businesses regulated by the Environment Agency.
default&#xa0;
defaultWorking with other government bodies
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have worked closely with lead government departments to develop the aims of the Climate Ready programme, particularly the Departments of Health; Business Innovation and Skills; Communities and Local Government; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and t
defaulthe Cabinet Office. 
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn delivering the programme we work closely with other agencies and delivery bodies, especially the Met Office, Natural England and the Forestry Commission. Examples of working with other Government bodies include:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEstablishing a delive
defaultry group f
defaultor 
defaulthealth sector resilience with 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS Sustainable Development Unit, Public Health England and 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health, which is supporting Health and Wellbeing Boards to develop local climate risk assessment and action plans.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWorking with the
default National Flood Forum and Cabinet Office to develop local resilience case studies. These document the actions of four community groups to help increase their resilience ag
defaultainst flooding and other weather
default events. The group in Calderdale use social media and
default web content to engage the local community and increase resilience during extreme events. 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRunning workshops for local transport authorities, such as local authority highways teams and ambulance services, to understand and manage risks to their services fr
defaultom extreme weather.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunication through our wider flood and coastal management role
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe work with our partners to help the public and communities understand their risk of flooding, which can involve consideration of climate change when thinking over the 
defaultlong term.
default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe aim to raise their awareness of flood risk and encourage people to take action to protect themselves and their property so they are better prepared for flooding. This may include them checking their flood risk on our flood map, signing up to 
defaultour free warning service - Floodline Warnings Direct - or preparing a personal flood plan. We also look to improve flood response at a community level by holding community meetings and workshops, promoting community led flood action groups, and working wit
defaulth communities to establish community flood plans.
default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe issue flood warnings to the public, businesses and the emergency services to help them prepare and respond to floods. In March 2013, 62% of properties in the highest flood risk areas received our direct 
defaultflood warnings, up from 60% at the end of 2011/12. Research carried out in 2013 found that our communications are effective in helping people to understand that preparing for flooding is worthwhile. Almost nine out of ten customers who are signed up to our
default free flood warning service and who had previously received a flood warning said that flood warnings are easy to understand, two-thirds agreed that flood warnings are accurate and half take action when a flood warning is issued.
default18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFrom October to November 20
default12 we ran a flood action campaign which aimed to change behaviours and encourage people to accept risk and take action
default:
default 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur website had 650,000 unique users during the campaign – a 150% increase compared to the same period in 2011/12.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver 4,000 people si
defaultgned up for flood warnings as a result of the campaign
default.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlmost 2,000 people downloaded flood plans in direct response to the campaign adverts.
default19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClimate change projections indicate rising sea levels and increasingly severe and frequent rainstorms, resulting in a greater risk of flooding.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCoastal Communities 2150 
default20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Coastal Communities 2150 project helps 
defaultcommunities to 
defaultdevelop visions for 
defaultmanaging their long term risks from coastal
default and climate change to
default 2150 and beyond. The project is a partnership between the Environment Agency, Kent and Hampshire County Councils and partners in Belgium and Holland. It is funded by the European INTERREG bo
defaultdy.
default21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Environment Agency is working in Newhaven, Seaford and Lewes in East Sussex, and has developed successful local engagement groups that are supported by town and parish councils. Kent County Council is working in Margate, the Isle Sheppey and the Ro
defaultmney Marshes. Hampshire County Council is engaging at 6 sites around the Solent.  
default22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic interest has been higher than expected and is driven by the desire to shape long term community plans. The UK partners have found it easier to form local public engag
defaultement groups than the Dutch or Belgians, who have encountered a public attitude that ‘the government have always dealt with this - so why should I get involved?’
default23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent extreme weather events such as the droughts and floods in 2012 and Hurricane Sandy in N
defaultew York seem to have contributed to general public acceptance that weather events have become more extreme and communities should prepare for more to come.
default 
defaultThe 150 year time frame has not been a problem for the public or businesses, who seem generally conc
defaulterned with leaving a sustainable legacy for future generations.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe a
defaultudiences are
default usually 
defaultinterested in clim
defaultate change only to the extent that it affects their interests. They find it easier and more worthwhile to engage when risks are
default framed in familiar terms. We find it is
default more producti
defaultve to focus on relevant impacts such as flooding and drought.
default 
default25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe find it h
defaultelpful to take a people-first or organisation-first perspective
default.
default 
default 
defaultThis involves thinking about how they are affected by current weather, and then how such vulnerabilities could increase in the future. This allows them to consider their adaptation needs wit
defaulthout having to engage with complex science
default.
default 
default26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore expert audiences such as utilities are comfortable talking about climate change and appreciate to the need to adapt. However, they 
defaultare 
defaultalso primarily interested in the impacts of climate change rather than 
defaultthe climate itself. 
default 
defaultA lack of relevant information is often cited as a barrier to action, with organisations finding it difficult to translate climate projections into the more relevant impact assessments that they need to inform adaptation decisions. 
default27.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default have undertaken market surveys to understand how potential customers for our Climate Ready Support Service
default,
default 
defaultincluding
default 
defaultorganisations in the
default, business, local government, infrastructure, built environment, health, natural environ
defaultment, agriculture and 
defaultforestry sectors,
default 
defaultengage with climate adaptation, and what language resonates with them. In summary, this shows that:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOrganisations are more familiar with climate cha
defaultnge mitigation than adaptation 
defaultand are more likely to be acting to mitigate climate change
default.  The reasons for this include: greater understanding of how to act; actions are associated with cost savings; they can apply tangible, measurable, specific targets; and existing regulation.  By contrast adaptation tends to have a lower profile and is ass
defaultociated with more barriers to action.  
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen thinking specifically about environmental risks there is relatively high awareness of climate change among the target audience and organisations perceive it to be the top environmental risk (as important as envi
defaultronmental regulation/compliance).  Organisations also identify the impacts of climate change as key risks (e.g. flooding, droughts, heat-wave
defaults, 
defaultand extreme weather).  29%
default of organisations believe they have already been affected by climate change a great de
defaultal and a further 
default39% 
defaultbelieve that they have been affected a little. The target audience are most likely to think they will be affected by disruptions to staff (63%), 
defaultall
default 
defaultimpact on logistics (60%), and all
default impact on premises or infrastructure (58%).
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe m
defaultaj
defaultority of organisations have
default a strategic approach 
defaultto 
defaultrisk management as part of their normal business planning, and so can manage climate risks within that process rather than separately.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOrganisations commonly cite barriers to adaptation that include: miti
defaultgation taking priority over adaptation; 
defaultshort-term focus is prioritised
default 
default(
defaultadaptation is perceived to be long-term); a lack of understanding of the business case (the financial argument); economic pressures; lack of knowledge, capacity, finances and time; la
defaultck of confidence in the science and difficulty dealing with probabilities.
default28.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt can also be effective to focus on adaptation actions (solutions) rather than climate (uncertain problems). In many cases, no- or low-regret actions can be taken that make sense r
defaultegardless of future climate. For example, businesses can benefit from simple water efficiency measures or registering for our flood warning service irrespective of how the climate changes.
