default&#xa0;default1.      default              defaultWhy anddefault how I am involveddefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI am Tina Hughes, mother of Olivia Bazlinton who was killed at Elsenham Station level crossing in December 2005 with her friend Charlie Thomson. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI have been working with Network Rail since Sept
defaultember
default 2006 to raise awareness of level crossing risk and in March 2011 
defaultSir 
defaultDavid Higgins, then newly appointed 
defaultChief Executive
default, asked me to become Level Crossing User Champion which gave me access to the newly formed National Level Crossing Team and through the
defaultm to a wide audience within Network Rail to help 
defaultthat 
defaultteam embed the changes being introduced
default. I do this by 
defaultgiving a personal account of the failures 
defaultthat 
defaultled to 
defaultOlivia
default's death, and the impact this has had
default;
default and 
defaulttherefore, 
defaultwhy N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default must change. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.        A brief background of what was exposed through the Elsenham case default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe girls were coming back across the level crossing having bought their tickets.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThey misunderstood the lights and audible warnings, believing they were for the train t
defaulth
defaultey had waited at the gate for - 
defaultthe train they intended to catch. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThey stepped onto the crossing the 
defaultvery 
defaultsecond that their train would have cleared the warnings but were hit by a Stansted Express train on the other track.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultN
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail’s immedia
defaultte public response
default 
defaultwas 
defaultthat the crossing was safe if used correctly.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultO
defaultn the accident form completed a few days after the accident 
defaultN
defaultetwork Rail 
defaultdescribed the girls as 
default“
defaulttres
defaultpassers
default”
default 
defaultdespite knowing that
default they had purchased tickets and hence were passenge
defaultrs. This illustrates a culture where blame is directed to users with little consideration of facts.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultA previous fatal accident in 1989, in almost identical circumstances at Elsenham, had resulted in HMRI instructions for a second train coming warning -
default this had never been installed. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default              
defaultRisk assessments at the crossing had wrongly revealed very low scores but these had not been properly completed. Immediately after the accident a careful retrospective risk assessment showed a much higher score, but on
defaulte that still enabled N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default to continue to say that the crossing did not need to have been changed. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default              
defaultEven that score was disputed as too low by HSE
default, who prepared a
default report prepared for the Inq
defaultu
defaultest into the girls
default’
default death
defaults. They
default suggested that the r
defaultisk was much higher than even the second assessment and that risk management
default at level crossings
default in general in N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default wa
defaults very poor. This report was su
defaultpressed by N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default's legal team following a pre-
defaultI
defaultnquest meeting and 
defaultsubsequently 
defaultthe Coroner wo
defaultuld not allow any evidence 
defaultthat expressed concern about 
defaultrisk assessment
defaults
default to be raised at the girls' Inquest. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default9
default              
defaultFollowing the Inquest, H
defaulter 
defaultM
defaultajesty’s 
defaultR
defaultailway 
defaultI
defaultnspectorate
default advised tha
defaultt they were too busy with other
default cases
default (mainly derailments) 
defaultto prosecute 
defaultN
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail. T
defaulthe opportunity to use evidence of poor risk management 
defaultto facilitate change 
defaultwas missed.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default10
default              
defaultDuring the 18 months following the Inquest, I heard N
defaultetwork Rail 
defaultrepeat the phrase "it's a perfectly safe crossing if used correctly" many times wh
defaulten responding to 
defaultquestions about 
defaultdeaths on crossings. 
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default              
defaultI knew that Elsenham had been far from a safe crossing when this phrase had been used (indeed N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default had installed a footbridge and magnetic signal-based locks on the gates within two years
default) 
defaultso 
defaultI decided I could not leave things unchallenged and 
defaultdetermined
default to take a civil case against N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default to prove them negligent and try to raise awareness with someone (their regulator or perhaps N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default 
defaultit
defaultsel
defaultf
default) that something needed to change.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default12
default              
defaultA risk expert reviewed our case and Counsel agreed to take the case to Court.  
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default3
default              
defaultFrustratingly, after almost two years and within a few months of my planned public exposure of the
defaultir negligence
default on the Court steps, N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default decided to settle o
defaultut of Court and therefore avoid any damaging publicity. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default14
default              
defaultA few weeks later, upon return of my papers from the solicitors, I discovered a risk assessment that has been disclosed
default to my solicitor
default by N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default during 
defaultour case, 
defaultbut 
defaultthis had not been se
defaulten
default previously
default during the accident investigations or Inquest. This 
defaultrisk 
defaultassessment from 2003 advised that the gates 
defaultat Elsenham 
defaultshould be locked when trains were approaching. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default15
default              
defaultIn February 2011, The Times published an article about 
defaultthe 
defaultfailure of Netwo
defaultrk Rail to 
defaultdi
defaults
defaultclose this important document to the rail accident investigators 
defaultand to 
defaultthe Coroner
default.
default N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail 
defaultpublicly 
defaultstated that this document had been 
defaultdisclosed 
defaultand disingenuously suggested the families were mistaken. However, the 
defaultOffice of Rail 
defaultRegulation (
defaultORR
default)
default and Transport Select Committee had picked up this information and started asking questions of 
defaultSir 
defaultDavid Higgins, the newly appointed C
defaulthief Executive
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default16
default              
defaultSir 
defaultDavid Higgins advised the T
defaultransport 
defaultS
defaultelect 
defaultC
defaultommittee, in February 2011,
default that h
defaulte would make full disclosure to the families. However, when we met him a
default 
defaultfew weeks later, the 
default‘
defaultfull disclosure
default’
default file he handed over, prepared by N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default's legal team did not even include the recently discovered risk assessment! 
default&#xa0;
default2.17
default              
defaultMuch to the dism
defaultay of Network Rail's Chairman, the ORR re
default-
defaultopened the investigation into Elsenham and 
defaultwhen forensic examination was proposed 
defaultseveral 
defaultother
default 
defaultdamni
defaultng documents came to light
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default18
default              
defaultIt 
defaultbecame 
defaultclear that some people in Network Rail were aware of the very real r
defaultisks at Elsenham - one 
defaultof these 
defaultdocument
defaults
default, a memo written in
default 2001 described exactly how the accident at El
defaults
defaultenham would happen.
default 
defaultIt was 
defaultheart breaking
default to read.
default&#xa0;
default2.19
default              
defaultWe have proof that one very damning memo was in the hands of Network Rail’s legal department
default even before the ‘full disclose’ file was created and long before it was handed over to Sir David Higgins.  They are withheld information from their Chief Executive. The non-disclosure of these documents to us in our civil case was contempt of Court.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default20
default              
defaultThe ORR investigation identified:
default&#xa0;
default2.
default2
default1
default              
defaultORR eventually prosecuted Network Rail in March 2012
default and they pleaded guilty
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default2
default2
default              
defaultI feel it is worth quoting a short paragraph from Justice T
defaulturner
default’s summing up of the case: 
default&#xa0;
default“I have concluded here that there 
defaultwas a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed and act upon available information and earlier specific warnings.  That prevailed over a worrying number of years.  
defaultThere was a consistent underplaying of the significance that this cr
defaultossing was being regularly misused.  There was a consequent failure to take timely remedial action.  What emerges from a consideration of the totality of the material available to me is a narrative of culpable corporate blindness and complacency going beyo
defaultnd the merely inefficient, sub optimal or even occasionally incompetent but entering the realm of criminal failure as the guilty pleas concede.  In short, warnings went unheeded.  Data was insufficiently appraised.  Critical questions went unasked and unan
defaultswered.  Remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed.  Narrow thinking and a culpable failure to appreciate the actual high levels of abuse at Elsenham meant that a key indicator there was missed,
default 
defaultoverlooked and that serious failure was sustained.” 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default3
default              
defaultBut Network Rail seems to think it is above the law and paying fines for deaths caused by their negligence is a painless penalty – it is after all the return of funds back to the Treasury.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default4
default              
defaultIt was quite a relief to finally hear these words spoken in
default Court and to know that Network Rail had a criminal conviction and a 
defaultR
defaultegulator who had already started to ensure that changes would happen. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.default              defaultWhat has changed?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultSir 
defaultDavid 
defaultHiggins arrived at Network Rail
default just as the 
defaultmedia
default exposed the w
defaultithheld 
defaultdocuments
default in February 2011
default. 
defaultA few weeks later he 
defaultmet with us
default, to hand over all the documents relevant to Elsenham
default (as promised to this Committee
default)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default2
default              
defaultIn the following weeks
default 
defaulthe realised the significant 
defaultrisk 
defaultthat level crossings posed 
defaultcorporately 
defaultand the improvements in safety that could be made. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultI expressed my desire to help and he asked me to become 'user champion' - a role that would demonstrate a change in attitude by Network Rail. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default4
default              
defaultHe facilitated a budget of £130m and gave the job o
defaultf setting up the team to deliver changes to level crossing risk management, safety enhancements and process improvements to Martin Gallagher
default, who had already been working on improvements in this field but with little support corporately. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default5
default              
defaultDespite pres
defaultsure from the C
defaulthief Executive
default, t
defaulthere has b
defaulteen considerable resistance within 
defaultsome areas at 
defaulthigh-
defaultlevel management, particularly with
defaultin
default Operations, to this work
default; 
defaultbut the team eventually settled into achieving significant progress. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default6
default              
defaultI
defaultn the two and a half
default years since they started work, I
default have been very impressed by the 
defaultprogress made
default by the National Level Crossing Team and the changes that they have been able to make in this previously neglected area. 
defaultI will not go into what has been delivered to date, as I
default am sure that this will be detailed in Network Rail's own submission. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default7
default              
defaultOne of the major changes that I believe is
default 
defaultand will 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultmake the most significant difference is the introduction of Level Crossing Managers.
default 
defaultThese people have a remit to 
defaultbecome familiar with
default the level crossings assigned to them - they each have around 70 - and will be proactive in reducing the risks and following through actions so that issues will be dealt 
defaultwith. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default8
default              
defaultL
defaultevel crossings are 
defaultinherently 
defaultdangerous and the inter
defaultface between the railway and road or footpath users will inevitably lead to accidents as humans do make errors of judgement - sometimes deliberately but often while distracted - but at least when they do 
defaultso, Network Rail 
defaultcan be open and honest about what t
defaulthey have done to reduce the risk or be able to defend why the crossing 
defaultremains open
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.default              defaultBut there is much to do...default&#xa0;defaultRoute level deviationsdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultDespite the 
defaultNational Level Crossing Team’s 
defaulteffort to analyse the requirements for Level Crossing Managers
default, 
defaultth
defaulte devolution of responsibility to the routes and the emphasis on cost cutting, 
defaulthas resulted in 
defaultnot all of the recommendations being implemented across the board. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultOne route, LNE, with little evidence of why, decided to 
defaultunder resource 
defaultthe
default number of L
defaultev
defaultel 
defaultC
defaultrossing 
defaultM
defaultanager
defaults by 25%. This 
defaultsignificant under resourcing leaves th
defaultat particular 
defaultteam stret
defaultched – some with almost double the 
defaultaverage 
defaultnumber of crossings to manage - and feeling that they can
defaultnot provide the level of care and attention this important w
defaultork deserves. I am due to 
defaultchallenge this decision with 
defaultthe 
defaultLNE 
defaultroute managing director
default in October. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStill reactive to accidents and not pro-activedefault&#xa0;
default4.
default3
default              
defaultNetwork Rail
default,
default and it
defaults
default predecessors
default,
default have always bee
defaultn good at reacting to accidents -
default putting right something that is found to be a significant factor 
defaultafter the event
default. For example, the subsequent replacing of the type of crossing that allowed a signaller to raise the barriers at Moreton-on-Lugg 
defaultwhen 
defaulta train that had not yet been through 
defaultthe crossing when the barrier was raised
default and a car passenger was killed
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default4
default              
defaultI was appalled that the 
defaultLevel Crossing Keeper 
defaultwas also prosecuted in this case. He had been dealing with 
defaultsomeone
default on the phone who wanted to 
defaultmove 
defaulta herd of sheep 
defaultover 
defaultanother cro
defaultssing and 
defaultthe Crossing Keeper 
defaultthought he had left the barriers down after the train had passed while he was 
defaultmaking arrangements
default with this farmer. The system operated by Network Rail 
defaultat Moreton-on-
defaultLugg 
defaultshould never have allowed 
defaulthim
default to raise the barriers whe
defaultn the train was already within the crossing zone - there was no 'are you sure?' or failsafe system to protect crossing users, or the 
defaultCrossing Keeper
default, from making
default this fatal error. There is now and all crossings of this type are now being upgraded. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default5
default              
defaultI
default believe that as the L
defaultevel 
defaultC
defaultrossing 
defaultM
defaultanager
defaults do their job through the 
defaultfull 
defaultrisk assessment cycle
default,
default these risks will be identified and methods devised to remove or reduce the risk in a proactive way. At the moment they are still in their first year 
defaultof operat
defaultion 
defaultand playing catch up. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default5.default              defaultAnd going forward...default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultPerhaps my biggest concern is recent changes that are being undertaken
default; 
defaulteven before 
defaultSir 
defaultDavid Higgins leaves the company. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultAlthough it not the Committee, nor my business to intervene in the wor
defaultking of Network Rail and how it manages it’s human resources functions, I feel I must advise of the risk posed by what seems to me some rather unwise decisions. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultHaving established a highly successful team to deliver the significant changes that have 
defaultbeen seen in the last two and a half years, the National Level Crossing Team have been subjected to some partially implemented and then apparently withdrawn changes. It was announced recently that this team would be split between Safety and Programmes with
defaultin Operations but th
defaulten
default seems to have been reversed following ORR intervention, h
defaultowever the team have been unnec
defaultessarily demoralised and the Head of that team, Martin Gallagher, (whose qualities ORR described in a recent review as "needing to be bottled") s
defaulteems to me to be being pushed out of the organisation. Does professional jealousy win the day? Sadly, I believe 
defaultthat to be the case
default.
default 
defaultBut w
defaulthat a loss of 
defaulthome-grown
default talent!
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultAs one might expect following such a shambolic re-organisation, where the team,
default nor the Head of the team, was consulted, there is now a significant risk of the skilled and experienced resource leaving the company. This is very short-sighted. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default5
default              
defaultWithout the collaborative working established by this team to improving processes, 
defaultinnovation in technology to move away from signal-based (expens
defaultive
default and time consuming) methods, and culture changing - leading by example that has been established and proven by this team, the changes made 
defaultare in danger of 
defaultslip
defaultping
default back and level crossings
default will once again be neglected. 
defaultI believe that the continuing cultural issues played out at senior management level are posing a serious 
defaultthreat to this on
default-
defaultgoing work
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.
default6
default              
defaultI believe there 
defaultis a 'we only kill about 10 a year which is better than most other networks' attitude in 
defaultsome areas of 
defaultN
defaultetwork Rail
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default7
default              
defaultI have heard rumour
defaults
default that a new professional role might be established in Asset Management. But Asset Management professional roles a
defaultre histo
defaultrically, obviously, engineering-
defaultbased and my fear is that a Head of Level Crossings in this area will have an emphasis on signalling which will therefore focus on the proportionately small number of signal-based crossings. These crossings are inevi
defaulttably better protected and therefore lower risk than the majority of crossings that will 
defaultin all likelihood
default be neglected
default,
default as signal-based solutions are 
defaultdisproportionately expensive for the calculated risk levels at these crossings. And cost benefit analysis
default i
defaults essential to assist prioritis
defaultation of scarce resource.  
default&#xa0;
default5.
default8
default              
defaultBut all level crossings pose a risk - even a footpath crossing that is only occasionally used is a very high risk if the user happens to be there at the same time as a train. You may rec
defaultall 
defaultthe four girls in the north
defaulteast last year who ran across a "perfectly safe crossing" and one was hit and fortunately only lost
default her arm 
default-
default not her life? 
defaultThe crossing had a sign that says '
defaultYou must 
defaultcall the signaller before crossing' but was otherwise unprote
defaultcted
default on the East Coast mainline where the train was travelling at 125mph. What 12 year old is going to call a signaller? As I suspect m
defaultost 
defaultof us 
defaultwould, the girls looked, 
defaultthought it was safe and crossed - but they, and 
defaultalong with 
defaultmost of
default us, would 
defaultnot 
defaulthave 
defaultthe ability to judge just how quickly a train travelling at 125mph would be upon 
defaultthem
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default9
default              
defaultN
defaultetwork Rail
default have £67m 
defaultbudget allocated 
defaultfor 
defaultCP5, the next five year period, 
defaultto continue to develop innovative means to protect crossings and these remote crossings
default might be easily and relatively inexpensively protected, for example, by vibration-linked signals. N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default needs more funding for this work - they had £130m for only the last 
defaulttwo
default years of CP4. But even if they get additional funding, which they are asking for, without dedicated re
defaults
defaultour
defaultc
defaulte to deliver the work they will not succeed. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default10
default              
defaultMy co
defaultncern about the user-
defaultblaming and back-side covering culture in N
defaultetwork 
defaultR
defaultail
default that I was expo
defaultsed to during my fight for the truth and to get changes made, is one I believe results from a legacy of lack of accountability. When ORR discovered evidence of withholding of evidence from the accident investigators (including the D

defaultf
defaultor

defaults R
defaultail 
defaultA

default) and 
defaultthe 
defaultCoroner
default,
default they decided that rather than expose those individuals that the 
defaultcompany 
defaultmight then use as a scapegoat, they would prosecute 
defaultfor 
defaultthe systemic failings.
default 
defaultI believe that was the right decision. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default11
default              
defaultHowe
defaultver, even 
defaultSir 
defaultDavid Higgins did not have the appetite to deal with the withholding of documents from 
defaulthim, when 
defaultthe 'full disclosure' file he had promised this 
defaultC
defaultommittee he would deliver to us, the families. 
defaultWe have proof that Network Rail
default’s legal departmen
defaultt 
defaultwithheld information from their 
defaultown 
defaultChief Executive. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default2
default              
defaultThe non-disclosure of these documents to us in our civil case was a contempt of Court. Despite this now being exposed I am not confident that the culture has changed
default within the company
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default3
default              
defaultI 
defaultbelieve the way that 
defaultNetwork Rail
default treats people internally 
default- 
defaultcompromise agreemen
defaultts that gag it's outgoing staff
default, lack of information, for example, 
defaultabout why they pleaded guilty 
defaultin 
defaultthe Elsenham case until a groundswell of protest from within required an 
defaultexplanation,
default as well as externally by withholding information and, basically, lying
