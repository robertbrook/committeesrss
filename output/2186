[normal]Written evidence from Tina Hughes (SLC 020)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.      [bold]              [bold]Why and[bold] how I am involved[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I am Tina Hughes, mother of Olivia Bazlinton who was killed at Elsenham Station level crossing in December 2005 with her friend Charlie Thomson. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have been working with Network Rail since Sept
[normal]ember
[normal] 2006 to raise awareness of level crossing risk and in March 2011 
[normal]Sir 
[normal]David Higgins, then newly appointed 
[normal]Chief Executive
[normal], asked me to become Level Crossing User Champion which gave me access to the newly formed National Level Crossing Team and through the
[normal]m to a wide audience within Network Rail to help 
[normal]that 
[normal]team embed the changes being introduced
[normal]. I do this by 
[normal]giving a personal account of the failures 
[normal]that 
[normal]led to 
[normal]Olivia
[normal]'s death, and the impact this has had
[normal];
[normal] and 
[normal]therefore, 
[normal]why N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] must change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.        A brief background of what was exposed through the Elsenham case [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The girls were coming back across the level crossing having bought their tickets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]They misunderstood the lights and audible warnings, believing they were for the train t
[normal]h
[normal]ey had waited at the gate for - 
[normal]the train they intended to catch. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]They stepped onto the crossing the 
[normal]very 
[normal]second that their train would have cleared the warnings but were hit by a Stansted Express train on the other track.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail’s immedia
[normal]te public response
[normal] 
[normal]was 
[normal]that the crossing was safe if used correctly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]O
[normal]n the accident form completed a few days after the accident 
[normal]N
[normal]etwork Rail 
[normal]described the girls as 
[normal]“
[normal]tres
[normal]passers
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]despite knowing that
[normal] they had purchased tickets and hence were passenge
[normal]rs. This illustrates a culture where blame is directed to users with little consideration of facts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]A previous fatal accident in 1989, in almost identical circumstances at Elsenham, had resulted in HMRI instructions for a second train coming warning -
[normal] this had never been installed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]Risk assessments at the crossing had wrongly revealed very low scores but these had not been properly completed. Immediately after the accident a careful retrospective risk assessment showed a much higher score, but on
[normal]e that still enabled N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] to continue to say that the crossing did not need to have been changed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]Even that score was disputed as too low by HSE
[normal], who prepared a
[normal] report prepared for the Inq
[normal]u
[normal]est into the girls
[normal]’
[normal] death
[normal]s. They
[normal] suggested that the r
[normal]isk was much higher than even the second assessment and that risk management
[normal] at level crossings
[normal] in general in N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] wa
[normal]s very poor. This report was su
[normal]pressed by N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal]'s legal team following a pre-
[normal]I
[normal]nquest meeting and 
[normal]subsequently 
[normal]the Coroner wo
[normal]uld not allow any evidence 
[normal]that expressed concern about 
[normal]risk assessment
[normal]s
[normal] to be raised at the girls' Inquest. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]Following the Inquest, H
[normal]er 
[normal]M
[normal]ajesty’s 
[normal]R
[normal]ailway 
[normal]I
[normal]nspectorate
[normal] advised tha
[normal]t they were too busy with other
[normal] cases
[normal] (mainly derailments) 
[normal]to prosecute 
[normal]N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail. T
[normal]he opportunity to use evidence of poor risk management 
[normal]to facilitate change 
[normal]was missed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]During the 18 months following the Inquest, I heard N
[normal]etwork Rail 
[normal]repeat the phrase "it's a perfectly safe crossing if used correctly" many times wh
[normal]en responding to 
[normal]questions about 
[normal]deaths on crossings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]              
[normal]I knew that Elsenham had been far from a safe crossing when this phrase had been used (indeed N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] had installed a footbridge and magnetic signal-based locks on the gates within two years
[normal]) 
[normal]so 
[normal]I decided I could not leave things unchallenged and 
[normal]determined
[normal] to take a civil case against N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] to prove them negligent and try to raise awareness with someone (their regulator or perhaps N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] 
[normal]it
[normal]sel
[normal]f
[normal]) that something needed to change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]12
[normal]              
[normal]A risk expert reviewed our case and Counsel agreed to take the case to Court.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Frustratingly, after almost two years and within a few months of my planned public exposure of the
[normal]ir negligence
[normal] on the Court steps, N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] decided to settle o
[normal]ut of Court and therefore avoid any damaging publicity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]14
[normal]              
[normal]A few weeks later, upon return of my papers from the solicitors, I discovered a risk assessment that has been disclosed
[normal] to my solicitor
[normal] by N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] during 
[normal]our case, 
[normal]but 
[normal]this had not been se
[normal]en
[normal] previously
[normal] during the accident investigations or Inquest. This 
[normal]risk 
[normal]assessment from 2003 advised that the gates 
[normal]at Elsenham 
[normal]should be locked when trains were approaching. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]15
[normal]              
[normal]In February 2011, The Times published an article about 
[normal]the 
[normal]failure of Netwo
[normal]rk Rail to 
[normal]di
[normal]s
[normal]close this important document to the rail accident investigators 
[normal]and to 
[normal]the Coroner
[normal].
[normal] N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail 
[normal]publicly 
[normal]stated that this document had been 
[normal]disclosed 
[normal]and disingenuously suggested the families were mistaken. However, the 
[normal]Office of Rail 
[normal]Regulation (
[normal]ORR
[normal])
[normal] and Transport Select Committee had picked up this information and started asking questions of 
[normal]Sir 
[normal]David Higgins, the newly appointed C
[normal]hief Executive
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]16
[normal]              
[normal]Sir 
[normal]David Higgins advised the T
[normal]ransport 
[normal]S
[normal]elect 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee, in February 2011,
[normal] that h
[normal]e would make full disclosure to the families. However, when we met him a
[normal] 
[normal]few weeks later, the 
[normal]‘
[normal]full disclosure
[normal]’
[normal] file he handed over, prepared by N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal]'s legal team did not even include the recently discovered risk assessment! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.17
[normal]              
[normal]Much to the dism
[normal]ay of Network Rail's Chairman, the ORR re
[normal]-
[normal]opened the investigation into Elsenham and 
[normal]when forensic examination was proposed 
[normal]several 
[normal]other
[normal] 
[normal]damni
[normal]ng documents came to light
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]18
[normal]              
[normal]It 
[normal]became 
[normal]clear that some people in Network Rail were aware of the very real r
[normal]isks at Elsenham - one 
[normal]of these 
[normal]document
[normal]s
[normal], a memo written in
[normal] 2001 described exactly how the accident at El
[normal]s
[normal]enham would happen.
[normal] 
[normal]It was 
[normal]heart breaking
[normal] to read.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.19
[normal]              
[normal]We have proof that one very damning memo was in the hands of Network Rail’s legal department
[normal] even before the ‘full disclose’ file was created and long before it was handed over to Sir David Higgins.  They are withheld information from their Chief Executive. The non-disclosure of these documents to us in our civil case was contempt of Court.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]20
[normal]              
[normal]The ORR investigation identified:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]2
[normal]1
[normal]              
[normal]ORR eventually prosecuted Network Rail in March 2012
[normal] and they pleaded guilty
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]2
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]I feel it is worth quoting a short paragraph from Justice T
[normal]urner
[normal]’s summing up of the case: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“I have concluded here that there 
[normal]was a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed and act upon available information and earlier specific warnings.  That prevailed over a worrying number of years.  
[normal]There was a consistent underplaying of the significance that this cr
[normal]ossing was being regularly misused.  There was a consequent failure to take timely remedial action.  What emerges from a consideration of the totality of the material available to me is a narrative of culpable corporate blindness and complacency going beyo
[normal]nd the merely inefficient, sub optimal or even occasionally incompetent but entering the realm of criminal failure as the guilty pleas concede.  In short, warnings went unheeded.  Data was insufficiently appraised.  Critical questions went unasked and unan
[normal]swered.  Remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed.  Narrow thinking and a culpable failure to appreciate the actual high levels of abuse at Elsenham meant that a key indicator there was missed,
[normal] 
[normal]overlooked and that serious failure was sustained.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]But Network Rail seems to think it is above the law and paying fines for deaths caused by their negligence is a painless penalty – it is after all the return of funds back to the Treasury.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]It was quite a relief to finally hear these words spoken in
[normal] Court and to know that Network Rail had a criminal conviction and a 
[normal]R
[normal]egulator who had already started to ensure that changes would happen. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]What has changed?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Sir 
[normal]David 
[normal]Higgins arrived at Network Rail
[normal] just as the 
[normal]media
[normal] exposed the w
[normal]ithheld 
[normal]documents
[normal] in February 2011
[normal]. 
[normal]A few weeks later he 
[normal]met with us
[normal], to hand over all the documents relevant to Elsenham
[normal] (as promised to this Committee
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]In the following weeks
[normal] 
[normal]he realised the significant 
[normal]risk 
[normal]that level crossings posed 
[normal]corporately 
[normal]and the improvements in safety that could be made. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]I expressed my desire to help and he asked me to become 'user champion' - a role that would demonstrate a change in attitude by Network Rail. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]He facilitated a budget of £130m and gave the job o
[normal]f setting up the team to deliver changes to level crossing risk management, safety enhancements and process improvements to Martin Gallagher
[normal], who had already been working on improvements in this field but with little support corporately. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Despite pres
[normal]sure from the C
[normal]hief Executive
[normal], t
[normal]here has b
[normal]een considerable resistance within 
[normal]some areas at 
[normal]high-
[normal]level management, particularly with
[normal]in
[normal] Operations, to this work
[normal]; 
[normal]but the team eventually settled into achieving significant progress. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]n the two and a half
[normal] years since they started work, I
[normal] have been very impressed by the 
[normal]progress made
[normal] by the National Level Crossing Team and the changes that they have been able to make in this previously neglected area. 
[normal]I will not go into what has been delivered to date, as I
[normal] am sure that this will be detailed in Network Rail's own submission. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]One of the major changes that I believe is
[normal] 
[normal]and will 
[normal]continue to 
[normal]make the most significant difference is the introduction of Level Crossing Managers.
[normal] 
[normal]These people have a remit to 
[normal]become familiar with
[normal] the level crossings assigned to them - they each have around 70 - and will be proactive in reducing the risks and following through actions so that issues will be dealt 
[normal]with. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]L
[normal]evel crossings are 
[normal]inherently 
[normal]dangerous and the inter
[normal]face between the railway and road or footpath users will inevitably lead to accidents as humans do make errors of judgement - sometimes deliberately but often while distracted - but at least when they do 
[normal]so, Network Rail 
[normal]can be open and honest about what t
[normal]hey have done to reduce the risk or be able to defend why the crossing 
[normal]remains open
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]But there is much to do...[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Route level deviations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Despite the 
[normal]National Level Crossing Team’s 
[normal]effort to analyse the requirements for Level Crossing Managers
[normal], 
[normal]th
[normal]e devolution of responsibility to the routes and the emphasis on cost cutting, 
[normal]has resulted in 
[normal]not all of the recommendations being implemented across the board. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]One route, LNE, with little evidence of why, decided to 
[normal]under resource 
[normal]the
[normal] number of L
[normal]ev
[normal]el 
[normal]C
[normal]rossing 
[normal]M
[normal]anager
[normal]s by 25%. This 
[normal]significant under resourcing leaves th
[normal]at particular 
[normal]team stret
[normal]ched – some with almost double the 
[normal]average 
[normal]number of crossings to manage - and feeling that they can
[normal]not provide the level of care and attention this important w
[normal]ork deserves. I am due to 
[normal]challenge this decision with 
[normal]the 
[normal]LNE 
[normal]route managing director
[normal] in October. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Still reactive to accidents and not pro-active[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Network Rail
[normal],
[normal] and it
[normal]s
[normal] predecessors
[normal],
[normal] have always bee
[normal]n good at reacting to accidents -
[normal] putting right something that is found to be a significant factor 
[normal]after the event
[normal]. For example, the subsequent replacing of the type of crossing that allowed a signaller to raise the barriers at Moreton-on-Lugg 
[normal]when 
[normal]a train that had not yet been through 
[normal]the crossing when the barrier was raised
[normal] and a car passenger was killed
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]I was appalled that the 
[normal]Level Crossing Keeper 
[normal]was also prosecuted in this case. He had been dealing with 
[normal]someone
[normal] on the phone who wanted to 
[normal]move 
[normal]a herd of sheep 
[normal]over 
[normal]another cro
[normal]ssing and 
[normal]the Crossing Keeper 
[normal]thought he had left the barriers down after the train had passed while he was 
[normal]making arrangements
[normal] with this farmer. The system operated by Network Rail 
[normal]at Moreton-on-
[normal]Lugg 
[normal]should never have allowed 
[normal]him
[normal] to raise the barriers whe
[normal]n the train was already within the crossing zone - there was no 'are you sure?' or failsafe system to protect crossing users, or the 
[normal]Crossing Keeper
[normal], from making
[normal] this fatal error. There is now and all crossings of this type are now being upgraded. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal] believe that as the L
[normal]evel 
[normal]C
[normal]rossing 
[normal]M
[normal]anager
[normal]s do their job through the 
[normal]full 
[normal]risk assessment cycle
[normal],
[normal] these risks will be identified and methods devised to remove or reduce the risk in a proactive way. At the moment they are still in their first year 
[normal]of operat
[normal]ion 
[normal]and playing catch up. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.[bold]              [bold]And going forward...[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Perhaps my biggest concern is recent changes that are being undertaken
[normal]; 
[normal]even before 
[normal]Sir 
[normal]David Higgins leaves the company. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]Although it not the Committee, nor my business to intervene in the wor
[normal]king of Network Rail and how it manages it’s human resources functions, I feel I must advise of the risk posed by what seems to me some rather unwise decisions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]Having established a highly successful team to deliver the significant changes that have 
[normal]been seen in the last two and a half years, the National Level Crossing Team have been subjected to some partially implemented and then apparently withdrawn changes. It was announced recently that this team would be split between Safety and Programmes with
[normal]in Operations but th
[normal]en
[normal] seems to have been reversed following ORR intervention, h
[normal]owever the team have been unnec
[normal]essarily demoralised and the Head of that team, Martin Gallagher, (whose qualities ORR described in a recent review as "needing to be bottled") s
[normal]eems to me to be being pushed out of the organisation. Does professional jealousy win the day? Sadly, I believe 
[normal]that to be the case
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]But w
[normal]hat a loss of 
[normal]home-grown
[normal] talent!
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]As one might expect following such a shambolic re-organisation, where the team,
[normal] nor the Head of the team, was consulted, there is now a significant risk of the skilled and experienced resource leaving the company. This is very short-sighted. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Without the collaborative working established by this team to improving processes, 
[normal]innovation in technology to move away from signal-based (expens
[normal]ive
[normal] and time consuming) methods, and culture changing - leading by example that has been established and proven by this team, the changes made 
[normal]are in danger of 
[normal]slip
[normal]ping
[normal] back and level crossings
[normal] will once again be neglected. 
[normal]I believe that the continuing cultural issues played out at senior management level are posing a serious 
[normal]threat to this on
[normal]-
[normal]going work
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]I believe there 
[normal]is a 'we only kill about 10 a year which is better than most other networks' attitude in 
[normal]some areas of 
[normal]N
[normal]etwork Rail
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]I have heard rumour
[normal]s
[normal] that a new professional role might be established in Asset Management. But Asset Management professional roles a
[normal]re histo
[normal]rically, obviously, engineering-
[normal]based and my fear is that a Head of Level Crossings in this area will have an emphasis on signalling which will therefore focus on the proportionately small number of signal-based crossings. These crossings are inevi
[normal]tably better protected and therefore lower risk than the majority of crossings that will 
[normal]in all likelihood
[normal] be neglected
[normal],
[normal] as signal-based solutions are 
[normal]disproportionately expensive for the calculated risk levels at these crossings. And cost benefit analysis
[normal] i
[normal]s essential to assist prioritis
[normal]ation of scarce resource.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]But all level crossings pose a risk - even a footpath crossing that is only occasionally used is a very high risk if the user happens to be there at the same time as a train. You may rec
[normal]all 
[normal]the four girls in the north
[normal]east last year who ran across a "perfectly safe crossing" and one was hit and fortunately only lost
[normal] her arm 
[normal]-
[normal] not her life? 
[normal]The crossing had a sign that says '
[normal]You must 
[normal]call the signaller before crossing' but was otherwise unprote
[normal]cted
[normal] on the East Coast mainline where the train was travelling at 125mph. What 12 year old is going to call a signaller? As I suspect m
[normal]ost 
[normal]of us 
[normal]would, the girls looked, 
[normal]thought it was safe and crossed - but they, and 
[normal]along with 
[normal]most of
[normal] us, would 
[normal]not 
[normal]have 
[normal]the ability to judge just how quickly a train travelling at 125mph would be upon 
[normal]them
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]N
[normal]etwork Rail
[normal] have £67m 
[normal]budget allocated 
[normal]for 
[normal]CP5, the next five year period, 
[normal]to continue to develop innovative means to protect crossings and these remote crossings
[normal] might be easily and relatively inexpensively protected, for example, by vibration-linked signals. N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] needs more funding for this work - they had £130m for only the last 
[normal]two
[normal] years of CP4. But even if they get additional funding, which they are asking for, without dedicated re
[normal]s
[normal]our
[normal]c
[normal]e to deliver the work they will not succeed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]My co
[normal]ncern about the user-
[normal]blaming and back-side covering culture in N
[normal]etwork 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] that I was expo
[normal]sed to during my fight for the truth and to get changes made, is one I believe results from a legacy of lack of accountability. When ORR discovered evidence of withholding of evidence from the accident investigators (including the D
[normal]epartment 
[normal]f
[normal]or 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport’
[normal]s R
[normal]ail 
[normal]A
[normal]ccident 
[normal]I
[normal]nvestigation 
[normal]B
[normal]ranch
[normal]) and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Coroner
[normal],
[normal] they decided that rather than expose those individuals that the 
[normal]company 
[normal]might then use as a scapegoat, they would prosecute 
[normal]for 
[normal]the systemic failings.
[normal] 
[normal]I believe that was the right decision. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]Howe
[normal]ver, even 
[normal]Sir 
[normal]David Higgins did not have the appetite to deal with the withholding of documents from 
[normal]him, when 
[normal]the 'full disclosure' file he had promised this 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee he would deliver to us, the families. 
[normal]We have proof that Network Rail
[normal]’s legal departmen
[normal]t 
[normal]withheld information from their 
[normal]own 
[normal]Chief Executive.

[normal]              
[normal]The non-disclosure of these documents to us in our civil case was a contempt of Court. Despite this now being exposed I am not confident that the culture has changed
[normal] within the company
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]I 
[normal]believe the way that 
[normal]Network Rail
[normal] treats people internally 
[normal]- 
[normal]compromise agreemen
[normal]ts that gag it's outgoing staff
[normal], lack of information, for example, 
[normal]about why they pleaded guilty 
[normal]in 
[normal]the Elsenham case until a groundswell of protest from within required an 
[normal]explanation,
[normal] as well as externally by withholding information and, basically, lying 
[normal]is an on-going problem
[normal].

[normal]I h
[normal]ope to continue to work with Ne
[normal]twork Rail to support the changes they are introducing 
[normal]in level crossings safety and risk management 
[normal]and in
[normal] a small way help to influence the 
[normal]change in 
[normal]culture
[normal] that I believe is essential
[normal], but 
[normal]as I also am 
[normal]free to challenge them, I 
[normal]suspect the opportunit
[normal]ies
[normal] to do so will cease without the support 
[normal]I have enjoyed from Sir 
[normal]David Higgins.
