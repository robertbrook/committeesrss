[[[Wahlberg]]]

[[[ (HSR 024) ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Written evidence submitted by Madeleine Wahlberg in a personal capacity. I am a member of the Offchurch Action Group against HS2. I am neither a member of nor a donator to any political party and have no personal financial interest in any company or NGO. I am retired but was a university lecturer and researcher. I have taken a special interest in EC TEN-T policy and in trans-European citizen groups concerning HSR. &#xa0;

[[[1 Summary]]]&#xa0;

[[[2 Background]]]&#xa0;

[[[2.1]]]  The most common response from MPs when asked about the connection between HS2 and TEN-T policy is summed up by The Secretary of State for Transport who vehemently said “HS2 has nothing to do with Europe”.  As this is patently untrue although oft repeated, it seems right to ask why there is so little understanding of TEN-T policy (or such a widespread refusal to openly acknowledge TEN-T policy); and whether the TSC has taken the same view or is by contrast fully aware of current TEN-T policy and its likely or possible impacts on the development of the HS2 proposal?&#xa0;

[[[2.2]]]

[[[ ]]] Assurance on TSC knowledge of TEN-T in relation to the HS2 proposal would be particularly pertinent in the light of the “most radical overhaul of EU infrastructure policy since its inception” which has been agreed by the European Parliament today. &#xa0;

[[[2.3]]]  I wish to raise this issue specifically without raising any issues about whether the UK should or should not repatriate powers from, or leave the EU. Nor am I interested in scaremongering about ‘EU control of UK transport policy’. Nor am I taking a view of whether TEN-T policy is itself either positive or negative. &#xa0;

[[[Source of advice]]]

[[[ for TSC]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[3.1]]]  Given that it was the Secretary of State for Transport who said “HS2 has nothing to do with Europe”, I do not have confidence that the Department for Transport would be sufficiently informed about the latest TEN-T policy to provide TSC with an adequate view of the issues in relation to the HS2 proposal.&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]]  As I have raised the issue of TEN-T policy on numerous occasions with HS2 Ltd staff, and have had ill-informed responses, I do not have the confidence that HS2 Ltd has any inkling of the latest TEN-T policy nor its potential impacts on HS2.

[[[3.3]]]  At the recent European Commission meeting on TEN-T policy that I attended in Tallinn, EC staff who are central to the implementation of TEN-T had almost no understanding of the strategic case either for or against the HS2 proposal. I do not have confidence that they could adequately inform the TSC on the impacts of the latest TEN-T policy on HS2. &#xa0;

[[[3.4]]]   It is my view that the TSC should acquire an independent and informed view of the impact of the latest TEN-T policy on the HS2 proposal.&#xa0;

[[[4]]]

[[[  Possible issues of concern]]]&#xa0;Four areas are suggested here as initial exemplars of issues that the TSC might wish to review. &#xa0;

[[[4.1]]]  The reduction in priority for the ‘East Y’ arm of HS2. The latest TEN-T maps no longer show the East Y with ‘Core’ status. It is now not part of Core Corridor 8 (Cork to Marseilles). The line from Birmingham to Leeds is now only shown with lower ‘Comprehensive’ status. A possible reason for this ‘downgrading’ or removal of Core status is that it reflects a lowering of the priority to build the extension of HS2 to Leeds. There is a commitment under TEN-T regulations that Core routes will be completed by 2030 but Comprehensive routes will only need to be implemented by 2050. Is the current status of the East Y a reflection of a changed strategic case for HS2? Will this be reflected in a changed analysis regarding the inclusion of WEIs from the North East?  Is this lower priority status for the East Y intended to reflect the way in which HS2 will be delivered cheaper and faster? &#xa0;

[[[4.2]]]  In earlier phases of TEN-T policy, the scheme that was identified to improve transport from London northwards was the West Coast Main Line. This was then known as Priority Project (PP) 14. EC funds were allocated to the modernisation of WCML and the EC singed it off as a “completed” project. HS2 is essentially taking the TEN-T programme back to the starting blocks by introducing a second proposal on a similar route to the already completed scheme. Are there any implications of this for the strategic case for HS2? Will this impact on the ability of HS2 to access EU CEF funding for a duplicate (HS2) proposal? &#xa0;

[[[4.3]]]  The HS2 proposal under TEN-T will have to satisfy the EC that it is conforming to a number of ‘design criteria’ such as environmental sustainability, contribution to the carbon reduction targets, limitation on environmental damage, multi-modality and the involvement of civic voice ‘from start to finish’. Does the TSC feel that HS2 will be able to match up to such strategic criteria? What will be the implications for the strategic case of HS2 (including the choice of specific route), if HS2 as currently configured is not able to satisfy such criteria? &#xa0;

[[[4.]]]

[[[4]]] As part of the latest policy phase, TEN-T has agreed to a new governance instrument for each Corridor “led” by a coordinator appointed by the EC. This goes beyond the existing Forums that have existed for some time in order to achieve inter-operability. The intention is that this will ensure that each Corridor is planned, developed and managed as a whole, and on the basis of “European Added Value” not national added value. How will such a new governance instrument impact on the strategic case for HS2? Will it impact on the ability to make strategic decisions with regard to HS2 eg with regard to ticket pricing, staffing, timetabling, contracting for services; or at a more policy level, will it allow or prevent policies on eg a public service ethos; re-nationalised rail; the reintegration of services and infrastructure?&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;This submission has argued that the latest revision of TEN-T policy should be acknowledged and understood. It is that policy that will provide the European context for HS2 as a European project. We need a more mature response than the frequently heated denial that there is any link between HS2 and TEN-T.

[[[TEN-T policy and whether the HS2 proposal conforms to that]]]. I hope that the TSC can take these issues forward.&#xa0;November 2013 Public interview Kenilworth 3rd June 2013 http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/news/ep-backs-new-eu-infrastructure-policy_en.htm The House of Commons Library Standard Note SN184 summarises some of the key potential issues, particularly in the discussion regarding the Fourth railway Package, but it has not been updated by all the 2013 decisions.  A broad map of the UK TEN-T scheme is here http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/doc/ten-t-country-fiches/uk.pdf  and all 9 corridors can be seen in the pdf at the bottom of this http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kallas/headlines/news/2013/10/ten-t-corridors_en.htmA more detailed map of Core Corridor 8 is attached. http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2010-01-12d.309628.h&amp;s=%28WCML%29+1935-10-01..2013-11-14+section%3Awrans#g309628.r0 http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/ten-t_projects/30_priority_projects/priority_project_14/ Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funds http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t- policy/review/doc/com _sec(2011)0101_en.pdf   (p9) “public interest should lead to a continuous communication that implies a true involvement and would avoid the problems described.” It seems clear from discussions on the various media that many commentators assume that the UK will be in full control over all of these decisions in relation to HS2. That is less self-evident since the latest agreement in the European Parliament.
