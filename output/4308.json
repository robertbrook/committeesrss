"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by James Painter (IPC0044)1. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ) is part of the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford.  It was established in 2006. The RISJ aims to serve as a leading forum for a productive engagement be\ntween scholars from a wide range of disciplines and the practitioners of journalism.  It aims to bring the depth of academic scholarship to major issues of relevance to the practice of the news media. \n2. The RISJ regularly publishes reports and books on v\narious issues affecting the media.  On the specific issue of climate change, \nJames Painter \nhas published three recent works:  \nSummoned by Science: Reporting Climate Change at Copenhagen and Beyond\n (2010); \nPoles Apart: the international reporting of climate\n scepticism \n(2011); and \nClimate Change in the Media:\n&#xa0;\nreporting\n&#xa0;\nrisk and uncertainty\n (September 2013).\n&#xa0;\n \n3\n. This submission \ndraws on the research contained in \nClimate Change in the Media\n, which includes \ndetailed \ndiscussion of the way the last round of IPCC reports in 2007 were reported \naround the world\n.  It focuses on the way uncertainty and risk were conveyed in around 350 articles in the print media in 18 newspapers in six countries, including the UK, with a com\nbined readership of 15 million.  The book also includes a lengthy discussion of the different types of uncertainties surrounding climate change, and the possible advantages of framing the issue as one of risk management.\n4. In October 2013, the RISJ also p\nublished another study on risk and uncertainty reporting in climate change and other sectors like health, which summarised what we know about the particular challenges of communicatin\ng such difficult issues for the general public.\n (Ashe\n,\n October 2013)\n  Thi\ns publication drew on a conference held the previous year on the same topic which drew together academics, scientists and practitioners from different fields. \n5. The committee asks: How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying&#xa0;what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?6. \nThe first point to make is \nthat the \nWorking Group-1 (\nWG-1\n) \nreport of \nthe Fifth Assessment Report (\nAR5\n)\n \nexplicitly \ncontained a large number of uncertaint\nies \nabout climate change \nin its Summary for Policy M\nakers (SPM).  The draft version contained \nthe word \n‘\nuncertain\nty’\n or \n‘\nuncertaint\nies’\n \n42 times in just 31 pages\n, although this was reduced to \n36\n by the time the final\n, shorter\n version was issued. (Doyle\n, \nSeptember \n2013\n)\n7.  \nLaying out these uncertainties is the appropriate task of such a report and reflects the way \nthe way climate science is conducted\n.  But \nthere are several problems when communicating \nsuch \nscientific uncertainties to a wider audience, whe\nther they are policy makers, the media, or the wider public. \n More resources, training and \nanalysis need \nto \nbe directed at \nthinking through \nand implementing \neffective communication a\nbout uncertainty \nby climate scientists and other bodies.  \nOne key obstacle\n remains that the IPCC still only employs two professional communicators. \n8.  \nIf by ‘effective’ \nin the question \nwe mean ‘improving understanding’, then there is substantial evidenc\ne that scientific uncertainty can be\n a difficult concept to grasp. \n It is o\nften misunderstood by \nthe general public who can \ninterpret it to \nimply complete, rather than relative, lack of knowledge\n – or in other words, ignorance\n.\n   \nMany fail to make the distinction between \nwhat some call \n‘school science’, which \nis \na\n source of solid\n facts and reliable understanding\n, and ‘research science’ where uncertainty is engrained and is often the impetus for further investigation. \n (Painter, 2013)\n9.  Research carried out both in the USA and the UK suggests that messages of uncertainty too can \nbe an obstacle to\n public engagement\n.\n  \nIf scientists constantly talk about uncertainty, often the response of the listener is not necessarily apathy but lapsing into an unhappy situation of not knowing how to proceed, and therefore discounting or dodging th\ne problem.  Or some can even get angry when scientists don’t know things.  (Shuckburgh \net al, \n2012)\n10.  The way the IPCC reports present uncertainties using ranges of probabilities and assigning confidence levels has also been shown to be problematic.  It\n is highly laudable that the scientists are attempting to quantify the uncertainties\n to help decision making\n, but there may well be a mismatch with public understanding unless these concepts are clearly explained.\n11. For example, research in the USA \nabout\n the communication of the 2007 IPCC reports strongly suggests that there can be a \nbig discrep\n&#xad;\nancy between the meaning the IPCC intended, and the con\n&#xad;\nclu\n&#xad;\nsion people actu\n&#xad;\nally drew.  In particular, they found that \nthe public consistently misinterpret the IPCC’s probabilistic statements, and usually in a ‘regressive’ way, or in other words, less extreme than intended \nby \nthe authors of the reports.  So for example, when the I\nPCC writes that ‘many changes in the global\n climate system during the 21\nst\n century &lt;…&gt; would \nvery likely\n be larger than those observed during the 20\nth\n century’, the IPCC intends this to mean more than 90% probability, whereas the typical respondent interpreted this to mean a 65-75% probability. \n(Bu\ndescu et al, 2009)\n12. Other criticisms of the IPCC’s portrayal of uncertainties are that it is too complicated; \ntoo \nconfusing (because the intervals overlap); links numbers to words \nwhich can also be an impediment to understanding\n; and ignores affect (how\n people feel about what they are reading).\n  (Ashe 2013, quoting Professor Chris Rapley)\n1\n3\n.  It is not clear that even the expression ‘it is 95 per cent certain that humans are mostly to blame for temperatures that h\nave climbed since 1951’ is well \nundersto\nod.  In the context of this statement, one IPCC author was asked on the BBC by the presenter \non the day of the release of WG-1 ‘\nwhat the other 5 per cent of scientists believed\n?’\n.  In other words, there was a confusion between what the authors of the\n WG-1\n \nreport collectively had concluded \nwas true \nwith a very high degree of certainty and what percentage of scientists were in agreement with the statement. \n14. More explanation \nis \nneeded about what the phrase ’95 per cent\n certain\n’ means\n.   Few people may know\n that such an expression in the scientific world is often taken as a gold standard for ‘certainty’ and can be likened to the degree of confidence scientists have in decades’ worth of evidence that cigarettes are deadly.  (Borenstein, September 2013)\n15\n.  A\nnother \nproblem with \nhighlighting the scientific uncertainties\n is that \nsome j\nournalists \nor writers of opinion pieces in the media \nreport the uncertainties extensively\n, or misreport them, in order to cast doubt on the science\n, the IPCC\n or the implications of it.  S\nome media organisations may play \nthem up to follow an editorial line of justifying not taking action on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. \n&#xa0;\n16\n.  \nThe RISJ \nstudy of the way the 2007 IPCC reports were reported in the print media \naround the world showed that the media were not very good at explaining how the IPCC measured uncertainty. About 40 per cent of the articles included the IPCC concepts of likelihood and confidence levels but only 15 per cent included an explanation of what\n they actually meant \n&#xa0;\n- such as 'very likely' meaning more than a 90 per cent probability. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(We are in the process of studying the 2013 \nIPCC \nreport, so we cannot tell yet how widely these concepts were reported this time around).\n17\n. \nJournalists \ninterview\ned for the study \ngave lots of good reasons to explain this - such as readers or viewers not liking or understanding numbers - or the difficulties of concepts such as 'medium confidence'. \n&#xa0;\nSome of them agreed that \none of the essential challenges remains to \nexplain to a g\neneral public that uncertainty (i\nn a scientific context\n)\n does not mean ignorance, and uncertainty can be quantified, particularly to help decision-making.\n&#xa0;\n18\n.  \nThere is a growing body of literature suggesting that risk language may be a good, or at least a less bad, way of communicating climate change to \npolicy makers and \nthe general public.   Many argue that when compared to the messages of disaster or uncertain\nty that often surround climate change, \nrisk is far from being a panacea, but it does offer a more sophisticated and apposite language to have the discussion in and a more helpful prism through which to analyse the problem.  \n1\n9\n. One of the arguments in fav\nour of using risk language is that for policy makers, it shifts the debate away from what would count as conclusive proof or overwhelming certainty before taking action, towards an analysis of the comparative costs and risks of different policy options (in\ncluding doing nothing).  \n20\n. \nAnother is that risk is an essential part of everyday experience, including the worlds of insurance, health and investment.   Many people have to deal with it daily and manage it in different ways: most people in the developed\n world take out house insurance against the low-probability, very high-impact event of a fire.  Patients \nare increasingly familiar with the concept of the risks and benefits of different health treatments\n (\nthough they rely on trusted intermediaries to help\n them \nto \nnavigate the risk\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n \n \nInvestors constantly use the language of risk, and one top UK banker at HSBC reacted to the \nWG-1 report\n by describing climate change as \nessentially \nan ‘issue of strategic risk management’.  \nAnd s\nome of the risk assessments people make are on the same timescale as possible climate impacts – for example, taking out a pension policy into which they pay for 40 years. \n21.  It is certainly the case that risk language is \nnow \noften \nbeing \nused by politici\nans and other science communicators.  By risk language, we mean such \nevery day phrases \n'taking out an insurance policy',\n \n‘\nloading the dice'\n \nor 'playing Russian roulette with the climate'. \n&#xa0;\nDavid Cameron, Michael Bloomberg and Lord Nick Ste\nr\nn have all recen\ntly used such language as a helpful way of describing the problem and the need to take action. \n Lord Ste\nr\nn for example \nargues that sceptics have to \nshow \nthey have high confidence the planet is going to experience only the lower end of possible temperature \nincreases for them to make their case that it is not necessary to take action to minimise climate risks.\n22. \nRisk concepts in a narrow sense of assigning probability levels to adverse consequences are important for \na \nbetter understanding\n of climate science\n.   For example, c\nlimate models can now evaluate how much man-made climate change may have made an extreme weather event like a severe flood \nor drought \nmore likely.  Such risk assessments usually include probability levels, and what degree of confidence sc\nientists have in their findings.   \n23.  However, even though \nrisk \nlanguage \nand concepts \nshould be \ngenerally \nwelcomed, a number of caveats should be made.  \nFirst, some metaphors work better than others, and need to be constantly tested.  ‘Loading the dice\n’ for example, has been shown to work well in the USA, but not so well in the UK where the practice of playing dice is not so widespread.  (Shuckburgh\n et al\n, 2012)\nSecondly, there is little research done with focus groups on how \nthey react to risk language and concepts about climate change, in terms of understanding, engagement and behaviour change.  \nIntuitively \nmany observers may \nfeel that risk language \nw\nould work with a wider audience, who are accustomed to risk from the worlds \nof insurance, betting, health and investment. However, there's a need to test this more. \n&#xa0;\nMoreover, many people may find the numerical assignment of probabilities to possible risks difficult to understand or use as a basis for action. \nThirdly, it \nundersta\nndable that the authors of report on the physical science\n (WG-1) \nsh\nied\n away from using risk language.\n&#xa0;\n \nThey argue that they prefer to use \n‘\nlikelihoods\n’\n as it is a more neutral and quantifiable language; they say risk on the other hand is a more qualitative\n language and implies only bad outcomes whereas some outcomes from climate change may be beneficial to a limited extent.\n&#xa0;\n2\n4\n. \nHowever, t\nhere is already evidence that \nthe Working Group Two \n(WG-2) \nreport on climate impacts will probably have much more risk l\nanguage in it, as the IPCC \n2012 \nreport on extreme weather events did. \n&#xa0;\n(Doyle,\n November\n 2013) \nThis is in part explained by the different science disciplines involved, but also by the greater acceptance that the impact of extreme weather events are likely t\no be negative, and therefore 'risky' in the sense of a negative outcome.\n&#xa0;\n2\n5\n.  Finally, It is worth drawing \nmore \non the literature and practical ex\nperience of climate scientists o\nn how to communicate the uncertainties effectively.  Many climate scientists \nused to dealing with the media and policy makers stressed that they \nhave \nfound it helpful to start with what they were very sure about - for example, that temperatures are going up, that it's largely caused by human activity and that many of the impacts ar\ne likely to be negative - before explaining the areas of uncertainty. \n&#xa0;\n2\n6\n.  There is also a lot of work being \ndone in general in the media on the use of info\n-\ngraphics in expressing risk and uncertainty around climate science and other scientific issues. T\nhere are already some good examples of representing risk and uncertainty\n \n- and much more could be done. In many cases, visual presentations of uncertainty can be better than text for \neffective communication and \npublic understanding. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n7\n.
