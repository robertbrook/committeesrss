defaultThe Space Action 
defaultNework
default (SPAN) comprises university group and institute heads across the fields of Earth Observation, Space Engineering and Space Science. Our joint response to the above consultation is as follows:
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ESA 
defaultprogramme
default is generally very successful with excellent underpinning technological development. It is implemented in such a way as to provide continuity and commitment.  Following a thorough assessment and selection process space missions generally 
defaultgo on to provide a world class in-space capability
default. This continuity is in contrast to that of NASA where political interference and changes of high level policy cause much disruption
default, delay and cost increase
default. Moreover, the selection process involves significant community participation and balances science value with technical/programmatic risk and opportunity.
default A weakness of this assessment and selectio
defaultn process is that it is slow and 
defaultelaborate with much nugatory work taking place at the expense of the nations.
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe mechanism of 
defaultJuste
default retour, in which individual nations receive a large return of their subscription in terms of industrial contracts has been generally effective. While it can sometime lead to an element of compromise,
default or lack of optimization,
default it ensures continued support from participating nations. 
defaultThe increasing size of ESA places additional pressures on the 
defaultJuste
default retour mechanism.
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA is technically highly competent and so makes an intelligent customer for the prime contractors and is able to make informed decisions regarding strategic technological developments.
default However, ESA’s 
defaultprogramme
default is small compared with the overall European space 
defaultprogramme
default which gives prime contractors a great deal of power. As a result ESA often defers to the primes position at the expense of nationally funded instrument providers to avoid contract cost increases.
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA’s policy to cover all technical aspects associated with space has led to the creation of its ‘
defaultCentres’
default (ESOC, ESRIN, ESTEC, ESAC, 
default‘Harwell’,
default…). While these are effective they provide services to space missions in a non-competitive environment and so are perceived to be expensive and elaborate. 
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt will be important to align ESA’s space 
defaultprogramme
default with that of the EU, especially in terms of technology and capability development (rather than 
defaultmajor 
defaultspace missions
default which should remain the province of ESA
default). It would be very detrimental in further politicize ESA and 
defaultso 
defaultto introduce to it many of NASA’s weaknesses. However, better cooperation in terms of technological development would avoid duplication 
defaultand funding gaps.
default Non-EU nations (Switzerland and Norway in particular) play an important role in ESA and might be excluded were there to be common governance.  
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EU has probably much more to learn from ESA in terms of the implementation of a European space 
defaultprogramme
default than ESA has to learn from the EU.
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultESA has the best perspective on the needs of the space sector. An independently EU strategy makes little sense – see 2 above. Nevertheless, the EU does provide useful support in this area
default especially with the more focused ERC schemes. However, EU funding is to
default bureaucratically managed.  
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKSA’s awareness of the particular needs and constraints of the space sector in general and ESA in particular are evident in a more nimble and informed decision making process (e.g. compared with STFC). It only weakly supports early technological development (i.e. non-mission specific) which is currently the responsibility of other research councils (STFC, EPSRC and NERC).   It’s relationship with these bodies will need to evolve so that a more joined-up approach can be established. 
defaultIt should be noted that because of EPSRC’s reluctance to fund space engineering, UK universities are forced to turn to ESA and the EU for support
default in this area
default.
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSo far UKSA has been a success.  
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK science community benefits very significantly from the ESA space 
defaultprogramme
default.
default It’s missions have made a great contribution to our understanding of processes that shape our Earth and the Universe. European space technology is world class. 
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpace debris and solar activity represent a real threat to the UK’s space-based infrastructure. While the probability of a major incident is low, its potential impact is very high and could be very expensive. The UK should have a clear strategy for reduction and mitigation of these risks and should engage with ESA, the EU and others to maximize the benefits of its 
defaultnational 
defaultcontribution in this area.
