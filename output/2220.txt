[[[Peter Simon – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;Re: (Have Your Say on ) The Deregulation Bill&#xa0;I wish  to  support  suggestions made  by  a  coalition  of  various  Campaign bodies    that  the Parliamentary Committee advising on  the draft of the    Deregulation Bill might see fit   to include certain clauses within the section dealing with byways.  These could remove  certain  regulation - which  is being used perversely to support  off-reading in areas of  UK countryside-   that relates  to UUCRs (unsealed unclassified roads) and  BOATS (byways open to all traffic).  The legislation that applies to these tracks was drafted many years ago in a different age and has ceased to be relevant to the world of today. It   is now being   misapplied in a way that  is against  the public interest as indicated by this quick summary.&#xa0;The current recreational use by mechanically propelled vehicles - of non agricultural purpose-  of these tracks in countryside areas is:&#xa0;1.   Resulting in  large on-going expenditure of scarce public money and energy . The. public purse is having to continually fund bureaucracy generated by issues relating to these tracks; such as complex contested rights of way claims, legal disputes in the Courts, or orders for route maintenance which fall upon  Highways Authorities, the cost being met by the taxpayer.&#xa0;This encumbrance of bureaucratic waste is as far as I can tell because of red tape allowing rules made for another time  coming back to haunt us today. I feel therefore your bill offers an ideal opportunity for clearing this costly and unfortunate bureaucratic legacy.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.   Off-reading is itself highly damaging to the fragile resource of the  UK countryside;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.               Rural MPV use is damaging the international reputation of our country for unique and cherished landscapes and habitats.  I think this point is mainly self -explanatory. Travellers who arrive in our country  are usually struck not only by our cities, but equally if not more so by our superb verdant countryside that surrounds. On a small island this is in scarce supply and needs   urgent protection from  Off-roading. The Deregulation Bill offers a timely and not to be missed opportunity for this.&#xa0;To reiterate -the current  regulation surrounding UUCRs and BOATS is an unfortunate legacy from a different time which  would benefit from changes that appear to fall under the remit   of the Deregulation Bill, whose purposes are creditably to modernise  our regulation to be fit for today. Therefore for the reasons offered I strongly support  and urge strong consideration of  the following proposals  to be included  within the  Clauses of the Bill that have been introduced to deal with Deregulation of By-ways.&#xa0;&#xa0;OR IF this is seen as too draconian a measure, downgrading to restricted byway all unsealed UUCRs and BOATs in National Parks, Areas of Natural Beauty (AONBs) and where part of National Trails&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for considering my comments  and suggestions for this Bill.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
