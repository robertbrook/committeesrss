For example, customers are not always keen to be the first mover when it comes to buying a new and relatively unknown product. Another issue can be that sales people nee\nd to learn how to sell new products or services, and this can take time. These challenges in turning innovation into market opportunities are a particular issue given that manufacturers expect to use innovation to develop new markets. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Key comments on the 2013 Spending Round&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSpending commitments should boost companies’ ability to innovate&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;As well as spending commitments, there was some clarification around the delivery of innovation support&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Suggestions into future inquiries on R&amp;D funding&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlthough the government has started to move down the route of sector-based strategies, what is the best option longer-term\n?\n \nHow is duplication of resources minimised, and opportunity to support \nemerging areas of competitiveness maximised?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Appendix A: Achieving better balanced growth – a role for R&amp;D&#xa0;&#xa0;\nA1.\n \nAs the UK came out of recession, a consensus emerged that we could not continue to grow in the same way \nwe\n had done in the previous 15 years. A better balanced economy would be one where growth was based on innovation, investment and trade rather than cons\numption.\n At the time, \nforecasters were optimistic that this kind of growth could be achieved, but the recovery did not materialise as expected and business investment in particular remains well below its pre-recession average. \n&#xa0;\nA2.\n \nIn 2012\n,\n EEF \npublished \nT\nhe \nRoute to Growth\n, our take on what an Industrial Strate\ngy \nthat would deliver better-balance\nd\n growth \nfor the UK should look like.\n \nThe central principle was that government should to\n take an economy-wide approach\n towards \ncreating the climate and conditions \nthat would enable\n businesses in all sectors to grow through investment and exporting.\n&#xa0;\nA3.\n \nThe\n UK has significant strengths on which to build, including a diverse and innovative manufacturing base and strong science capabilities. An Industrial Strategy must se\nek to build on these strengths\n with a set of clear ambitions which lay out what government is looking to achieve.\n&#xa0;\nA4.\n \nEEF’s vision for the economy is based on achieving four key ambitions:\n&#xa0;\nA5.\n \nThe first of the ambitions is particularly relevant as innovation and R&amp;D are necessary to\n develop new products and services wh\nich can\n drive sales and exports. In order to understand whether the economy was making progress against this ambition we set out two key metrics\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA6.\n \nWhile \nR&amp;D expenditure is not a perfect measure of innovation\n, \nit is a valuable metric and \nit is \nmeasured by a range of international comparator countries.\n BERD is a key component of this. \n&#xa0;\nA7.\n \nThe SME R&amp;D tax c\nredit indicator is important as R&amp;D expenditure is concentrated in large businesses, and smaller companies face the most acute barriers to innovation\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Progress has been made &#xa0;A8.\n \nTo date we have seen\n \nprogress against both of these measures. BERD reached pre\n-recession levels after strong growth in 2011 and the number of SMEs claiming the R&amp;D tax credit increased by 49% between 2008/09 and 2011/12.\n&#xa0;\nA9.\n \nRecent improvements to the SME R&amp;D tax credit scheme and the relative stability of its provision through the tax\n regime will have played a part in the significant increase in the number of companies using the scheme in the past three years.\n The tax credit \nshould encourage a virtuous circle of i\nnvestment in R&amp;D and innovation, and\n the NAO’s report shows that over thi\ns same time period there has been a corresponding increase in SME expenditure on R&amp;D.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n For further information how policy could drive better-balanced growth, please see the Appendix.\n Source: OECD Available online: \nhttp://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/sti_scoreboard-2011-en/06/08/g6-8-01.html?contentType=/ns/Chapter,/ns/StatisticalPublication&amp;itemId=/content/chapter/sti_scoreboard-2011-62-en&amp;containerItemId=/content/serial/20725345&amp;accessItemIds=&amp;mimeType=tex\nt/html\n \n Dominique Guellec, Bruno Van Pottelsberghe De La Potterie\n (2003)\n \nThe impact of public expenditure on R&amp;D\n,\n \nEconomics of Innovation and New Technology\n,\n \nAvailable online: \nh\nttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10438590290004555\n \n NESTA (2012) \n EEF (2013) \nDynamic Innovation – Innovation Monitor 2013\n Available online: \nhttp://www.eef.org.uk/blog/file.axd?file=2013%2f8%2fInnovation+Monitor+August+2013.pdf\n \n19% of manufacturers agreed with the statement “we are falling behind our competitors due to the level of our investment in innovation” whilst 54% of companies disa\ngreed. \n \nIn \n2013, \nthree quarters of companies said that speed to market was more important than it was in the past.\n \nOnly 25% of companies said their performance was good or excellent \nwhen it came to speed of developing innovations\n, \nwhile \n30% of companie\ns thought their performance was poor.\n \nIn EEF’s Innovation Monitor 2013, only 38% of companies rated their performance as good or excellent at turning innovations into market opportunity, though this is an improvement compared with our 2010 survey.\n LSE Growth Commission\n \n(2013) \nInvesting for Prosperity\n \nAvailable online at: \nhttp://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/growthCommission/docu\nments/pdf/LSEGC-Report.pdf\n Source: UK Innovation Survey Available online: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-innovation-survey-2011-first-findi\nngs\n \n"
