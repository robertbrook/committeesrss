Written evidence submitted by the Forest Policy Groupdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Forest Policy Group welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Scottish Affairs Committee inquiry into Land Reform. As a major land use across most of Scotland, it is crucial that proposals for land reform adequately consider the current role and future potential of forestry in delivering benefits to all of Scotland’s people.
default&#xa0;defaultForest Policy GroupdefaultThe Forest Policy Group (FPG) seeks to further the development of sustainable forestry in Scotland, by contributing informed inputs to the policy debate. Its membership is drawn from woodland organisations, forestry and land use professionals and timber users, who subscribe to a view of forestry in which:

defaultdiversity is actively fostered – diversity of tree species and woodland types, woodland ownership, management approaches, timber production and processing, and wider economic opportunities.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012 FPG published a review of forest ownership in Scotland called “Forest Ownership in Scotland - A Scoping Study”; the only paper to have tackled this issue for many years.  This submission draws on that paper and presents the main issues and proposals from it.  
defaultFPG also published “Woods for People”, a plea for a new emphasis in public support for forestry in Scotland - 'forestry with a belief in people' - accompanied by a suite of briefing papers in support covering rural development, grants, forest ownership, the National Forest Land Scheme, restocking, deer, &amp; quality broadleaves (2011).
defaultThese publications are available from the Group’s website at www.forestpolicygroup.org 
default&#xa0;defaultStructure of submissiondefaultOur evidence begins with a list of key points, followed by a brief executive summary. Thereafter we consider each question posed by the Inquiry’s published Terms of Reference in more detail, including links to references and sources of further information where appropriate.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Forest Policy Group considers that forest ownership is a critical issue which has been ignored by successive governments and yet is crucial to the successful delivery of the Scottish Forestry Strategy. FPG’s own research has concluded that forest ownership is highly concentrated with a small number of owners each holding very large areas on average, compared with the situation typically found abroad.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis pattern is in part maintained by current incentives available for forestry and agricultural activities.  Diversifying ownership is essential to bring more people into forestry, so that the pattern better reflects the 
defaultmake up
default of the rural population of Scotland, and the benefits and outputs are shared more equally across society. Such diversity would widen the delivery of benefits and provide a wider range of local and national economic activity, thereby providing an element of resilience in a changing world. It would also to help to deliver the fullest range of public benefits from forestry.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as reviewing incentives to ensure they are delivering the intended outcomes without unintended consequences, and providing value for money, government has itself many opportunities to support the diversification of ownership, both for community groups and individuals. Relatively minor changes to government procedures could have a significant effect in this respect relatively quickly, with adjustments to the fiscal framework for forestry allowing more general change to occur more gradually over time.
default&#xa0;
default(only those questions directly relevant to forestry have been answered; where questions refer to land ownership in general, we focus specifically on forest ownership)
default&#xa0;default3.1.default&#xa0; 
defaultHow does Scotland compare to other countries in terms of the pattern of land ownership?defaultIn 2011 FPG commissioned research on forest ownership on Scotland
default as we felt it was an issue of fundamental importance, and yet officially received no attention. Without an understanding of the pattern of ownership, key policies and strategies for forestry risk failing, as ultimately it is owner motivations that are critical in influencing the management choices that are taken.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first thing to note is that there is a lack of ownership information in Scotland. This is in complete contrast to the situation abroad, where the importance of the issue is underlined by the detailed level of information which is gathered and published. A good example of this is the Statistical Yearbook of Forestry produced by the Swedish Forest Agency. This devotes an entire chapter to ‘Estate &amp; Ownership Structure’
default breaking ownership down by age, sex, size of holding, county etc
defaultFPG’s research revealed that about 67% of Scotland’s forest area is privately owned (i.e. owned by private individuals, trusts, companies, charities, communities etc). Of these privately owned forests:
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default91% of the area is owned either by landed estates or by investment owners, leaving only 9 % for all other ownership types;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default55% of the area is owned by absentees;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultamongst private owners, 32% live outside Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
defaultScotland’s forest resource is thus dominated by the state, landed estates and forestry investors. This contrasts with other European countries where a significant proportion is owned by individual resident owners, farmers, co-operatives, and municipalities.
default&#xa0;
defaultA further difference lies in the distribution of holding size. Forest ownership in Scotland is dominated by large land holdings: over 93% of Scotland’s privately owned forest area is in holdings of more than 100ha and as a result very few people (approximately 4,000) own all private forests. In contrast private forest ownership in Europe is characterised by large numbers of smaller forest holdings owned by individuals and families (for example, in Sweden 327,727 individuals owned forests in 2011).
default&#xa0;
defaultThis contrast is best illustrated by the figures below, taken from the research report
default1
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultSource: UNECE/FAO data from 8 countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland &amp; Slovakia;
defaultScotland: derived from 569 holdings in the research sample. For more details see the research report.
default&#xa0;default3.2.default&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the benefits and disadvantages of the current pattern of land ownership, and to what extent is this pattern sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangemendefaultts?default&#xa0;
defaultBenefits of current pattern
default: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNote however that the benefits of a simplified timber supply chain could be delivered in other ways. In countries with high levels of forest ownership, as in Scandinavia, co-operation through vertically integrated co-ops provides an alternative model.
default&#xa0;
defaultDisadvantages of current pattern
default: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSignificant levels of absentee ownership mean that forestry is not a land use that is well-integrated into the rural economy, and has led to tensions with, for example, agricultural interests.
default&#xa0;
defaultEffect of subsidy and taxation arrangements
default: we discuss subsidy and taxation issues in more depth in later questions (3.6 &amp; 3.7). However the importance of the tax benefits to primarily wealthy investors is highlighted by the space that is devoted to them on the websites of the main forestry land agents
default. Indeed, it is not uncommon for individual sales particulars to devote more space to the tax benefits of the purchase than the details of the timber crop being purchased. One major effect of this system of benefits is to perpetuate a gradual process of acquisition of 
defaultafforestable
default land by wealthy and often absentee owners, with adverse consequences for the integrity of the local rural community and economy.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.default&#xa0; 
defaultIs the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food security?defaultWe address here the closely related question of timber security.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt a UK level, the UK is significant net importer of wood – 80% of consumption was imported in 2012
default. Official statistics are not broken down by country but Scotland’s greater production and lower consumption means the figure for Scotland is much less than this. Nevertheless the real challenge is to expand Scotland’s forest area for both timber production and climate change mitigation, alongside other benefits.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is clear that the current ownership pattern and incentive regime is failing to meet this challenge, due to its focus on the singular motivation of profit; as a result annual planting rates are consistently below target. FPG considers that land tenure is as important a factor – if not more so – than incentives, in seeking to expand Scotland’s woodland area and the variety of species grown.
default&#xa0;default3.4.default&#xa0; 
defaultIn particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development? Is it socially just?defaultThe Scottish Forestry Strategy
default is the Scottish Government’s framework for taking forestry forward through the first half of this century and beyond. Its core principles are based on
default“sustainable development and social inclusion, achieved through a culture of ‘forestry for and with people’ and delivered in well managed forests and woodlands that integrate effectively with other land uses and businesses”
defaultSocial inclusion and a culture of ‘forestry for and with people’ is necessarily restricted by the current concentration of forest ownership, as are opportunities for woodland-based economic development for people and communities of ordinary means. This is not socially just.
default3.5.default&#xa0; 
default Given mounting political interest in, or commitment to, a programme of land reform in Scotland, what form should this programme take?defaultFPG believes that reform of forest ownership should begin with the collation of detailed information on ownership patterns, including research into the motivations &amp; priorities of owners; more analysis is also needed of the impact of policies and incentives on trends in ownership; a policy on ownership – informed by examples from abroad - then needs to be developed through consultation, which will maximise the public benefits of forestry for all; this policy then needs to be integrated across government such that incentives, legislation and government procedures (
defaulteg
default for disposal of surplus property) are all aligned behind this policy.
default&#xa0;default3.6.default&#xa0; 
defaultWhat sort of subsidies and grants are available to landed estate owners in Scotland? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the subsidy regime? In particular, are support payments being capitalized into land values and making these higher than they otherwise would be? defaultAdefaultnddefault&#xa0;default3.7.default&#xa0; 
defaultHow does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland? For instance, does it offer landed estate owners the opportunity to minimize the tax they pay, thereby increasing the value of land, adding to speculative interest (on the part of those looking for ways to minimize or avoid tax) and making it less likely that it will be made available to others?defaultWe answer these two questions together as they are essentially the same question posed in respect of grants in the former case, and tax benefits in the latter.
default&#xa0;
defaultForest owners have been eligible for subsidy through the Scottish Rural Development Programme (SRDP)
default, and are also eligible for a number of tax reliefs
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFPG strongly supports public subsidy for forest management activities which deliver public benefit. Current incentives have evolved in response to specific circumstances over time and many – particularly tax measures - are no longer aligned with current policy priorities as enshrined in the Scottish Forestry Strategy and elsewhere. In considering the advantages &amp; disadvantages of incentives in their various forms, it is worth going back to first principles and considering the characteristics of a good incentive regime.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch a regime should:
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultbe
default 
defaultfair
default              
defaultminimise unintended consequences
default              
defaultbe accessible to all owners/managers
default              
defaultprovide value for money
default              
defaultbe targeted at public goods
default              
defaultbe simple to apply for &amp; administer
default              
defaultbe flexible
default&#xa0;
defaultAssessed against these criteria, it is clear that while both SRDP and tax measures have some advantages, they are lacking in a number of key respects. For example, the SRDP has been so complex for smaller forest owners as to be practically inaccessible to them; Inheritance Tax Relief (IHT) is only available to wealthier individuals (&amp; not available to non-personal owners such as community groups), and is not targeted to deliver specific outcomes.
defaultIn the case of SRDP, a mid-term evaluation
default of the scheme has been undertaken and some refinements introduced, and the development of the new programme should allow further opportunity for improvement in consultation with stakeholders.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe situation with tax relief is more complicated. The Office of Tax Simplification’s Review of Tax Reliefs
default published in March 2011 concluded that profits arising from commercial woodlands should remain outside of income or corporation tax. One of the reasons given for this was that it was not possible to consider this relief in isolation from the rules that apply to commercial woodlands for both inheritance tax and capital gains tax. However inheritance tax relief for woodlands was not reviewed then, as it was considered more appropriate that this should form part of a review of inheritance tax as a whole (beyond the scope of the 2011 Review).
default&#xa0;
defaultFPG would go further, and considers that whilst tax arrangements for forestry do need to be reviewed as a matter of urgency, this review needs to take place as 
defaultpart of a wider review of agricultural and business reliefsdefault. Whilst our preference would be for all public support to be channelled through the grants system (a more transparent and targeted approach), removing tax advantages for forestry without also addressing those for agriculture would simply amplify the current distortions generated by the tax system, and exacerbate the imbalance in land use that is already heavily weighted in favour of agriculture.
default&#xa0;
defaultChief amongst these distortions is the effect of inheritance tax relief on land values (including forest values). Whilst land agents are often reluctant to acknowledge this, their own briefings frequently refer to it: a commentary
default on the recommendations of the 
defaultMirrlees
default review of taxation by property consultants Fisher German states 
default“Some might argue that it (
defaultie
default even the prospect of a review of IHT
default) 
defaultcould also affect capital values”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultProfessor 
defaultMirrlees
default himself, discussing inheritance tax in that Institute for Fiscal Studies 2011 review
default into taxation, was more forthright:
default&#xa0;
default“The UK is unusual in offering unlimited 100% relief on business assets—this is not available in France, Germany, or the US. These reliefs create just the sort of non-neutrality the tax system ought to try to avoid, 
defaultpushing up the price of agricultural landdefault”
default&#xa0;
defaultOne problem with tax incentives generally is that there is no guarantee that tax savings made by an owner will be reinvested into forest management, indeed there is an incentive to minimise such spend. As a result their value for money in terms of public benefits delivered must be questionable. However, it is important to stress that in seeking to improve that situation, any money recouped by government from a rationalisation of the tax arrangements for forestry should be returned to forestry via the grant system (so there is no reduction in public investment overall).
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, it is likely that grant aid is also pushing up capital values of land, as evidenced by large-scale investment purchases of land for planting in the Scottish Borders. Current rates of planting grant coupled with economies of scale can see large 
defaultafforestation
default schemes recoup their investment within only a few years. Relatively simple adjustments to the grant system could however be made to address this issue, such as tapering grant rates or capping the total payable to any single owner. Such measures would avoid distorting land values, share grant funding more equitably amongst landowners, and encourage a more diverse forestry.
default&#xa0;
default3.8.default&#xa0; 
defaultHow easy is it for communities in Scotland to take ownership of land and other assets? Should it be made easier in the light of the substantial achievements of existing community ownership groups?defaultBriefly, it is very challenging for communities to take ownership of land and other assets such as woodlands. High capital values, issues surrounding transfer of public assets to communities, difficulty in securing funding (including the effect of State Aid rules), and the bureaucratic hurdles put in place to qualify for purchase are all significant issues. These need to be addressed in order to facilitate the expansion of community ownership in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor more detail on these issues as they relate to community woodland owners, please see the submission
default of the Community Woodlands Association to the Land Reform Review Group.
default&#xa0;
default3.9.default&#xa0; 
defaultIs there a case for establishing a Land Agency to facilitate both the expansion of community ownership and the creation of new, especially “starter”, tenancies on land acquired for this purpose?defaultWe respond in particular to the question on ‘starter’ tenancies.
defaultForestry Commission Scotland (FCS) has developed a successful pilot project whereby it is creating ‘starter’ units for new entrants to agriculture, on farms it has acquired for planting. However, conspicuous by its absence to date is any move to create similar ‘starter’ woodland units within its forests. Although FCS enables communities to create woodland crofts through the National Forest Land Scheme (NFLS), it is not itself creating woodland crofts for rent to individuals (although it is already a 
defaultcrofting
default landlord). Similarly woodlot licences, a new model of forest tenure introduced from British Columbia where they are used by the Crown to help diversify the forestry sector, have not so far attracted interest and support from FCS.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the pattern of forest ownership and management in Scotland alluded to earlier, FCS has a key potential role in diversifying the forestry sector by creating new woodland tenancies on land that it manages.
default&#xa0;
default3.10.default&#xa0; 
defaultHow easy is it for land in public ownership to be transferred to communities and other private individuals, where that would be in the public interest? Should steps be taken to make it easier? For instance, should the UK and Scottish Governments compile a register showing land and assets for disposal? Should there be changes in the way in which such land and assets are valued? What UK Treasury rules are relevant to this area?defaultThe disposal of Government land represents a golden opportunity to diversify land ownership, one of the key aims of land reform.  However currently the way FCS disposes of land is not making the most of this opportunity. True, communities and approved NGOs have ‘first refusal’ on any sale via the NFLS; however if they do not take this up for any reason (and there are many good reasons why they might not), no further effort is then made to ensure a diversity of potential bidders are encouraged. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NFLS does not provide an opportunity for other types of small-scale, locally accountable and democratic groups to acquire FCS land, since these do not meet all the standard Scottish criteria for “community groups” (e.g. they may not be geographically defined, or non-profit-distributing).  Furthermore woodland areas are typically not being 
defaultlotted
default into smaller parcels to be more accessible to buyers of ordinary means. Indeed, FPG is aware that in fact the reverse is happening (for example in Skye), where several individual woodlands have been being bundled together to create bigger lots of substantial value. This highlights that insufficient priority is being given by FCS to ensuring that its disposals programme serves the Scottish Forest Strategy objectives by delivering the widest local and community benefit.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of valuation issues and public finance rules (stemming from Treasury rules), civil servants invariably interpret the requirement to achieve ‘best value’ as meaning ‘highest price’. A clear definition of ‘best value’ balancing economic, environmental and social aspects, coupled with appropriate guidance in its use, would help ensure that transfers of public assets to communities reflect the wider benefits which will accrue from the transfer.
default&#xa0;
default3.11.default&#xa0; 
defaultShould a Land Value Tax (LVT) of some sort be introduced in Scotland, as a replacement or addition to council tax and business rates?defaultAs alluded to earlier in our answer to 3.7, there is a need to review taxation in a holistic way. Fortunately, the 
defaultMirrlees
default review of taxation referred to there already provides such a review
default11
default. On LVT, Professor 
defaultMirrlees
default and colleagues were clear:
default&#xa0;
default“The economic case for a land value tax is simple, and almost undeniable”
default&#xa0;
defaultAs world-renowned experts in these matters, we are happy to accept their recommendations and would therefore support the introduction of LVT in Scotland - not as an additional tax but as a simplification of the existing system, 
defaultie
default as a replacement to council tax and business rates.
