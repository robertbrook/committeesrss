Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Bristol City Council, Swindon Borough Council, and Wiltshire Council. Costs of building to the Code for Sustainable Homes: Updated cost review, DCLG (August 2011). Note that while the costs of community heating energy strategies in this study are based on representative data, costs of such schemes are highly site-specific. The case for district heating should therefore be assessed on a site-by-site basis where possible, in the context of other strategic drivers for community energy approaches (e.g. seeding a network of low carbon heat supply that could be used to decarbonise neighbouring existing buildings). This study focuses on the most cost-effective energy strategies based on capital costs only. On-going costs (and the impact of support schemes such as the feed-in tariff or renewable heat incentive) have not been considered.
