defaultThe Housing Standards Review presents a
default great 
defaultopportunity to 
defaultestablish a framework to address the enormous embodied impact of the housing sector in its sourcing and construction, not just the impacts of houses in use, when key decisions are largely irreversible.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is therefore of substantial concern that: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultAs a consequence there is a great risk that the opportunity to substantially improve the quality and sustainability of housing as well as to encourage the scale of embodied impact reduction required by our climate change commitments and set out in the Green Construction Board roadmap will be lost.
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, the ASBP strongly recommends that a working group is established for the purpose of creating a standard for embodied impact for inclusion in the proposed set of ‘Nationally Described Standards’
default. Such a standard would:

default&#xa0;
default                                                                     Figure default1default Current Standards and Potential OutcomedefaultThe government is seeking views on three strategic options:
default&#xa0;
defaultA. defaultwhether government should develop a nationally described standards set which would operate in addition to the Building Regulations (where rigorous local needs and viability testing indicated it could apply); 
default&#xa0;
defaultB. defaultwhether government should develop a nationally described standards set as a stepping stone en route to integrating standards into Building Regulations at a future date; 
default&#xa0;
defaultC. defaultwhether the government should move now to integrate standards directly into building regulations, as functional tiers, and no technical standards would remain at all outside of the Building Regulations system, recognising that this will take time and may require legislative change.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditionally, 
defaultthe Code for Sustainable Homes (which is owned by the government) is seen as being overly burdensome, duplicates many planning related requirements and includes aspects that would be better delivered as part of the Building Regulations. T
defaulthe Consultation Report 
defaulttherefore proposes
default that the

default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultASBP responsedefaultThe ASBP welcomes the review and agrees in general with the statement of the Challenge Panel made in their report
default (Challenge Panel, 2013)
default on the need to untangle the ‘
defaultuntenable forest of Codes, standards, rules and regulation’. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the ASBP believes that the Housing Standards Review presents a unique opportunity to develop a ‘Nationally Described Standard’ for embodied impact, and is concerned that this opportunity will be missed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ASBP has long standing concerns as to the exclusive use of the Green Guide to Specification (See Appendix A
default 
default- ASBP Critique of the Green Guide) to gain materials credits within the Code for Sustainable Homes, and in that regard welcomes the news that the Code will be wound down, with the underlying assumption that some sustainability aspects of the Code will be incorporated into Building Regulations and other aspects becoming the subject of ‘Nationally Described Standards’.   
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, in the case of materials, this assumption appears misplaced, with nothing currently proposed to replace the material aspects of the Code. The short and confusing section on materials in the consultation document concludes that the government ‘
defaultdoes not therefore propose to include materials within the Nationally Described Standards document’
default. The government is clear that it currently believes material aspects are best left to the market.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Consultation Report considerations (Materials section p.78) and the ASBP response are shown below
default&#xa0;
defaultConsultation rdefaulteport defaultconsiderationdefaultASBP responsedefault‘A specific working group was not set up to consider materials issues since at an early stage members of the Steering Group undertook to explore how materials could be addressed through various industry led mechanisms.’
defaultNo evidence is provided as to how materials and product issues should be addressed or the nature of these ‘industry led mechanisms’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultA range of formal, non-proprietary standards such as British (BS), European (EN) or International (ISO) exist already, setting out materials standards that 
defaultthe housing industry can adhere to if it wishes
default. Under the EU Construction Products Regulation (305/2011) products covered by a harmonised European standard (
defaulthEN
default) should 
defaultnormally
default be CE marked and accompanied by a declaration of perform
defaultance when placed on the market.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CPR has been extended to cover the sustainability credentials of construction materials, with EPD
default)
default highlighted as the way to provide this data, and some sectors are already voluntarily developing products standards applying the European TC350 standards for their products.
defaultT
defaulthere is no consistent approach in terms of the scope of the evaluation which should be undertaken at the building level
default. 
defaultAlthough bodies such as RICS, BRE and the GLA have put forward approaches to evaluating the impact of materials, and these follow the TC350 standards to some extent, 
defaultbut
default– 
defaultsignificant areas of embodied impact such as building services or shading are often omitted and optimisation approaches can therefore be flawed.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultMost
default new housing is brought forward by private sector developers, outside the auspices of the Code, and these manufacturers tend to follow these common non-proprietary standards already, without authorities requiring them to do so. There are compelling reasons for them to do this, since consistent approaches ensure economies of scale, comparability between different sites and reduces costs on the supply chain. If any of these areas were regulated anywhere in Europe, the regulators would have to use these European standards so it makes sense to keep voluntary codes based on them.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are compelling market drivers for selecting construction products in terms of cost and technical performance. This cannot be said for the sustainability characteristics of construction products.
defaultAdditionally, whilst manufacturers have made great strides to embraced company level sustainability standards (such as responsible sourcing), product level sustainability standards and labels (critical to informing choice at the point of commercial pressure) remain stubbornly absent from the UK Marketdefault&#xa0;defaultDevelopers and t
defaultrade associations are clearly
default taking a lead in agreeing materials standards, and adhering to them. There is also an absence of any clear understanding at this stage as to what embodied energy standards should embrace, or clear evidence of what works (nationally or internationally). 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe publication of EN 15804 giving  a harmonised method for assessing the environmental impact of products and EN 15978 for assessing buildings make it clear what embodied impact statements should embrace.
default&#xa0;
defaultBased on the inputs of the steering and working groups, the proposition from the government therefore is that this is an area where there is no compelling case for local authority 
defaultstandard setting.
defaultThe ASBP believes that a materials working group should be established. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government does not therefore propose to include materials with the Nationally Described Standards document. However, the government will keep this under review to see if Nationally Described Standards may need to be developed at some point in the future. 
defaultThe ASBP believes that the government should establish a working group to consider the establishment of a Nationally Described Standard for embodied impact. In its absence the Government commitment to BIM will be made without a key cornerstone of good embodied impact data at a product level
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Challenge Panel report does expresses some concern that materials may be missed but stops short of stating the need for a standard.

defaultThe ASBP strongly recommends that a working group is established defaultfordefault the purpose of creating a defaultstandard for embodied impact for inclusion in the proposed set of default‘Nationally Describdefaulted Standards’ This standard will unlock a range of potential benefits (Below)default&#xa0;
defaultThe ASBP believes that substantial gains can be made through the identification and use of more sustainable, products, materials and approaches to their use. A Nationally Described Standard on embodied impact could unlock many such opportunities which include: 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome UK Local Authorities (such as Brighton and Hove and Hackney) have taken the lead in developing a requirement for embodied impact to be considered at the planning stage, but the widespread adoption of this approach is hindered by a lack of common standards.
defaultOther reasons for the timely adoption of a Nationally Described Standard for embodied impact are set out below.
defaultThe Climate Change Act 2008 commits the Government to a 26% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020, and at least an 80% reduction by 2050 (compared with the 1990 baseline). 
defaultThe Green Construction Board has provided a roadmap for the substantial (63%) reduction of embodied or capital carbon of construction from the 2010 benchmark of 33 MtCO2e by 2050 
default(Green Construction Board, 2013)
default. See Figure 2 below. Such a reduction will only be achieved through the use of 
defaultappropriate policy levers, such as a ‘Nationally Described Standard’ for embodied impact. 
defaultFigure default2default UK Capital Carbon EmissionsdefaultAs we move towards zero carbon buildings, including forthcoming Part L revisions, materials will have increasing importance compared to the impacts of building energy consumption. As shown in the diagram below fromWorld Green Building Council ( WGBC), the balance of materials and energy impacts has altered dramatically from 2002 to the current day.
defaultFigure 1: Lifetime CO2 emissions of new European Buildings defaultbefore and after Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD 2002) default(credit: Wdefaultorld defaultGdefaultreen defaultBdefaultuilding defaultCdefaultouncildefault)default&#xa0;
defaultThe CEN TC350 suite of sustainability standards developed as a result of a mandate from the European Commission provides an agreed method of assessing the environmental impacts of our buildings and construction products, and sets out an approach to evaluate a wide-ranging list of impacts across the full building life cycle.  Impacts are clearly reported in the life cycle stage where 
defaultthey occur, so it is possible, reviewing a TC350 assessment, to fully understand the differing importance of the impacts from:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe embodied impact of products is reported in an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) which can now be produced to harmonised product categories rules (PCR) described in EN 15804. The EPD assists in focusing the pressure for sustainability at a commercial transaction point, which is measurable and comparable between competing products.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther recent developments include an embodied impact benchmarking database (established by WRAP and UKGBC), and both the RICS
default (RICS, 2012)
default  and GLA
default (Greater London Authority, 2013)
default have published guides to embodied impact measurement.
defaultThe proposed adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) will enable embodied impact data of products and materials (from EPD for example) to be incorporated into whole life decision making processes for buildings. The ASBP anticipates that this ability to use EPD data intelligently in the design process will shine a light on current wasteful practices and encourage a far greater focus on resource deployment and governance through life and help to accelerate principles associated with the circular economy. 
defaultThe ASBP believes that whilst the sustainability gains from embodied impact reduction are substantial, market drivers remain very weak, with the majority of current schemes assessed at house or company level, well away from the commercial decision point of product choice. A Nationally Described Standard on embodied impact would help to address this market failure 
defaultThe ASBP 
defaultalso 
defaultbelieves that 
defaultimproved e
defaultmbodied 
defaulti
defaultmpact 
defaultshould become an Allowable Solution within government legislation targeted at zero carbon homes by 2016. A Nationally Described Standard would logically become the means by which the embodied impact is measured. 
defaultThe current Housing Standards Review provides an opportunity to capture the enormous potential benefits available from best practice in the sourcing, selection and use of appropriate building materials and products.
defaultThe information about products and materials is the subject of extensive European and international investigation, and the basis for appropriate interpretation tools is already in place. Failure to capture this opportunity via the currently considered national standards will undermine attempts to match improvements in the impact of building use by improvements in embodied impact. It will also significantly hamper the deployment of the Governments flagship Building Information Modelling (BIM) program, by robbing it of much of its most relevant data around the impact of sourcing construction and end of building life processes.
defaultOn this basis ASBP suggests an urgent review of the current exclusion of products and materials from the proposed National Standards
