[normal]Written evidence submitted by Laurence Robertson MP, [bold]Chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee (FTF [bold]09[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for 
[normal]your letter of 16 December, 
[normal]seeking my views on 
[normal]how greater certainty about the date of the next general election is likely to affect the work of Parliament, particular
[normal]ly the work
[normal] of Select Committees, in the final year before that election.
[normal]The 
[normal]most 
[normal]obvious
[normal] benefit of 
[normal]fixing the date of the General Election
[normal] for Select Committees is that
[normal] 
[normal]it 
[normal]enables Committees 
[normal]to “programme” their inquiries 
[normal]during the final year of the Parliament.  In previous Parliaments, 
[normal]the uncertainty over the date of Dissolution would affect a Committee
[normal] 
[normal]in a long-term or a particularly 
[normal]detailed inquiry; the danger would be that, once the PM had announced the General Election, Committees would either have to hurriedly  curtail an inquiry and rush out its Report, with the result that that Report was not as complete
[normal] 
[normal]as the Committee might otherwise wish, or otherwise abandon the inquiry without producing a Report, with the hope that its successor Committee would take up the matter in the new Parliament.
[normal]I hope that these brief comments are helpful.
