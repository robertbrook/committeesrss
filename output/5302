defaultWritten evidence submitted by Laurence Robertson MP, defaultChair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee (FTF default09default)default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for 
defaultyour letter of 16 December, 
defaultseeking my views on 
defaulthow greater certainty about the date of the next general election is likely to affect the work of Parliament, particular
defaultly the work
default of Select Committees, in the final year before that election.
defaultThe 
defaultmost 
defaultobvious
default benefit of 
defaultfixing the date of the General Election
default for Select Committees is that
default 
defaultit 
defaultenables Committees 
defaultto “programme” their inquiries 
defaultduring the final year of the Parliament.  In previous Parliaments, 
defaultthe uncertainty over the date of Dissolution would affect a Committee
default 
defaultin a long-term or a particularly 
defaultdetailed inquiry; the danger would be that, once the PM had announced the General Election, Committees would either have to hurriedly  curtail an inquiry and rush out its Report, with the result that that Report was not as complete
default 
defaultas the Committee might otherwise wish, or otherwise abandon the inquiry without producing a Report, with the hope that its successor Committee would take up the matter in the new Parliament.
defaultI hope that these brief comments are helpful.
