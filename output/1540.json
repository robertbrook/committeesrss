"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence\n from Leeds-Lancaster-Morecambe CRP\n (TIC 046)\n&#xa0;\nSome research was undertaken in 2006/07 on this \nservice\n by the TAS Partnership, a transport consultancy; it was produced by Phillip Higgs, The TAS Partnership Ltd. Guildhall House, Guildhall St. Preston PR1 3NU \n(\nTel 01772 204988\n)\n. Some of their broad findings are incorporated into this response.\n&#xa0;\nComments on \nt\nhe \nspecific\n points:\n&#xa0;\n1) How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?\n&#xa0;\nP\nopulation density may be lower but there would seem to be a good\n&#xa0;\ndea\nl of suppressed demand both from residents and visitors; \nmost have\n a car \nbecause public transport is not available at all times so often the marginal cost of an additional car journey is accepted rather than public transport. Any basic shopping or work bas\ned trips from stations along the line such as \nWennington\n, Bentham, Clapham, \nGiggleswick\n, Long Preston, \nHellfiield\n and \nGargrave\n  are often not straight forward and often are constrained by the timings of the last journeys in the early evening, the last serv\nice from Leeds leaves at 16.47\n. \n \nThose without a car are reliant on family or friends for when public transport is lacking. We feel that there\n is no doubt that a substantial degree of exclusion from public transport services exists in rural areas\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is r\neally a case of until the public service is available that is suitable\n,\n people will not use the current less than helpful partial service; but as even this\n restricted service \nis not used the planners see no need to increase the service. Proper analysis nee\nds to be made of what is required. However the service has seen continual year on year growth despite the current timetable shortcomings.\n&#xa0;\nTAS found that it was almost impossible to \nus\ne the line for commuting to and from work because of the very early last\n train from \nLeeds\n (currently \n16\n:\n47\n). It also felt that travelling for leisure \ntrips\n especially when returning from \nLeeds\n were poor. \nYet they noted a 49% increase in patronage from 1998 to 2007 and yearly reports by Northern Rail indicate that the usage con\ntinues to grow.\n&#xa0;\nBetween \nSkipton\n and Morecambe 42,437 people lived within one kilometre of a station (2001 census data) with over 150,00\n0\n within five kilometres. TAS felt that there was a potential target market of 12,000 \npeople\n for stations along the cent\nral part of the \nroute. \nThe population is ageing, especially at the Western end but up to 43\n% of\n the population in some areas is\n \na potential commuter market if the service was geared to working patterns.\n&#xa0;\n2) To what extent are the needs of different groups \nof passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?\n&#xa0;\nS\nchool runs and specialist services for pensioners and walkers apart there would often a\nppear to be an assumption that rural people only require a basic daytime\n weekday service\n; the existing rural public transport network in some areas is a patchwork of \naccidental survivals. \n Those who rely on public transport for work need \na service that is \nconsistent seven days a week as many industries are no longer confined to a traditional Monday – Friday working week.\n \n&#xa0;\nIntegration\n of all forms of public transport services could be better de\nveloped - rail, stage carriage bus, community transport \nbus, dem\nand responsive \nservices \nso that all groups have a chance to access the public transport network; for those without pass\nes, fares can also be expensive.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3) What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail serv\nices to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?\n&#xa0;\nP\nroviding services in sparsely populated areas is expensive and government does not necessarily recognise this in its funding settlements to non-metro transport authorities; cross county \nboundary services can also be a source of problems as different counties can have different priorities in terms of providing 'optional' services; because of vastly varying traffic flows, different types of solutions are necessary for different routes/commu\nnities; there should however be core rail and stage carriage routes giving a full regular interval service \nseven days a week.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe timetables for rural \nrail stations \na\nre rarely co-ordinated with bus services from \nsurrounding\n villages and often the bus does not even stop near the station.\n TAS\n commented that \nbus services should complement rather than compete with the railway.\n&#xa0;\nHistoric rail timetables \nare perpetuated in the PSR requirements, and the \noperators who are now shorn \nof their powers to adjust services themselves and are merely contractors providing \nthese \nspecified services. \nSuch services are often \ntotally out of focus of modern needs (comm\nuting, shopping, leisure). \n&#xa0;\nCounty Council\ns who are the area transport \nauthorities seem to be remote from the local parish and town councils\n;\n even \nD\nistrict \nC\nouncils\n in some cases with minimal, if any, consultation. There needs to be liaison between \nall levels of Local Government and the Rail and Bus industry together with Use\nr Groups and CRPs.\n&#xa0;\nThe CRP for Leeds-Morecambe already comprises representatives from various levels of authorities as well as Northern Rail, Network Rail and voluntary groups thus making it a useful existing body for this detailed work to be played out.\nBut there is a need \nfor all \nparticipants to \nbe flexible where changes can be made without much cost and a local usable service provided.\n&#xa0;\nCar parking at many rural stations is small or \nnon existent\n (mainly due to land sell off) provision should be encourag\ned as this allows access from \nsurrounding\n villages to public transport instead of the need to drive into town for work, shopping etc with the traffic and parking problems involved.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4) How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of p\nassengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?\n&#xa0;\nA\n lot of good work has been done in this area but lack of long term core funding, and of coordinated integration and marketing strategies has not helped in fulfilling the full p\notential of\n this mode. Three year funding, for example, is too short to allow investment in capital projects which may take longer to achieve payback. This argument has also been a criticism of short duration Rail franchises. \n&#xa0;\nThere needs to be funding fo\nr at least seven years, or ten to allow more imaginative solutions to be tried with the chance of being able to become revenue neutral over the full period.\n&#xa0;\n5) To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other\n demand-responsive transport services?\n&#xa0;\nT\nhese forms of transport need to play their part and may be the only solution in some isolated areas but should not replace regular core services as in rural areas they wil\nl restrict travel opportunities. Even commun\nity based demand-responsive ser\nvic\nes can be \nexpensive\n \ncompared\n with scheduled \nservices and thus this disadvantages people living in such areas compared to those in urban areas who have much lower transport costs.\n&#xa0;\n6) What are the main challenges associated\n with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?\n&#xa0;\nC\nommunity r\nail partnerships and community \nbus services have proved their worth in reducing the costs of rural transport even where their activities h\nave been largely directed towards increasing revenue - marketing and community involvement strategies have paid dividends in tapping into the suppressed demand mentioned above; the value of improved rural services feeding into national trunk/cross country \nservices needs also to be recognised; for rail, Network Rail have been examining ways of providing cheaper alternative traction options for rural lines. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTAS noted that the pricing of tickets offered good value compared to car and bus.\n&#xa0;\nBoth TPE and \nVirgin offer heavily discounted advance tickets while Northern Rail do not do so on this line. This has the effect of diverting customers from this cross-country rural route which has capacity onto overcrowded longer distance services operated via Preston \n&amp; Manchester. With better promotion the demand could rise and thus lead to improved services in the longer term.\n&#xa0;\nTAS did notice that some of the utilisation of rolling stock was inefficient and felt that with better diagramming the service could be enhanc\ned without needing additional stock, although this would need a change of practices in the \nstaffing\n. At present it is staffed \nonly \nby crews from \nSkipton\n which partly explain the \npresent \nnature of the service.\n&#xa0;\nThis illustrates that more creative thinking i\ns required bringing together all parties and accepting that changes may be needed in order to achi\neve the maximum utility for \nthose in isolated \ncommunities\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe local market \nof itself may be \ntoo small to justify a higher frequency service \nso needs \nto be \nlinked to developing the route as a\nn alternative\n Trans Pennine service.\n Question1 also referred to suburban areas. This is becoming a serious problem, especially in the \nAire\n \nValley\n, and nearer to \nLancaster\n. R\noads are jammed and old suburban stations \nwere\n s\nwept aside \nfrom the 1960s onwards \nas main line services grew; replacement \nof such \nnow \nbeing difficult as lines have been reduced \nwhile\n paths and speed of Intercity routes have grown in importance. \nPossible\n areas to explore should include restoring these st\nations (as has happened in the \nAire\n \nValley\n) nearer \nLancaster\n perhaps by the provision of loops, as used on the continent. It may be more four line tracks need to be restored where lifted. The use of Tram/Trains should be encouraged which can use the road a\nrea to skirt blockages and to serve town centres and use track adjacent to the railway or disused lines where space exists to install this.\n&#xa0;\nIt is also of interest that one of the questionable approaches adopted in the \nBeeching\n report was to ignore the eff\nect of feeder services into the wider rail network. While taken on its own a service such as the Leeds-Lancaster-Morecambe may have questions about economic benefits it needs to be seen in the context of a supporting route to the more principal East and We\nst Coast routes – linking both of these main arterial rail trunks.\n&#xa0;\nAugust \n2013\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
