default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe United Kingdom Independence Party (hereafter referred to as ‘UKIP’) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of Commons’ Welsh Affairs Committee’s call for evidence as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Wales Bill. This submission has been compiled by a working group of party representatives within Wales and authorised by the party leadership prior to submission to the Committee. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe note that the Committee is interested in examining whether
default 
defaultthe Government’s proposals, as set out in the draft Bill, in respect of both financial devolution and the National Assembly’s electoral arrangements are sound. We further note that the Committee is particularly interested in receiving and considering suggestions of specific amendments or modifications to clauses in the Bill.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe note the questions posed by the Committee: 
default&#xa0;
defaultAre the Government’s proposals, as set out in the draft Bill, in respect of both financial devolution and the National Assembly’s electoral arrangements sound? And
default&#xa0;
defaultDo the provisions of the draft Wales Bill deliver the policy intentions of the UK Government? 
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also note the Committee particularly welcomes suggestions of specific amendments or modifications to clauses in the Bill.
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis core element of the submission therefore takes the form of 4 parts:
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposal:default 
defaultPartial devolution of income tax, and full devolution of stamp duty land tax, landfill tax, business rates and other smaller taxes to the National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Government.
default&#xa0;
defaultA survey carried out by Beaufort Research on behalf of The Commission on Devolution in Wales (‘the Silk Commission’) found that 62% of respondents believed the National Assembly should have greater powers. However, it must be recognised that the question was asked in relation to the twenty areas of legislative competence and a limited number of explicitly defined areas. Questions relating to taxation are a fundamentally different matter and may have generated a different response. And although we do accept and welcome the fact that there is broad support for the Assembly throughout Wales, it is 
defaultcrucial that this support is not compromised by those seeking to build ‘bigger government’ at a cost to the Welsh taxpayer.  
default&#xa0;
default2.1.1.
default 
defaultNevertheless we do believe that wherever possible the institutions empowered to spend public money should be responsible for raising that same revenue, and that the Assembly being responsible for raising its own budget through taxation would increase the visibility and accountability of the institution. But, it is crucial to note that whilst we believe this is a sound principle, any devolution of further powers can only be legitimately delivered with the consent of the people which has been obtained through a referendum. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.2.
default 
defaultWe also believe that the practicalities of a separate tax code and different tax rates operating side-by-side could have wide-ranging and potentially catastrophic results for the Welsh economy. In Eastern counties, it is feasible to believe that businesses could be made uncompetitive because of an additional tax burden placed on them that is not levied against their English counterparts just across the border. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.3.
default 
defaultWe also believe that sufficient consideration has not been paid to the potential negative impact on housing and public services that different tax rates operating only miles apart may have. Ross-on-Wye is less than 10 minutes by car to Monmouth, which has a population of approximately 9,000 inhabitants. It is therefore conceivable and highly probable that different tax rates in both towns could have adverse and unforeseen impacts on local property values, demand on public services as well as resulting in increased commuting and pollution.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.4.
default 
defaultLastly, we also note our concern that sufficient consideration has not been paid to the logistical consequences of such powers being devolved. We are quite confident that if the people of Wales understood that the granting of such additional powers to the Assembly were accompanied by an expensive new bureaucracy (which will undoubtedly follow), the appetite for the Assembly to be entrusted with greater powers would be even less than it is currently. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposal:default 
defaultThe power for the National Assembly for Wales to be able to trigger a referendum on the devolution of income tax.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.1.
default 
defaultThis proposal is intrinsically linked with the first. In the case that we have put forward already, we have made it clear that it is our belief that there is not the appetite in Wales for the Assembly to be given increased powers in relation to taxation. However, we do accept that if Parliament ultimately makes the determination to devolve such powers, a democratic mandate in the form of a referendum must be sought and convincingly given. We also note that this proposal only makes reference to income tax, whilst the taxation powers being discussed are far broader. We therefore believe that if this Bill is passed into law, the principle of referendum must be extended to ensure the Assembly must seek the mandate of the people regarding all matters of taxation. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposal:default 
defaultIncreased capital borrowing powers for the Welsh Government. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.1.
default 
defaultThis proposal in particular concerns us greatly. According to the OECD the UK’s public debt currently stands at approximately 96%, forecast to reach almost 100% during this calendar year. This debt to GDP ratio means that the UK is fast becoming (proportionally) one of the most indebted nations in the World when considered against our entire economic output. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.2.
default 
defaultWhen household debt is considered, the picture is even more concerning. The UK’s external debt (i.e. the combination of government debt and household debt) is almost double that of Europe’s largest economy: Germany, and second only to the United States. It is therefore our view that it would be economic lunacy for Wales to worsen its own economic position by taking on new debt in addition to its share of the national burden, especially in light of the fact that Wales has no control over the setting of monetary policy. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposal:default 
defaultMove the National Assembly for Wales from four to five year fixed terms.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.1.
default 
defaultWe believe that all politicians should be accountable to the people they serve, and that this accountability should not merely consist of weekly surgeries and media coverage. The ability to hold politicians to account through elections is central to the functioning of our democracy. For 1359 days in every electoral cycle, the politicians hold the 
defaultreigns
default of power in Wales; it is only on Election Day that this power is returned to the people, and it is only then that the people of Wales can truly hold their politicians to account. As communications technology develops we should be seeking more opportunities for people to engage with the political process and more opportunities for them to cast judgements on their politicians, not less. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposal:default 
defaultRestore the right for candidates to stand on both a constituency and regional list during Assembly elections.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.1.
default 
defaultWe believe that the electoral system used by the Assembly is for the most part positive. It safeguards the principle that there should be a direct link between representatives and their constituents. At the same time it recognises that there are massive local variations in voting which could conceivably result in political parties receiving the single highest share of the vote across the country, whilst achieving a smaller number of AM’s than another party in the process. We therefore support the current system as it goes some way to compensating for these imbalances. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.2.
default 
defaultWe also believe that changing the system to allow individuals to benefit from the security of being named on their regional party list; whilst at the same time allowing them to campaign freely within a local constituency sends an unpalatable message to the people of Wales. People should feel that their vote makes a difference. The potential for candidates to be named twice goes against this fundamental principle of democracy as it allows politicians to insure themselves against the will of the people. It is conceivable that a local population have actively voted against a candidate for extremely strong reasons en-masse, but have failed to remove them/prevent their re-election because of the list system. We therefore do not support a change. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProposal:default 
defaultEnsure Assembly Members cannot be MPs at the same time.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.1.
default 
defaultOutside of the twenty areas of legislative competence, and other than the areas reserved to the European Union it is still the Westminster Parliament that makes the laws that apply to Wales. It is therefore only right that there is a strong Welsh voice at Westminster, and it is only right that this voice is committed and not part-time. We therefore support this proposal. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government can be commended for establishing the 
defaultCommission on Devolution in Wales. However, the government has failed to properly scrutinise the recommendations of the Commission, and crucially it has not asked in a robust way whether these recommendations are in-line with the wishes of the people of Wales. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend further consideration of the recommendations contained within the Silk Report and extensive consultation with the people of Wales. We also believe that the UK Government has a duty to ensure it considers these recommendations in the context of the small proportion of voters who are currently engaging with the National Assembly through the electoral process. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRemoval of the provisions related to taxation.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRemoval of the provisions related to capital borrowing.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRemoval of the provisions related to changing the Assembly term to 5 years.
