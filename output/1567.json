"              \n              \nLongframlington Parish Council, Northumberland (TIC 054)&#xa0;\nThe councillors would like to wholeheartedly support the thoughtful letter supplied below and hope that notice is taken of the need to consider rural services as a network not just as isolated services.  \n&#xa0;\nRunning a rural transport network in such a sparsely populated area as Northumberland is completely different to an urban one. Rural needs are more basic and exceptionally community related.  &#xa0;&#xa0;\n1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSummaryIncluding\nespecially for reaching \npotential passengers as well as existing ones, \nand those travelling long distances to access the public transport network (see 3.5)\nEVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  PLAN 2011-2026 - a howl of anguish from passengers.  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nno publicity about this questionnaire on any of the buses (3.7.ii)\nNo recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, needing to be supported by public transport. and for day-to-day service changes\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2)  A personal view of public transport policy and implementation from a regularly and long-used bus seat2.1              Being a regular bus user on both urban and rural routes over 40 years, starting with schooldays travelling from \nWindyhaugh\n in the upper Coquet valley to \nMorpeth\n, Northumberland, and then working i\nn various places from East London to mid Wales, Worcestershire to Middlesbrough, returning to Northumberland regularly using public transport, I have had plenty of opportunity for comparison.  \n2.2              For the last 9 years I have been in Northumberland, using \nthe \nThropton\n to \nNewcastle\n route for at least 5 return journeys per week between \nLongframlington\n and \nMorpeth\n, mostly for work or to connect to other destinations, so I have been able to observe all of the changes on this route since 1971.\n2.3               I am submitti\nng this evidence because I have full awareness of how \nimportant the bus service is for we passengers \nin all aspects of life, and not just to access shops and basic services.  Anyone not a regular rural bus user has no conception of this, as is reflected by\n policies and implementation for rural bus services .\n2.4              Also I think that the best hope for rural public transport is to enable a proper \nnetwork to be \nrun profitably, in recent years \nhindered by deteriorating communication with existing passengers and lack of contact with potential passengers, largely because of  the constraints of funding structures.\n2.5              Profitable and appropriate running of public transport in rural areas is hindered by looking at the funding of each route in isolation, instead of examining it as part of an effective and usable public transport network.2.6              Sources:\n              \n3)  \nHow do government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?3.1              Though there were surveys in previous decades, in the last nine years, despite making \nminimu\n, five ret\nurn journeys per week between \nLongframlington\n and \nMorpeth\n,  I have only seen one County Council survey, in spring 2011, and one done by a national organization, though I have heard that another was done this spring driver about a specific proposed change t\no our timetable.\n3.2              Our parish council has asked for people to notify them of their public transport needs via our parish newsletter, as has \nRothbury\n, \nThropton\n,  and upper \nCoquetdale\n, but until very recently, \nLonghorsley\n, the other main village on our bus\n route did not have such a publication.\n3.3              Our weekly, “Northumberland Gazette” covers public transport, publishing a paragraph or two during a  consultation, but usually at the very end of the consultation period.  Is this due to tardy dissemination of i\nnformation by the County Council, or to editorial policy.? \n3.4              Consultation documents are quite complex, and so only really useable online.  An unusually high proportion of bus passengers probably don’t have access to computers, particularly in rural area\ns lacking in broadband and decent mobile phone signals, leaving paper documents available at libraries. If people rely on public transport, they might only get to the nearest place with a library one day a week for an hour or two to do essential tasks, so \nwould not have time to peruse and respond to a consultation.\n3.5              At a public meeting in Felton, I think in October 2011, about cutting bus services to Newton-on-the -Moor and \nSwarland\n, attended by  councillors, council officers, and Arriva representatives \n, it was stated that one of the main ways for determining passenger demand was counting the ticket numbers on services. \nLocal users replied that this could only be done on services which existed, and it did nothing for people needing a bus service which currently didn’t exist, especially if they had to get a lift to the nearest bus route, often a great distance away \nThough  common practice in urban public transport surveys is  to ask people how far and how they travel to and from the service being surveyed, this is not done in Northumberland.Most regular passengers using weekly passes suspect that they are waved onto the bus without being counted.\n              \n3.6              On regular drivers who know the route and passengers well.  Their employers probably don’t make \nenough use of their local knowledge, and could run a better service if they did. It is only because of these drivers’ personal dedication that this service operates effectively.\n              \n3.7.i              I arrived back in Northumberland in time to see the five year Local Tra\nnsport Plan 2006-2011 apparently voted in by the County Council before the consultation period ended. In autumn 2010, having discovered the name of the Commercial Manager at Arriva, I prepared for the \nforthcoming 2011 Local Transport Plan by giving out add\nress cards with the Arriva manager’s name and head office address in Sunderland to anyone who I heard making a comment about the state of the bus service, hoping that it might encourage the decision-makers to pay more attention to our needs and experiences\n.  I was much surprised by the number of people who later told me that they had written letters, even those who had said “they won’t listen to us anyway”.  Apparently the Arriva management also got a surprise.  \nii                Later, questionnaires were distributed \nto passengers on the \nRothbury\n and A1 routes in Northumberland, and collated in the \nEVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  2011-2026, giving the impression of a howl of anguish from passengers.  There was no publicity about this questionnaire on any of the buses, \nand it was mostly distributed by passengers who got further copies of it themselves\n, and distributed it to everyone they could either on the buses or door-to-door.  Even so, I later heard from many passengers who had still had no idea\n that a consultation was taking place.\niii                Presusmably  this was because, as a subsidised service, Arriva ran it under contract for the County Council, and it  did not cover operating consultations or publicity.              It is probably not in Arriva’s interests to facilitate a profitable and effective service if they can get money by contracting to run a service for  the County Council without investing  in market research or promotion.  Few County Council resources available to do this.On “THE BOTTOM LINE” ON B\nBC RADIO 4 ON 19/11/11, I HEARD DAVID MARTIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ARRIVA UK appeared to say \ntaht\n \nthere was no money in running public transport services, but Arriva forecast healthy growth by getting  money for running services for councils.&#xa0;              3.8              Apparent\nly the RECENT QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE PROPOSED REINTRODUCTION OF REGULAR BUS SERVICES BETWEEN ALWINTON AND ALNWICK VIA ROTHBURY BY A NEW COMPANY\n, SPIRITBUSES OF ROTHBURY, has uncovered a huge and desperate demand, exemplified by sev\neral of we potential passengers getting a supply of questionnaires and voluntarily distributed them on buses, and door-to-door.\n&#xa0;3.9              See\n \nmy submission\n \nto the NORTHUMBERLAND CORE STRATEGY 2015-2030 PREFERRED OPTIONS\n  \nCONSULTATION,  TRANSPORT SECTION,  QUEST\nION 43:  \nTo base a planning strategy on a vision where the majority of the county is rural, but “where the use of public transport for the journey to work and to school is considered socially necessary but is not commercially viable, the local authority \nm\nay\n provide revenue support for services”[Northumberland Economic Strategy p.23] is LUDICROUS.\nIn the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 Strategy Document there are 17 principle elements of the new bus strategy, but \nnone of them mention working with or involving the LOCAL BUSINESSES WHOSE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS ARE USERS OF THE BUS SERVICE, and who might wish for more bus use in order to free up the oversubscribed car parking spaces for a larger number of customers, and a better network of buses to attract more tourists(e.g. Dutch tourists, 7% of whom expect to use public transport, our nearest neighbours on the ferry)\n4)  To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;              4.1              Many special interest groups such as the elderly, frail and vulnerable, and to some extent, young people, are probably very much on the County Council’s radar, and quite a large proportion of available resources are put into sup\nporting the introduction and operation of \ncommunity buses, but these are often only usable for people who are in a position to book in advance in quite small time-slots. \nThese, and the excellent car-share schemes implemented by the County Council, \nare not suitable for the growing number of people who are struggling to afford a car to get to work, or look for work, and who are increasingly expected to work unusual shifts or at short notice, or both (zero hours contracts etc.), or who simply want to reduce g\nlobal warming by using public transport \n&#xa0;4.2              Teenagers seem to be the least informed about changes to bus timetables etc., though public transport has been one of the main campaigning issues of the National Youth Parliament for 2 years running, and youngsters are readily in touch via social media.  \nProbably an effective route for communicating with them has not been established.\n4.3              Apparently no recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, which needs to be supported by public transport (especial\nly in the absence of accessible computer services and tuition).\n&#xa0;It isn’t just about taking people into town centres to access increasingly centralised services which have been withdrawn from rural areas.It is about allowing people to be able to continue seeing and supporting relatives and friends in neighbouring communities, get to family graves to tend them, recognising that sick people don’t just need medical services, but visitors as well (e.g. no Sunday services)\n, allowing access to local meetings so that they are not excluded from democracy, and local cultural events and activities to maintain the cohesion of the community For some people living on their own, or whose partners are in hospital, their fellow passengers and the bus-drivers can be their \nmost important source of company and support.  \nBuses are a good and rare meeting place for different sections of the community who might not otherwise meet \ne.g. young and old, native and newcomer, people with and without children,\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5) What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;\n5.1              Communicating with passengers and\n potential passengers (see section 3)\nand, for \nday-to-day service changes, recognition from e.g. Arriva, who say that we can use \nFacebook\n or Twitter, that an unusually high proportion of their passengers don’t have access to or knowledge of these, and many of the most essential journeys are outside of office hours. Arriv\na’s number for enquiries is only open during office hours, with no numbers for “local” depots. Their \nFacebook\n page is only updated during office hours.\nThere are no information offices on the \nThropton\n route outside of Newcastle.\n5.2              Accurately establishing\n the need.  \nPeople have had to give up going to places, make unreliable or inefficient ad hoc arrangements, or get a car when finances or environmental principles make it preferable that they did not.\nIf a new service is put in place, especially if it is \nnot publicised, or has not been properly researched to make sure that it best fits peoples’ needs, it takes some time for people to find out about and transfer back to trusting and relying on public transport.  If , as usual it has been a trial period of o\nnly a year, there is not time to build up a base of new and previous customers, and the service is then irrevocably cut due to “lack of demand”.  (Many passengers have concluded that this is probably one of the main objectives when designing “trial periods\n”).\ne.g. the recent history of the Newton-on-the-Moor and \nSwarland\n bus service, which was no use for workers, and only catered for a small section of the community before it was cut altogether.\n              \n5.3              Rough roads and reliability in winter – better \nintegration with highways \ndepts\n – ensuring better gritting times, passing places, and parking /dumping spaces for snow so that cars aren’t parked on roads and buses can get through safely.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6)  How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;See section 4.1\n&#xa0;7) To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxi and other demand-responsive transport services?This discrimi\nnates against some of the groups who actually rely on the buses, who have not got enough money to run a car, so couldn’t afford a taxi either.\nMaybe more could be done to look into taxi-share schemes\n&#xa0;8)  The main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities?  How can these services be made more affordable?8.1              Judging from a public meeting about the \nWooler\n  to Newcastle bus service in March 2013, the County Council is obliged to pay for the free journeys made by pensioners,\n but is given no funds for it, presumably meaning that available funds are drawn to the most used, but possibly less socially essential routes, so that people on busy urban bus routes get much more value for money and use of their pensioners’ passes than p\neople in rural areas can., but free bus travel for \nall pensioners, whether rural or urban is essential – see section 4.\n8.2              Do everything to make rural bus services more profitable, by effective market research and promotion, see section 3. \n8.3              Funding an\n area’s rural transport as a whole network, rather than looking at individual routes separately. This only results in constant cuts, rendering the network useless for increasing numbers of dedicated passengers, and necessitating larger subsidies for the re\nmaining few.\n8.4              We are all being exhorted to reduce emissions, but rural bus services are always being cut, despite more and more essential services and facilities being withdrawn from rural areas and centralised, so needing people to make more and longer\n journeys –\ninclude funding for rural public transport as part of any centralization project or cost-benefit analysis?&#xa0;Recommendations&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n1\n"
