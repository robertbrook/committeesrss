The deprivation of a provider is \nbased on the mean of the deprivation indices associated with the home post codes of the pupils attending the school rather than the location of the school itself. The schools are divided into five equal groups (quintiles) that are labelled from ‘most depri\nved’ to ‘least deprived’.\n ‘\nUnseen children: access and achievement in education 20 years on\n’\n \nhttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/accessandachievement\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-vocational-education-the-wolf-report\n"
