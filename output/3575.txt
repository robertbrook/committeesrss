[[[Supplementary written evidence submitted by Kelly Butler, BEAMA (HOT0060)]]]I was asked at the Select Committee this week what my views were on shifting ECO into a different levy structure.&#xa0; As I said at Committee, we are supportive of the supplier delivery model which is tried and tested for many years. They have purchasing power, routes to customers and marketing weight.&#xa0; However, we do feel that it may be more transparent for customers to pursue the old Standards of Performance approach which was a fixed price levy.&#xa0; This means the suppliers are tasked to meet their obligations at a pre-determined price point.&#xa0; Under this approach the suppliers cannot apply wildly varying levies on to the customer.&#xa0; The positive is that we retain the target based obligation but with a cost ceiling.&#xa0;
