"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Scienceogram UK (RaD0009)1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis evidence is submitted on behalf of Scienceogram UK, an organisation \naiming\n to raise awareness of the amount that the UK governm\nent spends on scientific research, and highlight the disparity between this and the size of the problems that science is trying to solve.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne technique employed is to divide up spending on science and technology into pounds per person per year—and this sim\nple methodology yields some surprising results. For example, cancer kills around 30% of people, and yet we spend just £4.30 per person per year on pu\nblic-funded cancer research. Furthermore,\n cancer is by far the best-funded medical condition—stroke is resp\nonsible for 10% of deaths, and yet just 28p per person per year is spent on research. More information is available on the Scienceogram website\n.\n \n(\nAn edited extract\n on health research spending is available in the \nAppendix\n.\n)\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are strong proponents of open data. Most of the data used on \nscienceogram.org\n has been obtained from publicly available sources, with supplementary data obtained from gover\nnment sources. All of \nour result\ns\n,\n together with calculations\n,\n are available online.\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScientific research and innovation are vital to the UK economy, our health and our lifestyles. We believe that putting science and technology funding into context, through the use of per capit\na figures and other such techniques, would be useful when making science funding policy decisions, and additionally makes an extremely important but potentially arcane topic more accessible. We would \nlike to see wider participation in the debate surroundin\ng science funding both within politics and the public, and hope that the insights we have gained in developing the Scienceogram can be of use to the Committee in commissioning reports or inquiries to that end.\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have divided our submission into three sect\nions:\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NAO’s recent report\n draws together a range of pre-existing data on public and private inputs to UK R&amp;D, and provides a useful official compilation of \nthis information. However, we would argue that the kinds of data presented—past inputs and international comparisons—are not the most useful context in which to consider R&amp;D spending.\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor instance, whilst the data presented do make it clear that the UK cou\nld invest more when compared to many other economically successful countries, international comparisons are an unsophisticated tool for determining what a country should spend on science. Desired and expected outputs—rather than others’ inputs—should infor\nm levels of spending.\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditionally, the NAO report does not fully reflect recent changes in UK science funding. This is understandable, given that the SET Statistics\n \nand OECD data\n \nfrom which it is drawn are necessarily post-hoc audits of spending across \na large number of institutions. For example, the SET Statistics are, at the time of writing, only available until financial year 2010–11; this limits analysis of recent budget decisions. It would be helpful for policymakers, journalists and citizens to hav\ne access to an official source of more up-to-date figures, even if they are provisional\n,\n or based on budgets rather than expenditure.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore fundamentally, the NAO report in its present form seems unlikely to engage a broad constituency of policymakers and t\nhe public. We believe that improved data collection and more accessible presentation could raise the profile of research in politics and allow a wider debate about R&amp;D funding and policy.\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have a number of specif\nic recommendations which\n could be suitable\n for a follow-up report or committee inquiry, presented in the third section of this submission, starting at paragraph \n20\n.\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is very likely that the net effect of the 2010 and 2013 Spending Review decisions constitutes a substantial real-terms cut in science funding over the term of this parliament.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs mentioned above, the most recent SET Statistics are those from FY2010–11, meaning that only one year of public R&amp;D funding numbers is available \nsince \nCSR2010. According to these numbers, total public spending on science fell from £10.7bn in 2009–10 to £\n10.0bn in 2010–11; a 7% cut, and the largest real-terms drop in per capita research spending since the SET data began in 1986\n.\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is difficult to ascertain what exactly has happened to public funding of R&amp;\nD since then, but there are strong indications that the trajectory is downwards. The two major sources of R&amp;D funding within government are the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), which disburses resource and capital funding directly to u\nniversities and research councils, and individual departments’ R&amp;D budgets. \n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are currently in correspondence with BIS and, though we have yet to complete our analysis, we understand from the figures provided that the annual budget from 2011–15 has been \ncut in real terms compared to the 2010–11 baseline.\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFigures obtained by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE) suggest that other departments have been reducing the proportion of research within their budgets, which are themselves being cut.\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA r\necent report by grassroots campaigning organisation Science is Vital\n attempted to gauge the impacts of these cuts on the ground. An online survey of nearly 900 working and former scientists found that 85% were worried about funding, and 68% were concerned\n about their employment (a figure which rises to 90% if you exclude principal investigators, many of whom have permanent positions). Over half of respondents reported reduced success in grant applications since 2010.\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are also broader policy implicati\nons from the way spending has been allocated. Over a third of capital spending on science between 2010 and 2015 was announced in a number of windfalls by the Chancellor. Disbursing funding through these unpredictable ‘fiscal events’ leads to uncertainty ab\nout science spending in the long term, making planning difficult at all levels, from individual research scientists considering their own careers to multinational companies considering investments in the UK.\n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther, the windfalls have largely been earmark\ned for a range of specified projects, from green computing to graphene. Where to direct research money has typically been the domain of practising scientists via peer-review panels; instead, these decisions about the allocation of science funding were made\n at high levels within government. Strategic direction of funding by central government is not in itself a bad thing; however, this change has seemingly occurred without the opportunity for consultation or debate.\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary, the 2010 and 2013 Spending Rev\niews have had significant financial and po\nlicy repercussions for science.\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScience and technology have widespread impacts on everyday life, and their funding should be an issue with broader political recognition a\nmong both policymakers and the public. Comprehensive and \ncomprehensible statistics are vital to inform future science funding decisions, and to facilitate wider engagement with this important issue.\n \n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe suggest that further collation of data is needed for \nmeaningful and accessible analysis of R&amp;D spending, extending the NAO report to include a more detailed breakdown of funding and additional context so that this disaggregated data can be understood. This would require:\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently available science and technology spending data are usually divided up either according to internal governmental budgetary divisions (for example by research council or department), or by tradition\nal subject area (such as physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, maths, social science, etc). Whilst these do have some policy relevance, they are not as important as the ultimate aims of research activities, and do not allow spending to be put into cont\next. (For example, there is no obvious imperative for a certain specific level of investment in the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBSRC], or the subject of physics, considered in the abstract.)\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend collecting data on R&amp;D \nspending in cross-departmental, interdisciplinary thematic areas based on socioeconomic goals. These goals could include health, energy, food, and so on. Such categorisation is arguably the best lens through which to view science and technology funding fro\nm both a public interest and a policy perspective. Further granularity within these socioeconomic goals (e.g. specific diseases within the health research portfolio) would be very useful for more detailed comparisons.\n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is, of course, important not to neg\nlect research which does not have an immediate and predictable application. Public-funded ‘basic’ or ‘blue-skies’ research has resulted in many extremely significant discoveries, from lasers to the internet, whose full importance would have been impossible\n for contemporary technologists to have understood. Therefore, focusing on research with a defined socioeconomic impact at the expense of more general investigation could be deleterious for scientific progress. It would nonetheless be valuable to collect t\nhese data on basic research funding alongside more applied science.\n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe SET Statistics do make some attempt to divide spending into themes, but there are large uncertainties resulting from the underlying methodology. Indeed, according to BIS, ‘these calcul\nations are not very meaningful’\n because the survey asks respondents to report how much of their expenditure ‘relates’ to specified categories, without requiring a thorough or consistent audit of spending. Additionally, ‘general advancement of knowledge’ a\nccounts for nearly half of spending, but is not broken down further.\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome further information on the component of general advancement of knowledge funded by universities is available through, for example, the Higher Education Funding Council for England \n(H\nEFCE) breakdown of mainstream quality-related funding.\n This is categorised by academic subject\ns\n (known as ‘units of assessment’). However, research into a particular subject could touch on one or many socioeconomic objectives, and further uncertainty is i\nntroduced because these block grants need not be spent on the area for which they are allocated.\n27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilar ambiguity exists in departmental R&amp;D spending data due to the diversity of funding sources. For example, medical research is funded through research c\nouncils such as BBSRC and MRC via BIS; the Department of Health; and money allocated to universities via the Higher Education Funding Councils. Aggregating these figures is not, as far as we know, currently possible.\n28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe creating a single authoritat\nive source of well-curated data broken down by socioeconomic goal would be a worthwhile priority for the Committee.\nThe socio-economic scale of science funding\n29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe context most relevant to science funding is the scale of thes\ne socioeconomic goals. We therefore recommend that the Committee collect data to quantify the magnitude of these challenges. \n30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe best way to set this context will vary by category of research, and there may be multiple perspectives from which to view each one. For example, in the case of health, the Scienceogram compares spending on disease research to the fraction of deaths cau\nsed by those diseases, as well as their total economic cost (as mentioned in the \nIntroduction\n—additional detail is available in the \nAppendix\n).\n31\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor energy research, the simples\nt comparison is purely economic. The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) reports that we spend around £2200 per capita on energy.\n Energy prices are also increasing rapidly: the UK per capita spend on energy increased by 60% \nin real terms \nbetwe\nen 2001 and 2011. The combined spend by \nUK \nresearch co\nuncils and the EU on\n energy research amounts to just over £5 per person per year—less than 0.25% of \nthe current\n total.\n32\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are many different ways to make these comparisons; for example, energy \nresearch should also be considered in the context of the effects that energy generation has on the climate. The choice of comparators inevitably has a subjective and political component, and judicious use of multiple comparisons allows conclusions to be ro\nbust and politically neutral.\n33\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that the Committee consider appropriate comparators to a variety of categories of science spending and collate those figures alongside a thematic summary of science spending.\nEstimating the cost of scientific obje\nctives\n34\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnother perspective which can be used to put science funding into context is the historical and projected costs of achieving specific scientific goals. There is a widespread misconception that research objectives, such as medical treatments or\n new e\nnergy technologies, can\n be considered to be a certain number of years away. However, it is common for resource constraints to be a bottleneck in \nscience (for example, experiments could often be run in parallel if sufficient resources were available); it is\n therefore more instructive to imagine that scientific goals are a certain number of person-hours, or an investment, away from fruition.\n35\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example, a 2002 German government analysis estimated that developing nuclear fusion to the point of viable electric\nity generation would cost between €60 and €80 billion.\n Whilst such estimates are inherently uncertain, this figure is comparable to the cost of large public infrastructure projects, but with transformative implications for global energy production.\n36\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe re\nsources and skills upon which the Select Committee can draw could allow similar estimates on a variety of socioeconomic and scientific goals from across UK R&amp;D to be developed in consultation with experts.\n37\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfficial data on research funding group\ned by socioeconomic objective should be collected. Assessment of R&amp;D funding should then take place within a context set by the scale of socioeconomic and scientific challenges being addressed. This framework would allow policymakers and the public to part\nake in more informed debate and decisions around public funding of research. \nThe government should make these statistics publicly available, and integrate them into R&amp;D funding targets.\n38\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDr Andrew Steele is a bioinformat\nician at K\nings College London. His\n work is funded by the ERC, and he has previously received grants from EPSRC and STFC.

And it’s argua\nbly the best-funded medical condition—looking at other big killers paints a stark picture of the state of UK medical research funding.\n40\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHeart disease is responsible for around 15% of deaths, and yet we spend just £1.30 per person per year researching it. St\nroke is the third most deadly individual condition, responsible for 10% of deaths; stroke research receives just 28 pence per person per year. So, astonishingly, these three conditions are responsible for over half of the deaths in the UK, and yet we inves\nt less than £6 per person per year to try to understand their causes and find new treatments.\n41\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLooking at mortality statistics starts to give a sense of scale to measure up health research spending, but what doesn’t kill you can nonetheless have a huge effe\nct on your quality of life. It would be a mistake to concentrate our research solely on the most fatal conditions. For example, dementia has a \nmassive effect on quality of life, but the condition itself is rarely fatal. It affects one in six people over 80\n; we spend about 60p per person per year researching it.\n42\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe suffering caused by illness should be reason enough to invest more seriously in looking for treatments. However, diseases also come with a significant economic cost. Firstly, there’s the substant\nial direct cost, in terms of health and social care for sufferers. Secondly, there are large indirect costs, such as friends and family members taking time off work to care for loved ones. The total economic impact of the four diseases mention\ned is over £8\n00 per UK citizen\n per year. This makes the combined £6.50 we each spend researching all four of these conditions look rather paltry.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nscienceogram.org\n \nScienceogram\n UK\n, Data\n.\n \nscienceogram.org/in-depth/data/\n \nNAO memorandum: Research and \nDevelopment funding for science and technology, July 2013\n.\n \nwww.nao.org.uk/report/nao-memorandum-research-and-development-in-the/\n \nScience, engineering and technol\nogy (SET) \nstatistics 2012, September 2012.\n \nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/science-engineering-and-technology-set-statistics-2012\n \n OECD M\nain Sc\nience and Technology Indicators.\n \nstats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MSTI_PUB\n \nScienceogram\n UK\n, Data\n.\n \nscienceogram.org/in-dep\nth/data/\n \nOngoing correspondence with BIS, August 2013\n.\n \nCampaign for Science and Engineering: Government R&amp;D hit by disproportionate cuts, October 2012\n.\n \nsciencecampaign.org.uk/?p=11131\n \n \nScience\n is Vital: Legacy of the 2010 Science Budget Cash Freeze, June 2013\n.\n \nscienceisvital.org.uk/2013/06/17/legacy-of-the-2010-science-budget-cash-fr\neeze-final-report/\n \nBIS Ministerial Correspondence Unit, April 2013.
