\nMs Hadjivassiliou: No, I think\n I will\n go to the questions.\n \nThe opening statement is that the levels of youth unemployment at the moment across \nEurope\n, in my opinion, are unacceptably high.\n \nI a\nm encouraged to see that policymakers, at both \nEU and national level, have realised that they have to act as a matter of urgency.\n \nPersonally\n,\n I am not sure that some of the measures proposed are sufficient to addre\nss the magnitude of the problem\n but at least a start has been made. \nThe Chairman: An opening statement from you, Mr Mascherini?\nMr Mascherini: \nNo. \nI would like to thank the Committee for the invitation and I look forward to the questions.\nThe Chairman: \nThank you for coming. \nProfessor Simmons? \nProfessor Simmons: Likewise\n, thank you for the invitation\n but I would like to proceed to the questions.\nQ110 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Thank you.\n \nI have to advise the witnesses that some questions will be more relevant to them than others.\n \nEach witness is not expected to provid\ne an answer for every question. \nI think you will probably be relieved to hear\n that\n.\nA central element of the EU’s approach to tackling youth unemployment is the Youth Guarantee.\n \nCould you summarise for us your understanding of the extent to which this has been taken up across the EU and whether there are signs that it is achieving any results yet?\n \nIf there are statistics available, perhaps you could identify the fact that they are and then\n it would be very useful if you could send \nthem to us as a ba\nckup. \nWho wants to answer that question? \nMr Mascherini: I can start.\n \nThe concept of the Youth Guarantee was born in Scandinavian countries in the 1980s and is based on the concept that young people are guaranteed an opp\nortunity a certain amount of time after\n becoming unemployed or finishing their education.\n \nAt the European level the discussion about\n the\n Youth Guarantee started in 2005 when the European Council encouraged member state\ns to guarantee an opportunity for\n young \npeople four months after\n becoming unemployed.\nThe discussion has gone on for years and the European Pa\nrliament realised the need to guarantee an opportunity for young people. \nIn December 2012 the European Commission \nmade a proposal for a youth guarantee\n to the European Council.\n \nThat has been endorsed and published by the European Council on 22 April.\n On the basis of the European C\nouncil recommendation, the guarantee is that every young person\n has to receive an opportunity four months after\n becoming unemployed or finishing educati\non\n.\n \nThat can be an educational position, a study place, an apprenticeship, an internship, training or\n an offer of\n a job within four months.\n \nThis happened last April.\n \nNow member states are required to submit an implementation plan for the Youth Guarantee.\n \nThe deadline is December 2013 for those member states that have a\nn un\nemployment rate higher than 25%;\n otherwise it is spring 2014 for the other member states.\n \nThe level of unemployment below or above 25% is the condition for accessing funding.\n \nIn this regard, €6 billion has been made available for those re\ngions whose un\nemployment rates are\n above 25%.\n \nThis is linked to the submission of the implementation plan to the European Commission.\n \nThis is the status, I would say. \nThe Chairman: Do you think that it is going to improve?\n \nHas it been instrumental in getting a move on in terms \nof\n the opportunities for these people who have been unemployed for four months? \nMr Mascherini: Yes.\n Data is available from\n the evaluation of \nthe Finnish Youth Guarantee, which\n is the model that is taken as an example.\n From that we see that the first development plan was\n carried out for 93% of young people within two weeks of their\n registration with\n the Public Employment Services.\n \nAfter three months\n,\n 72% of young people who partic\nipated in this programme were no longer unemployed\n.\n \nHalf of them \nwere in the labour market, 20% were\n in education or training, but there is no data for the remaining 30% who\n have\n disappear\ned\n from the statistics.\n \nThis is an official\n evaluation by\n the Finnish Government, and I w\nould be happy to share the source of that with you.\nThe Chairman: That would be very kind and very helpful.\n \nYou feel slightly optimistic but\n you are\n still worrying about\n those who do not have anything. \nDid\n you say \n30% or 13%?\nMr Mascherini: Slightly above 30% disappear\n.\n \nFurther research on those for whom there \nis no information is\n crucial in order to fully understand the effectiveness of these guarantees, even though the numbers are positive in comparison to other programmes.\nMs Hadjivassiliou: Similar\nly\n to the Finnish results\n, an\n evaluation\n of the \nYouth Guarantee scheme in \nSweden\n has\n shown that participants find a job faster than a control group\n which does\n not have the support of the Youth Guarantee.\n We have some data from\n \nAustria\n and,\n although there is a high dropout rate from their \nparticipants, of those \nwho participate\nd\n in the Youth Guarantee in 2010\n,\n \nabout 58% \nfound a job after three\n months\n and\n 63% found a job after 12 months\n.\nThat said, my \nconcern—and not only my concern,\n commentators h\nave mentioned this—\nis the amount available, the \n€6 billion.\n It is welcome\n but\n,\n given the magnitude of the problem\n, it is considered in\n some quarters to be insufficient.\n \nFor example, the ILO have estimated that for a proper implementation of the Y\nouth Guarantee one would need €\n21 billion, so you can see \nthe difference. \nThe Chairman: Goodness gracious\n, t\nhe difference between €6 billion and €21 billion. \nMs Hadjivassiliou: Yes, but that is an ILO estimate.\n \nI am just saying\n that those are\n \nthe \narguments that are\n out\n there at the moment.\nThe Chairman: There i\ns \njust\n one poi\nnt I want to\n clarify before I forget it.\n \nWhat is the dropout rate?\n \nYou said the dropout rate. \nMs Hadjivassiliou: I do not have it here but I can send it to the Committee.\n That was for \nAustria\n.\nThe other thing is \nthat the Eurofound study on the\n Youth Guarantee shows that there are some critical factors for the success of the Youth Guarantee, one of which is capacity, Public Employment Services capacity, quality of advice and number of advisers.\n \nThere is a big discrepancy in the capacity of Public Employment Services across the EU\n,\n as you can imagine.\n The Youth E\nmployment \nI\nnitiative\n is front\nloaded for 2014 and 2015\n. I do not know whether there\n is enough space to develop the capacity in member states if it is not adequate.\nAlso, in a number of member states the Youth Guarantee is delivered through the Public Employment Service\ns\n.\n \nT\nhe coverage of young people who\n are supported by the Public Employment Service\ns\n also varies across the EU.\n \nIn \nLithuania\n it is \n25% of young people.\n \nWhat will happen to the\n other\n 75% of young people?\n T\nhere are these issues.\n \nI am sure they are going to be \nironed out but tho\nse are\n the issues at the moment\n.\nThe Chairman: Do you have \nanything\n to add to that, Professor Simmons? \nProfessor Simmons: Yes.\n \nThe ILO have done quite a good report on this, called \nStudies on Growth with Equity\n.\n \nT\nhey look at the Finnish and \nSwedish Youth Guarantee and provide some case studies of how that operates.\n \nI can forward that to you.\nThe main thing it\n is useful to think through is what that guarantee consists of.\n Evidence shows that if the\n guarantee consists of labour market reintegration it is likely to be more successful than concentration on education and training.\n \nF\nor example, the Swedish and \nFinnish model concentrates on reintegrating back into the workplace.\n \nFurther afield there are similar schemes in \nAustralia\n and \nNew Zealand\n that\n concentrate mainly on reintegration into education\n, and success rates are \nsignificantly worse, below 50%.\nThe other thing th\nat is quite interesting is \nthe delivery models.\n \nIn \nAustralia\n and \nNew Zealand\n that is a highly marketised system, in many ways similar to many of the support services in \nEngland\n, with quite a lot of competition and duplication.\n \nThat appears to be less successful than the Nordic model with the Public Employment Service.\nQ111 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: In \nFinland\n and \nSweden\n how are the jobs created in order to give them to the people who are being looked after?\n I can see that in\n education\n government can do that and \nin p\nublic services g\novernment\n can do that to a certain extent\n, but h\now are the jobs created for \npeople to occupy? \nMr Mascherini: In the Finnish Youth Guarantee the jobs\n basically\n are not created but employers are helped in hiring young people through incentiv\nes. E\nach young person who participates in the programme and is thought to be ready for the labour market is provided\n with\n a voucher.\n \nIt is called\n a\n Sanssi\n card and it \nremoves part of the salary\n from\n the employer for a certain amount of time.\n \nThe par\nt that is removed is different for an apprenticeship or \na real job.\n \nThere is data showing that after the voucher \nexpires\n, most of those who\n have started a\n work relationship keep the work relationship alive, so they remain in the labour market after the conclusion of the voucher.\nQ112 &#xa0; \nLord Clinton-Davis: After the change of Government in \nAustralia\n, do you anticipate any changes so far as this policy is concerned? \nProfessor Simmons: It is difficult to say.\n \nI do not think there will be radical changes because I think broadly the new Government has a quite similar outlook generally to the old one, so I would not see them shifting towards a more Finnish or Swedish model. \nThe Chairman: That is an interesting point.\n \nDo you think that in even in countries where\n the Government and O\npposition are quite opposed to one another in a fundamental\n way \nthey come together with youth unemployment because it is a general worry to everybody? \nProfessor Simmons: I suppose if you look at the Anglophone nations in particular, with varying degrees, largely policies within a neo-liberal framework—and there is the emphasis mainly on supply side rather than demand—the Nordic countries have mediat\ned that to some degree and \ntheir policies\n have\n stimulated demand more than the Anglophone nations. \nQ113 &#xa0; \nBaroness Hooper: I want\n to come back to the Finnish example that you quoted and the 30% who did not continue in the scheme, who disappeared from the scheme.\n \nWhat is the difference between that and being a dropout?\nMr Mascherini: There is\n one-\nthird for which they have no data, so they do not kn\now if they became self-employed or if they are at work but there is\n no record.\n \nThis is the difference between the dropouts\n, \nbecause among them there can be\n a\n part that is a dropout and another part that maybe is at work but there is no record because data has \nbeen discontinued\n. \nThe Chairman: The black economy, we call it here. \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Are there any other Europe\nan countries offering \nsubsidies\n, effectively\n?\n \nThe vouchers are subsidies, are they not? \nMr Mascherini: I think there are other countries that offer incentives or subsidies.\n \nOne is \nSweden\n and then maybe you have other data.\n \nAnother thing, for example, is negative incentives.\n \nThis is a measure that I found in \nFrance\n where large companies need to have 4% of their labour force as apprentices.\n \nIf they do not have this 4%, if they have a lower share, their taxes are raised for that figure.\n \nThese are negative incentives that are the opposite of the positive i\nn some sense\n. \nQ114 &#xa0; \nLord Fearn: The European Social Fund and the additional funds from the Youth Employment Initiative are the main financial contributions to tackling youth unemployment at a European level.\n \nWhat in your view are the ways in which member states have used ESF \nto address the current problems\n and are proposing to use these instruments in the new programming in the new period?\n \nWhat value do they add, if any? \nMs Hadjivassiliou: T\nhe ESF has supported polic\nies targeted\n at unemployed young people in a variety of ways.\n \nThe main types of polici\nes can be summarised as those\n that are aimed at preventing early school leaving.\n \nThere are some successful examples like the second-chance schools across Europe\n,\n and in \nFrance\n in particular\n that has\n very good reintegration rates.\n \nHowever, \nthere is concern even from the C\nommission that the availability of data\n and\n monitoring needs to be improved for the policies that target early school leaving.\n \nAlso we need to know more, even after all these\n years of\n doing research in this area, about the drivers of early school leaving.\nThe other types of policies are to promote the skills that are relevant to the labour market in a variety of ways, like curricula reforms.\n A\nt the moment\n \nPoland\n is und\nergoing a major curricula reform\n to link learning outcomes to employer requirements.\n \nCyprus\n \nis undergoing\n a major curricula reform as well\nThe other area is supporting first work experience and on-the-job training, for the simple reason that employers across \nEurope\n repeatedly say that one of the major barriers to them employing a young person \nis lack of work experience. T\nhere is a big push towards traineeships\n—internships in the \nUK\n; t\nraineeship is\n the c\nommission-speak for internship\ns\n and work experience placement\n—and t\nhere is a big push for apprenticeships.\nThe third one is improving access to the labour market for the first job, through subsidies and voucher schemes\n,\n and \npromotion of entrepreneurship and\n self-employment among young people.\n \nThere are a number of programmes supporting this.\nYou can imagine that the effectiveness is mixed\n because\n of this wide range of policies in a \nwide ran\nge of countries\n.\n \nThere are some examples wher\ne it has been very effective. A\npprenticeship schemes\n, if they are well designed, \ntend to be very effective in a particular context.\n \nWe have just finished an EU-wide overview of apprenticeships and trai\nneeships across \nEurope\n for the \nC\nommission, and we saw that the labour market int\negration rate ranges between \n60% to even 90% in some cases.\n \nTraineeships can be effective, but less so unless they are well designed and targeted.\n \nAgain\n,\n the integration rate ranges, but there the lowest is 35% and the \nhighest\n&#xad;\n—\nif it is to do with \ngraduates, not surprisingly—\ncan be 90%.\n \nMy point is that effectiveness is not black or white, it is mixed\n,\n and it depends on the particula\nr context of implementation, co\n-\no\nrdination and also employer buy-\nin.\nMr Mascherini: Member states have used ESF, as Kari said, through three main ways.\n \nOne is investment in education and training that can be preventing or reintegrating early school leavers or providing training.\n \nIn this regard, from 2007 to 2012 20 million young people under 25 benefited from the ES\nF through the participation in one of these\n programmes.\n \nIn some countries young people account for almost\n half of all the participants in\n ESF activities.\n \nA good pract\nice in the \nUK\n, for example, is the\n hothouse project in \nCornwall\n that aims at\n preventing early school leaving.\nThe other strand of activities is to bridge the gap between education and the labour market\n through various activities such as \nindividual career guidance, apprentice\nship, fostering mobility or through helping young peopl\ne to set up their own business\n.\n These are the sort\n of \nESF \nactivities that have been used by the member states.\nIn recent years there is evidence that approximately €16 billion has been reallocated in t\nhe chapter of employment in order to speed up the access of young people into the l\nabour market in training and \nemployment.\n \nThis is expected to help around 1 million young people in \nEurope\n and 55,000 small companies.\nG\niving a chance to all young people is another area where member states have used the ESF, especially for removing practical and logistic\nal barriers for\n the most vulnerable, \nfor example the Danish Hold on Tight Caravan p\nroject.\n \nThat helps to support\n \nthe integration of those with an immigration\n background into\n society.\n \nThis has contributed to\n a\n decrease\n in \nschool leaving from 20% to below 14%\n,\n more or less.\nFinally\n,\n the future.\n \nI think that\n these\n instrument\ns\n, the youth employment i\nnitiatives and the ESF\n,\n will be potentially used for the implem\nentation of the Youth Guarantee\n because it guarantees a longer-term programme.\n \nIt is a national commitment, so member states have to finance the Youth Guarantee and the budget.\n \nThe European Commission can top up the Youth Guarantee through the Youth Employmen\nt Initiatives and the ESF.\n \nThe youth employment i\nnitiatives that are the €6 billion will be used for programmes that are linked to individuals, such as vouchers for training apprenticeships or financial support to help young people to set up t\nheir own busi\nness\n.\n \nConversely, the ESF \nstill would be used\n for the individual but also to promote\n and support\n structural reform in the countries\n, for example education, \nthe Public Employment Services and job search strategies, at least in \nthe member states that need it\n. \nThe Chairman: Do you think there is a confusion between the two?\n \nIs it right to have two or could they not be consolidated?\n \nGoing back to the question that Lord Fearn asked, what value do they add? \nMr Mascherini: I think t\nhe value that they add\n \nis\n that \nthey provide the opportunity to implement the new programmes, for example. \nProfessor Simmons: \nI j\nust \nhave \na couple of points to add.\n \nIn some ways it is a difficult question to answer because it is a highly variable situation between different European nations.\n \nSuccess or otherwise relates very much to individual state-level policy.\n \nT\nhat is one difficulty in answering the question.\n \nThe other difficulty is that in many ways it is quite early in the process to evaluate it.\n \nTraineeships were mentioned earlier.\n \nIn the \nUK\n context in particular, that is a very recent development, so it is quite hard to say.\nOne general observation \nis\n that\n entrepreneurship and so on has probably been done less well through this initiative than it could be.\n In particular in\n the \nUK\n context, historically we did this quite well.\n \nI am thinking of things like the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, an MSC programme back in the 1980s, that was really quite successful and many businesses that exist today were brought on through that as seed corn.\n \nMy impression is that that particular element\n of this\n initiative is perhaps not as well developed as the education and training initiatives and so on.\nThe Chairman: \nIt is p\nrobably too formulaic and does not allow for the inspiration\n and the pizazz.\nQ115 &#xa0; \nBaroness Valentine: Forgive me if you have touched on this already.\n \nIt is following on in the same vein.\n \nAll the things you have listed that are being done by member states you would have thought any self-respecting member state would do with or without European involvement.\n \nIs there a redistributive point in here?\n \nIs one trying to get more cash from the north to the south or the south\n-\nwest to the east, and/or is there a best-practice transfer?\n \nIs it just a money point?\n \nAre we trying to add some more money to what the member states would be paying anyway, and is that not just pooling the money and putting it back out again?\n \nWhere is the slice of added value? \nMs Hadjivassiliou: I do not know whether my answer will satisfy you, bu\nt \nit is definitely the case that the user base varies across the \nEU\n and for the southern European countries\n.\n I am Greek\n so I should know\n that\n.\n \nAlso\n for the eastern European \ncountries and some smaller countries\n like \nMalta\n, \nthe European Social Fund in \ngeneral has\n been a key driver in developing policies in areas where there was no money or even no policy expertise.\n So there has been a transfer of learning from countries that are more developed in certain areas to others, especially in the youth employment area and social inclusion. In that sense, there is a transfer of learning. On the other hand\n,\n learning is two ways, so I was surprised when I read recently—not for youth unemployment—that the German Labour Inspectorate was totally reorganised after a peer review visit in another country. Learning is two ways. I would not like to think that it is only that the northern European countries teach the other countries how to do things. \nThere are other kinds of learning, for example through the European Mutual Learning Programme and the peer reviews that exist. There was a recent one in \nthe Hague\n at the end of November where the countries presented their policies and there was a synthesis paper. There is a lot of interaction in learning so I would not like to minimise the importance of the ESF and the structure of funds, but it is not just the money, it is the whole learning and exchange of experience process that goes with it.\nBaroness Valentine: Is there a trend to give the money to the newer countries?\nMs Hadjivassiliou: The allocation of funds depends on the need. Also the ESF is helping the \nUK\n. For example, TAPS is an apprentice scheme in the \nUK\n that is funded by the ESF, so it is not just that the money goes to the eastern European countries.\nThe Chairman: You have a huge amount of information available in your head. Do you think that you could share it with us, not now because we obviously have a time limit today?\nMs Hadjivassiliou: Yes, by all means.\nThe Chairman: If you could\n give us another example, like \nyou gave us from \nthe Hague\n, \nit would be most helpful.\nMs Hadjivassiliou: Yes, we can definitely\n do that, and\n I am very happy to.\nThe Chairman: Thank you very much. Also\n let me say to\n the two other witnesses, if you feel that there is some experience that you suddenly think about that could\n shed\n some light \non \nthis whole thing it would be very useful to have it\n.  W\ne never know the nuggets we have not managed to find.\nQ116 &#xa0; \nLord Freeman: My question is to Professor Simmons. If we could look back now over the last 50 years—you very helpfully have just mentioned one lesson that we could learn—are there other lessons that we can learn from past recessions and past high levels of youth unemployment?\nProfessor Simmons: Yes, I think there are lessons that can be learned. Each recession has a disproportionately large effect upon young people. Although it affects the population in general, the effect upon young people is deeper. The way that successive Governments have tried to address that, particularly since the 1970s, has been largely through focusing on the supply side. Education and training of various sorts is, of course, very important. However, it is only part of the equation and I think largely the demand side has been neglected. Where deman\nd-\nside initiatives have been tried, I think they have been relatively successful. I look back to some of the MSC programmes, which at the time were highly criticised. For example, the community programme was a nationwide MSC-funded programme that stimulated the demand for labour and provided work-based learning for trainees on it.\nI guess that is the main thing, although the other thing to say is that in some ways it is a false dichotomy to talk about a division between supply side and demand side because the tw\no things interact. Poor-quality work and poor-\nquality training can have a deleterious effect upon young people and discourage them from further labour market engagement. There needs to be a concentration on quality because poor\n-\nquality provision, whether that is in the workplace or education and training, can in some ways be more damaging than waiting for something that is more suitable.\nLord Freeman: Very helpful, thank you.\nQ117 &#xa0; \nLord Clinton-Davis: You have referred to the situation that persists in other European Union countries. I am concerned about the approach in this country. Do you think what the Government is doing is effective, relevant, can be improved?\nProfessor Simmons: I am happy to answer that. I think there are some things to be praised, for example the promotion of apprenticeships is broadly a good thing but the way that it is being delivered in many ways is highly problematic. Many of the programmes labelled as apprenticeships stretch the meaning of the term beyond reality and the quality is highly variable. So the principle of increasing apprenticeships is really good but the practice is problematic. \nOther than that, I think there are three problems with the \nUK\n approach. One I have menti\noned already, which is the over\nconcentration on \nthe \nsupply side and the lack of recognition that supply and demand interacts. Another area that is problematic is a marketised system of delivery, particularly for education and training. For example, within one local authority you could have 100 providers of education and training programmes, public, private, voluntary sector, charitable organisations and so on. I think for young people and their parents that is a very difficult mishmash to see through and to negotiate. Also organisations competing against each other for business sometimes works very well but on the ground that can be problematic for young people who are put on programmes that are sometimes not suitable because the funding is attached to the young person as a unit of resource. So I think the marketised thing is problematic.\nLord Clinton-Davis: Are these points raised in the debates that occur about the issue in \nEurope\n? Are we doing something quite unique as far as this is concerned? Is it being followed by other people?\nProfessor Simmons: I do not think it is unique. There is highly variable practice in the different European nations although in many ways the \nUK\n context is more similar to other Anglophone nations, for example \nAustralia\n and \nNew Zealand\n. If you look at how well the \nUK\n is doing, in a way it is EU average, so okay, but in reality the \nUK\n is doing much worse in terms of youth unemployment than the countries that it would traditionally compare itself to, particularly \nGermany\n. It depends how you look at it but, compared to \nBritain\n’s traditional industrial rivals, it is doing relatively badly.\nThe third point is that the other problem with the \nUK\n approach is coercion. I think there is a balance to be had between carrot and stick. I am not a hopeless romantic, some young people do need to be robustly encouraged; the minority as well by the way but there are some. However, if they are encouraged into low\n-\nquality provision\n,\n that will have a further deleterious effect. That would be my overall observation of the \nUK\n context.\nQ118 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Thank you very much. Do you think that the \nUK\n approach is consistent in other EU countries, a similar sort of approach, or are we doing things so differently that maybe this is why the differences come up between \nUK\n and \nGermany\n?\nProfessor Simmons: The \nUK\n system is very different to \nGermany\n. For example, I mentioned apprenticeships earlier and people are probably aware of the traditional German system of apprenticeship, and also \nAustria\n. Other northern European nations are much more robust than the \nUK\n system. I think there are some qualitative differences there.\nThe Chairman: Going though this today, I have the feeling that there are many initiatives and not all of them can be of the same value. What are the better ones? Lord Kakkar, you would like to come into that.\nQ119 &#xa0; \nLord Kakkar: You mentioned a few moments ago that the approaches are quite different and youth unemployment has been a particular feature of every recession and the responses are different in different member states. Has the recovery of the youth element from those recessions also been different across \nEurope\n? Cumulatively, recession after recession, has the position of youth employment in this country been left at a particular disadvantage in comparison to the rest of \nEurope\n as the member states come out of recession?\nThe Chairman: Sorry, we have not given you notice of that question but I am sure you can deal with it.\nProfessor Simmons: Again, it is variable. The condition of youth unemployment in the Mediterranean states is much worse than that in the \nUK\n. I think that is related to some degree to socio-historical traditions and particular labour markets or the absence of a solid youth labour market that used to exist in the \nUK\n. Youth unemployment levels in \nGermany\n, \nBelgium\n, \nFinland\n and so on have held up much better than those of the \nUK\n since 2008. There is evidence, looking at all these dimensions, that there is good practice to spread. The evidence is there, but I think \nit is difficult to get certain G\novernments to recognise that.\nLord Kakkar: Does that mean that in times of economic growth we have a structurally weaker youth employment market as a result of a previous lack of attention?\nProfessor Simmons: Yes, that would be my observation. In particular in the \nUK\n what we are getting is many adult workers competing for what was traditionally youth employment, so trading down and squeezing young people out of what were, essentially, pockets of the youth labour market. That is a particular feature of the \nUK\n that is quite observable.\nThe Chairman: May I just remind everybody that we are now running out of time. We have about 15 minutes left so\n would you\n keep the answers quite short.\nQ120 &#xa0; \nBaroness Hooper: A quick supplementary, which to some extent we have bypassed: when you first referred to the broad definition of apprenticeships in the \nUK\n as being not an advantage, what would be your preferred definition?\nProfessor Simmons: Just to put a little flesh on the bones, for example calling a six-month programme in a retail outlet an apprenticeship is extremely different to a robust\n three-year programme with high-\nlevel qualifications, let us say within Rolls-Royce or British Aerospace. I think there needs to be a definition about level, length and content. That could be debated but I think at the moment it is too fluid.\nMs Hadjivassiliou: In response to a previous question, a distinctive characteristic of the crisis that we have had in the last few years—and Massimiliano can correct me—is that it affected graduates, highly skilled young people, much more than in previous recessions. I was just checking the latest figures for NEET in Europe and for young pe\nople with upper secondary, post-\nsecondary and tertiary education levels—the so-called more skilled than the usual group of NEETs we tend to associate with—over 50% are classified as NEETs in countries such as the UK, the southern European countries, Ireland, Sweden, the Baltic countries, Czech Republic and the rest of it. I think there is an issue around also the highly skilled because the policy focus is usually NEETs and we feel that the general youth population, especially the highly skilled ones, will integrate more easily. But after this recession things are not like in the past so graduates find it difficult to integrate in a number of countries.\nThe Chairman: The graduates who several years ago knew they had jobs at the end of their degree and that is not the case now? \nMs Hadjivassiliou: Yes.\nThe Chairman: Yes, I think that we do have evidence of that.\nMr Mascherini: I would like to just briefly enter into the discussion. Responses to youth unemployment have been different in Europe because the problems of the member states are different in \nEurope\n. For example, in some member states the crisis has exploded youth unemployment but the labour market was already difficult before for young people. If we analyse, for example, the population of NEETs, they have very different characteristics among member states, even in countries with similar rates. For example, \nin \nSpain\n and \nItaly\n—I am Italian—they have similar NEETs rates but the population is completely different. In \nSpain\n the population of NEETs has increased as a result of the crisis, so the majority of NEETs are unemployed males with work experience. On the other hand, in \nItaly\n the majority of NEETs are inactive females without work experience because there was a problem of youth accessing the labour market even before the crisis. It is more a structural problem than a problem related to the crisis and this has created different responses to the crisis.\nQ121 &#xa0; \nEarl of Liverpool: There seem to be so many different situations in different countries that you are telling us abou\nt and obviously there is no one-size-\nfits\n-\nall solution, but we are trying to write a report on how to resolve the situation. If you were writing the report for us, what magic wand could one use to produce an idea to get everybody singing off the same hymn sheet?\nThe Chairman: A nice quick answer, please.\nProfessor Simmons: To anybody in particular? I will give you an answer then. There is no silver bullet. However, what individual nation states and the EU need to do is to develop a coherent industrial strategy, and by that I do not mean trying to reopen shipyards and coal\n \nmines that were closed 30 years ago. There are different ways of doing industrial strategies and different nation states need to think that through. For example, in the \nUK\n we need an industrial stra\ntegy for green, renewable, high-\ntech infrastructure projects, housing and so on, so my answer would be for the supply and the demand side to interact. That is far harder to implement than it is to say, but I suppose that would be my vision.\nMr Mascherini: It is a $1 million question, but I think that we can be as creative as we want with our supply side initially, the training, retraining, fostering apprenticeship or integrating early school leavers and apprenticeship and intern\nship, but if we do not have jobs how, after six months of training, do \nwe tell our young people that there is more training for the next six months\n?\n So supply side measures are important as well.\nMs Hadjivassiliou: To reinforce what the previous speakers said, as we are doing this over youth apprenticeships I was speaking to the Public Employment Services in \nGreece\n and \nCyprus\n and they said to me, “Apprentices are free to employers. We pay everything”. They do not want them because they are not sure whether they will have a business in a year’s time, and maybe this is the extreme case but this is the need for balance of supply and demand.\nThe Chairman: Yes, I can understand that. Lord Clinton-Davis, do you want to ask your question? No. If you have an answer to that prepared perhaps you could let us have it because we are up against the pipes, You have just been too interesting.\nQ122 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: I think my question, which again is about the balance between supply and demand, has been answered to a fair degree already, but I have an additional point to make. One of the traditional ways in the public service in the past in the \nUK\n was to retire people at 65 or 60 to create opportunities to bring young people in. Now with the changed legislation on retirement policy and people having to stay longer and older people competing for jobs in the market, we have a difficulty there in the \nUK\n. Is that common in other parts of Europe, where I believe they still have rather earlier retirement ages in some of the European countries than we have in the UK, or is there freedom for people to argue that they can stay on as long as they wish regardless of what the public policies are on retirement age?\nMr Mascherini: In most European countries now there is the tendency to increase the minimum age that people can \nretire at\n, for budgetary reasons as well. I think that there is conflicting evidence about the effect of increasing retirement age on the share of young people who are at work. We have observed that during this recession older workers have suffered the crisis in a very marginal way in comparison to the other age categories. We do not know basically because, for example, those countries that have a higher share of older workers are also those with a higher share of young people at work, so it is more general and broader labour market participation. However, for certain types of jobs there is no replacement of an older worker for a young worker. For other jobs, as you indicate, there is an increase in older workers being competitive in the labour market, but there is no conclusive evidence on that because we can find studies that indicate opposite directions.\nQ123 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Can I ask, if the demand side is the answer\n,\n what is the responsibility of employers? A quick response, please, or you could even think about it and write t\no us. Would that be all right? I am talking about t\nhe responsibility of employers if the real problem is on the demand side.\nProfessor Simmons: I could give you a very quick response. I think largely employers are the missing voice in this. We talk about education, training, state policy and so on but I think largely the employer voice is missing, with some exceptions, some noble exceptions by the way.\nThe Chairman: It is interesting you should say that because we have had some really cracking evidence from some employers, but there are always good eggs.\nProfessor Simmons: Yes, absolutely.\nMs Hadjivassiliou: It depends again which country we are talking about. There are countries where employers are very much present, and I am not going to mention the Germans,\n who are\n the usual suspect\ns\n here. For example, in \nLuxembourg\n a very successful traineeship programme, with over 85% of labour market integration rate, was intro\nduced on the initiative of the Chambers of C\nommerce and it was designed with the Public Employment Services in close co\n-\noperation with the employers. I think if employers see young people as the investment for the future then you see the whole thing on a different footing.\nMr Mascherini: There is variability among the member states because, for example, in Scandinavian countries Youth Guarantees are a partnership between public, private and people, and employers play their role. Also in \nGermany\n and \nAustria\n there is the question, “Why do you offer apprenticeships?” because we do. It is in our tradition to play our role there. This is a complement and it is important.\nQ124 &#xa0; \nBaroness Hooper: I think the evidence base about how youth employment should best be tackled and where the gaps in knowledge are has been pretty well covered, but is there anything you would wish to add, perhaps particularly in terms of gaps in knowledge?\nMr Mascherini: In our studies we found some gaps in evaluation of those programmes that try to involve the filters from the labour markets, so multiple disadvantages that require a multiple approach that is not just the integration into labour market but also at the beginning management schemes and then labour market schemes. We found a lack of evidence for those kind of programmes in some cases.\nMs Hadjivassiliou: In our overview, it is not about content although content is an issue. For example, existing evidence shows that active labour market policies targeted at young people tend to perform less well in general across the EU than programmes for adults. I think there is a need for further exploration especially with training, but at the more general level, impact evaluations are missing, proper rigorous impact evaluations. We have monitoring data, like so many people took part in that programme, so many people finished the programme, but in terms of labour market outcomes—and I was struck as we were doing the overview this year—I expected to find a lot of impact evaluations and, especially after the six months, how many young people who took part in this programme were still employed. It is very uneven, very patchy and overall there is a big gap there for proper impact evaluations, counterfactual evaluations and the rest of it.\nQ125 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: You have given us a lot of very interesting examples of different practice in different countries in the EU. How valuable is sharing good practice and in the past how effective has it been to do that? A final bit of that, if it is valuable, is what is a way of doing it? Is it useful to pass on good practice? In the past has it been useful? If it is useful, what is the right mechanism for doing it within the European Union?\nThe Chairman: Do\n you want to write to us on that.\nMr Mascherini: I can try to answer shortly. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time. If we have a formal evaluation of good programmes and we know that they work very well, they can serve as inspiration. All member states are different, they have their national context and their own problems, so the successful programmes need to be adapted to the other member states.\nHow can we learn from each other? The European Commission has peer reviews of most of our learning programme. It has thematic and multiple-learning programme events. There is the database of good practices. In some sense it is a process that is strengthening every year in order to find new ways of learning from each other. For example, an increasing number of member states have reported to have drawn inspiration from each other in the field of small and medium enterprises, education for apprenticeships and youth apprenticeships. This is the whole communication of the European Commission in that direction. This is just one small example.\nThe Chairman: Quick two-sentence answer.\nProfessor Simmons: It all depends what you mean by best practice. If best practice means creating highly flexible labour markets and pools of labour to pull on, we have best practice within the \nUK\n, because that is what we do. We churn young people through various sites of participation and non-participation. If we are talking about best practice as a model of social justice and high employment, I think we have talked about various examples, various nations where we can draw on good practice. Having said that, I think there is generally a gap between policy and practice.\nThe EU is a large unit and set of committees and organisations and so. How that drills down to practice on the front\n \nline, to careers advisers, teachers, training providers, it is creating that link between policymakers and practitioners that is really important.\nThe Chairman: That is very instructive. Thank you all very much indeed. You have really given us of your best and it has been most interesting. You are leaving us confused, at least me confused, not the rest of them I am sure. We are very grateful to you for spending the time and thank you. The last thing I do say is that if there is anything you think we should have asked you please answer it and write to us. Thank you.\n&#xa0;\n"
