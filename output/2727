defaultThe anticipated shortfall of places in the state sector is of concern to all involved in the education of children.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of the 1,000+ independent schools in the UK would be able and willing to provide places for state-supported pupils and the Independent Schools Council encourages the Committee to consider whether independent schools can comprise a part of the solution.
default&#xa0;
defaultIndependent schools already cater for children who have all or some of their fees defrayed by the public purse, as our submission demonstrates.  As a result, independent schools contribute to the education of a wider proportion of the British public than they are often given credit for.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe hope that the Committee’s report will note the breadth of provision already offered by the independent sector and the significance of its role in the matrix of schooling currently on offer in the country.  Our world-class schools are able to make a substantial contribution to the education of our nation’s children, particularly in areas where the need for places is most acute.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to the Local Government Association, a
defaultlmost half of England's school districts will have more primary pupils than places within two years.

defaultResearch by London Councils revealed the need for 83,470 school places to be created in London alone between 2014 and 2017, with local authorities spending £9,000 on every pupil in order to create these school places.
default  The risk is of local authorities resorting to expensive bulge classes, temporary pre-fabricated buildings or hastily conceived building projects to meet these needs without full consideration of the longer-term.
default&#xa0;defaultFrom 1997, our schools have expanded to accommodate many more pupils, as this extract from our Census shows.  Polling by 
defaultPopulus
default of adults about their education reveals that the independent sector educates between 12 and 14% of children for some or all of their schooling.
default  The same polling also reveals broad popular support for public funding of places at independent schools:  in both 2011 and 2012, the survey showed that half (51 per cent) the British public would support the use of government funds to enable children from lower income families to attend independent schools, more than twice the proportion who would oppose such funding (21 per cent).
default&#xa0;
defaultIndependent schools could therefore be a part of the solution, particularly in areas where the need for places is greatest.  Indeed, the Chief Executive of one of our member associations, IAPS, recently commented that "just as we already see in health provision, 
defaultthe private sector can relieve some of the pressure on the state".  An option for consideration must be how local authorities could work together with local independent schools to ensure that all children have a place at a school in the future.
default&#xa0;defaultLocal authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient school places to meet the present and future demand for school places. Under section 18 of the Education Act 1996, a Local Authority may pay the whole or part of the fees and expenses of pupils at independent schools. Including the independent sector as part of the solution would not need a change in legislation, merely the political will to make it happen.
default&#xa0;defaultState funding is already being applied towards independent school fees.  For example:
default&#xa0;
defaultMore than anything though, bold action in this area could be the biggest factor in building on the contribution of the independent sector to the education of our nation’s children.
default  The independent sector is keen to play it part; will government meet it half way?
