"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by CO2DeepStore Ltd (CCS39)&#xa0;CO2DeepStore\n welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the committee on CCS. The development of CCS is fundamental to the UK and international ability to mitigate the effects of climate change whilst delivering societyâ€™s energy needs. CCS is complimentary to other \nlow carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear.\n&#xa0;\nCO2DeepStore has been focused exclusively on development of CCS projects in the UK for the last 6 years. As such, we are perhaps unique in bringing a perspective of the challenges the industry face\ns to get CCS started.\n&#xa0;\nCO2DeepStore and Summit Power are joint developers of the proposed Captain Clean Energy Project, a new build IGCC plant at Grangemouth on the Forth Estuary\n. The developers are in discussion with DECC about the project.\n&#xa0;\nCO2DeepStore\n offer\ns\n the following input to the committee;\n&#xa0;\ntechnology challenges preventing its deployment at scale. CO2 \ncapture, transport and \nstorage can be delivered safely and eff\nectively. CCS will be \ncost-competitive with other low-carbon technologies\n&#xa0;\nWe would be glad to provide further input should the committ\nee require.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
