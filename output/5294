defaultWritten evidence fdefaultrom Dr Nigel Perry (CYS0122)defaultSummarydefaultThe Committee did not explicitly ask for views on the role of helmets in cycl
defaulting safety. However, while British I have been resident in New Zealand for some years and have first hand experience of how wrong and counterproductive promoting or legislating bicycle helmets is. It is important than the UK does not make the same mistakes
default.
defaultBicycling is Beneficialdefault7.1.

defaultDoes the safety risk of cyclidefaultng outweigh the health benefits?default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe answer is, quite clearly, no: the actual risk of cycling is tiny. There is one cyclist death per 33 million kilometres of cycling, while being sedentary presents a much greater risk. Over 50,000 people die in the UK eac
defaulth year due to coronary heart disease related to insufficient physical activity, compared to around 100 cyclists killed on the road. Research suggests that safety risks are outweighed by the health benefits by a factor of around twenty to one.

defaultThe individual choosing to cycle wins; they gain a health benefit, they reduce their transport costs, etc. Cyclists on average live longe

default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSociety also benefits; there is less demand on health services, reduced congestion on the roads, lower environmental pollution (which incidentally is a significant killer), etc.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBusiness also benefits; healthier people are happier, and healthier happier
default people are more productive –
default&#xa0;
defaultsome countries have run schemes where employers donate bicycles to their employees if they use them a few times a week to ride to work, and businesses have participated because it makes financial sense to do so.
defaultWhy Bicycle Helmet Legislation And Promotion Is Baddefault14.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt creates the false impression that the costs of bicycling outweigh the benefits, while the reverse is true, however
default much effort is put into avoiding this problem
default.
default14.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHelmet promotion has therefore, wherever undertaken, over sold the minimal protection that helmets provide
default in order to counter the false impression of the dangers of bicycling.
default14.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverselling any safety device
default is counterproductive, due to risk compensation.
default14.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe result is that the, already minimal, benefit is negated.
default14.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBicycle helmets are commercial products; marketing is up to the manufacturers not the Government.
default14.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever as safety devices there marketing must b
defaulte controlled, that is where the Government has a role –
default&#xa0;
defaultin avoiding specious claims etc.
default15.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYou start with an activity where the benefits outweigh the costs and yet argue that participants are somehow irr
defaultesponsible if they don’t wear helmets
default.
default15.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultToday in Australia and New Zealand it is a common view among the public that un-helmeted bicyclists should not be covered by national health care.
default15.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYet those bicyclists are 
defaultreducing
default Society’s costs.
default15.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnd are invariably

defaultvictims
default when serious injuries or deaths occur.

defaultActive Travel Strategy
default, Department for Transport/Department of Health, UK, 22 Feb 2010
default These standards are by no means new, we find them in liberalism in the 17C:
default… the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either phy
defaultsical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so … because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating
default with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil, in case he do otherwise.
defaultfrom On Liberty, John Stuart Mill, 1859
defaultEchoes of these ideas are found in our present day views on 
defaulthuman rights, discrimination and justice.
default The New Zealand Government, when working on an active transport strategy, once stated that they had “shot ourselves in the foot” with the promotion of bicycle helmets.
default Bicycle helmets are designed, due to unavo
defaultidable limitations, for cycle-only incidents below about 10mph.
default For example the New Zealand Government chose the slogan “Bare head, Knucklehead”… with obvious connotations. But what could they have chosen without negative connotations?
