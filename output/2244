defaultAbout the RFUdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefaultWomen’s rugby in England
default has seen a steady increase in parti
defaultcipation and interest in 
defaultrecent years from a very low base a decade ago
default.  
defaultPrior to 2011 the 
defaultRugby Football Union 
defaultfor Women 
defaultwas a separate entity to the RFU.  Following 
defaultintegration
default the RFU’s full resources have been put behind developing women’s rugby at all levels of the Game.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWith the platform of the Women’s 
defaultRugby World Cup 
defaultin 201
default4
default, a home
default Rugby World Cup in 2015 and rugby sevens entering the Olympics in 2016
default for both men and women
default, there is a huge opportunity for 
defaultthe RFU 
defaultto broaden the appeal of the Game amongst women.  The RFU is also working to widen 
defaultaccess
default to women workin
defaultg and volunteering in rugby at all the levels of the Game, as we recognise that a balanced workforce will strengthen 
defaultthe Game
default.
default  As this submission will show, English rugby has developed from a heavily male dominated sport 
defaultto a more balanced one 
defaultin just a f
defaultew years, and this progress will continue.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFemale engagement in rugby union in England is far higher than participation, suggesting that there 
defaultare significant perception
default or practical barriers to women playing rugby.  This submission 
defaultconsiders these barr
defaultiers and makes some recommendations to the Committee on how public policy might help women and girl’s rugby to flourish further.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe RFU’s submission is divided into core areas of activity 
default–
default 
defaultperformance, media, commercial, fan engagement, leadership, 
defaultfacilities and rugby in schools.  The RFU has also made some recommendations to the Committee.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEngland women’s teams are world beaters.  The 
defaultSenior
default 1
default5-a-side team has
default enjoyed a sustained period of success coming 2
defaultnd
default place in the last thr
defaultee successive World Cups 2002, 2006 and 2010 in England.  They have won seven RBS 6 Nations titles since 
default2003,
default and six Grand Slams in the last decade.  The Senior 7 a-side team are also very successful, and came runners up in the 2013 7s World Series.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultRFU supports three women’s elite teams – 
defaultSenior
default 15–a-side, Senior 7-a-side, and Under 20s 15-a-side.  Previously more teams have been supported but a decision was made to consolidate the offering to ensure quality was higher and support better for those to
defaultp teams.
default&#xa0;
default 
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are approximately 1,000 women playing rugby to a very high level within the talent pathway. The talent pathway focuses on talented players from U15 to senior level.  The markers used to assess the health of the game have been agreed with S
defaultport England. 
defaultCase Study 1: defaultPlayer, defaultSarah Hunterdefault 
defaultEngland XIs Captain
default&#xa0;
defaultSarah began playing rugby league aged nine at primary school and started in union five years later. Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sarah attended Goathland Primary and Longbenton
default Community College in North Tyneside before gaining a BSc in Sport Science and Mathematics at Loughborough University. She is now a RFU University Rugby Development Officer for the South West.
default&#xa0;
defaultHer achievements feature winning the British Universities Cham
defaultpionship with Loughborough, captaining Lichfield from 2005-09, the North East U18 and Northumberland U16 sides. Her international triumphs span the Six Nations five times, together with the European Championship, Nations Cup and European Trophy twice each.
default Personal accolades are players’ player awards at Novocastrians, Lichfield, Loughborough University and the England Academy.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe RFU invested approximately
default £2.5m on women
default’s 
defaultelite rugby
default last year, which 
defaultincludes talent
default identification and development
default.
default&#xa0;
default This
default is lower than the investment in the men’s elite programme, due to a number of factors including that the RFU has to pay release fees from Premiership clubs
default 
defaultfor the men.  
defaultThe RFU has been relatively well placed internationally in investment in the women’s 
default7s programme
default.  
defaultThe England 15s programme is one of the best resour
defaultced in the world which allows England
default to compete at the top level.
default&#xa0;
default 
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThough the sponsorship value of the women’s Game is significantly lower than the men’s at present
default,
default which is why we offer 
defaultsponsors rights to both (see 3.1)
default, the RFU is committed to investing in women’s rugby over and above the income it 
defaultcurrently 
defaultgenerates
default.  
defaultThe RFU does not receive any public funding from UK Sport to support the elite women’s programme but does from
default Sport En
defaultgland through to 2014.  Public investment in women’s rugby is vital, and we urge the Government to continue to invest in women
default’s rugby
default.

defaultCase Studydefault 2default: defaultMajor event, defaultWomen’s Rugby World Cupdefault&#xa0;
defaultIn 2010 England hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup.
default&#xa0;
default  The competition was contested over 16 days with 30 matches between 12 nations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInterest in the tournament was far higher 
defaultthan in the previous five WRWCs.  Thirteen matches were broadcast live by Sky Sports to 127 countries and all pool games were sold out with a total attendance of 30,000 over the tournament.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe final was held at the Twickenham Stoop with England 
defaultfinishing

defaultThe media can play a crucial role in challenging 
defaultmis
defaultperceptions of rugby as a 
defaultsport exclusively for men
default.  
defaultTh
defaulte RFU seeks to get the 
defaultEngland
default women extensive coverage in print

defaults elite rugby. Promoting grassroots women

defaults and girls
default’
default rugby is part of the RFU’s Regional 
defaultCommunications
default team’s remit
default and we have introduced targets to try and increase local coverage

defaultRapid improvements in the coverage of 
defaultelite 
defaultwomen
default’
defaults rugby have been made in the last decade.
default  Prior to 2009 there was little
default national coverage of women’s rugby.  
defaultEngland hosting the 2010 Women
default’
defaults Rugby World Cup prompted a
default significant shift and the
default media became much more engaged.
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe WRWC
default 
defaultsaw

defaultCase Study 2
default).  Sky Sports televised 13 games live in 
defaulttotal
default,
default and

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2010
default,
default interest in England Women’s rugby has continued to increase with consisten
defaultt national media coverage.  
defaultAll the England women home games 
defaultwere
default accessible to watch or listen live on Sky Sports, BBC, radio 5 live or

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe RFU media team feel that despite not being part of the 
default2012 
defaultOlympic 
defaultGames, the focus on women’s sport has boosted women’s rugby also.  The RFU has seen a shift in the media being more proac
defaulttive in promoting women’s rugby
default.
default  
defaultThe RFU b
defaultelieves that there has been a significant change in the mind
default-
defaultset of the media
default following 2012
default, and urges the Committee to encourage the media to push 
defaultthemselves
default even further.
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe RFU media team use the profile of the men’s squad and management team to drive
default coverage of the women’s 
defaultteam and their 
defaultachievements.  The RFU has found that joint press conferences are successful in raising awareness of the women’s Game
default, and result 
defaultin 
defaultmore press coverage than a standalone women’s team press conference.  Joint press c
defaultonferences will be held for the forthcoming QBE Internationals and RBS

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the Rugby Football Union for Women was integrated with the RFU, the RFU does not separate its sponsorship of women’s and men’s programmes.    The
default RFU has a strong commercial 
defaultprogramme
default, and works with partners to ensure that they have a far-reaching and embedded place within England rugby.
default  This ensures the m
defaultaximum commercial investment in
defaultto all aspects of the Game, including women’s rugby.

default  
defaultWhile neither the men’s nor the women’s senior 15-a-side players are employed by the RFU to play for England, the RFU has recently instituted an Elite Player agreement for the women’s players which, like
default that for the men’s, 
defaultsets out the support from the Union in areas such as training and medical cover.

defaultThe RFU has recently undertaken research on fans so we can better understand our customers with a view to making their experience better, and 
defaultto widen
default access to rugby to attract those who don’t currently come to Twickenham.  M
defaultatches at Twickenham attract a
default surprisingly high proportion of women
default 
defaultcompared to similar sport
defaults
default with approximately 35% attendees at rugby matches at Twickenham being female.  For th
defaulte 
defaultMarriott London Sevens
default weekend the 
defaultattendees are equally split between male and female
default, due to the youn
defaultger profile of the audience and the relaxed atmosphere of this particular event.  The RFU will be 
defaultanalysing
default these results and working with focus groups 
defaultto find out why there is such a gulf between the n
defaultumber of women who claim to be “passionate about rugby
default”
default, and the numbers that are motivated to participate in the Game.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEngland Connected is the RFU’s campaign to ensure everyone feels part of the rugby community.  Written inside the sleeve of the England jersey for all England teams is the slogan 
default“
defaultEngland Co
defaultnnected
default”
default to remind all players that they are part of 
defaultone
default 
defaultEngland 
defaultrugby family.  Players are also encouraged to support each other publically. 
defaultEngland captain, 
defaultChris Robshaw
default,
default regularly sent
default messages of support via social media to the women’s team for example.
default  This helps drive media attention and fan

defaultThe RFU also expect
defaults
default to see increases in female participation from the resource we are putting into modified forms of the Game, such as O2 Touch rugby, as our research shows 
defaultthese appeal more to women and girls
default.  O2 Touch is a join initiative from the RFU and long-standing partner O2, and is part of the RFU’s plans to increase participation in rugby as part of the 2015 Rugby World Cup Legacy.  There are currently more than 50 O2 Touch Centres in rugby clubs and 
defaultUniversities across the 
defaultcountry,
default and by 2014 there will be a further 100. The advantages of Touch is that it is great for fitness, men and women can play together, and the rules are very simple so it is an easy way to start playing rugby
default – all of these poi
defaultnts address barriers to women and girls starting to play rugby
default.  Of those signed up to the O2 Touch rugby programme, 18% are female.  This is a good start but we aim to increase the proportion of female participants further
default as overall participation with To
defaultuch rugby increases
default.

defaultGrassroots rugby relies on the support of England rugby’s 60,000 volunteers.  The RFU aims to increase volunteering in rugby by both men and women.  The RFU’s development team is working with potential volunteers to identify how the RF
defaultU could attract more female volunteers to support their local rugby clubs.

default member clubs. 
defaultCase Study 8: Club volunteer, Sophie Morris defaultSophie is a Sponsorship and Marketing Consultant and volunteer.  Her involvement in rugby began when she was a Director of Marketing for a Financial Services firm which sponsored the Barbarians games at Twickenham.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012 she wanted to do some volunte
defaulter work and searched on a Government website for opportunities and found Millwall Rugby Club.  
defaultThe Club welcomed her expertise and she was appointed the
default Development Officer, looking after sponsorship, marketing and press.  Having not played team sport sinc
defaulte school, she took up Touch and then 
defaultmoved on to contact rugby, playing for Millwall’s ladies team.  Sophie now sits on the Essex County RFU Development Committee.
default&#xa0;
defaultAmong Sophie’s many achievements are increasing sponsorship income to Millwall Rugby Club b
defaulty more than 500%, and the recruitment of the club’s first ever sponsor of the Ladies team.  Sophie sits on one of the RFU’s six regional Rugby World Cup Activation and Legacy Groups which were set up to capitalise on the opportunity of 2015 to increase par
defaultticipation.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll the above roles are voluntary, and Sophie has recently set up her own Marketing consultancy, specialising in rugby sponsorship.  She is keen to promote sponsorship in the women’s side of the Game.

defaultThere are 
defaultapproximately 2000
default community rugby clubs in England and 
defaultof these
default 77% have security of tenure over their ground
default.  The RFU supports clubs through loans, grants and advic
defaulte to ensure that these
default facilities are 
defaulthigh-quality and well managed.
default  Clubs will drive increases in female 
defaultparticipation and so it is vital that improvements are made to facilities to make them more attractive to women, although facility improvements will of course benefit all participants.

defaultConstituent Bodies (governance structure which broadly mirrors county b
defaultorders) work with local Rugby Development Officers (50 full time RFU employees) to identify the needs of rugby clubs within the context of national priorities.
default  
defaultOne of the factors the RFU asks clubs and CBs to consider when seeking investment is the club’s
default plans for women and girls activity.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch by the RFU and the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation found that the main barriers to women and girls playing rugby are the changing and clubhouse facilities.  
defaultBetween 2003 and 2012 the RFU and Rugby Football
default Foundation has invested £23.4m of grants and loans in 763 clubhouse projects with a total project cost of £72m, focusing on improved changing facilities and clubhouses. The improvements to clubhouses are designed to meet “RFU Guidance Note 5: Clubhouses a
defaultnd Changing Rooms” which has been developed to produce facilities that meet the needs of all users of rugby clubs (adult, youth and child, male and female). A large number of these projects are focused on supporting clubs to grow the number of women and gi
defaultrls teams as well as male provision, but we do not count them separately.

defaultThe RFU plans to 
defaultinvest £10m into 500 rugby clubs as part of its Lead Up and Legacy Programme default(
defaultthe
default RFU’s legacy plan to use the 2015 RWC to grow participation). Changing room improv
defaultements remain a key part of this programm
defaulte and in the first round £600,000 went to eight projects. Round Three
default of the programme is particularly focused at transforming social spaces in clubhouses with £2.5m investment. The RFU is developing support and gui
defaultdance for clubs participating in this round to design and furnish these spaces in line with the findings of the RFU’s work with the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation.

defaultThe RFU works in schools, colleges and universities to provide 
defaultopportu
defaultnities for girls to play rugby.  Encouraging school age girls to play rugby is vital to the future health of the Game in general participation and elite success.

defaultstudents
default receive a broad and balanced PE ex

defaulty rugby in Key Stages 3 and 4.  
defaultThe RFU’s primary focus for delivering schools-based rugby is at secondary level as this is where we can have the bigger impact on 
defaultparticipation in encouraging young people to tak
defaulte up and continue playing rugby beyond school age.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are 3126 schools affiliated to the England Rugby Football Schools Union, many of which have good quality sporting facilities.
default As part of the Rugby Wo
defaultrld Cup legacy work, last year the RFU launched 
defaultthe 
defaultAll Schools 
defaultProgramme 
defaultto 
defaulthelp
default more state secondary schools to offer rugbydefault to their students (Case Study 
default10
default).

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe RFU provides coaching, kit, equipment and teacher training, and in a typical year our natio
defaultnwide community rugby coaches would impact on an estimated 750 secondary schools.   
default&#xa0;
defaultCase Study default10default: All Schools Programme defaultIn 2012 
defaultThe RFU launched All Schools.  
defaultAll Schools was founded on the principles that ALL schools can play rugby, ALL of t
defaulthe 
defaultchildren in the school can
default play, and rugby has a positive impact on ALL of the school. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe RFU provides tailored support to each school, depending on their needs, challenges and opportunities
default over a three year period
default.  The RFU are therefore pleased that 
defaultmore than half of the schools in Phase 1 opted to have girls-only or mixed sessions in their schoolsdefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll Schools is one of seven area areas identified by the RFU to deliver the greatest participation legacy for the game in the lead up to the Rugby World 
defaultCup 2015 and beyond.  The RFU has set up All Schools to 
defaulthelp more state schools that haven’t traditionally played rugbydefault to offer the Game to their students.  We aim to help 400 state secondary schools new to rugby to become self-sufficient rugby playing sc
defaulthools and linked into their local rugby clubs by the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
default&#xa0;defaultSchools have been identified in small clusters, allowing them to play rugby against each other locally.  The schools in Phase 1 2012-13 (100) and Phase 2 2013-14 (an additional 100
default) have been selected on a number of factors including: local rugby club need for young players, proximity to potential RWC2015 venues, and areas of the country that to date haven’t had a large rugby union following.
default&#xa0;
defaultRugby generates whole school improvemen
defaultt and the RFU encourages coaches and teachers to help youngsters understand and practice rugby’s core values – 
defaultTeamwork, Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline, defaultSportsmanshipdefault.  Teachers from schools which have participated in Year 1 have reported improving behavio
defaultur, enhanced learning and increasing self-esteem amongst students.  
default&#xa0;
defaultCanterbury, the kit partner of England Rugby, is the Official Partner of All Schools.  Each school taking part in the programme is given the opportunity to attend a Canterbury kit design
default workshop.  The students design their own team rugby shirt, whilst learning about the core values of rugby, the pride associated with the shirt and the importance of colours, logos and emblems, which is made up and presented to the schools at Twickenham.
