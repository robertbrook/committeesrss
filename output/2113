[normal]Network Rail [bold]&#xad;[bold]- Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Network Rail Infrastructure Limited (Network Rail) is the owner and operator of Britain’s railway infrastructure.  Please find below Network Rail’s responses to some of the questions raised as well some general comments on the Draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Power to [bold]disapply[bold] legislation no longer of practical use [bold]&#xa0;[bold]11. Is the [bold]meaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear[bold]? In this context, what is meant by “practical”? [bold]Should it be defined and, if so, how?[bold] Will removing any of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]It is felt that there does need to be further clarity.  This does relate to the power to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] primary legislation and it needs to be clear about the parameters of when this can be done.  A definition could be useful, but as long as this in itself did not create further areas of uncertainty about its application.  The notes at page 35 in the Explanatory Memorandum at paragraph 212 may be a sensible place to start.
[normal]12. Are the safeguards regarding the use of the “no longer of practical use” power (set out in Clauses 54 to 56) adequate and appropriate? [bold]Network Rail believes that there does need to be further safeguards in place.  Essentially the process in place involves consultation then a Statutory Instrument.  This has been drafted on the basis that all that is required is a negative resolution not an affirmative resolution.  This is not adequate considering that this is about the potential 
[normal]disapplication
[normal] of primary legislation.  Not only does this need addressing, there needs to be a greater focus on consultation to make sure those that could be impacted by the proposed 
[normal]disapplication
[normal] of legislation are contacted and that meaningful engagement happens. 
[normal]We suggest that clause 54(1
[normal])(
[normal]b) is amended so that this reads something along of the lines of, “consult with all parties directly or indirectly affected by the legislation which is proposed to be 
[normal]disapplied
[normal] in accordance with section 51 and such other persons as the Minister considers appropriate”.  In addition due to the roles of the Law Commission, the Scottish Law Commission and the Northern Ireland Law Commission, the relevant Commission should be consulted on and also be required to carry out 
[normal]their own
[normal] separate consultation, much in the way as it does now.  
[normal]14. Are the mechanisms set out for parliamentary oversight (Clauses 55 and 56) of deregulation orders adequate and appropriate? [bold]              [bold]No, see our response to question 12.
[normal]16. What are the risks associated with the proposed new power to [bold]disapply[bold] legislation that is “no longer of practical use”? [bold]              
[normal]The main risk is unintended consequences.  That there could be a severe adverse impact to an organisation, group, charity, business, local authority, etc as a result of legislation being 
[normal]disapplied
[normal] without proper assessment, consultation and engagement with all relevant parties.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this regard and on an associated point, we also have some concerns about clauses 62 – 65 of the draft Bill in this context.  This is because of the nature of this Bill and what it covers and further amendments, repeals and revocations could have wide reaching impacts on the various bodies mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
