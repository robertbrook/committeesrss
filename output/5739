[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing in response to your letter dated 17th January 2014 which was received in my
[normal] 
[normal]office on 28th January 2014. In this letter you request the information that I had agreed to
[normal] 
[normal]provide relating to 
[normal]Police Information Notices (PIN
[normal]s) during my evidence to the Committee on
[normal] 7th
[normal] January 2014.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am aware that a response ha
[normal]s
[normal] been provided
[normal] to the Committee providing the 
[normal]number of
[normal] PIN
[normal]s issued by Sussex Police during 2013. However your subsequent letter asks for the
[normal] number of PIN
[normal]s that have been issued for the last two years. For the sake of completeness, I
[normal] 
[normal]can confirm that in 201
[normal]2 Sussex Police issued 1796 PIN
[normal]s,
[normal] and in 2013 we issued 2006 PIN
[normal]s.
