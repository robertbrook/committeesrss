"&#xa0;\nFurther submission from David Cowburn, Managing Director,  NAPIT Registration (BRC83)&#xa0;\nDear \nMr\n Betts and CLG Select Committee Colleagues, \n&#xa0;\nPoints of Clarification following the CLG Select Committee Hearing 6th January&#xa0;Thank you for giving us the opportunity to attend the CLG Select Committee Hearing on the 6\nth\n January and respond to concerns raised by both the industry and the committee. Following this\n, I thought it best to write to you with a few p\noints of clarification\n which were \nrequested by yourselves.\n&#xa0;\nNumber of memberships terminated in 2013&#xa0;NAPIT Registration’s\n disciplinary process is set up with a number of sanctions such that non\n‐\ncompliance does not simply result in termination (not least because that would result in successful appeals and legal challenges if opportunities to address non\n‐\ncompliance are not giv\nen). Non\n‐\ncompliance is against any of the requirements of the EAS which may mean that non\n‐\ncompliance is against the rules allowing self\n‐\ncertification even if works are compliant with the Building Regulations. \nIn 2013, the following compliance actions and \nsanctions were taken: \n&#xa0;Hence the 163 who cance\nlled their own membership without addressing improvement actions plus the 2\n4\n actively removed by the compliance procedure gives 18\n7\n whose membership ended as a result of identified non\n‐\ncompliance.\n&#xa0;\nThis figure represents 15% of the 1224 enterprises whose P\nart P membership ended during 2013 the remaining 85% is made up of retirements, business closure, sole traders gaining employment in larger firms and simple non\n‐\nrenewal. Only a small number of these seem to have scheme\n‐\nhopped, the majority are either genui\nnely not trading or they continue to trade without being registered.\n&#xa0;\nNAPIT stance of Qualified Supervisor model&#xa0;NAPIT’s scheme is based on the person who \nattends site to \ninspect and test the installation being a Qualified Operative who is at least equiva\nlent to the EAS Qualified Supervisor. Because we have a high proportion of micro\n‐\nbusiness this is still often one person.\n&#xa0;\nThe total number of Qualified Operatives is 12\n,\n235 within 9006 enterprises. 8134 operatives work for 8134 sole traders and micro\n‐\ncompanies (i.e. 1 per enterprise) and 4101 operatives work for 872 larger companies at an average of 4.7 per enterprise (excluding one very large scheme member gives an average of 3.2 qualified operatives per enterprise for the rest).\n&#xa0;\nNumber of Complaints&#xa0;\nB\nased on the last two \ncomplaints \nreports \nto DCLG, the annual level of complaints \nabout electrical work \nreceived by \nNAPIT \nruns at a level of 1-in-5000 installations – of course scheme members themselves will receive and resolve the bulk of complaints with\nout them being escalated to the scheme.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI hope you find this clarification of use, and would be happy to provide any further information that you would assist you further in this enquiry. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if this would be desirable.\n&#xa0;\n10 January 2014\n&#xa0;\nRegistered at: The Gardeners Lodge, Pleasley Vale Business Park, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, NG19 8RL \n  \nNAPIT Registration \nCompany No. \n05190452  Part of the NAPIT group of companies\n&#xa0;\nGRP/MAR/TMP/0040 V2.0 (07.11)\n"
