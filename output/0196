Written evidence submitted by Mrs Beryl Burton[bold] [bold](FSS008)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1) I am a member of
[normal] 
[normal]the public.
[normal] 
[normal]My knowledge of
[normal] 
[normal]Forensic Science provision is derived from what
[normal] 
[normal]I have heard and read.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2) I am concerned that Forensic Science is now wholly in the private sector.
[normal] 
[normal]This means that
[normal] 
[normal]companies will have to make a profit otherwise they will close down.
[normal] 
[normal]Due to being in a market
[normal] 
[normal]environment,
[normal] 
[normal]decisions on tests required may be curtailed due to cost rather than whether or not a
[normal] 
[normal]further test would provide more accuracy. In an interview on B.B.C. Radio 4, a member of
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Forensic Science Service gave an example of her advice being over-ruled by a member of the
[normal] 
[normal]police. She felt that the police were taking cost into account.
[normal] 
[normal]Of
[normal] 
[normal]course, the police could say that the
[normal] 
[normal]Forensic Science Service wanted to do another test to make more money,
[normal] 
[normal]an uncomfortable and
[normal] 
[normal]unsatisfactory position for both.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am uneasy about the police being both test result provider and prosecuto
[normal]r. I
[normal] would be happier if
[normal] 
[normal]independent providers were doing the testing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3) If companies fail in the private sector,
[normal] 
[normal]how will provision of forensic science services continue?
[normal] 
[normal]Will they have to be done in other countries which could result in a lack of transparency and control
[normal] 
[normal]over standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4) I understand that very few police forces are accredited at present.
[normal] 
[normal]This situation must be rectified
[normal] 
[normal]as soon as possible and their standards monitored.
[normal] 
[normal]The police are losing ground in the public's
[normal] 
[normal]estimation and miscarriages of
[normal] 
[normal]justice will exacerbate that situation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5) The Forensic Science Service,
[normal] 
[normal]supported by the Govern
[normal]ment,
[normal] has gone. I
[normal]t may well have been top
[normal] 
[normal]heavy and needed some streamlining and changes of
[normal] 
[normal]practice such as working hours.
[normal] 
[normal]However, it
[normal] 
[normal]was full of knowledge,
[normal] 
[normal]experience and expertise,
[normal] 
[normal]and provided a safe,
[normal] 
[normal]stable,
[normal] 
[normal]impartial and secure base
[normal] 
[normal]for the provision of material to put before the courts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6) The U.K. sees itself as a leading developed country and I see justice for the people as important
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]education and a Health Service. I
[normal] am not convinced that either the police or the private sector will
[normal] 
[normal]be able to provide it.
