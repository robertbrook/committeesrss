"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Intellect (LPG 32)&#xa0;About IntellectIntellect is the go-to organisation for the\n \nUK tech industry. It is the trade association\n \nfor the UK’s tech sector, which represents\n \ndevelopers and suppliers of digital\n \ntechnology and services.\n&#xa0;\nIntellect has over 85\n0 member companies\n \nincluding major multinationals, mid-sized\n \nfirms and small businesses. Collectively these\n \ncompanies directly employ more than half a\n \nmillion people in the UK and their products\n \nand services are used by every part of the\n \nUK and global economy.\n&#xa0;\nVisit our website for further information, \nwww.intellectuk.org\n \n&#xa0;\nIntroductionIntellect welcomes the opportunity to input into this review on procurement and provide an IT industry perspective in response to the questions raised. The views that we express and the recommendations that we make in this response are relevant to all areas of procurement, not just the procurement of IT. However the procurement of IT within local government does give rise to issues for both suppliers and buyers which can, and often do, have a detrimental effect on the delivery of cost effective services to citizens.\n&#xa0;\nBackgroundIntellect and the government have worked together over many years to create tools and proce\nsses to improve IT procurement\n. Examples include a pre-procurement market engagement process known as Concept Viability\n, \nour Innovation Den series\n \nwhich are half-day sessions that offer small, innovative businesses the opportunity to pitch their ideas to panellists from central and local government\n,\n and a Pre-Qualification Tool\n to help procuring authorities\n test the readiness for major I\nT procurements. However, \nprocurement across the local government sector has remained\n \ninconsistent \nwith the result that, despite many initiatives, procurement of major ICT systems and services in \nlocal government remains varied in both success, value for money and outcomes for citizens.\n \n&#xa0;\nIntellect members have experience of working across both the public and private sectors. They have observed that within the public sector procurement rules and regulations are often translated into processes and cultures that tend to engender a more adversarial procurement environment. Many of our recommendations are aimed at breaking down barriers between industry and the \nlocal government sector\n \nto create a competitive market and a level playing field \nwhilst, at the same time, maintaining the necessary integrity of the public procurement process. Intellect believes that huge improvement is possible through change in this area and that\n \nthere are opportunities to achieve quick wins by building on work that has already been undertaken.\n&#xa0;\nCurrent opportunities within the marketIntellect’s position is that the public sector technology market is competitive and vibrant with a substantial supplier and customer base.  There are also significant business opportunities for suppliers across the public sector, with a pipeline worth over £25bn.\n \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the main challenge facing suppliers to the public sector is the way customers procure technology and the processes and practices used.  These create high entry barriers for suppliers, small and large, and threaten our industry’s ability to grow and innovate. The cost of doing business in the public sector is a real challenge for industry, particularly for smaller suppliers.\n&#xa0;\nIndustry and government have developed and started to implement policies and best practices that seek to remove these barriers.  The reforms introduced by the government to reduce these barriers are already making a positive impact. We support these reforms and are encouraged by the actions taken so far.   \n&#xa0;\nLocal government are also ahead of the curve in terms of some central government initiatives and have led the way in particular areas of government policy. For example, local government have already readily embraced the SME agenda and has sourced innovation and new technology from the SME community at a rate much higher than that of central government. Local government are also key users of the G Cloud framework with several success stories emerging from the sector on how using the new agile model G Cloud presents has resulted in improved procurement costs and experience for those involved. \n&#xa0;\nSeveral forward thinking organisations are also embracing suppliers as strategic partners and delivering improved services through these relations for both the council as a customer and the citizen as a consumer.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, these examples exist often as pockets of innovation within the sector with little focus placed on sharing this knowledge or collaborating further to achieve economies of scale. F\nor\n procurement to be truly\n successful \nwithin the local government sector \nthere has to be a comprehensive cha\nnge to process and practice in public s\nector procurement\n. \n&#xa0;\nChallenges faced within the sectorOur members face a number of potential challenges when procuring within this market which we have listed as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf we are successful with this we will see a growing number of suppliers succeeding in the market, a customer base that implements good technology quicker, a reduction in the cost of technology to the public sector, and the delivery of better public services. \n&#xa0;\nAreas for action&#xa0;\nIn order to achieve the above the following three areas need to be looked at and worked on not only between local and central government but also consulting and working with industry to achieve the needed outcomes:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nImprove standardisation and transparency within the process\nWhilst local government organisations\n must have freedom to act\n, increased standardisation of process and documentation can contribute to improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the procurement process.  \nSuppliers are concerned abo\nut the often onerous nature of \nPre-Qualification Questionnaire (P\nQQ) processes \nas well as\n the often obscure status of the business case for investment.  \nCentral government together with local government and industry should work to identify areas within the procurement where standardisation can be applied e.g. PQQ or Terms &amp; Conditions. Although we appreciate that an exercise like this is unlikely to produce a one-size-fits-all document it may still be possible to create a suite of standardised documents that relate to the scale and type of procurement so as to enable the necessary local flexibility.\nTransparency is a key tool to enable all sides to ensure a procurement process is run to achieve the best outcome. \nIntellect’s consultative work with its members indicates that both suppliers and purchasers would benefit from a clearer understanding of the context and scope of particular procurements\n.  Local government should be encouraged to be transparent through every stage of the procurement process.\n&#xa0;\nEncourage and foster greater market engagement and relationships\nStructured industry engagement is an increasingly important part of preparing for public sector procurements. Early engagement means policies can be refined into outcome definitions before the launch of a formal competition; and carefully designed procurement strategies can be aligned to deliver the desired outcomes ensuring better overall performance and value for money. It also means potential suppliers have a real opportunity to put forward truly innovative solutions.\n  \nIn addition, currently suppliers are typically seen as adversaries who are to be kept at arm’s length and involved in as little of the project as possible. This attitude needs to change.  An environment of partnership and collaboration between suppliers and customers needs to be promoted and encouraged for local government to get the most from its procurement activity.\n&#xa0;\nIntellect and SO\nCITM run a joint forum between local g\novernment and suppliers\n called the Local Public Service Supplier Forum\n to bring together both sides in a neutral forum to discuss and share information about the market to improve knowledge and develop potential solutions to challenges faced within this sector. \n&#xa0;\nCentral government should promote and encourage initiatives like the Local Public Service Supplier Forum and other activities like Concept Viability referenced above to make market engagement not just accepted but a standard \npart of procurement across all local g\novernment organisations.\n&#xa0;\nImproved knowledge and expertise within the sector\nA lack of knowledge about the IT marketplace and the wealth of suppliers operating in it is proving hugely detrimental to local government both in terms of aligning solutions to specific requirements as well as limiting innovation and the economies of scale that could be achieved. \n&#xa0;\nThrough fora like the Local Public Service Supplier Forum Intellect have started to provide a platform for councils to share and come together to improve their skills and knowledge in this area but much more needs to be done.\n&#xa0;\nCentral government should play a stronger role in highlighting successes within the market and sharing the lessons learnt and best practice from the projects. In addition, there is a role for either central or local government to improve the procurement, project management and evaluation skills of individuals working within local government organisations. \n&#xa0;\nIntellect is keen to work with local government and stakeholders within the sector to improve these areas and we would be happy to discuss our work and how we can help with the committee. \nFor questions or comments regarding this response please contact Intellect’s \nLocal Government lead, Gemma Blakey\n: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.intellectuk.org/conceptviability\n \n \nhttp://www.intellectuk.org/cross-government-initiatives/innovation-den\n \nhttp://www.intellectuk.org/cross-government-initiatives/procurement/6320\n \nhttp://data.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Crown%20Pipeline.csv\n \n \nhttp://www.intellectuk.org/vertical-markets/local-government\n \n"
