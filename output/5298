defaultCYCLING SAFETY
default&#xa0;
defaultA coherent approach to transport policy is needed as part of a long-term plan.
defaultThe long-term aims should be to reduce our carbon footprint and to make all forms of travel safer. Increasing and improving 
defaultprovision for safer cycling would contribute to both these aims.  The following issues need to be considered if safer cycling is to be achieved.

default&#xa0;
defaultI. defaultIs cycling safe?default&#xa0;
defaultIt
default is neither as dangerous as non
default-
defaultcyclists perceive it to 
defaultbe nor as safe as it should be 
defaulti
defaultn a civilised society such as ours.  It could be made much safer per mile cycled and the number of cyclists could be greatly increased for comparatively little compared with the amount spent on roads and the expenditure by the NHS on illness related to ob
defaultesity.
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling in traffic feels particularly 
defaultunsafe because however careful
default cyclist
defaults are
default, their safety is largely in the hands of drivers.  A cyclist who is dressed in bright clothing, wears a helmet. who has good lighting and who rides carefully and corr
defaultectly may still be wiped out 
defaultbe
default a motorist. If they are, they are largely unprotected and will be s
defaulteriously hurt o
defaultr killed.  Conversely, a careful driver who makes no mistake is unlikely to be involved in a serious accident and if they are, their car will 
defaultprovide a lot of protection for them. So cyclists are vulnerable and at the mercy of others to a much greater extent than motorists.
default&#xa0;
defaultII. What could be done to improve safety?default&#xa0;
defaultA. Segregation(see below)
default&#xa0;
defaultB.
default 
defaultTake steps to reduce the danger caused to 
defaultcyclists by vehicles
default&#xa0;default1. The
default Highway Code
default&#xa0;
defaultImprove the content and the emphasis of the highway 
defaultcode.
defaultThe
default Highway Code devotes only three paragraphs (211 – 213) to the care motorists should pay to cyclists,(
defaultincluding them with motorcyclists
default,
default which is potent
defaultially misleading
default and                    dangerous) and giving the impression that they are rather an afterthought rather than users with equal rights of access. The Code needs amendment to inculcate an understanding of cycling in the motorist, particularly
default of the difficulties and dangers involved in cycling, and how cycling differs from motoring. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Code should state that motorists should allow cyclists a minimum width of 1.5m when overtaking.
default&#xa0;
default2. Speed limits
default&#xa0;
defaultA 20mph limit should be the norm in urban a
defaultreas where segregated cycle facilities are lacking
default&#xa0;
defaultSpeed limits should be enforced preferably by traffic calming measures which are cycle
default-
defaultfriendly or by speed cameras.
default&#xa0;
default3. Driving test
default&#xa0;
defaultThe test should require the driver to demonstrate knowledge of defens
defaultive driving techniques to minimise the chance of hitting a cyclist.
default&#xa0;
defaultKnowledge about the position a 
defaultcyclist
default should take on the road should be part of the test.  Drivers should be aware that cyclists should not be hugging the kerb.
default&#xa0;
default4. Definition of 
defaultdangerous driving
default&#xa0;
defaultDefine "dangerous driving" realistically so that a driver who causes the death or serious injury of another by the way they have driven will in all cases be charged with dangerous driving.
default&#xa0;
default5. Penalty for killing a cyclist (or pedestrian
default)
default&#xa0;
defaultMake drivers more careful in the vicinity of cyclists (and pedestrians!) by making the loss of the driving licence mandatory in all cases where a driver is found responsible for the death of a cyclist or pedestrian. Prison is not an appropriate punishme
defaultnt; a period of being forbidden to drive is a more effective encouragement to people to drive carefully, particularly in the case of HGV drivers who are responsible for a disproportionate number of cyclist deaths.
default&#xa0;
default6. HGV's
default&#xa0;
defaultFit all HGV's with devices to 
defaultwarn the driver of the presence of a cyclist
defaultBan HGV's from city and town centres during the day unless segregated facilities for cyclists have been provided
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.Legalise cycling on footways beside fast roads
default&#xa0;
defaultLegalize cycling on footpaths beside fast road
defaults.  Ideally, it should be legalised where the speed limit is more than 30mph with power for Councils to apply for exemptions where necessary i.e. to ban cyclists from footpaths where pedestrian use would make cycling inappropriate.  A start could perhaps b
defaulte made by legalisation where the limit is above 40mph.  Clearly, cyclists must ride 
defaultsafely 
defaultwith
default 
defaultdue 
default consideration for other path users. 
default&#xa0;
default8. Cycle lanes: priority, width, usually free of parked vehicles
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultVehicles should cede priority to cycle lanes acros
defaults junctions and roundabouts.  This would play a part in making motorists more aware of cyclists.
default The change would, however, need wide publicity.
default  The lanes should be clearly marked.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll on
default-
defaultroad cycle lanes 
defaultshould
default have a minimum width of 1.5m
default.  Narrow lane
defaults are likely to increase danger to cyclists by causing them to ride in the gutter and encourage cars to squeeze past where there is insufficient room.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn all but exceptional circumstances, no parking should be allowed in cycle lanes.
default&#xa0;
default9. Signs to remind d
defaultrivers of minimum overtaking width
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs in 
defaultFrance
default, the space which should be allowed cyclists by overtaking vehicles should be emphasised by reminders on road signs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultC. Create a climate in which the public will accept restrictions on vehicles and the spa
defaultce allotted to them to enable safer cycling
default.
default&#xa0;
default1. Publicise damage to health and environment by vehicles
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPublicise facts about the true environmental and health costs of current vehicle use  in terms of air quality, noise pollution and climate change.  In
default particular, the public should be aware of the estimated 5000 premature deaths in the UK caused by vehicle emissions (

defaultabout causes of accidents to cyclists
default&#xa0;
defaultM
defaultake
default the public in general and the police in particular aware of the facts concerning  accidents involving
default adult
default cyclists
default. T
defaulthe fact that on the analysis commissioned by
default the Department of Transport, the police had found drivers were solely to blame in about 60 - 75% of cases and cyclists solely to blame in about 17-25% of cases
default 
defaultshould be widely known. At present, this analysis i
defaults largely ignored and as a result
default the debate
default about what action is needed to deal with the problem of increased cycling casualties is ill
default-
defaultinformed.

defaultBritain

defaultombat the myths that failure to wear bright clothing and failure to stop at traffic lights cause most cycle casualties
default by publicising the fact that this was a cause in 4
default%
default-5% of accidents involving cyclists
default (see Collisions above)
default.
default&#xa0;
default3. Encourage bet
defaultter behaviour by cyclists
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA
defaultt the same time 
defaultencourage
default cycle organisations
default to take the lead in trying reduce the  type of behaviour by cycl
defaultists which leads to
default antipathy to cyclists, particularly in large cities.  The obvious flash point is the f
defaultailure to s
defaulttop at traffic light
defaults.
default&#xa0;
default4. Publicise health benefits of cycling
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultP
defaultublicise
default the benefits of cycling in keeping people fit and 
defaultcombating
default obesity, for example publish the typical calories burned in a week/month/year and the weight which might typically be lo
defaultst by regularly cycling 2 miles a day
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultD. Provide information to enable cyclists to find safe routes
default.
default&#xa0;
default1. Local maps
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultDetailed maps for cyclists are needed showing clearly which routes provide segregated facilities, which are along quiet roads, roads w
defaultith traffic calming measures and so on so that cyclists can find a route which is as safe as possible.  The maps should be available on
default-
defaultline.   
default&#xa0;
default2. The National Cycle Network created by 
defaultSustrans
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultParts of the network include busy sections where cyclists 
defaultare in danger.  These sections should be clearly shown as interim routes and should not enjoy full National Cycle Network status.  Again, this will enable cyclists to make informed choices about their routes.
default&#xa0;
default3. Provide local signage to facilitate safe
default route-
defaultfinding
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultE. Cycle training
default.
default&#xa0;
default1. Adults
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultBikeability
default 3 courses
default 
defaultfor adults
default should be widely
default publicised and available.  Organisations such as CTC and 
defaultSustrans
default have a part to play.  We are volunteers for 
defaultSustrans
default and as part of our volunteer duties, check routes along busy roads which are not safe for cyclists. Our requests for 
defaultSustrans
default to provide
default us with 
defaultBikeability
default 
default3 
defaulttraining have been met with the response that they do not provide such training and have no plans to do so.
default&#xa0;
default2. Children
default&#xa0;
defaultWe understand that cycle training for children is already widely provided, but we have no 
defaultspecial
default knowledge abo
defaultut this.  Clearly it is needed and should be extended with particular emphasis on the danger points for child cyclists 
defaulte.g
default cycling off the pavement onto the road without looking (see "Collisions" above)
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIII. Segregationdefault&#xa0;defaultSegregate cycle lanes, particula
defaultrly in urban areas. Dedicated cycle lanes protect cyclists and encourage cycling. They would contribute to a reduction in car usage, carbon dioxide emissions, noise pollution and light pollution, as well as increasing public safety by reducing accidents an
defaultd reducing the incidence of deaths caused by vehicle emissions and  pollution. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSafer routes to schools would encourage and protect children, as has been proved in The Netherlands (see
default the result of the Dutch campaign called "
defaultStop de 
defaultKindermoord
default"  which r
defaulteduced child pedestrian and cycle deaths from 450 in 1971 to 14 in 2010
default). It would also contribute to i
defaultmproved health and 
defaultfitness.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen a new  housing development is planned,  a condition should be 
defaulta contribution to the construction of a cycling infrastr
defaultucture, not merely on the housing development itself but also in the adjoining area
defaults
default, to offset the inevitable increase in motorised transport.  
default&#xa0;
defaultExisting cycling lanes and routes should be connected to each other to avoid dangerous stretches and contribu
defaultte to integration.
