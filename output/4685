default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission is Ofsted’s response to the Committee’s call for written evidence on academies and free schools.  It 
defaultdraws upon published findings from the 
defaultAnnual Report 2012/13 as well as analysis of inspection outcomes and examination results for 2013.
default 
defaultOfsted inspects all academies under section 5 inspection arrangements
default.
default 
default 
defaultWe have long experience of inspecting sponsor-led academies, which tend to be scho
defaultols which have replaced predecessors with challenging histories
default;
default more recently there is growing ins
defaultpection evidence about ‘converte
defaultr’ academies, which tend to be successful schools. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs outlined in the Annual Report 2012-13, 
defaultOfsted will assess the impact 
defaultof conversion to academy status on school performance in the coming year. This will include detailed reporting on how well new academies make use of their autonomy and freedom to innovate and raise standards. We will also report in more detail on the perfo
defaultrmance of free schools once more schools have been inspected in 2013/14.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecent reports from Ofsted, such as 
defaultUnseen Children: access and achievement in education – 20 Years On
default, and changes to inspection frameworks, have
default collectively
default put an increased focus
default on ensuring that the quality of education improves
default,
default especially in those schools that are in the most disadvantaged areas and where the gaps between the performance of disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers differs most. In this submission,
default the term ‘disadvantaged’ refers to those students from low income backgrounds that have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the previous 6 years (FSM6).

defaultDeprivation is b
defaultased on the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) 2010. The deprivation of a provider is based on the mean of the deprivation indices associated with the home post codes of the pupils attending the school rather than the location of the schoo
