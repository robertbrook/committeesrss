[normal]AFS0088[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by Ofsted[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission is Ofsted’s response to the Committee’s call for written evidence on academies and free schools.  It 
[normal]draws upon published findings from the 
[normal]Annual Report 2012/13 as well as analysis of inspection outcomes and examination results for 2013.
[normal] 
[normal]Ofsted inspects all academies under section 5 inspection arrangements
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]We have long experience of inspecting sponsor-led academies, which tend to be scho
[normal]ols which have replaced predecessors with challenging histories
[normal];
[normal] more recently there is growing ins
[normal]pection evidence about ‘converte
[normal]r’ academies, which tend to be successful schools. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As outlined in the Annual Report 2012-13, 
[normal]Ofsted will assess the impact 
[normal]of conversion to academy status on school performance in the coming year. This will include detailed reporting on how well new academies make use of their autonomy and freedom to innovate and raise standards. We will also report in more detail on the perfo
[normal]rmance of free schools once more schools have been inspected in 2013/14.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recent reports from Ofsted, such as 
[normal]Unseen Children: access and achievement in education – 20 Years On
[normal], and changes to inspection frameworks, have
[normal] collectively
[normal] put an increased focus
[normal] on ensuring that the quality of education improves
[normal],
[normal] especially in those schools that are in the most disadvantaged areas and where the gaps between the performance of disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers differs most. In this submission,
[normal] the term ‘disadvantaged’ refers to those students from low income backgrounds that have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the previous 6 years (FSM6).

[normal]Except for 16-19 academies which are inspected under the Common Inspection Framework for Further Education Learning and Skills
[normal] Figures are for primary and secondary academies where deprivation has been classified. 
[normal]Deprivation is b
[normal]ased on the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) 2010. The deprivation of a provider is based on the mean of the deprivation indices associated with the home post codes of the pupils attending the school rather than the location of the schoo
[normal]l itself. The schools are divided into five equal groups (quintiles) that are labelled from ‘most deprived’ to ‘least deprived’

[normal]s
[normal]chools, University Technical Colleges and

[normal]All academ
[normal]ies, including free schools, have a l
[normal]egal status as
[normal] independent schools and must meet the requirements of the Independent Schools Register. Those academies which acquire academy status under the Academies Act 2010 are deemed to have met those requirements upon opening and, therefore, do not u
[normal]ndergo pre-registration inspections
