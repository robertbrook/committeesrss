default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultEdefaultxecutive defaultSdefaultummarydefault&#xa0;defaultAR5 demonstrates a clear agenda on the part of its authors to promote human emissions as being the cause of global climate change and global warming. 
defaultThis is 
defaultfostering an intellectual environment of climate change being a done deal, thus legitimizing the r

defaultI am Conor McMenemie. I
default had patented and been involved with the development of a t
defaulturbine for producing energy from sea and river currents. Research was also being 
defaultconsolidated into a number of neurological and psychological conditions. 
defaultWhilst researching locations relevent to the turbines usage, it became apparent that there existed an 
defaultunexplained relationship between a large river management operation in Egypt and rainfall over a significant part of Sub Saharan Africa. It further became evident that this would also have an impact upon equatorial Atlantic temperatures
default,
default as well as the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. Features which are relevant to both the global warming statistics and global climate change. It had consistent
defaultly
default been the objective to hand this initial research over to those institutions with the releva
defaultnt resources, so that I could continue with other research projects.
defaultDue to the political implications of the research, concern that a geo-reengineering project may be introduced on its basis without due consideration to its wider effects and the author no
defaultt wishing to provide ammunition to organizations that follow a financially motivated path rather than dealing with the climate problem itself, care and confidentiality were enshrined in dealing with the research. Unfortunately it became evident that 
defaultbogus 
defaultand irrelevant arguments were 
defaultbeing
default produced as a means to dismiss the findings of the original research
default, despite the magnitude of its implications. Thus with each rejection it was necessary to produce more research to check the validity of the original ob
defaultservations.

default ocean warming is 99% of global warming and that the current prevailing theory can not possibly produce such ocean warming,
default we have a document produc

default Despite this our national policies are largely defined by the agenda set by this same group.

defaultGiven that the planets surface is 70% water and that i
defaultt requires 3,500 times more energy to warm the same volume of water than air, the current 
defaultemissions based 
defaultclimate policy is based upon an unproven theory that can not possibly account for the oceans warming.

default For the passed 3,500 billion years the equatori
defaultal oceans have absorbed 80% of the solar radiation that is applied to them, with this energy 
default(heat) 
defaultbeing distributed round the planet via the normal ocean currents. Thus any changes in the cloud mass above the equatorial oceans

defaultGlobal climate models are dependent upon the

defaultConclusion
defaultAR5 does not 
defaultaddress the reliability of climate models, because there is an institutionalized rejection of models whose definition lies outside of the prevailing emissions based climate theory. 
defaultIt may be the case
default 
defaultthat grant funding bodies a
defaultre reluctant to finance research that may undermine the general emissions policy. 
defaultThe climate research institutions, upon whom we rely for an honest and accurate provision of information, are quickly becoming the least reliable authorities at providing th
defaultat same information, since it is their ambition to adhere to the 
defaultaspirations of the IPCC, despite their 
default100% failure record
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation
defaultIt has become essential for finance to become available for research into factors affecting the formation of Easterly Waves: the main meteorological system that provides the cloud 
defaultmass
default over the Equatorial 
defaultOceans
default.
default 
defaultThis determines how much of the solar radia
defaulttion is providing the ocean warming as mentioned in AR5. 
defaultUntil it be
defaultcomes known why this cloud mass
default has significantly reduced, ALL CLIMATE MODELS are meaningless.

defaultSince NASA’s Godard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is an American organisation, whenever possible the USA is placed in th
defaulte centre of the picture, to please both their tax payers and to provide a simple geographical reference. In this particular image a large slice of West Africa and South America can be seen, but no USA. To produce the same image with the US
defaultA
default in the picture,
default one would be confronted with the fact that the sea warming 
defaultzone
default as shown here
default,
default actually skips over Central America and into the Pacific (as demonstrated in ‘The Nile Climate Engine’). It should also been known that despite the rendering on the GISS image,
default this warming zone is ALWAYS highest off the West African Coast, not in the Caribbean, as shown in this highly misleading picture. Also it is pertinent that the temperature variability within this warming zone is consistent with GISS’s published data for G
defaultlobal Temperatures.
default 
defaultIn every respect the GISS image is profoundly misleading and is configured to specifically provide a false image of the key factors
default,
default whilst obscuring relevant features.
defaultThe graphic artist that refined this GISS image would not have 
defaultproduced and published such a misleading picture of global significance
default off his own bat,
default that order would only have come form a very senior person in the organisation. The head of GISS was the very same person that produced the latest version of the explan
defaultation for global climate change.
