[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]E[bold]xecutive [bold]S[bold]ummary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]AR5 demonstrates a clear agenda on the part of its authors to promote human emissions as being the cause of global climate change and global warming. 
[normal]This is 
[normal]fostering an intellectual environment of climate change being a done deal, thus legitimizing the r
[normal]ejection of facts and arguments that demonstrate, not just the flaws in this perspective
[normal],
[normal] but also 
[normal]those which 
[normal]show that other factors are causing global warming.

[normal]I am Conor McMenemie. I
[normal] had patented and been involved with the development of a t
[normal]urbine for producing energy from sea and river currents. Research was also being 
[normal]consolidated into a number of neurological and psychological conditions. 
[normal]Whilst researching locations relevent to the turbines usage, it became apparent that there existed an 
[normal]unexplained relationship between a large river management operation in Egypt and rainfall over a significant part of Sub Saharan Africa. It further became evident that this would also have an impact upon equatorial Atlantic temperatures
[normal],
[normal] as well as the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. Features which are relevant to both the global warming statistics and global climate change. It had consistent
[normal]ly
[normal] been the objective to hand this initial research over to those institutions with the releva
[normal]nt resources, so that I could continue with other research projects.
[normal]Due to the political implications of the research, concern that a geo-reengineering project may be introduced on its basis without due consideration to its wider effects and the author no
[normal]t wishing to provide ammunition to organizations that follow a financially motivated path rather than dealing with the climate problem itself, care and confidentiality were enshrined in dealing with the research. Unfortunately it became evident that 
[normal]bogus 
[normal]and irrelevant arguments were 
[normal]being
[normal] produced as a means to dismiss the findings of the original research
[normal], despite the magnitude of its implications. Thus with each rejection it was necessary to produce more research to check the validity of the original ob
[normal]servations.

[normal]W
[normal]e are pr
[normal]esent
[normal]ed
[normal] with a significant change to the planets largest weather system, 
[normal]yet 
[normal]due to the 
[normal]concentric nature of c
[normal]limate 
[normal]c
[normal]hange 
[normal]research,
[normal] there is an 
[normal]all pervading willingness to avoid
[normal] dealing with 
[normal]su
[normal]ch issues since it 
[normal]deals with a
[normal] definition that fall
[normal]s
[normal] outside 
[normal]th
[normal]e general em
[normal]issi
[normal]ons theorem.
[normal] Consequently the ability for AR5 to 
[normal]address the reliability of climate models
[normal] is profoundly flawed
[normal],
[normal] due to 
[normal]there being an ongoing polocy of 
[normal]trying to 
[normal]ensur
[normal]e
[normal] that climate models only 
[normal]reach 
[normal]the IPCC if they agree with which ever explanation of global warming is prevalent at any given time.

[normal]As an example
[normal],
[normal] during a meeting with a senior scientist at th
[normal]e Met Office in Exeter
[normal] (
[normal]24/02/2011)
[normal], where it
[normal] was demonstrated 
[normal]using Met office data, 
[normal]that there has been a significan
[normal]t change to
[normal] the 
[normal]planets largest weather system. When it was pointed out that this data could be further refined to demonstrate its association with other large and relevant events, the immediate response was 
[normal]being told twice
[normal] not to do this. 
[normal]Even when this matter was directly related to the scientists subject area. 
[normal]Yet in May 2013 the Met Office was meeting to discuss why its climate models were not working. Ignoring changes to the planets largest weather system is obviously g
[normal]oing to ensure major errors in 
[normal]the 
[normal]formulation
[normal] of
[normal] climate models.
[normal] Variations 
[normal]on this theme have been a constant feature where irrelevant, impossible and in some cases pure fictional arguments have been introduced as a means to dismiss accurate and relevent
[normal] information
[normal],
[normal] in a
[normal]n apparent
[normal] bid to ensure the continuation of the prevailing climate th
[normal]e
[normal]or
[normal]y.

[normal]The near blind acceptance of whichever is the most recent
[normal] explanation for climate change
[normal] has ensured
[normal] there has been less than adequate scrutiny of the explanation
[normal] itself. 
[normal]Too many within the climate community ha
[normal]ve
[normal] ventured into a mindset where proof of global warming is somehow proof that human emissions are
[normal] the cause. Where 
[normal]legitimate 
[normal]scientific research which undermines this link is classed as ‘climate denial’
[normal] – thus rejected at its earliest stages
[normal].

[normal]W
[normal]e have been provided with three previous peer reviewed and accepted explanations of how human emissions are warming the planet. Each one inturn being dismissed due to subsequent res
[normal]earch findings. W
[normal]e are now confr
[normal]onted 
[normal]by the IPCC accepting a forth 
[normal]explanation on the same emissions theme. Yet as mentioned in AR5
[normal], where
[normal] ocean warming is 99% of global warming and that the current prevailing theory can not possibly produce such ocean warming,
[normal] we have a document produc
[normal]ed by authors with a 100% failure rate at explaining what is warming the planet and causing climate change.
[normal] Despite this our national policies are largely defined by the agenda set by this same group. 
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given that the planets surface is 70% water and that i
[normal]t requires 3,500 times more energy to warm the same volume of water than air, the current 
[normal]emissions based 
[normal]climate policy is based upon an unproven theory that can not possibly account for the oceans warming.
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] For the passed 3,500 billion years the equatori
[normal]al oceans have absorbed 80% of the solar radiation that is applied to them, with this energy 
[normal](heat) 
[normal]being distributed round the planet via the normal ocean currents. Thus any changes in the cloud mass above the equatorial oceans 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]a very
[normal] significant fact
[normal]or in determining 
[normal]how much solar energy is absorbed, thus
[normal] global mean temperature. This 
[normal]cloud
[normal] 
[normal]variability
[normal] 
[normal]has already been 
[normal]demonstrated 
[normal]to cause 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]very significant sea 
[normal]warming effect
[normal],
[normal] consistent with published data for global 
[normal]temperatures and guaranteed to
[normal] have a significant impact upon large scale climate events
[normal], including melting the Arctic ice.
[normal] But this non conformity to the general emissions polocy ensures very little resources are applied to a climate model that does demonstrate all of the criteria for
[normal] causing global warming and climate change.

[normal]Global climate models are dependent upon the
[normal] 
[normal]output from various institutions, yet these same institutions are significantly financed upon funds that stem from the infrastructures emplaced on the premise of human
[normal] emissions climate change. For such organisations to pursue research into other 
[normal]probable 
[normal]causes, not just undermines their financing
[normal] but
[normal] possibly 
[normal]their very 
[normal]existence
[normal].
[normal] It is not in the interests of so
[normal] many key climate institutions 
[normal]or their senior personnel
[normal] to scrutinise to
[normal]o
[normal] closely the foundations of the current climate change explanation
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]or to 
[normal]look elsewhere for viable explanations.

[normal]The normal modes of scientific scrutiny, when applied to climate science, have suffered an almost endemic breakdown. Where 
[normal]adherence to policy overrides the need to adequately appraise or value information on its own merit. Where individuals or institutions 
[normal]have an incentive to reject valid and relevant information which 
[normal]may 
[normal]undermine the financing for their own research.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion
[normal]AR5 does not 
[normal]address the reliability of climate models, because there is an institutionalized rejection of models whose definition lies outside of the prevailing emissions based climate theory. 
[normal]It may be the case
[normal] 
[normal]that grant funding bodies a
[normal]re reluctant to finance research that may undermine the general emissions policy. 
[normal]The climate research institutions, upon whom we rely for an honest and accurate provision of information, are quickly becoming the least reliable authorities at providing th
[normal]at same information, since it is their ambition to adhere to the 
[normal]aspirations of the IPCC, despite their 
[normal]100% failure record
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation
[normal]It has become essential for finance to become available for research into factors affecting the formation of Easterly Waves: the main meteorological system that provides the cloud 
[normal]mass
[normal] over the Equatorial 
[normal]Oceans
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This determines how much of the solar radia
[normal]tion is providing the ocean warming as mentioned in AR5. 
[normal]Until it be
[normal]comes known why this cloud mass
[normal] has significantly reduced, ALL CLIMATE MODELS are meaningless.

[normal]Since NASA’s Godard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is an American organisation, whenever possible the USA is placed in th
[normal]e centre of the picture, to please both their tax payers and to provide a simple geographical reference. In this particular image a large slice of West Africa and South America can be seen, but no USA. To produce the same image with the US
[normal]A
[normal] in the picture,
[normal] one would be confronted with the fact that the sea warming 
[normal]zone
[normal] as shown here
[normal],
[normal] actually skips over Central America and into the Pacific (as demonstrated in ‘The Nile Climate Engine’). It should also been known that despite the rendering on the GISS image,
[normal] this warming zone is ALWAYS highest off the West African Coast, not in the Caribbean, as shown in this highly misleading picture. Also it is pertinent that the temperature variability within this warming zone is consistent with GISS’s published data for G
[normal]lobal Temperatures.
[normal] 
[normal]In every respect the GISS image is profoundly misleading and is configured to specifically provide a false image of the key factors
[normal],
[normal] whilst obscuring relevant features.
[normal]The graphic artist that refined this GISS image would not have 
[normal]produced and published such a misleading picture of global significance
[normal] off his own bat,
[normal] that order would only have come form a very senior person in the organisation. The head of GISS was the very same person that produced the latest version of the explan
[normal]ation for global climate change.
