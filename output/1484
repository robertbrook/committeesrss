defaultOur responses are as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultNdefaultational defaultAdefaultudit defaultOffice first point defaultBetween 1995 and 2011, overall annual spending on R&amp;D increased in real terms by 37% (from just under £20 billion to just under £27 billion) and most of
default this growth was driven by UK businesses. However, spending declined between 2007 and 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultPHE ResponsedefaultWe do not have a response available for this point. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNational Audit Office defaultsecond pointdefaultBetween 1995 and 2011, the Government has progressively 
defaultreduced the amount it spends on undertaking R&amp;D itself through public research institutions but, at the same time, has increased the funding it provides to UK businesses.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPHE ResponsedefaultWe welcome the fact that government funding routed through industry ha
defaults increased.
default&#xa0;
default In our experience TSB funding has provided an effective incentive for SMEs to undertake R&amp;D in areas of importance to public health, and to collaborate with PHE where access to specialist science or facilities is required.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have some 
defaultconcerns about the reduction in R&amp;D conducted by Public Sector Research Establishments.
default&#xa0;
default PSREs have a valuable role to play in addressing issues of societal importance through challenge-led R&amp;D.
default&#xa0;
default Such R&amp;D is typically unattractive to both academic bodies (
defaultas it tends to be focused on outcomes rather than publications) and to industry (as it may not offer sufficient commercial return) but government R&amp;D can be a valuable bridge between the two.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe historical perception that the UK is “good at innovation, b
defaultad at exploitation” is no longer universally true, but care must be taken to ensure that incentives exist to translate innovation into practical outcomes and economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default The inclusion of impact assessment into academic R&amp;D funding allocation decision
defaults has been beneficial, and could usefully be extended to bodies such as the NHS and PSREs which conduct R&amp;D for the benefit of the public but have limited capacity to exploit and disseminate the resulting innovations.
default&#xa0;
defaultNational Audit Office defaultthird pointdefaultUK 
defaultbusiness R&amp;D spending 
defaultis concentrated
default in a small number of very large firms, with the pharmaceuticals sector accounting for 28% of total UK business R&amp;D spend. This sector is a key driver of innovation but the UK’s reliance on the sector is also a risk.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultPHE ResponsedefaultA strong and innovative UK R&amp;D base is an important element in ensuring improved public health in the UK.
default&#xa0;
default This is true not only in the obvious areas of vaccines and pharmaceuticals, but also in ICT (app
defaultlications
default, software and data analytical 
defaulttools of relevance to public health), genomics, remote sensing, geographic information, nutrition, and social marketing.
default&#xa0;
default We would welcome further R&amp;D growth in these areas without neglecting the UK’s leading position in pharmaceutical sciences.
default&#xa0;
defaultNational defaultAudit Office defaultfourth pointdefaultThe UK receives a significant amount of R&amp;D funding from the European Commission:  Framework Programme.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultPHE ResponsedefaultThe European Commission supports world-class collaborative research and is a major contributor of funding and f
defaultuture collaboration opportunities to PHE researchers.  PHE 
defaulthas an excellent international reputation and 
defaultparticipates in an extensive network of 
defaultmultidisciplinary collaborative research projects 
defaultwith European public health institutes a
defaultnd other European 
defaultorganisations.  
defaultThese c
defaultollaborations have 
defaulta number of positive aspects including formal and informal information exchange and pooling of resources, as well as opportunities to benefit from EU funded research outputs and support national research with poole
defaultd expertise. 
defaultThe European funding framework (Horizon 2020) will present excellent opportunities for PHE to compete for resources to improve national health protection.
