defaultWritten Submission from defaultAIC default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultSummarydefaultAIC represents the UK agricultural supply industry, companies involved in the 
defaultmanufacture and 
defaultsupply of inputs
default and advice
default to producers and the purchase of combinable crops from farms.
default  
defaultAIC’s membership 
defaultconsists predominantly of SME’s.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn submitting evidence to the Committee’s 2009 enquiry, 
defaultAIC h
defaulte
defaultld the view that 
default“… 
defaultthe UK food system is robust and in the primary chain has worked hard together in recent years to develop independently audited and accredit
defaulted assurance schemes which have supported a robust system but which have also added transparency.  AIC believes therefore that the industry is well placed to respond to the challenges which will arise in the next 40 years.
default”  Our view today has not changed 
defaultand the systems we referred to in 2009 remain in place and have been developed and refined since.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have however been some significant changes to the landscape since 2009, not least the 
defaultdetermination made at EU level to base its decision making process on the assessment of hazard, rather than risk.  This has, and will 
defaultcontinue 
defaultover the coming years, 
defaultto 
defaultremove a large number of active ingredients from the EU marketplace and therefore 
defaultgiv
defaulte 
defaultthe EU agricultural industry
default considerable difficulties in meeting the requirements for food security which the EFRA Committee, and others, might wish to see.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the major concerns which AIC has, looking forward to some of the targets being discussed o
defaultver the next 30-40 years, is the focus they place on the need for increased production.  Whilst it is imperative that we look forward in that way, and recognise the importance technology will play in that, there is currently a lack of focus on the challeng
defaultes which are placed in the way of the industry accessing technologies.  At a more fundamental level the impact of the hazard to risk issue, raised earlier, 
defaultmeans that industry is also not able to retain existing technology.  AIC is, with the support of oth
defaulter bodies in the agricultural sector, just embarking on project to determine the cumulative impact of threats faced by UK agriculture in the near future whilst at the same time evaluating the opportunities and access to them.  Part of this work has to be a
default fundamental re-evaluation of the legislative decision making processes within the EU system which places a robust scientific assessment at the heart of determining the introduction of new technologies into the EU farming structure.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain as in 2009, 
defaultAIC 
defaultwould place the industry’s access to technology at the heart of future strategy.  
defaultIt remains a central point that use of 
defaulttechnologies will be dependent on consumer acceptance 
defaultand we welcome the recognition, through the Agri-Tech Strategy, of the need to lo
defaultok at 
defaultaccess to technology a
defaultlongside
default a functioning and properly funded agricultural science base.  
defaultWhere progress still needs to be made is in the recognition by government of
default the role played in transferring science knowledge into practical on-farm applications

defaultSpecific Questions
default&#xa0;
defaultHowdefault best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficientlydefaultWe very much welcome the Committee’s recognition that issues such as food security are improved through the efficient us
defaulte of resource rather than talking about a reduction in resource use – which may well be counter-productive from a security point of view.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst much of the answer lies in the quality of information and advice obtained by individual producers, there is a 
defaultrole for legislation to play 
defaultin terms of the flexibility it can offer.  Whilst we support the development at EU level of a framework in which people can operate, there should be a continuing role for interpretation at a national 
defaultlevel which provides a degr
defaultee of flexibility in how best legislation can be used to deliver a desired outcome.  We have seen an example in the UK, where ironically the lack of flexibility comes from the devolution legislation than from the EU, which does not allow the application of
default less mobile plant nutrients (eg. potassium and potash) at certain times of the year because these nutrients come in a form which contains a small amount of nitrogen  - which is itself restricted in closed periods.   A pragmatic approach allows the applica
defaulttion as it delivers the most sensible outcome and recognises the lack of a negative impact of nitrogen at the levels involved.  A strict interpretation however prohibits the right result being achieved in order to stay within the letter, rather than the sp
defaultirit, of the law.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the concerns 
defaultto have
default been highlighted by a number of commentators recently is the gap in performance between those producers at the top of the table and those 
defaultfurther down.  Whilst there are many who believe the solution to this is simply to throw more money at projects which demonstrate particular advances, this approach misunderstands the 
defaultmotives of the prospective audience, the farmer.
default  Interpretation of rese
defaultarch advances, packaging of such into actions that can be taken onto farm and the knowledge transfer involved in seeing a change in farmer 
defaultactivity/ best practice all requires individual knowledge of the farm, the aspirations and motivation of the farmer a
defaultnd therefore the most appropriate way in which changes can be made.  This is particularly important in relation to those farmers who are more reluctant than others to attend events.  Knowledge transfer is therefore critical to the efficient use of resource
default and requires practical, rather than just theoretical, knowledge of its on-farm application.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing itdefaultAIC is not sufficiently qualified to answer this question other than to suggest that with
defaultin the primary agriculture and food chain, which includes to the point of first processing (eg. flour miller, animal feed manufacturer etc.), the industry operates on very low margins, usually considerably below the 5% figure recently quoted in the area of
default power generation and supply.  This results in a competitive marketplace and ensures the costs of raw materials entering 
defaultthe food manufacturing chain represent an efficient supply chain.
defaultOur greater concern from the perspective of food security is how that
default cost of production might alter in the coming years.  AIC is embarking on a study over the next 12-18 months to look at the cumulative costs which the production industry is facing, both in terms of restrictions on access to new technologies and loss of ex
defaultisting technologies/ products.  This will impact not only our ability to produce agricultural product at a cost which is competitive in a world market but also our ability to meet the increased production aspirations which governments and others have ident
defaultified as the consequence of the growing population and the need for ‘sustainable intensification’.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe remain happy to provide the Committee with more details of the rationale behind this work as appropriate. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe implications of volatility in global defaultfood supply and demand for UK food securitydefaultIn the UK food security is inextricably linked to global production, demand and supply, and must be considered in this broader context. As such, the UK already experiences shocks to its food system. For example, 
defaultthe price spikes of 2008 and a 5.2 per cent rise in the average UK food bill between July 2010 and July 2011
default. 
defaultWhen we think about the sustainability, safety and resilience of UK food imports, we must consider challenges which range from those with a local 
defaultor UK national focus to more wide-ranging European and global issues. These are points highlighted by the Global Food Security Programme (2012).
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability can contribute to increased resdefaultiliencedefaultOver the past 20 years in the combinable crops supply chain as an example, there has been a marked increase in the level of activity that the chain has taken collectively.  We would cite the Cereal Liaison Group, facilitated by the HGCA, as a very 
defaultgood example of how the chain has worked effectively to deal with issues within the chain and support activities that have helped to improve co-ordination of issues within the chain and, thereby, the expected resilience of the chain.  We are aware of other
default initiatives in other chains where the different parts of the chain are increasingly working together to identify future issues
default.  We believe the Committee should encourage more of this sort of activity using existing and established representative bodies a
defaultt both farming and trade level as a conduit through which information can be shared with a much wider group of players than would be the case 
defaultwith centrally tendered government initiatives which do little other than reach a fraction of the intended audienc
defaulte.
default&#xa0;defaultWhether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security, strategies and planningdefaultAs highlighted in the Foresight Report (2011) changing climatic conditions present risks to food production including impacts on crop growth and livestock performance, the availability of water and the functioning of ecosystem services. 
defaultChanging climate ma
defaulty also lead to changes in the distribution and/or severity of pests and diseases, as well as impacting pollinator number
defaults
default. 
defaultIncreasing climate and environment related disruptions will affect UK food supply in terms of price, choice and availability. 
defaultTherefo
defaultre it is vital that climate change risks are incorporated in food security policy.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new marketsdefaultNot comprehensive, but these would include
default:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWays of increasing self sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantagedefaultAs demonstrated by Defra stat’s over the years t
defaulthe UK
default’s self-sufficiency has consistently declined 
defaultfrom 
defaultalmost 80% in 1984 to around 60% in 2010. W
defaulte currently import around £37.6bn of food and drink
default which demonstrates that the UK is becoming increasingly dependent on food imports and, at the same time, is one of the few developed countries with a population 
defaultthat is expected to expand significantly over the next few decades.

defaulthere is significant potential for the UK to produce more food products. 
defaultThis, 
defaulthowever, is largely dependent on the right 
defaultpolicy 
defaultframework and market signals, as well as the provision of
default an environment in which farm
defaulters are confident to invest in, to enable the
default entire food chain to grow.

defaults
default that hazard based approaches to 
defaultlegislative frameworks are
default impeding our ability to produce food in the UK – which is at odds with the current 
defaultUK 
defaultGovernment’s 
defaultfocus on growing the economy. 
defaultCite an example….
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is 
defaultconsumer appetite for more home-grown food
default products
default. For example, a One Poll (2013) survey revealed that 78% of shoppers believe supermarkets should stock more British Food, whilst 42% revealed that recent 
defaultissues around food provenance 
defaultmeans that are more 
defaultlikely to purchase traceable food produced on British farms. 
defaultWith appropriate legislation the agricultural industry would have increased access to 
defaulttechnologies to produce more 
defaultfood in the UK and meet the challenge of sustainable intensification.
