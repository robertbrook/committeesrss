[[[Written evidence submitted by the ]]]

[[[Palestine Solidarity Campaign ]]]Palestine Solidarity Campaign welcomes the opportunity to submit this evidence to the International Development Inquiry into DfID’s work in the Middle East. Our submission covers DfID’s work in occupied Palestinian territory. The submission outlines the importance of Area C and East Jerusalem to the long term future of Palestinians, a Palestinian state and economic independence. Given this, the submission suggests it is vital that DfID support the development of healthcare and educational facilities within Area C and East Jerusalem. Furthermore, it suggests this should be done in tandem with the FCO taking further action against Israel’s programme of illegal settlement building and demolitions of Palestinian structures. In addition, the submission outlines that humanitarian aid in Gaza will fail to meet need until the blockade is lifted, and that significant infrastructural development will be required to prevent further humanitarian catastrophes. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_11_12_2013_press_release_english.pdf http://www.btsele m.org/publications/201306_area_c https://www.gov.uk/government/priority/supporting-development-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territories-opts http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2013-008784&amp;language=ENhttp://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_protection_of_civilians_weekly_report_2014_01_10_english.pdf http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_the_humanitarian_monitor_2013_11_25_english.pdf http://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/file/publications/gaza/Gaza%20in%202020.pdf
