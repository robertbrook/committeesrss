[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Case 1&#xa0;Case 2&#xa0;&#xa0;Case 3&#xa0;Case 4“An authorised veterinary practitioner would have originally accompanied the inspecting officer at the first visit to grant the licence, but as the licence was first issued well over 10 years ago we no longer hold any paperwork relating to the report he would have submitted following his visit.&#xa0; &#xa0;Section 1 (5) of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 states that “a local authority shall not grant a licence under this Act unless a veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner authorised by the authority to do so under section 3 of this Act has inspected the premises...  and the authority has received and considered a report by the surgeon or practitioner, containing such particulars as in the authority’s opinion enable it to decide whether the premises are such that any animal proposed to be kept under the authority of the licence may suitably be held there, and describing the condition of the premises and of any animal or thing found there.”Licences are not “renewed” under the DWAA; new licences must be applied for every two years.  A veterinary inspection is required by law upon each application. Canterbury failed to fulfil this obligation for, in their words, “well over ten years”, instead relying on the judgement of their own inspector as to whether further assessment was required. Canterbury stated: “We would also request a veterinary practitioner visit if we identified any concerns during subsequent renewal visits”, yet even with the apparent passing of one of a pair of monkeys, leaving the remaining monkey without the company of any conspecific (a contravention of the requirements set out in the Code), no such concerns seem to have been identified.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
