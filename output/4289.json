Industry \nis not afforded the same privilege and in addition has to bear the pass through cost of the certainty afforded to the power generators.\n \nGovernment\n must\n provide\n \nthe same balance of \nincentives and funding \nacross\n all sectors\n of the economy\n.\n1.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nS\nectors like cement and lime where plant lasts around 35-40 years, \nneed\n long term certainty to attract investment. \nUp to now industry has been a missed\n opportunity for UK Government\n’s\n \nlow carbon benefits\n. Now would be the ideal time to put some of the low \ncarbon innovation underspend to good use in this sector.\n1.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nConsiderable work is required to make the UK an attractive place to invest. This can only be achieved through\n the\n provision of incentives to attract investment and \nthe \nminimiz\nation of\n the cumulative\n burden of climate change and energy policies on industry.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar and silica sand industries. With the recent addition of The British Precast Concrete Federation (BPCF) and the Brit\nish Association of Reinforcement (BAR), it has a growing membership of \nover \n450 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membership is made up of the vast majority of independent SME companies throughout the UK, as well as the 9 major \ninternational and global companies. It covers 100% of GB cement production, 90% of aggregates production and 95% of asphalt and ready-mixed concrete production and 70% of precast concrete production. Each year the industry supplies £9 billion of materials \nand services to the £120 billion construction and other sectors. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is also one of the largest manufacturing sectors\n. \n2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThis respons\ne relates largely to the MPA Cement and Britis\nh Lime Association activities which are p\nart of the Mineral Products Association.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWill the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nEnergy and CO\n2\n \ntargets will not be achieved at lowest cost \nwith the current support programme\n.\n \nLow carbon innovation \nopportunities exist in industry but t\nhe absence of support for manufacturing make\ns\n the UK \nless attractive\n \nfor investment\n. \nThe UK Government can achieve the \ntwin\n \nbenefit \nof growing the economy and enhancing\n the environment \nif it supports\n low carbon manufacturing industry.\n3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIn 2013 the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) published evidence\n that the UK carbon budgets set in the Climate Change Act are being met by a shift from manufacturing goods in the UK to importing goods manufactured elsewhere\n (carbon leakage)\n. \nIn \ndoing so\n,\n t\nhe \nUK is exporting emission responsibilities to other countries \nrather than \ncontributing to an overall reduction in \nglobal emissions.\n3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe CCC have not quantified production\n,\n investment\n and jobs\n leakage\n but\n MPA would expect this to also show a shift from the UK to other countries.\n If the \nabsence of support for manufacturing industries \ncontinues to drive invest\nment\n \nabroad\n \nit will be impossible for the UK to innovate \nas the capital and manufacturing required for growth of a low carbon economy will be exported\n. F\nunding for innovation will\n \nthen \nno\n longer\n be required\n and the UK will be dependent on the innovations of other countries.\n \n3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nUK manufacturing requires a certain but well-crafted green policy agenda that is synergistic with its manufacturing and industrial policy in order to assist lo\nng term investments. \nFor funding \nof\n low carbon innovation \nto be successful\n, the \nUK\n \ntherefore \nneed\ns\n to \nensure that carbon\n,\n production\n and jobs\n \nleakage \nis minimized. \n3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe renewable energy targets that have been set are going to be difficult to meet. UK Government policy \nto date \nhas concentrated on giving power generators certainty so that \nthey can\n carry out low risk investment in renewable energy \nvia guaranteed subsidie\ns\n and cost pass-through opportunities\n.\n \n3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nI\nndustry\n is not afforded the same privilege \nof \nlow risk investment \nand\n in addition\n \nis having to bear \nthe \never increasing pass through costs from the \npower generators. \nMPA has calculated that the indirect cost of energy and climate change policies \nfaced by \nthe cement sector \ncould reach \n€80m a year by 2020. This \nsignificant cost is further reducing the ability for industry to\n invest in \nlow carbon \ninnovation. \n3.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nRecent indications from Government are that domestic consumers will be given relief from green levies and taxes but what has not been made clear is whether this \ncost \nwill\n be\n \nloaded \nonto industrial \nconsumers\n. If this is the case then the cost to cement manu\nfacturers will be \neven \ngreater than €80m a year.\n This is not making the UK \nan \nattractive \nplace \nto locate energy intensive manufacturing industry that is essential for low carbon innovation.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoes the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n T\nhe balance between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies \nwill not\n be right until \nGovernment pro\nvides \nthe same balance of \nincentives and funding across\n all sectors\n of the economy\n.\n4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n On 4\nth\n December \n2013 \nthe Government announcements relating to strike prices clearly indicated \nthat the Government is favoring \nrenewable energy technology \nin the power generation sector. Government has not shown the same intere\nst in supporting specific technologies for industry\n. \n4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nAt the other end of the scale d\nomestic \nand smaller energy \nconsumers are \nprovided with \nincentives through schemes like the Renewable Heat Incentive. \nI\nndustr\nial processes\n on the other hand \nface an ‘all stick and no carrot \napproach\n’ with less attractive\n one\n-\noff grants as and when they become available. \nTh\nis\n provides a less attractive industrial investment opportunity\n and results in an imbalance \nof incentives and funding \nbetween the power gene\nration, domestic and industrial sectors.\n \nMeanwhile, incentives for the use of biomass by both power generators and domestic\n and smaller\n consumers pushes the cost \nof biomass \nup for \nindustrial \nsectors that\n do not receive incentives. This is only going to result in a shift in the use of biomass from one sector to another rather than a net increase as is required to meet the targets set. \nAnnex I illustrates this shift as a schematic.\n4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The Green Investment Ban\nk could have provided industry with funding at low \ninterest \nrates but \ni\nt \nactually \nprovides no additional incentive \nto invest in renewable energy or low carbon technologies \nover other bank based loans. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) funds expensive technologies for small \nenergy \nusers, while \nindustry, which consumes energy\n on a large scale and more efficiently\n in directly fired operations rather than boilers\n, receives no incentive to use biomass.\n \nA calculation of \nthe cost of installing a technology per tonne of CO\n2\n emissions avoided or alternatively the cost of switching fuel per tonne of CO\n2\n emissions avoided\n will demonstrate if an investment or incentive is a cost effective success\n.\n5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The Government response to the RHI consultation published on 4\nth\n December \n2013 \nst\nated\n that the use of biomass for direct heating would not be included in the scheme in this spending \nreview\n. The Government needs to ensure that \nbiomass direct heating \nis included in revisions to RHI for the next spending review\n period\n.\n This will stimulate innovation in industrial sectors, such as\n asphalt,\n cement and \nlime, which\n use direct heating in their processes. The success of this would be measured in the number of installations switching from fossil fuel use to biomass.\n \n \n \n \n&#xa0;6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nNo, \ninvestment needs to be targeted across all sectors of the economy and particularly towards industry where there \nis \nc\nurrently \nan absence of support\n \nf\nor investment in low carbon innovation. \n6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIn addition, \nmany Government incentives such as RHI are only applicable to new build\n. The maintenance and refurbishment of existing plant could contribute substantially\n, and at lower\n cost,\n to Government targets. \n&#xa0;\n \n 7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n S\nectors like cement and lime \nwhich have \nplant \nwith lifetimes of\n around 35-40 years, \nneed long term certainty in order to attract \ninvestment. Short term funding timelines do not provide the certainty required. \n7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIn the cement sector 60% of direct emissions of carbon dioxide arise from the decomposition of limestone (process emissions). \nTo address its climate change \nresponsibilities \nthe UK cement industry has developed a GHG Strategy for 2050\n. It outlines where Government support is need\ned\n.\n One of the principle technologies will be carbon capture and storage (CCS) which could address both process emissions and combustion emissions fr\nom cement manufacture. \nOpportunities to develop CCS cannot be achieved on short term funding timelines. \nThe UK should follow the example set by the Norwegian Government by funding a cement industry CCS pilot plant. The Norwegian example is the first of its\n kind and shows that the UK will be behind other countries in its low carbon development if the current absence of industrial low carbon support is not rectified.\n&#xa0;8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n There are plenty of investment opportunities in industry that could make a real and lasting contribution to UK renewable energy and emissions targets. Up to now industry has been a missed opportunity for UK \nGovernment. Now would be the ideal time to put some of this underspend to good use in this sector.\n8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nMPA suggests that there should be a sectoral allocation of the low carbon capital allocation.\n&#xa0;9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?9.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Currently \nthe UK is not an attractive place to invest and \ndomestic and \ninternational companies\n with operations in the UK\n \nare choosing\n \nto \nmake \ninvestments\n \nelsewhere\n. The consequences are tha\nt the \nUK\n \nmay lose the production of essential\n materials like cement and lime to other countries. \nThe subsequent import of products \nis\n then\n further increasing emissions relating to UK consumption. Considerable work is required to make the UK an attractive place to invest. This can only be achieved \nthrough \nthe \nprovision of\n incentives \nto attract investment\n a\nnd \nthe \nminimiz\nation of\n the \ncumulative\n burden of climate change and energy policies\n on industry\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex\n I\n: \nThe biased support for renewable fuel that disadvantages renewable fuel use in directly fired processes e.g. cement, lime \nand \nasphalt\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n              \n&#xa0;\n \n“Make the Link: The Mineral Products Industry’s Contribution to the UK”, 2012, \nhttp://www.mineralproducts.org/documents/MPA_MTL_Document.pdf\n  \n “Reducing the UK’s carbon footprint and managing competitiveness risks”, CCC, April 2013: \nhttp://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/carbon-footprint-and-competitiveness/\n \n \nFor more information see the UK Cement Industry 2050 GHG strategy: \nhttp://cement.mineralproducts.org/documents/MPA_Cement_2050_Strategy.pdf\n"
