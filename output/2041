[normal]Comments for inclusion in the Deregulation Bill
[normal]The inappropriate use of Green Lanes by 4x4s and Trail bikes is a major nuisance and cause of damage to Green Lanes. Current regulations reflect the  position in late 19
[normal]th
[normal] century of Britain rather than current needs. Local populations need a much simpler and cheaper method to be able to correct anomalies.
[normal]We support the submission on this by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lane Alliance (YDGLA).  Near Hellifield, North Yorks, we have witnessed the dramatic effect of the imposition of a TRO on a Green Lane leading out of the village (Haw Lane / Langber Lane).  The stopping of damage to the grazing fields and dramatic reduction of local nuisance has been striking. On other Green Lanes which we use, we have noted the difficulty and cost to local authorities in placing permanent TROs.
[normal]We would therefore wish to a simple change whereby all unsealed BOATS (byways open to all traffic) and all unsealed unclassified county roads (UCRs) should be reclassified as restricted byways, and not be recognised as part of the ordinary roads network.
[normal]A second change would remedy a serious problem with procedures for Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs).  At present a local authority can refuse to consider the imposition of a TRO whatever the strength and amount of requests from the public.  Currently there is no appeal mechanism available to people who wish to oppose a TRO. 
[normal]We therefore recommend that when a local authority declines to recommend a TRO that is widely supported by people, there should be right of appeal either to an independent inspector or a magistrate.
