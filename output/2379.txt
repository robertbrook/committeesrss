[[[Tim Wade â€“ Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I write to ask that the Bill grasps the opportunity to deal with the abuse by off road vehicles and motor cycles of Byeways Open to All Traffic (BOATS) and similar.&#xa0;The nature of this abuse is that these byeways are frequently rendered impassable or nearly so to pedestrians and horse traffic by being cut up to a huge degree. This cutting up indeed seems to be the principle enjoyment of the off-road community; if it is not a "challenge", where is the fun of it? What appears to be gratuitous damage is commonplace.&#xa0;Damage done is not only to the designated track but to adjacent land and fences as well.&#xa0;The potential for greater enjoyment, indeed of enjoyment at all, by wheel-less users is clearlydemonstrated by the example of those limited parts of the Ridgeway which have been closed to vehicular traffic year round and which are now enjoyed and available to foot travellers in a manner not seen for years.&#xa0;In discussion with the Local Authority it is clear that they consider that the law as it stands makes it difficult for the Authority to close such byeways to off-roaders, whilst the cost of maintenance as a result of off-road activity is huge.&#xa0;Please give the Local Authorities the tools with which to deal with this menace and to enhance the enjoyment of rights of way by the great majority of users.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 20132 of 1&#xa0;
