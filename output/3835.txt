Delay cannot be an excuse for failing to do that. None of the delay, it seems has arisen as a result of the fault of the applicant.”   [3]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Article 8 (1) of the Human Rights Act and the GMC’s Data Base of findings against the doctor&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;     Article 8(2) states:2   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security [or] public safety . . . for the prevention of disorder or crime, . . . or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&#xa0;&#xa0;Article 8(1) Right to a private life

It is expected to make               proposals to scale back the use of systems involving criminal records to common sense levels.”&#xa0;As a result of the review there have been changes which enable rehabilitated persons to re-establish their lives, in a way that doctors are unable to.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;[1] Information Commissioners Letter of findings against the GMC dated 29 May 2002[2] Information Commissioners Letter of findings against the GMC dated 15 May 2004[3] The Queen on the Application of Colman v GMC  [2009] EWCA Civ 746 [4] The Queen on the Application of John Oldroyd Catt v (1) The Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland and ors [2012] EWHC 1472 (Admin).
