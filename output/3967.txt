[[[Executive summary: ]]]We believe that the General Medical Council should have a role in ensuring that doctors working on clinical trials or who worked on a clinical trial in the past on any treatment in current use ensures that the clinical trial has been registered and a summary of the findings is publicly available. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“(i) Selective non-publication of unflattering trial data is research misconduct; “(ii) Registered medical practitioners who give grounds to believe they have been involved in such conduct should have their fitness to practice assessed by the GMC.”  &#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013 &#xa0;&#xa0;
