"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Jonathan Simon [CST0030]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI believe UK Police Polices are now universally involved in a “Crime Quota/Target” system which corrupt, not impartial and incorrect.\n&#xa0;\nIn other words Police Officers are so engrained\n with the “need for a conviction” after arrest that they will ignore any potential crime or potential crime unless they have that possibility.\n&#xa0;\nI have personally been a direct victim of this kind of “policy” in Wiltshire but can see that it is operating el\nsewhere too. Just look at the recent murder of the man in Bristol who had repeatedly called the police for help and protection. They did nothing. He’s now dead and wrongfully investigated for \npaedophilia\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn my own case I became a victim of crime and trie\nd to get police help. Consistently, again and again, they refused to act despite being given named individuals connected to gangs.\n&#xa0;\nAgain and again they  said “we can’t do anything unless there is scientific evidence”. That is no way to “police” anything. \nIt’s useless.\n&#xa0;\nThis form of “lunacy” is directed impacted by the “crime statistics quota/target” system which essentially has the effect of creating a failed police force until someone is harmed, hurt, attacked, killed or major property damage is done. The\nn there’s “scientific evidence”.\n&#xa0;\nIt’s too late!\n&#xa0;\nWhat’s the point of that? It’s worse than useless.\n&#xa0;\nBut it gets worse. It has instilled in police officers an attitude of arrogance, aggressiveness and the general idea that “they” are now not only the “cou\nrt of law” themselves but are indeed completely above the law.\n&#xa0;\nIf you don’t change this, then there is no point in having a police force at all.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
