[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1 People with disabilities are among the poorest of the poor but have not been adequately included in development or the MDGs; this must be rectified in any post-2015 development framework which should include clear indicators to measure disability inclusion. This is a critical moment for DFID to take a leadership role in championing disability in post-2015 discussions.1.2 Mainstreaming people with disabilities into development programmes can be effective if it actively includes people with disabilities in the planning process. A consortium approach, where at least one partner is able to provide expertise in disability is an effective model. 1.3 Programmes that use a twin-track approach – mainstreaming accompanied by disability-specific interventions – are particularly effective.1.4 Disability disaggregated data is needed at national but also project level, in order to plan appropriately and measure inclusion. 1.5 Disability is not just a medical or physical issue. Strategies must also address the social, psychological and legal issues around disability, including addressing stigma through a combination of individual empowerment and community awareness.1.6 Disability strategies, as well as addressing the consequences of disability, should consider prevention of disability, including the treatment of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that cause disability, such as leprosy. 1.8 Inequalities intersect, so people with disabilities can also be marginalised due to gender, caste, ethnicity, location, etc. Mainstreaming is important, with programmes focusing on the person rather than just the disability.1.8 DFID has begun to recognise the need for disability inclusion but much more needs to be done to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are realised. This should include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0; The Leprosy Mission, established in 1874, is an international development organisation working in 11 leprosy-endemic countries to defeat leprosy and transform the lives of people affected by the disease.  It uses a holistic approach to development that addresses not only the medical aspects of leprosy and disability but promotes social inclusion of those who have been stigmatised and disabled, supporting them to realise their human rights and live in dignity.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0; TLMEW appreciates the initial steps DFID has taken towards the inclusion of people with disabilities, including the ‘How to Note on Working on Disability in Country Programmes’ and other guidance documents.

[[[ ]]] TLMEW also commends Lynne Featherstone MP’s recent signing of the Manhattan Declaration on the Inclusion of People with Disabilities and her announcement that schools built with DFID funding will be accessible.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0; TLMEW is currently receiving support from DFID for two projects that seek to meet the needs of people affected by leprosy and disability:

[[[ ]]]Challenging Anti-Leprosy Legislation that is facilitating people affected by leprosy to unite and advocate for their equal rights and entitlements at local, state and national level; and Reducing the physical and social barriers faced by 2,000 people with disabilities in seven States and Regions in Myanmar and improving their livelihood opportunities which facilitates employment of people with disabilities through small business creation, as well as working with the private sector and government to ensure their inclusion in the workplace.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0; Although DFID has made a good start, much more must be done to ensure people with disabilities are not left behind in the development process and to meet the UK’s obligations under Article 32 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) with regard to International Cooperation. &#xa0;&#xa0;3.1 People with disabilities comprise some of the world’s most marginalised and vulnerable people. According to the WHO ‘people with disabilities and their families are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage than those without disability’.&#xa0;3.2 It is not sufficient for development programmes to target the easiest to reach. In order to effectively address poverty, DFID-supported programmes (including Bilateral and Multilateral Aid) must target the poorest-of-the-poor. It can be argued that without involvement of people with disabilities, poverty alleviation measures will not achieve full success: for ‘people with a disability are less likely to attend school, more likely to be unemployed, while households with a disabled member are more likely to experience material hardship – including food insecurity, poor housing, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, and inadequate access to health care’, affecting a wide range of development indicators.   

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.3 On the whole most conventional development programmes do not by default include people with disabilities. This is not necessary due to their impairment or functional limitation. Inadequate policies, negative attitudes and lack of accessibility often prohibit their participation. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.4 The WHO World Report on Disability (2011) calls for inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream programmes: ‘People with disabilities have ordinary needs – for health and well-being, for economic and social security, to learn and develop skills, and to live in their communities. These needs can and should be met in mainstream programmes and services. Mainstreaming not only fulfils the human rights of persons with disabilities, it is also more effective’.   

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.5 Despite there being international recognition that a key factor in preventing the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is the lack of inclusion of people with disabilities, there is currently no DFID policy nor strategy on disability. Thus there is no obligation for DFID programmes to demonstrate or monitor the inclusion of disabled people. Therefore, disability is not adequately reflected within strategic documents in other areas, such as the Strategic Vision for Women and Girls. Neither is there a requirement that Bilateral nor Multilateral Aid is inclusive of people with disabilities.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.6 Even when disability is said to be ‘mainstreamed’ in some DFID-supported projects there is evidence that this has not necessarily been well implemented. For example, the DFID Char Livelihoods Project in Bangladesh, where although ‘disability’ was a criterion for selection, because people with disabilities were not specifically encouraged nor enabled to participate in the programme their involvement was limited, with only 3.3% of participants having a disability. Yet prevalence of disability in Bangladesh was 31.9% and as global proportions of disability are estimated to average between 15% -20% of the population  they were significantly under-represented. &#xa0;&#xa0;4.1 From 2009-13 TLMEW was part of a consortium implementing a large European Union funded programme: the Gaibandha Food Security Project for Ultra Poor Women (GFSUP) (see Annex 1).

[[[ ]]]The GFSUP was implemented in order to improve the food security situation of 40,000 women-headed households. Women were organised in 1,600 women’s groups, and these in turn formed federations. Women received training and assets to develop two income generating activities (IGAs) along with further training on homestead gardens, health and hygiene, disaster preparedness, and on how to access government benefits. People with disabilities were intentionally included in this project with support from a dedicated ‘disability and leprosy team’ that provided health education and rehabilitation services to beneficiaries and family members with a disability. This twin -track approach involved mainstreaming and disability-specific inputs.&#xa0;4.2 This intentionality in terms of inclusion led to 9.5% of direct beneficiaries being a person with disabilities and 21.4% of households of beneficiaries containing a person with disability, all of whom received various support services. This figure compares well to global estimates of the proportion of people with disabilities and far surpasses the proportion of people with disabilities included in the DFID Char Livelihoods Project which operated in adjacent sub-districts to the GFSUP.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3 This is a good example of ‘active’ mainstreaming where two international partners (Light for the World and TLMEW) and two of the consortium implementing partners Centre for Disability in Development (CDD) &amp; The Leprosy Mission Bangladesh (TLMB) had a disability focus. They raised the knowledge of mainstream NGO consortium partners on disability inclusion and kept the issue on the agenda. They also provided technical expertise for implementation and trained implementing partner staff. Often ‘mainstreaming’ can be merely a sensitisation which exists on paper but gets lost in project implementation. This active focus on disability inclusion proved very effective. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4 The report on Lessons Learnt from the GFSUP emphasised that disability must be considered in the project design phase if inclusion of people with disability and/or leprosy is to be effective.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.5 In order to plan for ‘mainstreaming’ it is essential that the needs assessment process involves actively seeking out people with disabilities, who in many cultures are often hidden away, explores their needs and involves them in the project design process.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.6 To assess the effectiveness of ‘mainstreaming’, sufficient baseline data and actively tracking the engagement of people with disabilities in the intervention is paramount.  Monitoring and evaluation with regard to disability inclusion should be both quantitative, the number of people with disabilities benefiting from the programme, but also qualitative, reflecting their level of participation in project activities as well as the most significant changes seen in their lives as a result of the intervention.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.7 Inclusion of people with disabilities is not as expensive as often imagined. For example, within the GFSUP project budget, provision for people with disabilities totalled just 6% of project costs even though there were many disability-specific services provided, demonstrating significant value for money in reaching the most marginalised and enabling them to contribute to the local economy.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.8 Mainstreaming of people with disabilities within a larger project, such as GFSUP, has also helped reduce stigma, as disabled members of self-help groups were treated as equal members alongside others with no impairment. They were encouraged to become involved in the groups and as their confidence and abilities came to the fore, they were respected for their talents and abilities. Their leprosy/disability then became much less significant in terms of their status, with many being voted into positions of responsibility within the groups and community.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1 Disability strategies and programmes must recognise that disability is not just a medical condition. There are significant social impacts of disability that must be addressed.&#xa0;5.2 In many cultures there is shame associated with disability resulting in people with disabilities being hidden away, prevented from engaging in their community and being denied their rights.  People affected by leprosy often are scared to admit their condition, or even to seek treatment, because of the stigma and social exclusion that often accompanies diagnosis. Many people try to hide their disability in order to retain social acceptance. (Annex 2)

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.3 When people experience clawed hands due to leprosy, not only are they unable to grip things, they are also unable to greet people. A simple Indian gesture of greeting ‘namaste’ highlights not only their disability but often triggers a deeply rooted fear of a disease that leads to stigma and discrimination. As a result, people affected by leprosy often withdraw from social interaction. Barriers to inclusion are not only physical, but also social and psychosocial; issues of stigma and discrimination need to be addressed.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.4 Working with the individual to build confidence and rights-awareness, as well as working with the wider community to promote understanding and support is vital. For example, in the TLMEW-supported MIRANDA project in Myanmar, Disability Resource Centres are providing physiotherapy services to people with disabilities, as well as counselling and rights-awareness. They have established self-help groups where people with disabilities provide support for each other for livelihood development and run community awareness programmes on disability.  These activities have resulted in people with disabilities became more valued and included in society and the whole community has benefited from more accessible raised pathways that are wheelchair accessible, meaning they no longer have to wade through monsoon floods to get to the marketplace (See Annex 3).

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.5 Legal support is also needed to ensure national legislation, policies and practice comply with the UNCRPD and discriminatory legislation is repealed. For example, leprosy is still grounds for divorce in India.&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1 Although it is essential to address the rights of persons with disabilities, it should be recognised that some people experience disability that could be prevented. Minimisation of the causes of disability is paramount (see Annex 4).&#xa0;6.2 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) such as Leprosy, Lymphatic Filariasis and Trachoma are a significant cause of serious disability worldwide representing high levels of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS - the sum of the potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability). These treatable diseases must be addressed in order to prevent people developing disabilities. Thus, DFID’s approach to NTDs should be linked to its disability strategy.

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.3 Addressing NTDs is not just about mass drug administration. For many of those who have received late diagnosis and treatment, disability is already a result. For some the disability is obvious. Others, including people affected by leprosy, may not have a visual disability but like those with diabetes the sensation loss they experience is disabling.  Proper self-care and management of their conditions is essential in preventing further disability. A disability is not always visible nor obvious, yet not supporting a person in prevention of disability can lead to further impairment.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1 Inequalities intersect, so a person with a disability may also be marginalised in other ways such as gender, caste, ethnicity, living in remote locations or by leprosy-related stigma.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.2 Being marginalised in one way often leads to other forms of marginalisation; for example poor access to health care due to discrimination due to ethnicity or caste may lead to late treatment after an accident or after contracting a disease, resulting in disability.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.3 It is notable that the risk of disability occurring is heightened due to marginalisation, and further marginalisation is more likely to occur due to disability. 

[[[ ]]]This therefore leads to a bi-directional link to poverty: disability may increase the risk of poverty, and poverty may increase the risk of disability

[[[ – Case Study]]]

[[[Jahiruddin, India]]]Jahiruddin Kahan is married with two children and two grandchildren. He has a small stationers shop on the edge of Kolkata. Twenty years ago, when he was 41 years old, he fell from a minibus and a stone went inside his leg. The ulcer that developed would not heal and he spent over 10 years going to different hospitals and doctors to get help. One doctor gave him medicine to which his body seemed to react and he became covered with boils.  He went to a skin specialist who referred him to an expert in tropical medicine.  It was there that leprosy was eventually diagnosed, he was given MDT and eventually the ulcer healed.&#xa0;However, 10 years without a diagnosis took its toll on his feet and nerve damage was evident. In 2003 he developed another ulcer and came to TLM’s Hospital.  Here doctors recognised that he had been given the wrong dose of MDT originally so he was given a new treatment regime, his leg was put in plaster to help his ulcer to heal and he returned home, coming back to the hospital every 15 days for a check-up and the rest of his treatment.  However, he never told anyone that he had leprosy. &#xa0;Four months ago he injured his toe and so he returned to the place where he had received loving care.  However, the severity of his wound meant that he needed a skin graft and a month of bed rest.  During this time, Kavita, a hospital volunteer, has been encouraging people to learn to read and write.  Jahiruddin was already literate and could write well in Bengali, so he decided to use his time in bed to write a story.  During my visit he proudly read what he had written, a story about a man, magic and a mango tree, a story with a clear moral message of the need to obey your master and the importance of honesty.&#xa0;Yet this talented man also expressed that he is frightened that when he returns home people will be suspicious of the causes of his problem since he has been away having treatment for so long.  He is worried that if they guess his disability is due to leprosy that he will be excluded by the local community of which he is a part.  As for his dreams, he said, “I want people to understand that leprosy is curable and not a curse, I want to return to my community as a businessman, not an untouchable. Don’t let them call me a ‘leper’.”&#xa0;

[[[Annex 3 – Case Study]]]

[[[Kan, Myanmar ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Kan Tint

[[[ ]]]is

[[[ ]]]67 years old and is married with seven children.  27 years ago he developed leprosy but waited for 7 years before accessing treatment, by which time the disease had attacked his nerves and he had permanent disability. However, it was not just his physical disability, cause by his clawed hands and loss of digits, which affected his life.  More painful than the physical impairment was the social stigma he experienced. &#xa0;&#xa0;Kan was rejected by his community and not allowed to attend social functions such as weddings or Buddhist festivals. He was looked down upon with distain and his friends deserted him.  He faced such rejection and despair that he tried to commit suicide twice, the first by taking tablets and then by hanging.  Eventually his family chained him up to prevent his suicide attempts.  The stigma, discrimination and isolation all got too much for Kan and he decided to move out of the village he had called home to go and live with his grandchildren.  &#xa0;It was here that he came in contact with The Leprosy Mission. Staff provided him with psychosocial support and worked with the community to raise awareness about leprosy and disability, working with them to help reintegrate Kan back into the community. It has been a long process, but he is now accepted in his village and can join in celebrations and community events without being shunned.  He is treated just like anyone else and now has the joys of watching his grandchildren growing up without being isolated from community life.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Annex 4 – Case study Nafisa, Nigeria]]]&#xa0;Nafisa Aminou, 20, is from Nigeria and was told, aged 14, she had leprosy and was advised to go to hospital for treatment. But instead she was given traditional herbal treatment for five years. If she was given multidrug therapy at an early stage, it would have been highly unlikely that she would have become disabled.&#xa0;Eighteen months ago she developed painful ulcers on her legs and hearing of the reputation of The Leprosy Mission's services run from Danja Hospital, she and her mother crossed the border to Niger. On arrival from Nigeria, Nafisa had seriously shortened limbs as a result of her untreated leprosy and her legs were too painful to be touched below the knees. She was given multidrug therapy to treat the disease and her legs were bandaged to in attempt to remove the swelling and some of the pain.&#xa0;Wheelchair-bound, she began physiotherapy sessions to improve her mobility. Her legs were put in a plaster cast to straighten them and Boehler irons were attached to the plaster casts for walking. She is now able to walk with the help of a walking frame but she is still awaiting surgery on her lower legs which will further increase her independence.&#xa0;Despite her disabilities Nafisa is hugely grateful for the medical treatment and love she has received at Danja Hospital. She is optimistic that her mobility will continue to improve and she dreams of marrying and having children.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 32 http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=292  World Report on Disability.
