"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Channel 4 [WAS0028]&#xa0;\nChannel 4 welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry into women’s sport.\nWe note, in particular, that the Committee has decided to focus in part on the media coverage of women’s sports. As a \nUK public service\n broadcaster\n that televises a select number of sporting events\n, Channel 4 is committed to providing coverage of women in \nsport, and our response below is confined specificall\ny to this aspect of the inquiry, rather than the broader topic of women’s sport.\nChannel 4’s coverage of sports has, over the years, tended to \nfocus on one or two major sporting commitments, for example \ncricket from 1999 to 2005 and, latterly, through our coverage of \ndisability\n sport and horseracing\n. In 2013, Channel 4 took over \nlive coverage of all the major horseracing meetings \nin the UK\n.\nThese events are both notable for involving sports in which women\n compete on an equal footing, either alongside men’s events (such as women’s athletics) or as competitors with men (for example, the Paralympic sport Boccia and in horseracing where there are an increasing number of female jockeys).\n As such, while Channel \n4 does not provide as extensive levels of sports coverage as other broadcasters, our coverage of a select number of sports makes a significant contribution to the coverage of female competitors as well as men.\nThe following submission \nsets out Channel 4’s \napproach to coverage in this area, looking at our current range of sports programming and our plans for broadcas\nting these sports in the future, which we hope the Committee will find useful as part of their wider inquiry into women’s sport.\nParalympic sport&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChannel 4 Racing&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChannel 4 NewsIn recent years, Channel 4 News \nhas\n also\n \nsought to pioneer coverage of women’s sports\n, covering a wide range of sports and gender issues, as well as \nanalysis of the growth of interest within a number of women’s sports\n, both on-screen and online. Such reports include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCommissioned researchChannel 4 recently undertook to educate itself \nmore about the state of play of women’s sport in the UK\n, commissioning a private\n external research project\n \non this issue for internal information purposes.\nWhile recognising that there are reasons to be \noptimistic about women’s sport – such as the\n impressive\n peak audiences for women’s events at the Olympics and Paralympics and the increasing levels of sponsorship of female athletes at London 2012 – this research found that there are a number of wider deve\nlopmental challenges that need to be tackled.\nFor example\n, while broadcast coverage may be a necessary condition for popularising women’s sport, it found that is not an exclusive one: many other factors are required to work as part of a virtuous cycle, as \noutlined in the graphic below:\n© Prospero Strategy LLP&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChannel 4 hopes this submission is of assistance to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and would be happy to discuss any of the points raised above in further detail if helpful.\nSeptember 2013\n5\n&#xa0;\n"
