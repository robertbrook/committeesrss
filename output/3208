defaultI should like to give my views on the flagrant bias shown by the BBC – it really should be renamed as the
default Labo
defaultur
default Broadcasting Corporation!
default   Over the past few years it has steadily got worse, with bias eviden
defaultt both in TV 
defaultand radio 
defaultcontent.  Radio comedy programmes such as 
defaultThe News Quiz
default and 
defaultThe One Show
default are examples.  Morning news features on Radio 4 have also show
defaultn a strong left-leaning bias.
defaultThe Corporation seems to be stuffed with employees who are obviously much sympathetic to leftist views such as those published in the Guardian newspaper.  Recent criticisms of actions by the Guardian in publishing facts almost
default certainly detrimental to the country’s security were scarcely mentioned on 
defaultBBC 
defaultTV and radio news programmes.  Emphasis has
default long
default been on ‘savage Tory cuts’, and if there occurs anything that could be seen as detrimental to the Tory party it is pounced upon
default gleefully by the news team!
defaultBBC interviewers tend to be hard on those holding right-wing views but very soft on those holding left-wing views.  Left-wing interviewees are generally afforded more air-time than their right-wing counterparts.
defaultThe BBC seems t
defaulto be accountable to no-one when large pay-offs and expensive relocation plans of dubious value are implemented.
defaultBBC
default bias seems to be increasing rather than de
defaultc
defaultreasing and I 
defaultfeel it is wrong for the nation to have 
defaultto pay a Licence Fee to fund such 
defaultpropagand
defaulta
default broadcasting.  The BBC should be an
default impartial
default organisation, as once it was!
