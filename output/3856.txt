[[[ ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We would like to request that you consider , in particular, the situation of Gypsies and Travellers who are threatened with eviction from their own land by a local authority which has already failed to comply with government guidance on the provision of Travellers’ sites. Legal Aid service providers would be unlikely to take on such cases as the risk of being denied &#xa0;any payment is too great . &#xa0;Gypsies and Travellers are amongst the most disadvantaged and marginalised of groups and would largely be unable to muster the resources or the monies &#xa0;to proceed. Thus &#xa0;they would be denied what to others is a basic &#xa0;human right – that of access to legal representation which is available as a matter of course, to others . This, in itself would we believe lead to a breach of Article 6 of the &#xa0;European Convention&#xa0;We had understood that in November the  JCHR would be inviting people to give oral evidence on the legal aid aspect of this consultation. Despite two formal requests to the  committee  office, we have  had no response to our request that Gypsies and Travellers be  invited, particularly as theirs is not a strongly literate culture and they have little means by which to respond themselves to the consultation .  If invited to meet, their  statements would  provide the committee with the direct  evidence that they are requesting .  As it is now the end of November we would appreciate  a response and  further  again request that we be invited.   &#xa0;
