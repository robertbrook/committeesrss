"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the British Heart Foundation (BTO 035)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe British Heart Foundation (BHF) is the nation’s leading heart charity. We are working to achieve our mission of a world in which no-one dies prematurely of heart disease in the UK. We fund ground-breaking medical research, provide support and care to people living with heart disease and advocate for change. We rely on donations from the public to fund our life saving work. \nAlthough we are currently funding medical research that \nmay\n \none day render the need for heart transplants obsolete, until then a heart transplant is the only effective treatmen\nt available for people with end-\nstage heart failure. \n&#xa0;\nThe BHF warmly welcome\ns\n the opportunity to respond to this Inquiry. We are currently calling for the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation\n. We believe that this will help address\n the \nUK’s \norgan donor shortage\n and better reflect the public wishes. We\n know that \nnine\n out of \nten\n people support organ donation yet only \nthree\n out of \nten\n \ngo on to sign the Organ Donor Register (ODR)\n.\n \nChanging \nthe way we register conse\nnt can help close this gap and consequently\n make more organs available for transplantation. \nHowever\n this is not a magic bullet. The i\nntroduction of \na \nsoft opt-out \nsystem \nmust be accompanied by \nboth investment in infrastructure and resources and a public awareness campaign. \nAll three \nelements \nneed to be undertaken \ntogether \nto\n \nfirst; \nsecure more organs and \nsecond; \naccommodate additional organs and \na subsequent rise in transplant operations.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the\n strength of\n four ambitious targets set within the strategy, particularly the \ntarget of\n increasing familial consent rates\n from \n57 per cent\n to in excess of 80 per cent. \nWe\n are\n also pleased to see that the strategy \nstates that\n having the conversation with your loved \nones \nis\n vital to improving donor and consent rates. The BHF also \ncall\ns\n for more people to\n make their wishes known to their loved ones, as this will help make a difficult decision at a difficult time easier for families\n,\n regardless of whether an opt-in or soft opt-out system is in place. We welcome NHS Blood and Transplant\n’\ns (NHSBT) plans to run a\nn ambitious\n public awareness campaign\n focused on \nchanging the behaviour of the nation towards organ donation. \nBy encouraging \nthe \nconversation it’s hoped that the \nperceived \ntaboo around discussing organ donation will be broken down and that organ donation will become a normal part of life both inside and out of hospital. Again, we \nare\n pleased to see that the strategy \nalso acknowledges \nthat a review of the end of life pathway is needed \nto ensure that all opportunities to secure a donor are maximised in a sensitive and timely way. \n&#xa0;\nSimilarly, another strength is the focus on the differing cultural barriers to donation that arise within Black and Minority Ethnic communities (\nB\nME\n).\n \n \nBME communities make up 7.8\n per cent\n of the UK population\n but only make up 2\n per cent\n \nof the organ donor register.\n  W\ne know that those from Black and \nSouth Asian communities are three times more likely to need an organ transplant.\n Research shows that common barriers\n \nto donation \nwithin BME \ncommunities \ninclude\n; religious beliefs, anxieties, traditions, myths and lack of information.\n \nTherefore the strategy’s\n focus on tackling these barriers in a specialised way is much needed and to be welcomed. \n&#xa0;\nFinally, \nthe \nBHF also support\ns\n the review of the IT systems used across the donor network.  Anything that makes the process of donor and recipient matching faster and more effective is to be welcomed. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the one significant weakness of the strategy is that is does not include or \ndiscuss\n the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation. Instead the strategy is very\n cautious about discussing \nopt-out\n and instead notes that NHSBT will \nmaintain a watching brief on what happens with the introduction of legislation in Wales. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, we believe a system change is much needed. Under the current system \n466 people died last\n year because they did not receive\n an organ in time, \nwith \na further 766 removed from the list as their condition had deteriorated past the point of possible transplantation.\n T\nhe demand for heart transplants has risen \nby 89 per cent\n since 2004\n.\n \nInternational data shows that an opt-out system is associated with higher donation rates and several studies suggest that it would increase the numbers of organs available for transplantation by up to 30\n per cent\n \nin the UK.\n Expanding this model and projection to the UK would see a potential increase of between 25\n0\n and 31\n5\n donors in the UK as a whole.\n Taking into consideration that one donor can \ntransform up\n to nine \nlives\n,\n the potential \nnumber of \nlives saved\n or improved\n would be \nsignificant\n.\n Also\n,\n previous \ncost\n-\nbenefit\n \nanalys\ni\ns \nof the introduction of a soft \nopt-out system shows it to be a cost\n-\neffective treatment.\n This takes into account the reduction \nin \nmedical management of conditions for those waiting for organs \nand the significant psychological gains for patients that no longer have to receive on-going medical management and have \nof the chance of\n longer term survival.\n,\n&#xa0;\nThe change in system would also prompt a step change in the way that the public talk about organ donation. We have already highlighted how important it is that people have the conversation with their families and loved \nones to make their wishes known. H\nowever we hope that completely overhauling the \nsystem\n would prompt that conversation to take place on a wider scale. Publicity campaigns have run before across the UK, and yet we still do not have enough donors on the ODR. \nTherefore changing the way\n that we register consent should be a catalyst for this conversation.\n&#xa0;\nAs noted this change must be accompanied by investme\nnt in infras\ntructure, In \nthe \nBHF’s 2013 report \n‘Making opt-out a reality in Wales’\n we identified a number of areas for development that are key in maximising a soft opt-out system\n:\n staff training; increasing the numbers of transplant co-ordinators and specialist organ donation nurses; removing financial barriers to \nhospitals\n and effective management of donors through a national agency for \ntransplantation.\n \nThis would ensure that there is a system fit for practice to accommodate extra organs and transplant operations, as well as maximising the opportunity to  secure more donors in a timely and sensitive way. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition\n,\n it\n is \nvery welcome\n \nthat \nNHSBT\n will be engaging the public in future ideas\n.\n \nHowever,\n the BHF strongly \nopposes\n \nthe suggestion\n \nthat \nthose who are on the ODR \nwould \nget priority treatment if they need a transplant\n, as suggested in the strategy as a possible \noption\n. The BHF strongly believe\ns\n that donor organs should b\ne \ndistributed\n \non clinical need alone.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlthough we must always express caution when making direct comparisons between countries which have d\nifferent cultures and variables \nthere is a great deal of evidence from countries such as \nCroatia, \nNorway\n and Belgium \nthat show \nincreases in donation rates following \n a move to an opt-out \nsystem\n together with\n investment in infrastructure and raising public awareness\n of organ donation.\n \nFor example in Norway\n,\n \nwhere an\n opt-out system has operated since 1973\n,\n \nthere \nhas\n \nbeen\n significant investment in \nthe\n infrastructure – with Europe’s largest single transplant centre based in Oslo and five transplant co-ordinators to aid retrieval across the country. Norway’s rate of donation in 2011 was 24.5 \nper million population (\npmp\n)\n,\n which was well above the European average.\n \nIn Belgium the rate of organ donation increased from 19 to 41 \npmp\n three years after the introduction of opt-out legislation. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe Croatian model provides a clear example that a move to opt-out alone would not provide the much needed organ increase. \nIn 2000,\n \nCroatia\n \nhad one of the lowest donor rates \npmp\n in Europe at just 2.7 \npmp\n despite moving to an opt\n-\nout system 12 years previously. Yet after a period of significant \ninvestment\n by 2011 Croatia had one of the highest rates of donation in Europe of 33.6 \npmp\n.\n \n To achieve this, there was heavy investment in \ndeveloping\n an ‘in-house’ \ntransplant co-ordinator network in all hospitals which improved donor detection and management of potential donors. This approach also helped to reduce family refusal rate to \n20 per cent, which is less than half of the UK’s current refusal rate.\n A 24 hour helpline was set up at the Ministry of Health to support transplant co-ordinators \ndeliver\n \na speedy and efficient donor-transplant process. \nFurthermore there has \nbeen significant investment in public awareness campaigns organ\nised by the Ministry of Health \nand non-governmental organisations such as the Croatian Donor Network. There has also been continuous education and organ donor card promotion. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n NHS Blood and Transplant (2013) \n‘organ donation \ninfographics\n’ \nhttp://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/campaigns/campaign-materials.asp\n  \n NHS Blood and Transplant (2013)  \n‘Transplant Activity Report’\n http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/statistics/transplant_activity_report/current_activity_reports/ukt/activity_report_2012_13.pdf\n \n ACORN \nStatistics\n \nhttp://acorn.caci.co.uk/\n \n NHS Blood and Transplant (2013) \n‘organ donation \ninfographics\n’ \nhttp://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/campaigns/campaign-materials.asp\n \n \n \nNHS Blood and Transplant (2013) Campaign materials. \nhttp://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/campaigns/campaign-materials.asp\n \n \n Sims, J et al.
