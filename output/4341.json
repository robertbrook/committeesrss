"10\n&#xa0;\nJustice Committee\nOral evidence: \nPre-appointment scrutiny hearing: Chair of the Office for Legal Complaints, HC 916\nTuesday\n \n10 December\n 2013\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on 10 December 2013.\nWatch the meeting\n \nMembers present:\n Sir Alan Beith (Chair), Jeremy Corbyn, \nMr Elfyn Llwyd\n, \nAndy McDonald\n, \nJohn McDonnell\nQuestions \n1\n–\n28\n              \n \nWitness:\n \nStephen Green, \npreferred candida\nte for Chair of the Office for L\negal Complaints\n, gave evidence. \nQ1 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): Mr Green, welcome. You come to us as the preferred candidate for the chair of the Office for Legal Complaints and we are glad to have you with us this morning. It is the second time in our history that we have carried out interviews for this particular post. We did so for the previous post\n&#x2011;\nholder\n,\n who did two terms of office in that position. You have had a very interesting and varied career. What aspects of your previous career do you think are relevant to the role that you now propose to take up?\nStephen Green: I will pick out \nthree things, if I may, Chair\n. First, while chairing a board— \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair:  I am sorry, but I have been reminded that I have failed to do one thing. I should have asked members to declare any interests they might have. I apologise.\nStephen Green: Indeed.\nAndy McDonald: I should perhaps declare that I am a solicitor\n,\n and until November last year I was a partner with Thompsons.\nMr Llwyd: I was a solicitor for 16 years and I have been a member of the Bar for 16 years.\nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair: I have no such interests. \nJohn McDonnell: Thank God I was not a solicitor. \nMr Llwyd: \nYou just so\nlicit!\nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair: I \ndo \napologise. \nStephen Green: I am pleased to see there is a lay majority, Chair. That does feel healthy.\n&#xa0;\nQ2 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nYou were about to tell us what aspects of your previous career are relevant.\nStephen Green: Indeed. \nA\nt the heart of chairing any board is leadership. The first thing I would put forward is that most of my professional life has been as a leader of some sort or another. I started at the age of 19\n as a second lieutenant in the A\nrmy. When I became a police officer, I went on to the fast\n&#x2011;\ntrack scheme and progressed, ultimately, to become a chief constable. I believe that I have done leadership in all of its many forms and g\nuises\n,\n and I think nothing could faze\n me in this role. \nThat would be my first point. \nSecond\nly\n, in my senior police role I was involved in a range of national policy issues. Most notably in the roads policing area, I was involved in the creation, development and implementation of a number of significant initiatives\n. S\no I \nbelieve that I \nam very well acquainted with working at the national level and delivering something real and tangible that makes a difference to people’\ns lives. \nThe third thing is that when I retired from the police service I wanted to do some different things and\n,\n out of, I have to say, curiosity more than anything else\n,\n I applied to become a board member of the Legal Services Board and I have been drawn into it by inches. I have become fascinated at an intellectual level by the challenge of being an effective \nmember on\n that board, but I believe that the board has made a difference in the work \nthat \nit has done over the last five years. I am very proud of the things it has done\n,\n but certainly, in terms of this role, it has given me a \nreally \ngood understanding and insight into the legal services reform agenda of the last few years\n, what it is trying to achieve\n,\n and \nwhat has \nand perhaps \nhas not worked so well. \nSo I feel I would\n come into this role with a really good knowledge o\nf the environment in which the \nl\negal \no\nmbudsman operates. \nQ3 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nWhat is it that you are proud of that the board has done?\nStephen Green: There are\n a number of things. The first thing I would pick out is bringing into effect independent regulation by the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators. The old representative bodies wanted it to happen in practice but found it difficult to achieve on the ground. \nB\necause of the work the board has done\n,\n we now have lay majorities on all of the oversight boards of the regulators. We have regulation taking place independently of practice. We are policing that boundary as well. We conducted an investigation \nrecently \ninto one of the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators and their representative arm \naround our guidance rules. S\no I think we have rea\nlly brought independent regulation into effect. \nThe second thing that I would highlight is \nthat\n we have now created the regulatory structure for alternative business structures. They have perhaps not come into being as quickly as we would have liked, but we are now seeing innovative creative businesses establishing themselves\n,\n providing a service to people in different \nand \nhope\nfully \nmore affordable\n ways. \nThe third thing I would pick out would undoubtedly be linking to what we are talking about\n now—the establishment of the \nl\negal \no\nmbudsman. I believe I understand now that effective redress was at the heart of setting up the Legal Services Act\n.\n I think that the ombudsman, from a standing start of not existing at all to where it is now, has done a fantastic job and again is providing a real service to the public.\nQ4 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nBut are you sure this is a real job—the job that you have applied for and for which you are the preferred candidate? You are not the ombudsman.\nStephen Green: \nNo, but\n,\n equally\n,\n there is a need—and I think it does happen in practice—for a sort of filter through which the ombudsman’s wider policy issues need to pass. To me, the most imp\nortant feature of an ombudsman—\nparticularly in the legal world\n,\n where I think there were those \nwith\n \na\n perception that it was being regulated in the interests of the profession rather than in the publi\nc interest—\nis \nindependence\n, which \nis critical to their success and their commanding public confidence. \nI\nf you like, the role of t\nhe Office for Legal Complaints—\nin effect\n,\n th\ne board of the legal o\nmbudsman—\nis to defend that independence, to work in the wider policy environment in which it operates\n, and also to set a strategy\n, some sort of way forward, \nto say, “\nThis is the way in which the\n service has to develop from hereon in.” \nQ5 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nGood morning, Mr Green. Time was when regulation was undertaken by the Law Society\n and the Bar Council\n—\nfull stop. We now have the Law Society\n,\n the Bar Council, the Master of the Faculties, the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives, \nthe Council for Licensed Conveya\nncers, the Charte\nre\nd Institute of Patent Attorneys, the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys, the Association of Costs Lawyers, the Legal Services Board\n,\n the legal services ombudsman and your good self. What is your view of the overall system of services regulation established under the 2007 Act\n,\n and how could that be improved?\nStephen Green: \nWhere does one start? The regulatory maze that David Clementi spoke of when he wrote his report in the early noughties has not gone away. \nY\nour list—I am sure they were all there, but I did not check them off as you were saying them—demonstrates that. If you were to ask a member of the public if they understood any of that, I think they would be utterly baffled\n,\n and, to some degree, that has to be the test of whether where we are now is where we need to be. I hold to the view that\n,\n along the way\n,\n a single regulator doing all of the strands of the profession\n with the representative arms\n \ndelineating the different strands would probably be a better and more sensible structure than the one that we ha\nve now. W\nhen the Act was being passed\n,\n my eyes were on other things and I did\n not really witness the debate, but my understanding is that \nwhere we have \nreached\n now shows the necessary compromises that had to be made at the time the Act was passed to get us to this stage. I personally do not see it as the final destination. I would be amazed if it does not develop from there.\nQ6 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nTw\no points arise, \nI think. First—and I was reminded of this by the Chair in a private conversation a few minutes ago—solicitors who undertake financial services\n,\n and chartered accountants who undertake financial services\n,\n are regulated by different boards, so we have not quite finished fragmenting yet, it seems to me, but is not part of your function trying to simplify all this and makin\ng it accessible to the public? \nGiven this information, I think most members of the public would say, “\nHang it, I’\nm not getting involved in this.\n \nThere are so many different avenues.\n”\n I am not saying that the average member of\n the public is not intelligent—\nclearly\n, they are—\nbut\n,\n with all these bodies ranged across the spectrum\n,\n it is extremely complicated and confusing, is it not?\nStephen Green: \nIt is incredibly complicated and I have to say, until I start\ned\n doing \nmy \nresearch to apply for this job, I had no idea of the vast maze of ombudsman sche\nmes that exist in this country—\nschemes that exist under different statu\ntory bases\n, where \nsome people are public sector \nand \nothers are private sector. \nI have no idea h\now on earth the public navigate their way through it. I do not think that any single ombudsman, board or scheme could in some way, shape or form take sole responsibility for rationalising it. That is just not going to happen. Equally—and in fact there is a load of them \nsat \nnext door because I have just seen them go in—if you sit all the ombudsmen in the country together and say, “\nLet’\ns \nall \narrive at a consensus about how to go forward,” they are never going to do it. To me, ultimately, rationalising the landscape is a central Government policy challenge rather than an individual ombudsman scheme challenge. I believe, however, that the Office for Legal Complaints and the legal ombudsman can and should at least describe \nclearly what it is that they do and\n where th\nose overlaps and confusions are\n so that they can help to spell out the nature of the challenge. But I \ncannot\n sit here and say to you, “I am going to go to this job and make sense of all that\n,\n and\n I am going to make it rational.\n” I cannot do that. No one can do that sitting in one ombudsman scheme. \nQ7 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: It is not inconceivable that\n there is a rationale behind all of it, but do you see part of your function as educating, in the proper sense, the public about the kind of territory we are in?\nStephen Green: \nYes. If I am stepping out of where you want \nto be\n please stop me, but I think this is relevant. \nL\nook\ning\n at the complaints landscape of legal services at the moment\n,\n I have real concerns \nabout the number of people who—as best we know \nfrom \nthe figures—\nhaving been dissatisfied by a legal service\n,\n do not complain at all\n,\n and \nalso about the number\n of people who do complain formally and get some kind of resolution\n but are not happy with it and who\n then go to the legal ombudsman. \nW\ne have a firm, clear duty to address those numbers and \nto \nstart saying, “What can we do to make sure that\n,\n if people are unhappy with a legal service\n,\n they do something about it first with the firm \nfrom \nwho\nm\n they have had the service\n,\n and\n,\n if they are not happy with that resolution\n,\n \nthey \nthen \ncome to the legal ombudsman?” \nT\nhat is clearly our function. Where those overlaps are concerned, there \nare\n a number of things we can do. In the short term—and I know that the legal ombudsman does this already—where people come to the legal ombudsman but \nit is found that \nwhat they are complaining about would better be dealt with by a different ombudsman, \nthey\n are\n sign\npost\ned\n to where they should go\n.\n \nT\nhey are not just told, “\nNo, it is not us. Go away.\n” \nT\nhey are given a direction in which to travel to get their problem resolved. \nAgain, I hear talk of creating a common ombudsman portal on the internet, but I also hear that people have been discussing that for 10 years and it has not happened yet. What is \ndesperately required—\nand hopefully, perhaps, through the alternative dispute resolution requirement from the European Union it might\n happen—is some clear central G\novernment guidance about how this landscape might be rationalised.\nMr Llwyd: \nThank you.\nQ8 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: \nGood morning, Mr Green. Your CV says that you have been the lead member of the Legal Services Board with responsibility for monitoring the performance of the OLC.\nStephen Green: \nIndeed.\nQ9 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: \nThe OLC chair’s job description includes setting performance standards. Can I ask you a question in two parts?\nStephen Green: \nYes.\nQ10 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: \nWhat do you think have been the main areas of strength and weakness in the handling of complaints by the legal ombudsman? Second\nly\n, what proposals have you for improving the operational performance of the ombudsman?\nStephen Green: \nLet us start with the strength and then talk about the weakness. The strength undoubtedly, it seems to me, \nis this. I\nf you set up a new service for the public and you open the phone lines and say\n,\n “Ring us up,” that is an incredibly risky thing to do because you have no idea how many people are going to ring and what problems they are going to \nbring. The fact, as the Chair\n said, \nthat \nthe last time you saw anyone from the OLC was when you d\nid this for the current chair\n is a testament to the fact that they have handled that set\n&#x2011;\nup and launch and got the service running to a very good standard without any of the kinds of problems that other services of that nature perhaps have had in th\ne past. So their responsiveness and\n their ability to dea\nl with cases in a timely manner\n is impressive and improving\n,\n and certainly it has been an area that I have taken great pleasure from\n in\n see\ning\n how well they have done it. \nT\nheir weakness has been that they worked from the outset—forgive me for going round the houses\n,\n but it is important to set this background—with the sort of budgetary envelope tha\nt was assumed for them by the MO\nJ planners. \nIf you look at the figures, a\nlthough they have consistently reduced their costs year on year and are still reducing them, our view—I am talking \nabout \nmy view as an LSB board member now, not as the potential chair of the OLC—is that their cost per case is still too expensive. \nWhat we would like to see—\nand what I would like\n to do if I were made chairman—\nfirst \nwould be\n \nto capitalise\n on their strength of dealing with cases promptly and moving them through the system quickly\n,\n because \nI think \nthey can get even better at that. Second\nly, it\n would be looking at ways in which the cost per case of the system can come down. At the moment their cost per case is in the region of £1\n,9\n00 per case. If you were to look at\n the Financial Ombudsman Service, \nwhich \nwe did through our consumer panel \nin \na recent benchmarking survey—and I realise they\n have much greater volumes—\nit h\nas \na cost of \nsomewhere in the reg\nion of £700 per case. \nAs to t\nhe O\nmbudsman\n S\nervices, a private company doing lots of utility\n&#x2011;\ntype services, their cost per case is somewhere in the region of £400 per case. \nW\nhile I am not saying that there is an absolute definite benchmark to work to, \nit\n indicates that \nthe \ncost per case has to come down. \nHow \nthat \nmight \nhappen\n would be\n the next question to answer. \nFirst, you have to look carefully at, in effect, the ombudsman system as a conveyor belt: things start at one end, travel along it and, hopefully, there is an outcome at the end. Are there ways in which that conveyor belt can be made more efficient? Are there processes in there that have been duplicated and things that could happen more quickly than they are doing now\n? I\nf you can take time ou\nt\n,\n you can take cost out as well. \nSecond\nly\n, I believe that there are better uses that could be made of technology. The predominant way of interfacing with the legal ombudsman service is by telephone and then somehow you have to get any documentation through the post or whatever. In these modern days\n,\n it must be possible to have more web\n&#x2011;\nbased transactions so that people can interface with the legal ombudsman, on the internet if they prefer it that way\n,\n and us\ne that to move documents around\n or whatever. \nT\nhere are significant opportunities to be able to improve their efficiency by using IT in a smarter way that reflects modern consumer life. Would you like more or has that answered your question?\nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nI think we will probably cover some more of the ground as we go through \nthe\n questions.\nQ11 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: \nYou have \nplaced \nstress\n on the benchmarking and the processing\n,\n but I do not know whether you have addressed the improving of the overall operational performance issues. \nWould y\nou like to \ntell us more about that?\nStephen Green: \nIn reality, what is ov\nerall operational performance? \nI think it is\n,\n “Does it happen fast enough?” \nB\ny the time they get to the ombudsman\n,\n \nconsumers \nhave already been through the complaints system of the law firm and they want things t\no happen. \nT\nhe first thing is\n,\n “Does it happen fast enough?” The second thing \nis,\n “Is the qua\nlity of what is done acceptable?\n \nD\noes it meet the expectations of the member of the public \nwho\n complains?” Third\nly\n, “Is the overall cost of it reasonable\n,\n bearing in mind that whatever it is that the legal ombudsman costs is a cost to your profession?” If we are working to the regulatory objectives, we would have a duty to keep that cost down as low as possible. \nI believe that\n,\n by making the overall system more efficient\n,\n you will make it faster, \nimprove the quality and \nmake it cheaper. \nC\nertainly\n,\n one of the things that I would want to do as the chair of the OLC board is \nlose\n \nthe narrative that has been pursued by the legal ombudsman so far\n, which\n has been, “We are better and cheaper than what went before.” \nM\nemories of what went before are increasingly fading\n,\n and certainly the lead I would want to give would be to say—this is why the benchmarking is important—we now need to be seen as best in class\n,\n we need to understand what that means and chart a course towards achieving that\n,\n so that when this rationalisation take\ns\n place, as one would hope it would, people say, “Whatever we do, we need to keep the legal ombudsman because they are the best.” \nQ12 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nI am interested in your analysis about the way forward in terms of improvement\n,\n but to start the improvement process we need to be clear about what our assessment of trends is at the moment. What is your assessment of the trends with regard to the numbers and types of cases? In the reports we have received there have been predictions about quite an increase in cases\n,\n but there has \nactually \nbeen a decline recently.\nStephen Green: \nI could not go to the level of detail of trends in types of complaints\n,\n but certainly the trend in overall complaints is pretty flat. That has been something of a mystery to the OLC board and the legal ombudsman. This time last year they were just approving a change in their scheme rules that they believed would let more complaints in. It did not seem to have any massive\n,\n huge impact on the numbers. \nIn my current role\n I have challenged about that on a number of occasions and not received a satisfactory answer. Ultimately, if I could not get a satisfactory answer, then some research \nwould need\n to be done to understand that better. It has not been done yet. \nW\nhen you look at the numbers around the lack of willingness of people out there to complain and look at the fact that the complaints levels are flat, it does leave you wonder\ning\n what is happening out there. One of the things that the OLC board can take on is to say, “\nLet’\ns see what influence we can bring to bear on people’s willingness to complain in the first place,” and I think there are a number of things they can or could do to be able to improve that.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nThe legal ombudsman has undertaken some thematic reports.\nStephen Green: \nYes.\nQ14 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nDo you think the legal ombudsman can be more proactive and work in that sort of way, developing more thematic reports\n,\n and in what sort of area? \nStephen Green: \nYes. Again, I would not like to try and fire from the hip and specify an area\n,\n but my view is this. They have put three of those reports out\n and t\nhey have been of good quality, founded on the evidence of their experience as an ombudsman at this stage. \nIt\n is a feature of their service that they should do as much as possible of \nthat, and try \nto\n make it programmed and\n \nsystematic, so that people know what areas are being looked at in the course of a year and \npublished\n reports are coming out. \nI\nn addition to that\n,\n I wonder if, once they are doing that, they can capitalise on two things. One is that the Act allows the Legal Services Board to make requirements on the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators about the arrangements they make for the handling of co\nmplaints by the legal entities—\nthe regulated entities. Are there synergies that can be achieved\n,\n where we can bring together the knowledge of the legal ombudsman and the Office for Legal Complaints with the powers that the LSB have to try and make some of the use of that power more focused than it currently is?\nJohn McDonnell: \nAt the front end.\nStephen Green: \nIn addition to that, again—and I know that the OLC do work with the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators—are there ways that the information that the legal ombudsman produces can be shared more proactively with the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators and used so that they can fulfil their duties to oversee \nthe effectiveness of first\n&#x2011;\ntier \ncompla\nints handling in a more \nrisk\n and problem-focused \nway than they have hitherto \nbeen \nable to do?\nQ15 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nWhat is your assessment of the desirability of extending the remit of the legal ombudsman in a voluntary sche\nme to cover alternative dispute \nresolution providers, as proposed by the OLC report?\nStephen Green: \nIf you start from the premise that the point of the legal ombudsman service is to make the market work better for legal services consumers, the fact that there is a proportion of those consumers who are receiving legal services from non\n&#x2011;\nregulated providers and are unable to get redress from the legal ombudsman cannot be right. \nI\nn terms of a policy direction, it clearly has to be a desirable thing to do. It can never be—and I want to make this clear—seen as a means of addressing the cost issue that we talked about before. We have to deal with cost independently of that, although undoubtedly it would dilute some of the overheads and things like that. \nT\nhe OLC and LeO need to develop a proposition that they can put to the unregulated legal services to demonstrate the economic and business benefits of having access to redress\n,\n the legal ombudsman scheme\n,\n and then test that to destruction. If it is a voluntary s\ncheme, people have to volunteer. C\nertainly\n,\n if you look at the work that has been done in will writing\n,\n there is ample evidence of consumer detriment \nthere\n. There must be an argument that says the world would be a better place if that could be achieved. \nAnother area that interests me—and perhaps it is a \nnod back\n to my former life—is a whole tranche of \npeople who are not lawyers \nbut immigration advisers who are regulated by the Home Office\n,\n but there is no right of redress into the legal ombudsman. Again, \ntheir clients are\n probably among some of the most vulnerable consumers that are dealt with in legal services. Finding a way of bringing those people into a voluntary scheme would be a good thing in the interests of society.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nWould you apply the same logic to claims management companies and say that they should be brought within the same framework then? Technically, they are—  \nStephen Green: \nYes, Chair. This might be naive optimism on my part—and I \ngrovellingly apologise\n if it is—but it is my understanding that the legislative mechanism to overcome the difficulties in bringing in claims management companies was being overcome last week. I was certainly hearing optimistic messages in the other place. If that happens, I am hoping—and I have to say it was kind of an assumption of what I was saying earlier—that what we are then left with is an implementation project rather than a design\n of\n “How do we make this happen?”\n \nproject. I think it is desirable that it should happen. There is clearly some turbulence in that market now caused by the referral fees ban\n,\n and how big it will be in a couple of years’ time remains to be seen. But for the time being it seems to me that, first, given what LeO have done so far, I would feel confident about their capability to set this thing up and make it work in a relatively short time. Hopefully, touch wood, the legislative mechanisms are now in place \nto enable\n that \nto\n happen\n,\n and certainly I would hope that\n,\n were you happy with what I had to say today, by the time I arrive there, things would be starting to happen to bring that into being.\nQ17 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nYou are a “glass half full”\n man, Mr Green, \nare you not?\nStephen Green: It is the only way to live, \nsir.\nQ18 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nFollowing on the last point from the Chair, do you have a view on the growth of what can only be called professional McKenzie friends who appear in family cases and \nseem\n to be making a living with no regulation whatsoever? \nStephen Green: \nIt is not an area in which I have had any experience or study whatsoever and I am reluctant to just fire a view from the hip.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nI was not trying to trip you up. I would just like to flag it up.\nStephen Green: \nI have to say it is not an area that I am aware has raised any cases with the legal ombudsman, but it is certainly a question that, now you have asked me, I will \ngo and ask \nabout \nit \nbecause I am interested\n in it\n.\nQ20 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nThat is exactly what I was hoping you would say. In a response to Mr McDonnell earlier you said, basically, \nthat \nthere is a flatlining in numb\ners of complaints. Could it be—God forbid—\nthat legal services are improving in terms of quality?\nStephen Green: \nAbsolutely.\nQ21 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nOver the last five to 10 years there has been far more concentration on client care and quality of service\n,\n with checks on firms regularly. \nStephen Green: Yes. \nMr Llwyd: C\nould that be part of the answer?\nStephen Green: \nI think it absolutely could\n,\n and certainly I am aware\n,\n through my Legal Services Board work\n,\n that there is some evidence—\nI think it is out \nwith the SRA—of falls in the numbers of complaints that have been recorded in law firms. I think it is still quite fragile evidence, but there is some indication. I wonder, quite honestly, if one of the most significant things in the chan\nges in arrangements made by the OLC last year wa\ns the more proactive imposition of a case fee\n.\n There has been a change in the way that funding works so that in certain circumstances the law firm concerned is charged a case fee. I know \nthis \ncertainly because\n—\neven though up until this I have had no direct involvement in the \nrunning of the legal ombudsman—\nlawyers \nwho\n know me from my former life have bent my ear considerably about the likelihood of getting a case fee. I think that that has hopefully, in \na\n right and ethical way, incentivised people as well to resolve their cases at first instance. \nT\nhat can only be a good thing. \nT\nhat tells me the extent to which\n,\n by taking measures from the legal ombudsman\n,\n you can change the way the world works down at the coal face, as it were, where the client and the lawyer actually meet.\nQ22 &#xa0; \nMr Llwyd: \nWhat would be your priorities for the Office for Legal Complaints in the next few years? \nStephen Green: \nI have touched on them to some degree, but let me go through them one by one. \nNo. 1\n \nwould be\n to say \nw\nhat more can be done to influence the wider complaints system in general? We have just touched upon one thing, but if you look, as I say, at the unwillingness of people \neither \nto complain in the first place or pursue their complaint right the way to the legal ombudsman, there must be steps that can be taken to try and improve that. I will enlarge on that in a second if you want, but I will \njust\n go \no\nn to the other two, if I may. \nThe second would be to cover the areas that we talked about before about \nw\nhat \nwe \ncan do to make the existi\nng system work more efficiently.\n \nI\nmproving the e\nfficiency of the conveyor belt—by \nlooking at the things that fall off \nit in the course of its journey and\n looking at ways of making it travel thro\nugh faster, cheaper and quicker—is\n, again,\n an important priority. \nThe third \npriority\n would be to touch \nagain \nupon what we have discussed already\n,\n \nwhich is \ntryin\ng to chart a course through the\n wider environment of how people who cannot get \nredress\n because they get their legal service\ns from a non\n&#x2011;\nregulated provider\n \nbe served. T\nhat is all about voluntary schemes. How can people who get bundled services\n get redress? T\nhe famous example that is always quoted by the Legal Services Consumer Panel is a house purchase \nand \nth\ne people you have to deal with because \nyou go through the jurisdiction of several different ombudsmen \non\n that journey. How\n do you know which one\n to deal with\n? H\now can we make sure that people with bundled services get some kind of joined\n&#x2011;\nup redress? Then\n,\n also in that environment, as I said, the Government have to respond to the EU directive on\n alternative dispute resolution.\n \nW\ne need to understand how that is moving ahead. \nI think that, in reality, along\n the way\n,\n the ombudsman service and \no\nmbudsmen in general \nwill change over the coming years. I cannot paint you a vision\n.\n \nI think\n it would be foolish to say, “It needs to look like this,” but I certainly would see \nit \nas a priority making sure that I am in a position to lead the board to face those challenges and provide the most appropriate response from the Office for Legal Complaints.\nQ23 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nThere have been quite a few issues between the Legal Services Board and some of the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators. Do you think the front\n&#x2011;\nline regulators might see you as the LSB’s man?\nStephen Green: \nI would be foolish not to think it is a risk. All I would say, Chair, is this. Anybody who thinks that I will not be independent in my role is sadly mistaken. If you look\n at my professional background, \nmy culture\n and the way I have been brought up is to act independently—\nand I find that very easy to do. For me, while I think I offer great benefits because I under\nstand the Legal Services Board, \nI understand how they tick, I know what buttons to push and levers \nto pull—\nso I think that helps—\nI would have no difficulty in acting independently and establishing my independence as soon as I took this role on. \nH\nopefully\n,\n you can tell that this was not a question that was unexpected to me\n, but I understand \nthe importance, if I were to take up this role, of establishing the fact that I am independent and working accordingly.\n&#xa0;\nQ24 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nThere are two other roles we see in the job description, one of which is acting as ambassador for the OLC and the ombudsman\n,\n and the other \nis \nin regard to dealing with the media. On the ambassadorial role\n,\n will you do anything differently from Elizabeth France? On the media role, what experience do you have of that and will you do that somewhat differ\nently in this role? The Chair\n is concerned that we have a Paxman\n&#x2011;\nproof person appointed \nin this role or it will go pear-\nshaped.\nStephen Green: \nCan I \ntake that\n one first?\nJohn McDonnell: \nYes, you better had.\nStephen Green: \nI am pleased you have asked me that question because it probably shows that\n you have never g\noogled me. Because I was a chief constable, I l\nived my life in the media and \nI am very well acquai\nnted with dealing with them.\n I have played the part of hero and I have played the part of villain. I feel very comfortable in dealing with the media. I understand that you never control them. Every now and again you have an unholy alliance to achieve a particular end\n,\n but they are there to do a service; they are not there to be our bosom buddies and I am well used to that.\nQ25 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nYou had a relationship with motorway demonstrations and other things.\nStephen Green: \nYes, I did.\nQ26 &#xa0; \nJohn McDonnell: \nHow was that?\nStephen Green: \nIt was very interesting. My determination at that time was to do things differently. I was concerned when I looked at what had happened in the past that the tactics of the demonstrators were causing huge danger to themselves and those who were there to rescue them\n,\n because\n,\n in effect\n,\n they were digging holes in the ground, concreting themselves in and defying the world to get them out. I thought that that was madness\n,\n and so I worked very closely with Ministers and the Highways Agency to create a means of foreshortening \nit \nall. \nI\nn reality, other than one set-\npiece eviction, we turned what had been hitherto seen as the way that environmental protests then happened completely on its head and we tried to allow lawful, peaceful protest\n;\n but\n,\n where people wanted to dig dangerous\n tunnels and lay their concrete and so on\n, we put a stop to it quickly. I felt at that time that I had no difficulty standing up in the press and making the moral, legal\n and\n professional case for doing what I was doing. While it did not make the protestors happy, the people of the west Midlands, who were paying for all of this, were very happy with what I did and we got a lot of positive feedback.\nQ27 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nWhat about the ambassadorial role?\nStephen Green: \nAs to the ambassadorial role, I h\nave known Elizabeth a long time—\nshe is \nsitting\n behind me now so I will make sure I say nice things abo\nut her—and\n I think she does that well\n,\n \nbut\n I firmly believe that it is not the job of the chair of the OLC in any way, shape or form \nto \neclipse the legal ombudsman. The legal ombudsman is the person who is there to be at the front end of commanding public confidence and demonstrating independence. I would do anything required to be an ambassador\n,\n but I would do it on the principle that\n,\n if the legal ombudsman looks good, then I look good. But it does not work vice versa\n,\n and certainly I would want to ensure that the legal ombudsman is seen in the best possible public light.\nQ28 &#xa0; \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nHave you anything else that you think ought to be drawn to our attention that is relevant to this appointment?\nStephen Green: \nI do not think so, Chair\n. \nY\nou have drawn out of me everything that I came to say\n, though\n I am sure when I walk out of this room I will think of a thousand things\n that I would like to have said.\n I am grateful for the way that you have heard me and drawn these things out of me\n,\n and \nI \nam very happy with what has taken place. \nRt Hon Sir Alan Beith (Chair): \nThank you very much. We will very quickly reach conclusions and communicate them to the Minister, so we hope it will not be very long before you know whether you really are in this job or not.\n Thank you very much.\nStephen Green: \nThank you.\nOral evidence: Pre-appointment scrutiny hearing: \nChair of the Office for Legal Complaints, HC 916\n"
