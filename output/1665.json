"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by BDR Termea (HOT44)\nExecutive SummaryBDR Thermea Group was \ndelighted to\n see publication of the Heat Strategy by DECC which sets out how heating in the UK could be decarbonised by 2050. We believe that the potential benefits to the low carbon economy and UK economic competitiveness from successful implementation are significan\nt.\nThrough our well-known brands such as Baxi, Potterton and Heatrae, BDR Thermea empl\noy over 1,500 people in the UK.\nBDR Thermea\n support\ns\n the decarbonisation of UK heating. However the way in which it is achieved must recognise and address the unique feat\nures of the UK market. A bespoke approach that plays to consumer preferences, our national infrastructure assets and the strengths of the existing heating sector is required. \nWe are investing in the technologies that could enable such a transformation incl\nuding, Heat Recovery, Micro-Combined Heat and Power, Gas Heat Pumps, Solar Heating and Electric Heat Pumps.\nIt is vital to ensure implementation of the Heat Strategy supports the\n manufacturing \nsector and drives innovation an\nd employment growth in the UK al\nongside decarbonisation and bill reductions.\nGHPs are an established technology in Europe but RHI \nsupport\n on par with other renewable heating \ntechnologies\n is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK. \nRHI support would allow G\nHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy and enable prompt decarbonisation and renewable gai\nns even i\nf\n gas utilisation persists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nMost “hard to treat homes” will not meet the energy efficiency criteria to qualify for the \nRHI \nscheme and \nBuilding regulations \nonly capture those properties undergoing renovation. An additional barrier is that consumers are reluctant to pay for advice such\n as \nGreen Deal assessments as energy efficiency is pe\nrceived as allow priority expenditure.\n \nMost owners do not qualify for assistance under \nECO\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMicro combined heat and power (mCHP) units \npr\noduce both h\neat and electricity.\n \nThe electricity is generated\n in the home \nthus avoiding the transmission losses that resul\nt from centralised generation. \nSee paragraph 10 f\no\nr further \ninformation\n.\nHybrids present are a suitable retrofit for a large number of homes\n – see paragraph 11.\n  \nGas heat pumps (GHP) \ncan readily address the needs of the retrofit environment and achieve rapid efficiency and decarbonisation gains without infrastructure changes or loss \nof comfort\n see paragraph 12 and 13 for more information\n. \nGHPs are a heating technology that can readily contribute to the attainment of binding renewable targets\n but\n RHI support on par with other renewable heating technologies, is essential to provide the \nnecessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK. RHI support would allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy and enable prompt decarbonisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisati\non persists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nASHP\n1.29 tCo2/annum\nGSHP\n1.52 tCo2/annum\nBiomass\n3.52 tCo2/annum\nSolar thermal\n0.28 tCo2/annum\nmCHP (1kWe)\n0.96 tCo2/annum (savings result from avoided electricity import and may be higher because the technology typically generates during \npeak demand and therefore displaces marginal capacity)\n \nHeating and hot water requirements 13,700kWh for a median 3 bed semi-detached house (Source: National Energy Efficiency Data 2012). Except solar thermal which uses\n a\n 1,200kWh typical annual yield.\n&#xa0;No comment\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGHPs are the only key renewable heating solution currently not supported under the RHI.  The European Commission decision on establishing guidelines on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps confirms that GHPs \nare a renewable solution, on par with electricity driven heat pumps. Support is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK and address existing market distortion in the heat pump sector. RHI suppo\nrt would also allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy - one of the two scenarios of DECC’s Heat Strategy foresees that GHPs will be the dominant heating solution in the UK from 2025 onwards - and enable prompt decarbo\nnisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisation persists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n See biomass industry charter: \nhttp://www.installeronline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BiomassCharterFinal2013.pdf\n"
