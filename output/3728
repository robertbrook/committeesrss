[normal]Written submission from[bold] [bold]Mr [bold]Stephen Evans[bold] [bold]MIET[bold]DCLG Electrical Competent Person Scheme[bold]I have watched the video from the HOC Communities and Local Government Committee meeting held on the 2
[normal]nd
[normal] September 2013 and 
[normal]subsequently 
[normal]submit my response to 
[normal]this below.
[normal]1. As I am broadly in agreement with what other contributors have so far submitted, I will refrain from repeating many of the points already raised. However, I would like to provide my views on the standards of training 
[normal]and changes to the
[normal] regis
[normal]tration system.
[normal]2. 
[normal]To briefly outline my knowledge of the industry, I am a
[normal]n
[normal] electrician
[normal] with 40
[normal] years of experience and have worked
[normal] in both commercial and domestic environments
[normal] and
[normal] was
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]Part P accredited
[normal] contractor
[normal] when it was first introduced.
[normal] I am a ful
[normal]l member of the IET (institution of Engineering and Technology) and a registered electrician at technician grade with the JIB.
[normal]3. 
[normal]During the last 7 years I have mainly
[normal] worked
[normal] as a freelance trainer for both private training providers and FE Colleges. This work has involved delivery of courses for industry recognised qualifications relating to the IET wiring regulations
[normal] (BS7671)
[normal] and Inspection and Testing. In addition, I am a q
[normal]ualified NVQ assessor and verifier and have 
[normal]helped
[normal] many apprentices
[normal] achieve the Level 3 NVQ that is recognised within the industry as the minimum 
[normal]standard of competency.
[normal]4. 
[normal]As has been pointed-out by other contributors, one of the negative 
[normal]aspects
[normal] of Part 
[normal]P
[normal], which was initially welcomed by the trade as a way to improve standards,
[normal] has been the
[normal] way it’s
[normal] been hijacked by
[normal] private training providers offering very short courses 
[normal](at very high prices
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]anyone
[normal] to become 
[normal]a domestic electrician
[normal].  And whilst domesti
[normal]c electrical systems are the least technically challenging,
[normal] they still require a high level of compe
[normal]tency to be installed correctly and these
[normal] skills certainly can’t be learnt in just a few weeks
[normal]. Moreover, 
[normal]to make matters worse, 
[normal]these short courses have be
[normal]en encouraged by the various Part P scheme operators because they provide a 
[normal]good 
[normal]source for new members and 
[normal]an easy way to boost
[normal] revenue
[normal]s. 
[normal]5. 
[normal]Unfortunately, this is a classic case of a
[normal] good idea having unintended consequences and t
[normal]he sad fact is that
[normal] over
[normal]all
[normal] 
[normal]standards of domestic electrical installation work have
[normal] 
[normal]not improved at all and in 
[normal]many
[normal] 
[normal]instances
[normal] are actually worse
[normal].  As mentioned above, I 
[normal]have worked
[normal] for a private training company who provided these courses
[normal] and
[normal] witnessed first-hand the 
[normal]folly
[normal] of this policy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]In my opinion, and contrary to the wishes of the 
[normal]current 
[normal]accreditation bodies
[normal], the
[normal] way forward is 
[normal]to 
[normal]move away from 
[normal]the 
[normal]profit based registration schemes and 
[normal]adopt a single 
[normal]system of accreditation
[normal] - which
[normal] the public can easily unders
[normal]tand
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]similar to
[normal] the 
[normal]gas industry 
[normal]model
[normal] (Gas Safe)
[normal] -
[normal] whereby 
[normal]ANY 
[normal]individual working in the electrical industry must be suitably competent
[normal] and assessed on a regular basis
[normal]. 
[normal] It should also 
[normal]require all electricians to be 
[normal]suitably qualified to 
[normal]the 
[normal]standards
[normal] recognised by the JIB
[normal] ECS scheme,
[normal] wh
[normal]ich
[normal], in addition to 
[normal]requiring the relevant 
[normal]technical 
[normal]certificates
[normal], require
[normal]s
[normal] proof of
[normal] suitable
[normal] experience
[normal].
[normal]7. 
[normal]I greatly welcome the DCLG 
[normal]committee’s 
[normal]investigation into this matter
[normal] and strongly hope your conclusions are t
[normal]o recommend 
[normal]a root-and-branch overhaul 
[normal]of the current accreditation system 
[normal]as
[normal] currently
[normal] it 
[normal]benefits nobody except the scheme operators themselves.
[normal] However, if this is not possible then
[normal] at the very least
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for the sake of clarity, 
[normal]a single register
[normal] of
[normal] all 
[normal]certified 
[normal]installers should be adopted
[normal] (or enforced by government) similar to that
[normal] proposed by NAPIT
[normal].
[normal]8. Finally, I was slightly dismayed that the committee did not challenge Emma Clancy’s claim that her organisation represents eighty percent of contractor
[normal]s who carry-out ninety percent of all electrical work. This may be true for the electrical contracting industry
[normal] as a whole
[normal] but 
[normal]the 
[normal]DCLG committee 
[normal]is only considering the domestic market and I would be surprised if this percentage claim was so high in this 
[normal]segment of the industry?
[normal]I trust you will find my above contribution of interest and if you think I can be of further assistance please don’t hesitate to contact me.
