defaultWritten submission fromdefault defaultMr defaultStephen Evansdefault defaultMIETdefaultDCLG Electrical Competent Person SchemedefaultI have watched the video from the HOC Communities and Local Government Committee meeting held on the 2
defaultnd
default September 2013 and 
defaultsubsequently 
defaultsubmit my response to 
defaultthis below.
default1. As I am broadly in agreement with what other contributors have so far submitted, I will refrain from repeating many of the points already raised. However, I would like to provide my views on the standards of training 
defaultand changes to the
default regis
defaulttration system.
default2. 
defaultTo briefly outline my knowledge of the industry, I am a
defaultn
default electrician
default with 40
default years of experience and have worked
default in both commercial and domestic environments
default and
default was
default 
defaulta 
defaultPart P accredited
default contractor
default when it was first introduced.
default I am a ful
defaultl member of the IET (institution of Engineering and Technology) and a registered electrician at technician grade with the JIB.
default3. 
defaultDuring the last 7 years I have mainly
default worked
default as a freelance trainer for both private training providers and FE Colleges. This work has involved delivery of courses for industry recognised qualifications relating to the IET wiring regulations
default (BS7671)
default and Inspection and Testing. In addition, I am a q
defaultualified NVQ assessor and verifier and have 
defaulthelped
default many apprentices
default achieve the Level 3 NVQ that is recognised within the industry as the minimum 
defaultstandard of competency.
default4. 
defaultAs has been pointed-out by other contributors, one of the negative 
defaultaspects
default of Part 
defaultP
default, which was initially welcomed by the trade as a way to improve standards,
default has been the
default way it’s
default been hijacked by
default private training providers offering very short courses 
default(at very high prices
default)
default 
defaultfor 
defaultanyone
default to become 
defaulta domestic electrician
default.  And whilst domesti
defaultc electrical systems are the least technically challenging,
default they still require a high level of compe
defaulttency to be installed correctly and these
default skills certainly can’t be learnt in just a few weeks
default. Moreover, 
defaultto make matters worse, 
defaultthese short courses have be
defaulten encouraged by the various Part P scheme operators because they provide a 
defaultgood 
defaultsource for new members and 
defaultan easy way to boost
default revenue
defaults. 
default5. 
defaultUnfortunately, this is a classic case of a
default good idea having unintended consequences and t
defaulthe sad fact is that
default over
defaultall
default 
defaultstandards of domestic electrical installation work have
default 
defaultnot improved at all and in 
defaultmany
default 
defaultinstances
default are actually worse
default.  As mentioned above, I 
defaulthave worked
default for a private training company who provided these courses
default and
default witnessed first-hand the 
defaultfolly
default of this policy.  
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultIn my opinion, and contrary to the wishes of the 
defaultcurrent 
defaultaccreditation bodies
default, the
default way forward is 
defaultto 
defaultmove away from 
defaultthe 
defaultprofit based registration schemes and 
defaultadopt a single 
defaultsystem of accreditation
default - which
default the public can easily unders
defaulttand
default 
defaultand
default 
defaultsimilar to
default the 
defaultgas industry 
defaultmodel
default (Gas Safe)
default -
default whereby 
defaultANY 
defaultindividual working in the electrical industry must be suitably competent
default and assessed on a regular basis
default. 
default It should also 
defaultrequire all electricians to be 
defaultsuitably qualified to 
defaultthe 
defaultstandards
default recognised by the JIB
default ECS scheme,
default wh
defaultich
default, in addition to 
defaultrequiring the relevant 
defaulttechnical 
defaultcertificates
default, require
defaults
default proof of
default suitable
default experience
default.
default7. 
defaultI greatly welcome the DCLG 
defaultcommittee’s 
defaultinvestigation into this matter
default and strongly hope your conclusions are t
defaulto recommend 
defaulta root-and-branch overhaul 
defaultof the current accreditation system 
defaultas
default currently
default it 
defaultbenefits nobody except the scheme operators themselves.
default However, if this is not possible then
default at the very least
default,
default 
defaultfor the sake of clarity, 
defaulta single register
default of
default all 
defaultcertified 
defaultinstallers should be adopted
default (or enforced by government) similar to that
default proposed by NAPIT
default.
default8. Finally, I was slightly dismayed that the committee did not challenge Emma Clancy’s claim that her organisation represents eighty percent of contractor
defaults who carry-out ninety percent of all electrical work. This may be true for the electrical contracting industry
default as a whole
default but 
defaultthe 
defaultDCLG committee 
defaultis only considering the domestic market and I would be surprised if this percentage claim was so high in this 
defaultsegment of the industry?
defaultI trust you will find my above contribution of interest and if you think I can be of further assistance please don’t hesitate to contact me.
