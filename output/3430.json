"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Imperial College London (AMR0034)&#xa0;1. \n              \nExecutive summary\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThere is a need to extend learning about the challenges and successes in the hospital setting and, at the same time, focus attention on the primary and community care setting.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nA health systems perspective is important when assessing burden and analysing the impact of initiatives in different health sectors.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThere needs to be clarity regarding appropriate measures of impact for existing and suggested initiatives.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nForward planning needs to incorporate contingency and flexibility to accommodate the structural and cultural changes within the health structure and work force as well as the macro-environment such as national and individual economic circumstances.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nA\nntibiotic stewardship needs to be addressed from a whole healthcare economy perspective using an integrated care model.  The interface between primary and secondary care requires systematic process mapping.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nOrganisational background and reason for submitting evidence\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe National Centre for Infection Prevention and Management was set up in 2009 as a result of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration Translational Infection Research Initiative and is a collaboration between Imperial College London, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Public Health England. Our research capability focuses on healthcare associated infection and antimicrobial resistance and spans basic science, clinical investigation, population-based studies, social sciences, health management, organisational, and behavioural research. We have an excellent track record of important research in this area, evidenced by further successful grant funding and a pipeline of publications, and feel that the Centre is ideally placed to submit to the written inquiry. \nThe initiatives the Centre has put in place include better use of surveillance data, international collaborations to prioritise the issue of AMR, capacity building through the education and training of healthcare professionals and are already addressing the key areas of action outlined in the Chief Medical Officer’s five year UK strategy on AMR. Further details of these initiatives are included in the submission and have been cited in the UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013-2018.\n&#xa0;\n3. \n              \nFactual information from which the committee might be able to draw conclusions, or which could be put to other witnesses for their reactions.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nBackground\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.1.1\n              \nOver 30% of UK inpatients are on anti-infectives at any one time\n and about 12% of primary care prescriptions are for an anti-infective\n. Inappropriate use gives rise to \nClostridium difficile\n, particularly in older people, and drives development of resistance both at individual and population levels. The threats and costs associated with MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and other resistant organisms are well known. The stewardship of anti-infectives is a local, national and global concern and management of increasingly resistant infections is a major challenge for the NHS. The management of this diminishing therapeutic resource to ensure patient care and public health for the present and future is a global priority, giving rise to a WHO specific call for action in 2011.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nCurrent gaps in our knowledge of AMR\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.2.1\n              \nThe impact of reservoirs of high burden of antimicrobial resistance within primary and secondary settings needs to be explored. For example, what is the impact of intensive care units and nursing homes in the transfer and maintenance of antimicrobial resistance?  In addition, we do not have a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between primary and secondary care; essential knowledge to ensure that improvements in prescribing in one setting do not have unintended consequences in the other.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.2 \n              \nThere is a need to address\n antibiotic stewardship from a whole healthcare economy perspective using an integrated care model. The interface between primary and secondary care requires systematic process mapping. Most infection research has focused on the hospital setting, but over one third of MRSA bloodstream infections and nearly half of \nClostridium difficile\n infections occur in primary care. Imperial College has developed a method of assessing how successful hospitals control and manage infection, particularly infection outbreaks.  An extension of this approach in the community setting is required.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.3\n              \nEffective i\nmplementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes is a key factor in arresting antimicrobial resistance, but the optimal composition of these programmes is still unclear.  W\ne have a meagre understanding of prescriber behaviours when we differentiate within professional groups. For example how do consultants of different specialties (paediatrics, elderly, obstetrics, renal medicine etc) behave in relation to guidelines? In addition, we need to know how these consultants and other doctors perceive the role of and advice from specialist pharmacists\n. We have anecdotal evidence to suggest that consultant surgeons exclude the role of specialist pharmacists from their own domain of practice\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.4\n              \nThe key role of nurses as knowledge brokers in anti-infective use has not been adequately explored and their involvement is potentially under-utilised.\n \nThe involvement of nurses in decision making on antibiotics, particularly de-escalation, intravenous to oral switch and discontinuation are important potential interventions.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.5\n              \nDespite the frequency of public awareness campaigns, there is still uncertainty about public perceptions of antibiotics and antimicrobials.  Better understanding and appropriate methodology is also needed to make sense of decision-making process of individuals and groups when requesting/using antibiotics. Increasingly, a more sophisticated understanding of the impact of the economic crisis, social policies and associated inequalities on the use/misuse of antibiotics is needed (ie the social determinants of antimicrobial use). Of equal significance, is the need to ensure adequate early access to antibiotic treatment to improve sepsis survival in the UK.  Fragmenting the population appropriately will help inform better targeted campaigns and interventions for the public and patients.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nResearch and investment into new antibiotics, treatments and infection control methods\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.3.1\n              \nA recent collaborative study\n exploring the allocation of funds to infection and antimicrobial resistance research suggests that antimicrobial resistance receives globally a modest amount of funding compared with its impact. Further, a minor proportion of the funding goes towards the \nimplementation of effective solutions, compared to primary research or laboratory research for the generation of new antibiotics.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.2\n              \nOverall, infection prevention and control remains underfunded leaving key questions unaddressed. Which measures are successful in reducing transmission? What are effective, sustainable hand hygiene initiatives? How can organisations and systems effectively implement antimicrobial stewardship programmes? What is the optimal composition of these programmes?\n&#xa0;3.3.3\n              \nThere are implications specifically for infection prevention and control from research in the broader patient safety arena.  As part of the wider remit of patient safety in low-middle income countries, Imperial College has recently collaborated to a WHO coordinated study to assess the nature and scale of harm in these settings with an aim of building patient safety capacity.  The programme is working with countries to establish patient safety initiatives\n in 28 hospitals situated in Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Sudan and Yemen.  Whilst the adverse event rates were found to be similar to those in high income countries\n; their preventability and patient mortality is considerably higher. The principal problems identified were inadequate training and supervision and the failure to follow protocols.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nEffective measures in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.4.1\n              \nA number of innovative tools have been developed and are in use at Imperial College including “Check and Correct”, a Consultant-led, ward round-based tool for highlighting the quality of prescribing on an on going basis; a fully searchable smartphone application for the adult antibiotic prescribing policy, and a methodology for improving prescribing in older patients with multiple co-morbidities\n. Social Marketing interventions are also in development to improve antibiotic prescribing documentation and improving cessation.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.2\n              \nNational guidelines for infection control research on the \nemm1 Streptococcus pyogenes\n genome data from a maternity unit outbreak underpinned the introduction of new national guidance on preventing and limiting the impact of nosocomial outbreaks. The guidelines, in collaboration with the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England), address prevention and control of group A streptococcal infection in acute healthcare and maternity settings in the UK.  This followed the deaths from post-partum maternal sepsis at Royal Hampshire Hospital\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.3\n              \nIn the area of post graduate and continuing professional development the MSc in Infection Management for Pharmacists was established in 2003 to address the local and national challenge of antibiotic resistance.\n&#xa0;\n This course is still unique in the UK as the only one designed to provide antimicrobial pharmacists with the knowledge required to fulfil their post in the NHS in multidisciplinary teams and become influential leaders.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe WHO Global Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance 2001, stated that “The most effective infection control team consists of a physician […], a microbiologist, infection control nurses, pharmacist(s) and hospital management representatives”; \nand the Imperial Masters remains the only specialist course available for pharmacists.\n&#xa0;\n Appreciating the demands of trust pharmacists, the course delivery format is through blended learning\n, allowing pharmacists from across the UK to attend and complete the course with minimal study leave needed. \nGraduates from the course are now national leaders in this field, advising on policy and strategy with positions on advisory and expert panel\ns. Students are supported throughout completion of their research projects which enables and encourages them to improve an \narea of concern within their base trusts and for many students this has led to practise changes and improvements.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nGlobal coordination and action\n:\n&#xa0;3.5.1\n              \nWhilst the UK is a key player in raising the issue in international fora, coordination via supranational organisations is ad-hoc and inconsistent. For example guidance for global surveillance strategies to monitor AMR is underdeveloped.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.2 Within the UK there is good micro resistance data in hospitals as cultures are routine practice, however there is no routine collection of biological samples for monitoring in primary care. This limits the extent to which learning can be extrapolated and translated to other contexts. Currently we lack AMR surveillance in primary care other than for notifiable diseases. There needs to be a modelling of cost-benefits of targeted versus routine sampling in primary care.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.3\n              \nA review of poor quality antibiotics in low and middle income countries coupled with addressing ‘loose’ adherence to prescribing guidelines needs to be part of any health reform strategy. Direct access to specialists and ‘threat of exit’ by patients in market driven heath economies give rise to over-prescribing of antibiotics. Direct over the counter availability of broad spectrum antibiotics, self-medication and families sharing antibiotics as symptom relief are widespread practices. Learning from policy implementation issues of removal of over the counter antibiotics and unintended consequences need to inform future strategies\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nStrengths and weaknesses of the strategy\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.6.1\n              \nThe strengths of the strategy include the comprehensive approach addressing clinical, epidemiological issues as well as educational interventions.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6.2\n              \nThere is limited consideration of the social sciences as a methodology which is key to understanding behaviour change and hence critical in informing interventions.\n&#xa0;\n3.6.3\n              \nIn terms of evaluation, it is not clear how the impact of some interventions proposed will be measured and considered ‘successful’. For example what is the impact of awareness raising amongst the public? In addition, more information about the added financial commitment required by organisations could be useful.\n&#xa0;\n3.6.4 In terms of sustainability, the strategy does not incorporate fully the wider changes to the NHS and public heath structure. In addition it does not make explicit any contingency for macro-level and societal changes which may occur from 2013 to 2018. The strategy needs to be explicitly linked with the wider infection control agenda, which in turn is integral to the patient safety agenda\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nRecommendations\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.7.1\n              \nA\nntibiotic stewardship needs to be addressed from a whole healthcare economy perspective using an integrated care model.  The interface between primary and secondary care requires systematic process mapping.  This needs to include the contribution of primary and secondary stakeholders including healthcare professionals, veterinarians, pharmacists, governments, industry scientists and citizens.\n&#xa0;\n3.7.2\n              \nImpact of interventions should be analysed from a systems perspective. Focussing on a local health economy, for example, to understand if initiatives in one sector, such as primary care, have unintended consequences in secondary care.\n&#xa0;\n3.7.3\n              \nThe new NHS and public health structure (post April 2013) poses many challenges as well as opportunities for cross sector working. Understanding new leadership roles within this structure and drivers for appropriate and efficient prescribing need to be consistent with AMR reduction. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Dean BLW, Jacklin A, Rogers T, et al.
