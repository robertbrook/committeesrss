[normal]The Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies (CURDS)
[normal] is an 
[normal]internationally-recognised centre for the study of local and regional development.
[normal] 
[normal]Newcastle University is 
[normal]a 
[normal]partner in 
[normal]the EPSRC and ESRC 
[normal]i-BUILD
[normal] 
[normal](Infrastructure B

[normal] 
[normal]in which
[normal] 
[normal]CURDS is 
[normal]leadi
[normal]ng on the
[normal] 
[normal]study
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]innovative 
[normal]forms of 
[normal]finance 
[normal]for
[normal] city infrastructure
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]associated 
[normal]governance and regulation mechanisms
[normal]. 
[normal]Withi
[normal]n
[normal] the
[normal] research
[normal],
[normal] CURDS will be examining
[normal] the 
[normal]role 
[normal]of 
[normal]City Deals
[normal] in
[normal] 
[normal]local 
[normal]infrastructure financ
[normal]e
[normal] and delivery
[normal]. 
[normal]In 2013, CURDS
[normal] undertook the first National Survey of all 39 Local En
[normal]terprise Partnerships (LEPs) in 
[normal]England
[normal], as part of its involvement 
[normal]with the ESRC, BIS, DCLG and Welsh Assembly Government-funded Spatial Economics Research Centre (SERC)

[normal]              
[normal]The Coalition Government has placed significant 
[normal]emphasis on decentralisation as a means of
[normal] 
[normal]shaping 
[normal]public service reform
[normal], strengthening ‘
[normal]democratic engagement
[normal]’ and creating more open and transparent government
[normal].
[normal] Cities are a key area where the Government’s
[normal] decentralisation effort has been focused. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Decentralisation is not just an ideal. It has an essential role to play in achieving the Coalition’s core objectives.” (Rt. Hon Greg Clark MP)

[normal]The 
[normal]2013 
[normal]Core Cities 
[normal]Prospectus for Growth
[normal] sets out 
[normal]the case 
[normal]for fiscal decentralisation
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]specific 
[normal]policies 
[normal]that should be devolved to local areas.
[normal] These include: 
[normal]Jobs and Skills; Housing; Transport; and Business Growth and Innovation.

[normal]he

[normal]The 
[normal]Greater 
[normal]Manchester 
[normal]City Region has
[normal] played
[normal] a lead
[normal]ing
[normal] role in bringing together 
[normal]the 
[normal]decentralisation
[normal] of fiscal and economic responsibilities 
[normal]alongside

[normal]innovation when meaningful decentralisation has been exercised.

[normal]proposes 
[normal]to

[normal]then 
[normal]return
[normal] a share of the 
[normal]‘

[normal]ecentralisation
[normal] 
[normal]and public policy
[normal] reform 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]a set of tools 
[normal]that 
[normal]can

[normal] 
[normal]David Marlow, Visiting Professor of Practice at CURDS
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]suggests 
[normal]that 
[normal]integrated 
[normal]community budgets 
[normal]c
[normal]ould 
[normal]be 
[normal]align
[normal]ed
[normal] with 
[normal]‘economic
[normal]ally
[normal]-focused
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]City Deals:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Greater Manchester’s community budget sits explicitly alongside the Greater Manchester city deal 
[normal]and the combined authority as one of three major mechanisms for implementing a Greater Manchester strategy. The city region’s focus on growth is, in some senses, progressed through the city deal. The community budget seeks to lower ‘failure demand’ for pub
[normal]lic services through early intervention to tackle early years, troubled families, criminal justice, health and social care issues. If successful
[normal],
[normal] this would enable disadvantaged households and communities to participate in and benefit from Greater Manchest
[normal]er’s city deal economic opportunities in a virtuous ‘win-win’ circle.”

[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]London Finance Commission 
[normal]also 
[normal]calls 
[normal]for an extension to the remit and scale of 
[normal]Community Budget Pilots
[normal], and the idea
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]integrating 
[normal]local economic development 
[normal]with public service reform 
[normal]appears to 
[normal]have 
[normal]some 
[normal]momentum
[normal]. T
[normal]he 
[normal]2013 
[normal]Autumn Statement 
[normal]saw 
[normal]the G
[normal]overnment

[normal]However
[normal], 
[normal]if 
[normal]fiscal
[normal] 
[normal]decentralisation
[normal] and 
[normal]public service 
[normal]reform 
[normal]are to 
[normal]succeed there 
[normal]should 
[normal]be genuine decentralisation
[normal] 
[normal]by Government 
[normal]and 
[normal]then 
[normal]all 
[normal]Departments and Agencies 
[normal]need to 
[normal]subscribe 
[normal]to the process
[normal] rather than working
[normal], as has been the case
[normal] in the past
[normal],
[normal] with different levels of enthusiasm, commitment and even definitions of decentralisation
[normal].

[normal]I
[normal]n its

[normal] the Public Accounts 
[normal]Select 
[normal]Committee suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“This early promise now requires continued support from across the Government to translate it into real change on the ground, such as support from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to help ensure local areas are able to align skills and tr
[normal]aining provision with their plans to generate economic growth
[normal].

[normal]ifferent models for 
[normal]overseeing and guiding local and regional economic development 
[normal]are 
[normal]surfacing 
[normal]in England. 
[normal]Places that are 
[normal]more likely to be 
[normal]successful are those areas that have 
[normal]quality institutions and 
[normal]strong 
[normal]leadership driving forward 
[normal]clear and 
[normal]effective visions and evidence-based strategies.

[normal] T
[normal]he division of responsibilities 
[normal]between the
[normal] 
[normal]two
[normal] 
[normal]is still

[normal]              
[normal]In 
[normal]the CURDS 
[normal]National LEP Survey we found that 
[normal]those
[normal] 
[normal]LEP
[normal]s that
[normal] 
[normal]had been
[normal] 
[normal]absorbed into existing 
[normal]local 
[normal]structur
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]had 
[normal]greater accountability and legitimacy.
[normal] 
[normal]B
[normal]usiness involvement in local and regional development 
[normal]should 
[normal]be 
[normal]rooted in 
[normal]accountability and 
[normal]transparency
[normal], and it is a 
[normal]source of 
[normal]concern that
[normal] 
[normal]some 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]do not know 
[normal]who 
[normal]they 
[normal]a
[normal]re 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]accountable to.

[normal]The role and status of the Private Sector 
[normal]LEP 
[normal]Chair is crucial to 
[normal]shaping 
[normal]th
[normal]e character and focus of LEPs, with the quality of leadership 
[normal]fundamental to defining the LEP and articulating its vision, strategy and priorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With LEPs facing
[normal] a growing array of tasks and responsibilities, there is 
[normal]a paradox 
[normal]between the role of LEPs as strategic 
[normal]bodies (
[normal]i.e. 
[normal]their original remit
[normal]) and 
[normal]the 
[normal]part
[normal]nerships being encouraged to
[normal] act
[normal] 
[normal]more 
[normal]as ‘delivery agents’
[normal]. This 
[normal]is manifesting
[normal] itself in LE
[normal]P Boards where 
[normal]some 
[normal]Business Members
[normal] are concerned 
[normal]at whether 
[normal]they
[normal] 
[normal]possess
[normal] 
[normal]the necessary skill
[normal]s
[normal] and experience
[normal]. 
[normal]As LEPs allocate
[normal] and disperse
[normal] greater amounts of funding, t
[normal]he issue
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]legal
[normal] status and
[normal] indemnities 
[normal]have
[normal] arisen, 
[normal]which 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]provided a stimulus for
[normal] 
[normal]more
[normal] 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]opting to 
[normal]become
[normal] limited companies.

[normal]City Deals
[normal] and Growth Deals
[normal] are a me
[normal]ans for local areas to decide
[normal] strategic 
[normal]economic 
[normal]pri
[normal]orities
[normal] and 
[normal]to negotiate and 
[normal]conclude agreements 
[normal]with 
[normal]Government.
[normal] 
[normal]However, an evident
[normal] practical challenge
[normal] is 
[normal]to understand 
[normal]and deconstruct 
[normal]how
[normal] these Deals 
[normal]are
[normal] achieved
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]avid Marlow
[normal]’s recent
[normal] 
[normal]blog 
[normal]offers an instructive
[normal] contribution
[normal] on
[normal] the subject
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“When 
[normal]history comes to evaluate the Coalition Government’s approach to local growth, I suspect the fundamental critique of 2010-15 will be the subsuming of political values and conviction – whether to localism, city leadership, rebalancing, really to anything – 
[normal]in a series of tactical and one-sided ‘deals’. The ‘deal’ approach allows govern
[normal]ment to deconstruct 39 LEP, 28 C
[normal]ity, and any number of other places’ 
[normal]ambitions into a series of bilateral negotiations with individual departments and agencies. The ‘deal’ mode
[normal]l requires local leadership teams to ‘prove’ each individual proposition in a demonstration of their abilities to ‘haggle’ with an oligarchic patron. The default position is agreement to a slightly modified status quo where government retains the preponder
[normal]ance of powers, resources, flexibilities and influen
[normal]ce.....
[normal]."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]Government emphasises the value of deals in encouraging innovation, bespoke local approaches and decentralisation. Yet the deal-making system and culture raises questions concerning effect
[normal]iveness, consistency and equal treatment and the loss of scale economies in policy-making at the centre. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]In preference to the unbalanced deal-making syst
[normal]em that is emerging, w
[normal]e support the 
[normal]creation 
[normal]of meaningful 
[normal]‘
[normal]Centre-Local Contracts
[normal]’
[normal] to manage decentralisation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]OECD analysis of international practice, such as the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Contrats de Ville
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]that operate
[normal] 
[normal]in France, suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that it is possible to allow for innovation, tailored local approaches and decentra
[normal]lisation but within a more transparent, fair and accountable system.
[normal] 
[normal]In terms of 
[normal]accountability, i
[normal]t is 
[normal]important 
[normal]to 
[normal]distinguish between 
[normal]audit
[normal] and scrutiny.
[normal] It 
[normal]is 
[normal]insufficient for 
[normal]‘
[normal]devolved
[normal]’
[normal] areas to 
[normal]introduce
[normal] 
[normal]financial 
[normal]management 
[normal]processes 
[normal]without 
[normal]also

[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]Some Combined Authorities, such as Greater Manchester, have 
[normal]established 
[normal]formal scrutiny arrangements 
[normal]that
[normal] provide 
[normal]a check and balance 
[normal]on 
[normal]the
[normal]

[normal] 
[normal]Other
[normal] measures
[normal], such as publishing
[normal] 
[normal]pa
[normal]pers and minutes of meetings
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]should form 
[normal]an integral

[normal]of cities, city regions and LEPs
[normal].

[normal]in which 
[normal]individuals and

[normal]to question decision-makers
[normal], sh

[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]In relation to
[normal] executive and legislative responsibility
[normal], 
[normal]the Core Cities are seeking a
[normal] 
[normal]change 
[normal]in 
[normal]Parliamentary Standing Orders to limit the questions that Ministers can ask of local
[normal] politicians.
[normal] 
[normal]While
[normal] 
[normal]the UK 
[normal]Pa
[normal]rliament has a crucial role,
[normal] 
[normal]concerns have been raised
[normal] 
[normal]about the 
[normal]suitability and 
[normal]capacity of Parliament to monitor local government spending
[normal], particularly
[normal] as the Audit Commission

[normal]W
[normal]ithin 
[normal]new and

[normal]d regional economic development
[normal] there has been 
[normal]a 
[normal]resurgence
[normal] of local and regional levels of government – driven by the devolution of powers from

[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Detailed studies
[normal] 
[normal]of O
[normal]ECD 
[normal]member 
[normal]countries 
[normal]– between 1980 and 2005 –
[normal] 
[normal]suggest 
[normal]that there is 
[normal]a 
[normal]weak correlation 
[normal]between decent
[normal]ralisation and economic growth
[normal],
[normal] whilst recent analysis indicates that it is difficult to draw

[normal]conclusions
[normal] about

[normal] S

[normal]he Core Cities 
[normal]contend 
[normal]that there

[normal]relationship between the ability of cities to drive growth, the levels of local
[normal] 
[normal]financial control and the freedom to make policies ma

[normal] and the power to raise

[normal] to fund goods, services and infrastructure
[normal].

[normal]The call for cities and localities to be given new 
[normal]tax and borrowing 
[normal]powers 
[normal]is 
[normal]predicated
[normal] on a 
[normal]view
[normal] that the 
[normal]benefits 
[normal]of fiscal decentralisation
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]ould be 
[normal](re)
[normal]invested in 
[normal]infrastructure 
[normal]to support 
[normal]urban growth
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]albeit 
[normal]within 
[normal]a 
[normal]national 
[normal]framework
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]This represents
[normal], in part,
[normal] an attempt to 
[normal]reverse 
[normal]the 
[normal]trend 
[normal]of 
[normal]successive UK 
[normal]Government
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]favouring 
[normal]consumption
[normal] over capital spending
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]To illustrate, t
[normal]he proposed 
[normal]n
[normal]ew fiscal 
[normal]powers for 
[normal]the Welsh Assembly Government 
[normal]are being linked directly to 
[normal]the upgrade 
[normal]of the M4 Motorway

[normal]e
[normal]centralisation
[normal] of authority and resources from nation-state
[normal]s to regions and localities 
[normal]could 
[normal]pose a 
[normal]challenge
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]macro 
[normal]spatial economic 
[normal]efficiency and equity
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A highly unequal map of resources and prosperity could result. 
[normal]A narrow 
[normal]definition
[normal] of f
[normal]iscal decentralisation
[normal], 
[normal]stemming 
[normal]from 
[normal]a 
[normal]highly competitive 
[normal]model of 
[normal]urban development
[normal], could 
[normal]harden the 
[normal]inequality between core and peripheral areas shaped by 
[normal]market processes, agglomeration ec
[normal]onomies and increasing returns
[normal].
[normal] If the geography of fiscal dec
[normal]entralisation is 
[normal]fixed
[normal] at too small a scale 
[normal]there are risks of ‘tax flight’ as businesses and individuals 
[normal]seek the benefits of

[normal]ew local government finance arrangements

[normal]This risks entrenching the inequalities between more and less prosperous places with different growth potentials. 
[normal]In addition, t

[normal]The ca
[normal]ll for greater fiscal decentralisation
[normal] in England is taking place within 
[normal]broader 
[normal]debates about the constitutional 
[normal]arrangements 
[normal]in 
[normal]the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]The UK is out of step internationally and especially its cities and localities in England
[normal] outside London
[normal]. 
[normal]Scotl
[normal]and, Wales and London have 
[normal]existing structures 
[normal]that 
[normal]the UK Government can 
[normal]negotiate with and 
[normal]devolve powers
[normal] to. In 
[normal]England, 
[normal]beyond 
[normal]London, 
[normal]the 
[normal]recipients of 
[normal]possible 
[normal]fiscal devolution
[normal] are still to be 
[normal]finalised
[normal]. 
[normal]Although t
[normal]he Government see
[normal]s
[normal] C
[normal]ombined Authorities as bodies that 
[normal]it can 
[normal]devolve
[normal] powers and funding to
[normal], 
[normal]it is questionable 
[normal]whether 
[normal]such structures
[normal] 
[normal]represent 
[normal]radical 
[normal]constitutional change
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]The Core Cities
[normal] 
[normal]are proposing a new legally binding agreement between local and national go
[normal]vernment 
[normal]to set
[normal] out 
[normal]new 
[normal]roles and responsibilities. Other changes include 
[normal]the 
[normal]co-design of 
[normal]policies
[normal] that affe
[normal]ct
[normal] cities
[normal].
[normal] The LGA is

[normal]he London Finance Commission
[normal] recommends that
[normal] the full suite of property taxes (council tax, business rates, stamp duty land tax, annual tax on enveloped dwellings 
[normal]and capital gains (i.e. Mansion Tax) 
[normal]should be
[normal] 
[normal]devolved 
[normal]to London.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Core Cities 
[normal]want 
[normal]the 
[normal]devolution of property taxes
[normal]; limited powers to raise taxes (e.g. a VAT supplement or hotel room tax)
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]possibility of a local business bank
[normal];

[normal]The 
[normal]UK Government 
[normal]plans 
[normal]to 
[normal]devolve
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to the Welsh Assembly Government
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]landfill tax and stamp duty 
[normal]land tax; and 
[normal]to 
[normal]legislate 
[normal]for a referendum 
[normal]on 
[normal]whether

[normal] of

[normal] to the Welsh Assembly Government
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]Our view is that 
[normal]the 
[normal]nature of the 
[normal]arrangements for local authorities to retain busines
[normal]s rates point
[normal]s
[normal] towards 
[normal]some 
[normal]further 
[normal]limited decentralisation
[normal] of property taxes. However,
[normal] given the economic context, political se
[normal]nsitivities
[normal] and Central Government influence over 
[normal]local
[normal] taxation
[normal], 
[normal]any 
[normal]additional 
[normal]fiscal decentralisation
[normal] 
[normal]in England 
[normal]is likely to 
[normal]be incremental
[normal] in nature
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8

[normal]              
[normal]Greater f
[normal]iscal autonomy
[normal] 
[normal]should 
[normal]not intensify spatial disparities
[normal] or 
[normal]impact 
[normal]negatively 
[normal]up
[normal]on those 
[normal]unable 
[normal]to 
[normal]pay additional tax
[normal]. 
[normal]Transfers and safety net systems should not be compromised and unpicked as part of greater decentralisation. 
[normal]I
[normal]n the United States
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]p
[normal]roperty taxes 
[normal]are typically
[normal] regressive
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] poor
[normal]er
[normal] homeowners 
[normal]pay more of their 
[normal]incomes in property taxes than any other group.

[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]GLA 
[normal]is asking 
[normal]for local authority 
[normal]borrowing limits (within the Prudential Code) 
[normal]to be relaxed 
[normal]whilst the Core Cities 
[normal]wants the 
[normal]Government to raise the Housing Revenue Account borrowing cap.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]In October 2010, 
[normal]HM Treasury made borrowing for councils more expensive by 
[normal]raising 
[normal]the 
[normal]Public Works Loan Board (
[normal]PWLB
[normal])
[normal] interest rate
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, the desire by the centre to 
[normal]encourage local institutional innovation
[normal] for borrowing is potentially costly, uncertain and risky relative to
[normal] HM Government
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he UK Government could borrow 
[normal]at 
[normal]a cheaper rate
[normal] 
[normal]than local
[normal] authorities
[normal],
[normal] but
[normal] 
[normal]deficit reduction 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]the overriding objective of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Coalition
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]New forms, instruments or business models of debt finance need to be explored where Central and Local Government can work together/co-operate to reduce costs, pool risks and provide effective finance for investment – e.g. 
[normal]like the kinds 
[normal]of guar
[normal]antee
[normal]s
[normal] that HM Treasury is prepared to give London’s Government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]Following the PWLB rate 
[normal]rise
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]local
[normal] authority borrowing
[normal] 
[normal]fell
[normal] by 93 per cent
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Subsequently, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]2012 Budget
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chancellor of the Exchequer
[normal] 
[normal]announced
[normal] a 0.2 per cent
[normal] decrease in 
[normal]the 
[normal]PWLB rate
[normal]. 
[normal]Furthermore, i
[normal]n the 2012 Autumn Statement, the Government announced that it was 
[normal]creating 
[normal]a concessionary 
[normal]PWLB
[normal] ‘Project R
[normal]ate
[normal]’
[normal] for LEP
[normal]s
[normal]. This was
[normal] 
[normal]followed by a further announcement 
[normal]in 
[normal]2013 
[normal]that 
[normal]cheaper borrowing
[normal], 
[normal]of 
[normal]up to £400
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]illion
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]was to be m
[normal]ade available 
[normal]for 
[normal]priority 
[normal]local 
[normal]infrastructure projects 
[normal]in Scotland and Wales
[normal]. In England, LEPs and local authorities will have 
[normal]also 
[normal]access to 
[normal]an additional 
[normal]£800
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]illion
[normal] of borrowing as part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]new 
[normal]Growth Deals.

[normal]              
[normal]The UK Government 
[normal]accepts
[normal] that the 
[normal]Welsh 
[normal]Assembly 
[normal]Government 
[normal]should have new 
[normal]capital
[normal] borrowing arrangements
[normal] subject to a
[normal] proposed referendum on income tax powers.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he Welsh Government 
[normal]will 
[normal]also 
[normal]be offered 
[normal]early access to limited capital borrowing 
[normal]in order to fund 
[normal]immediate 
[normal]improvements
[normal] to the M4 M
[normal]otorway.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal].5
[normal]              
[normal]The relationship between devolved areas
[normal]’
[normal] borrowing powers and 
[normal]use 
[normal]of 
[normal]the UK Government balance sheet is
[normal] also
[normal] evident in 
[normal]London,
[normal] 
[normal]where 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury 
[normal]is providing 
[normal]a 
[normal]guarantee 
[normal]to enable 
[normal]the 
[normal]GLA 
[normal]to
[normal] borrow £1
[normal] billion
[normal] 
[normal]from the 
[normal]PWLB to 
[normal]help 
[normal]fund 
[normal]the Northern Line 
[normal]Underground 
[normal]e
[normal]xtension. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal].6
[normal]              
[normal]Under t
[normal]he Prudential Borrowing Framework (PBF) 
[normal]local authorities 
[normal]can borrow for capital expenditure purposes without 
[normal]obtain
[normal]ing prior
[normal] 
[normal]UK Government approval. 
[normal]Within the PBF, local gov
[normal]ernment officers assess the sustainability of borrowing and set limits in
[normal] line with the Prudential Code, which 
[normal]requires 
[normal]councils 
[normal]to have the financial capacity to repay debt 
[normal]as 
[normal]b
[normal]orrowing is unsecured by assets
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]because 
[normal]PBF 
[normal]increa
[normal]ses overall
[normal] public sector borrowing, the
[normal] Treasury 
[normal]retains the ability to 
[normal]cap
[normal] PBF
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]Faced with 
[normal]higher borrowing costs and 
[normal]changes to the Housing Rev
[normal]enue Account
[normal] system
[normal] 
[normal]some 
[normal]local authorities 
[normal]see
[normal] 
[normal]bond issuance as a
[normal]n alternative
[normal] 
[normal]source 
[normal]of finance
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]In the U
[normal]nited States
[normal], 
[normal]states and cities have borrowed from 
[normal]the 
[normal]municipal bond markets
[normal] for many years
[normal]. 
[normal]By the end of 
[normal]2011, there were over one million 
[normal]different municipal bon
[normal]ds outstanding in the US, in a
[normal] total aggregate principal amount of more than $3.7 trillion.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]GLA 
[normal]became
[normal] the first UK local authority for s
[normal]eventeen years to issue bonds when
[normal], in 2011,
[normal] it
[normal] raise
[normal]d
[normal] £600
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]illion
[normal] towards Crossrail
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The GLA 
[normal]needs 
[normal]to borrow a total of £3.5
[normal] billion
[normal], which is 
[normal]being 
[normal]secured against 
[normal]a 
[normal]business rate 
[normal]supplement.
[normal]

[normal]              
[normal]Bond issuance

[normal]LGA 
[normal]wants to create 
[normal]a local authority collective bo
[normal]nd agency 
[normal]for 
[normal]all 
[normal]authorities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]the municipal bond market has been
[normal] 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]inactive 
[normal]in the UK
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]councils 
[normal]will need 
[normal]expert 
[normal]advice 
[normal]and support 
[normal]on how to 
[normal]engage with 
[normal]a 
[normal]model that 
[normal]is 
[normal]more complex
[normal] and 
[normal]more 
[normal]costly
[normal] than the PWLB.

[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]GLA, in its emerging
[normal] London
[normal] Infrastructure Investment Plan 2050
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]identifies 
[normal]crowd
[normal]-
[normal]financing as a way of 
[normal]providing new 
[normal]finance
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Authority
[normal] is also exploring the 
[normal]possibility of 
[normal]hypothecated
[normal] 
[normal]taxes 
[normal]to deliver 
[normal]specific 
[normal]projects – subject to ballots
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]n the United States
[normal] 
[normal]voters 
[normal]can decide 
[normal]whether local areas should 
[normal]levy 
[normal]taxes or
[normal] borrow to fund capital projects
[normal] or 
[normal]whether the public or community sectors should own 
[normal]infrastructure
[normal] assets
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].5
[normal]              
[normal]There 
[normal]is also 
[normal]renewed interest
[normal] 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]in the merits of a
[normal] Land Value Tax (LVT).
[normal] Proponents 
[normal]argue
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] LVT could stabilise house prices
[normal] and raise funds
[normal].
[normal] At present, i
[normal]ncreases in land values usually come from external developments – such 
[normal]as 
[normal]infrastructure – which
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in the past
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]have 
[normal]not 
[normal]sought 
[normal]a 
[normal]financial 
[normal]contribution from 
[normal]the land owner. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].6
[normal]              
[normal]Other 
[normal]funding 
[normal]initiatives
[normal] include 
[normal]the Community Infrastructure Levy and 
[normal]e
[normal]vergreen 
[normal]f
[normal]unds where 
[normal]capital funding 
[normal]is loaned at or near commercial rates
[normal] to public and/or private sector
[normal], paid back and subsequently
[normal] re-invested in other
[normal] proj
[normal]ects
[normal]. A number of LEPs and 
[normal]city regions 
[normal]are 
[normal]creating
[normal] Revolving Infrastructure Funds, 
[normal]drawing on 
[normal]‘pump prime’ 
[normal]resources from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Regional Growth Fund, Growing Places Fund, 
[normal]European Regional Development 
[normal]Fund
[normal],
[normal] European Investment Bank,
[normal] Enterprise Zones 
[normal]and Pe
[normal]nsion Funds.
[normal] 
[normal]Cities and city regions are also turning to l
[normal]ocal authority pension funds
[normal] to finance capital projects
[normal]. 
[normal]Birmingham
[normal] City Council is
[normal] actively 
[normal]marketing the city
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]international investors, specifically 
[normal]global 
[normal]sovereign wealth funds
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]Both the London Finance Commission and Core Cities are 
[normal]seeking 
[normal]greater tax and borrowing powers
[normal] within a framework that 
[normal]has a neutral effect o
[normal]n the remainder
[normal] of local government finance (allowing for equalisation)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We believe that 
[normal]fiscal decentralisation should
[normal] be based on a robust assessment of the costs 
[normal]and benefits 
[normal]to 
[normal]individual 
[normal]cities and local 
[normal]authorities – a
[normal]nd not undermine fiscal safety nets or transfers to less prosperous places with less growth potential. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]The role of 
[normal]UK Government, working with cities, local authorities and LEPs should 
[normal]also 
[normal]not be
[normal] overlooked
[normal]. We think there is genuine
[normal] merit in the C
[normal]ore Cities 
[normal]suggestion of 
[normal]a new constitutional agreement
[normal] between Go
[normal]vernment and local authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]tentative recovery 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK economy is geographically unbalanced.
[normal] 
[normal]Fiscal d
[normal]ecentralisation
[normal] to cities and city regions should 
[normal]build on the inherent 
[normal]economic strengths of all cities and regions
[normal] 
[normal]to the benefit of national economies, 
[normal]and 
[normal]not 
[normal]exacerbate
[normal] 
[normal](inadvertently or otherwise) 
[normal]disparities
[normal] between different places.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]If policy-makers are serious about the need for spatial balance in the economy and fostering a balanced 
[normal]recovery, then fiscal decentralisation
[normal] should itself incorp
[normal]orate a significant element of 
[normal]geographical redistribution, directing greater resources
[normal] towar
[normal]ds areas of greatest need.
