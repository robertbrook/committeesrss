defaultIt is in the UK’s strategic interests to secure sustainably the resources which support its population’s quality of life (including for food supply, 
defaultdrinking water, construction and energy); to capitalise on its competitive advantages in the extractive industries (some of which are referred to above) for economic benefit; and to ensure that industry has access to the critical and emerging resources it 
defaultwill need to be innovative and competitive.  The pressure on all geological resources will
default increase
default as the
default world’s
default 
defaultpopulation grows – this is a geopolitical matter, because deposits of these resources can only be found where nature has put them.  Some comm
defaultodities trade globally, and for these the UK will be in competition with other countries.  Within the UK, some commodities (shale gas, for example) may occur in sensitive areas, and there is an opportunity to provide global leadership in securing social co
defaultnsent to operate.  To capitalise on our geographical and historical competitive advantages will require world-leading research and training.
