[normal]What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How does the UK based extractive [bold]industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Has [bold]the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?[bold]Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best [bold]practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Does the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based bu[bold]sinesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used[bold] to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the competitive landscape for the extracti[bold]ve industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]It is in the UK’s strategic interests to secure sustainably the resources which support its population’s quality of life (including for food supply, 
[normal]drinking water, construction and energy); to capitalise on its competitive advantages in the extractive industries (some of which are referred to above) for economic benefit; and to ensure that industry has access to the critical and emerging resources it 
[normal]will need to be innovative and competitive.  The pressure on all geological resources will
[normal] increase
[normal] as the
[normal] world’s
[normal] 
[normal]population grows – this is a geopolitical matter, because deposits of these resources can only be found where nature has put them.  Some comm
[normal]odities trade globally, and for these the UK will be in competition with other countries.  Within the UK, some commodities (shale gas, for example) may occur in sensitive areas, and there is an opportunity to provide global leadership in securing social co
[normal]nsent to operate.  To capitalise on our geographical and historical competitive advantages will require world-leading research and training.
