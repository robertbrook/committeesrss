default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIn April 2013, the Government launched a consultation concerning proposed legal aid reforms. Such proposals were containe
defaultd in the
default Ministry of Justice’s c
defaultonsultation 
defaultp
defaultaper entitled “Transforming legal aid: delivering a more 
defaultcredible and efficient system”, which proposes 
defaultsignificant reforms to both civil and criminal legal aid in England and Wales. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese proposals follow unprecedent
defaulted legal aid cuts introduced by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which came into force on 1 April 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International UK submitted a written response to the consultation on 3 June 2013, during the course of which we e
defaultxpressed serious concerns. Those concerns will be repeated herein. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn September 2013, the Government published its revised proposals and launched an associated consultation. Those proposals can be 
defaultlocated in the Ministry 
defaultof Justice’s consultation p
defaultaper e
defaultntitled “Transforming Legal Aid: Next steps”. This consultation ends on 18 October 2013. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultOn 18 July 2013
default, the 
defaultJ
defaultoint Committee on Human Rights launched
default an inquiry into the implications for access to justice of certain of the Government’s proposals to reform legal aid
default. 
defaultThe Committee seeks evidence 
defaultin relation to the 
defaultissues raised by the 
defaultGovernment’s legal aid
default proposals
default,
default in particular:
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International UK is seriously concerned that the 
defaultGovernment’s legal aid 
defaultproposals will deny legal aid and access to justice to vulnerable individuals 
defaultand 
defaultseverely inhibit
default the ability of individuals to hold to account public officials and bodies for their actions
default and decisions.
default These proposals will directly undermine respect for human rights and the rule of law
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultLegal aid is a cornerstone of any fair and efficient justic
defaulte system; indeed, the Lord Chancellor states in his Ministerial Foreword 
defaultto the 
defaultfirst c
defaultonsultation 
defaultp
defaultaper
default– 
default&#xa0;
default“Access to justice should not be determined by your ability to pay, and I am clear that legal aid is the hallmark of a fair, open justice system.”
default&#xa0;
defaultUnprecedented cuts to legal aid in April 2013, in addition to reductions over the past decade, have prevented thousands of people, including the most vulnerable, from accessing legal advice and asserting their rights as well as placing extraordinary strain
default on the legal profession and courts across the country. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Lord Chancellor argues that the public has lost confidence in the legal aid system. No evidence has been offered in support of this statement. It is our view th
defaultat 
defaultrespect for the rule of law, 
defaultan
defaultd the principle of equality before the law, are much valued traditions in this country. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our view that rather than saving significant sums, as is the proposed intent of the Government, these proposals will place unprecedented strain on the courts wi
defaultth the rise of litigants in person. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThose who will be excluded from legal aid as a result of these proposals include some of the most vulnerable people in our society including -  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe Government’
defaults first c
defaultonsultation 
defaultp
defaultaper posed the following question - 
default&#xa0;defaultQuestion 1: Do you agree with the proposal that criminal legal aid for prison law matters should be restricted to the proposed criteria?default&#xa0;
defaultIn the subsequent consultation pape
defaultr, it is confirmed that the scope of prison law legal aid will be reduced substantially though the Government has modified the original proposal so that legal aid will remain for proceedings before the Parole Board where the Board has the power to direct r
defaultelease. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThough we welcome that modification, substantial concerns persist. We do not agree with the proposal to remove matters from scope. Ensuring the rights of prisoners is vital; see 
defaultGolder
default v UK [1975] 1 EHRR 524
default. Prison law is a specialist 
defaultfield 
defaultdistinct from criminal law. Advice and representation in the prison law field is provided by highly specialist legal aid providers
default.
default These proposals will negatively impact on such 
defaultproviders and place at risk that specialism and, indeed, the continuing quali
defaultty of advice and representation. 
defaultThese proposals will have a severe impact on migrants detained in prison at the end of their criminal sentence under immigration act powers. Such detention is without time limit and without any routine judicial oversight. T
defaulthe detainee only appears before a court or tribunal if he or she is able to instigate this. Detention under immigration act powers is frequently lengthy, sometimes for many years with no automatic judicial oversight of the decision to detain.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are par
defaultticularly concerned about 
defaultthe impact on 
defaultforeign national prisoners with mental health problems. In the past year, the Government has been found to have failed in respect of its obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights for its 
defaulttreatment of foreign national ex-offenders with mental health problems on four separate occasions. Furthermore, those with a history of torture and ill-treatment, those in need of medical care and those with a limited command of English are at particular r
defaultisk. If the proposals are implemented, there will be no legal aid to bring cases on prison conditions. There will be no legal aid to address treatment by staff such as bullying, abuse or discrimination.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also particularly concerned by the impact o
defaultn foreign national women prisoners who may have additional vulnerabilities including mental or physical health problems. Matters impacted by these proposals include admission to mother and baby units, medical care and other issues of vital importance. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe proposal, stated at paragraphs 3.48 and 3.59 of the
default 
defaultfirst
default consultation
default paper
default, provides that in order to be eligible for civil legal aid, an application must satisfy a two limb “residence test”:
default&#xa0;
default(i)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA person must be “lawfully resident in the UK at the time the application for legal aid is made; and 
default(ii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMust have been “lawfully resident” in the UK for a continuous period of at least 12 months at some point. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe legal aid provider will be required to re
defaulttain evidence that their client satisfies
default both limbs of the test.
default&#xa0;
defaultThree exceptions to the above test were 
defaultincluded
default - 
default&#xa0;
default(i)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere will be an exception for UK armed forces personnel and their immediate families. 
default&#xa0;
default(ii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere will also be an exception for asylum seek
defaulter only whilst their asylum claim is pending. If the asylum application is successful, legal aid funding will continue for an on-going legal aid matter, but not for any new matter. Such persons will need to satisfy the second limb of the test and wait unti
defaultl they can demonstrate 12 months lawful residence. If the asylum application is refused, at this stage the exception will no longer apply. 
default&#xa0;
default(iii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government has stated legal aid will continue to be available where necessary to ensure compliance with obligat
defaultions under EU and international law. Precise details are not set out in the consultation document. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSome modifications to the proposal are contained within the September 2013 consultation paper. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International believes that the proposal would be 
defaultadministratively unworkable and 
defaultprohibitively 
defaultexpensive. Examples of different groups who will be excluded include 
default-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International UK believes that the introductio
defaultn of such a test is a threat to the rule of law and equality before the law. We do not agree with this proposal nor do we agree with the way in which the proposal has been framed. Whether an individual has accrued twelve months lawful residence in the UK i
defaults not an adequate or reasonable test of whether a person has a “strong connection” to the UK. It is unacceptable to deny any group of people access to the courts and thus justice.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal would render significant numbers of people at risk of abuses o
defaultf power and arbitrary decision-making because they are excluded from the protection of the law. Individuals officials and 
defaultand
default public bodies can act with impunity, as there will be little risk of legal sanction for unlawful action. The proposal will impact 
defaultthe most vulnerable members of our society, including mentally ill immigration detainees, survivors of human trafficking, destitute families, vulnerable women and children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, we believe that the proposal would be administratively unworkable an
defaultd 
defaultprohibitively 
defaultexpensive. The proposal will impose significant evidentiary hurdles and effectively requires all legal aid providers, in any discipline of law, to have a detailed knowledge and understanding of immigration law. The question of lawful reside
defaultnce is a complex legal issue and one which practitioners will be unable to resolve in many cases. Furthermore, the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) will face a significant administrative burden in determining whether lawful evidence has been sufficiently 
defaultestablished
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal is likely to lead to an increase in litigants in persons who without legal aid will have no option but to bring the case themselves without legal assistance, placing great strain on the courts with cases that are poorly prepared and poorly arg
defaultued. 
defaultOur organisation is of the view that legal aid must be available for those pursuing an asylum claim, as well as those who seek to pursue further representations (including a fresh claim for asylum). Persons pursuing such claims may have fled serious 
defaulthuman rights violations, be traumatised or face significant infringement of their human rights
default on return to their country of origin
default; as such they constitute an inherently vulnerable group. In these circumstances it would also be the case that they 
defaultwill
default fin
defaultd 
defaultit difficult to pursue such a case without access to publicly funded and good quality legal representation. 
defaultWe are also particularly concerned that individuals and/or families pursuing cases concerning Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Right
defaults do not qualify for legal aid any longer, 
defaultincluding making
default an application to the immigration authorities 
defaultand/
defaultor pursuing an appeal. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPersons pursuing such claims face significant infringement of their human rights; the cases are often of fundamental and 
defaultprofound importance to the parties concerned, particularly in those cases that concern the potential separation of family members and/or children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany would find it extremely difficult to pursue such a case without access to publicly funded and good qua
defaultlity legal advice and representation. In addition, the law in this regard is particularly complex. This is evident by the significant amount of judicial time devoted by the courts, both domestically in the UK (particularly in the higher courts, including t
defaulthe Supreme Court and its predecessor) and the European Court of Hum
defaultan Rights, to cases concerning A
defaultrticle 8 and its interpretation. The frequency with which factual, evidential and procedural issues arise in such cases, the inability of many individuals to
default navigate the case themselves, especially for those for whom English is not a first language, and the lack of effective alternatives to specialist advice
default,
default result in our belief that the 
defaultlack
default of funding in such cases is extremely regrettable. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal, stated at paragraphs 3.69 and 3.77 of the
default first
default consultation
default paper
default, is that solicitors should only be paid for work carried out on an application for permission if the Court grants permission. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the 
defaultsecond c
defaultonsultation paper, a modified proposal was advanced. The proposed change is to introduce discretion to permit the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) to pay provide
defaultrs
default 
defaultin certain cases concluding 
defaultprior to a permission decision without a costs order or agreement.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not agree with these proposals, which are likely to have a serious detrimental effect on access to justice. Judicial review is a vital mechanism in holding to account the decisions of public officials and bodies. Given the precarious situation in whi
defaultch 
defaultlegal aid providers find themselves, even 
defaultindividuals
default with meritorious cases are likely to experience severe difficulties in accessing representation given that legal aid providers will under these proposals not be paid for any of their work unless and 
defaultuntil permission if granted. Such work is “at risk” and therefore poses a direct liability to the legal aid provider who is likely to be constrained as to the cases that they are willing to take. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, the Government’s proposed change to allow the
default Legal Aid Agency such a discretion as outlined above, does not negate our concerns. The frequency with which th
defaultis discretion will be exercised, and in which circumstances, 
defaultis unknown. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe consultation ignores the fact that many public law issues can be 
defaultand, indeed, are resolved without the need for permission to be granted. This includes scenarios where the decision under challenge is so clearly deficient that the decision maker withdraws or changes it as soon as 
defaulta
default challenge is commenced.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal, stated at paragraph 3.86 and 3.89 of the consultation, is to abolish the “borderline” prospects success category, meaning that these cases would cease to qualify for legal aid. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not ag
defaultree with these proposals. We believe that such proposals will render whole groups of people, including the most vulnerable, unable to hold to account public officials and bodies for poor, unlawful or unfair decisions, even when serious human rights issues 
defaultarise. This directly undermines respect for human rights and the rule of law. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch cases are relatively few and the projected savings contained in the consultation document are very limited. Not only is it frequently extremely difficult to judge prospect
defaults of success before preparing a case, such cases frequently involve matters of particular importance to the litigant. Very few people can bring forward a judicial review claim without the assistance of legal aid. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International UK is seriously concerned that the 
defaultGovernment’s legal aid 
defaultproposals will deny legal aid protection and access to justice to poor and vulnerable people 
defaultand 
defaultseverely inhibit
default the ability of individuals to hold to account public bodies an
defaultd officials for their actions
default and decisions
default. These proposals will directly undermine respect for human rights and the rule of law.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe legal aid sector is a difficult arena in which to operate for legal representatives, given the reductions in funds that
default have occurred over the past decade or more. We are aware of reputable law firms that have closed and other
defaults
default who have seriously restricted their work 
defaultas a result of previous reforms. For instance,
default the closure of 
defaultboth 
defaultRefugee and Migrant Justice
default and the Imm
defaultigration Advisory Service in recent years
default, organisation
defaults
default of significant size
default and prominence
default, creating par
defaultticular strain upon the refugee and immigration sector.  
default&#xa0;
defaultExpert legal advice and representation at an early stage results in a fairer consideration 
defaulto
defaultf legal and factual issues
default and can reduce the need for costly appeals in many cases. The proposals in their current form could result in the further closure of reputable law firms and departments who will be unable to continue their work.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs an organisation, Amnesty International is unable to provide legal advice or representation, to those who require it. We do receive a significant number of enquiries from persons who seek advice on how to locate legal representation and/or other services
default, including from persons in detention. Our organisation devotes a significant proportion of our resources in responding to such enquiries. We strive to help such people by referring them to experienced legal specialists who can provide representation in th
defaulteir clients’ best interests. This is very difficult in some parts of the country where the impact of past cuts means that good quality legal representation is 
defaultextremely 
defaulthard to find.   
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that the impact of these proposals, should they become a r
defaulteality, will be felt widely by charities and voluntary sector organisations. We are concerned about the implications for Non-Governmental Organisations and voluntary sector organisations, which are ill-equipped for this purpose. We believe that such organi
defaultsations will be overwhelmed with enquiries which they are not resourced to manage; many such organisations also face significant financial and resource challenges in these difficult times. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAmnesty International UK believes that the result of these propos
defaultals will be further restriction
defaults
default on the ability of individuals to access publicly funded and good quality representation and restriction
defaults
default on the ability of representatives to discharge their duties to a professional standard. In conclusion, any further red
defaultuction in 
defaultlegal aid funding would be unwelcome and lead to serious negative consequences.
