[normal]Written evidence
[normal] f
[normal]rom Scottish Public Services Ombudsman 
[normal][PHS0041]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This
[normal] note is intended to 
[normal]provide some background to the C
[normal]ommittee in areas where the SPSO remit and power
[normal]s
[normal] are most different from that of the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman. 
[normal] These relate to the decision of the Scottish Parliament to create a sin
[normal]gle Ombudsman and also to a
[normal] new role we have around setting complaints standards 
[normal]and designing and imp
[normal]lementing standardised procedures 
[normal]for organisations under our jurisdiction. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our[bold] jurisdiction[bold]The SPSO’s jurisdiction broadly covers devolved and local areas of government and related bodies.  This includes local authorities; prisons; the health service; 
[normal]registered social landlords; the Scottish Government, 
[normal]colleges and u
[normal]niversities 
[normal]and most Scottish NDPBs.  We can take complaints by private companies providing 
[normal]services on behalf of one of these public sector bodies
[normal].  We also take complaints about one utility, water. 
[normal] There are exceptions to our remit, there are separate bodies 
[normal]in Scotland 
[normal]for complaints about police; information requests; breach of standards 
[normal]of specific codes of conduct; 
[normal]and social care. 
[normal] 
[normal]Last year 
[normal]we received, a little over 4,100 complaints of which 37% were about local authorities and 30% about health. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The “one-stop-shop” concept[bold] and review of complaints [bold]The roots of our broad jurisdiction can be traced back to 
[normal]2002, 
[normal]when 
[normal]the Scottish Parliament
[normal] endorsed the idea of a “one-stop-shop”. 
[normal]T
[normal]he aim was to make it easier for the public 
[normal]to access the ombudsman 
[normal]and to be able to deal with complaints where more than one
[normal] organisation was involved.  
[normal]This led to the merger of the Scottish parts of the P
[normal]arliam
[normal]entary and 
[normal]H
[normal]ealth 
[normal]S
[normal]ervices 
[normal]O
[normal]mbudsman
[normal], Housing Ombudsman and Local Government Ombudsman.  
[normal]There 
[normal]have been 
[normal]additional 
[normal]significant 
[normal]changes follow
[normal]ing
[normal] two reviews of complain
[normal]t handling across the Scottish public s
[normal]ector
[normal] in the last few years
[normal].  Full details 
[normal]of th
[normal]ese reviews 
[normal]can be found in the Crerar Report
[normal] (2007)
[normal] and the Sinclair Report
[normal] (2009)
[normal].  Broadly speaking, these
[normal] reports
[normal] called for significant changes in complaints handling by public organisations and simplification of the complaints handling landscape at the next level.  
[normal]It was 
[normal]as 
[normal]a direct results of these reports that we
[normal] took on a role in relation to prisons and w
[normal]ater c
[normal]omplaints
[normal] and that the bodies previously dealing with complaints in these areas were abolished
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As an organisation with a broad jurisdiction we need to ensure we can bring the benefits of being a 
[normal]“
[normal]one-stop-shop
[normal]”
[normal] in terms of ease of access; consistency of 
[normal]approach and learning across the sector with the requirements to understand the diverse range of public services.  
[normal]When taking on new jurisdictions we have set up small teams of staff who specialise in those complaints for a period to build up our internal
[normal] knowledge and only moved to integrating them with our mainstream process when we believe we have sufficient 
[normal]experience and expertise to do so.  We also have a bank of specialists advisers we can draw on when we need to supplement our knowledge. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Comp[bold]laints Standards Authority[bold]The other statutory change to our remit
[normal] as a result of these reviews was that we took on a new role in 
[normal]2010
[normal].  
[normal]This role gives us specific powers and imposing duties on organisations under our jurisdiction around complaint standar
[normal]ds.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In line with the new legislation we underto
[normal]ok a public consultation on
[normal] principles of complaints
[normal] handling and
[normal] seven
[normal] complaint handling principles were 
[normal]approved by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Scottish Parliament in January 2011
[normal].  
[normal]All organisations under our jurisdiction are
[normal] required to comply with these principles.  The legislation also encouraged us to create standard
[normal]ised
[normal] complaint handling procedures 
[normal]which meet these principles.  We can require organisations under o
[normal]ur jurisdiction to implement the
[normal]se procedures. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Working i
[normal]n partnership we have led a programme of reform 
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]develop a 
[normal]standardised 
[normal]model complaint
[normal]s
[normal] handling procedure for each sector
[normal] 
[normal]under our jurisdiction 
[normal]which 
[normal]it 
[normal]is 
[normal]now 
[normal]a statutory requirement for bodies to adopt. 
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal]re are
[normal] currently
[normal] 
[normal]standardised
[normal] 
[normal]procedures 
[normal]in place for
[normal] all local authorities, 
[normal]r
[normal]egistere
[normal]d 
[normal]s
[normal]ocial 
[normal]l
[normal]andlords
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]olleges
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]u
[normal]niversities and the Scottish Government and 
[normal]Government sponsored
[normal] 
[normal]agencies and other public authorities
[normal].  They 
[normal]all follow the same simple model
[normal] process
[normal].  A quick, frontline resolution stage which should normally be completed 
[normal]within
[normal] five working days and a single investigation stage with a target response time of 20 working days.  
[normal]Alongside that simple process, there are requirements for organisations to 
[normal]log, monitor and learn from 
[normal]all 
[normal]complaints
[normal].  
[normal]While very similar, the mo
[normal]del for each sector does take into account
[normal] specific issues that reflect the individual needs of each sector and there is room for local flexibility
[normal], not in terms of the process and stan
[normal]dards the public receive, but in how their organisations meets these
[normal].  This is another example of the way we need to balance being a single Ombudsman with the need to reflect 
[normal]and respect 
[normal]local conditions.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While there were some initial concerns from orga
[normal]nisations
[normal] in implementing this new model
[normal], particularly those for whom this would be a significant change, there are now hundreds of organisations across Scotland operating this model and organisations are increasingly reporting that they are finding the ne
[normal]w model is 
[normal]acting as a cultural catalyst not only in relation to their complaints handling but in 
[normal]improv
[normal]ing their wider approach to customer service
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CSA 
[normal]also provides 
[normal]support 
[normal]to 
[normal]organisations using the model.  They 
[normal]have established complaints handl
[normal]ers networks for the
[normal] 
[normal]sectors to
[normal] help
[normal] share best practice 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]learning from complaints
[normal] and to benchmark performance
[normal].  
[normal]We have 
[normal]develop
[normal]ed standardised 
[normal] performance indicators 
[normal]for each sector which they will be required to publish meaning that, for the first 
[normal]time, the public will have access to consistent detailed information about complaints at a local level and organisations will be able to compare and benchmark against each other
[normal] on the basis of consistent detailed information
[normal].  
[normal]We are not seeking to 
[normal]become
[normal] a regulator but 
[normal]have worked with regulators who now 
[normal]have access to 
[normal]complaints data 
[normal]in the course of their
[normal] regulation and inspection
[normal] activities
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is worth noting that the complaints process for the Health Service 
[normal]in Scotland 
[normal]is set out in separate leg
[normal]islation and regulations.  The process consists of a single investigation stage of 20 working days and this was used as the basis for the other sectors to mean that, as far as possible, anyone complaining to any public organisation in Scotland should meet 
[normal]similar standards
[normal] and procedures
[normal].  This should also make it easier for organisations working together to deliver services to co-ordinate their responses to any concerns. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Making 
[normal]the process easier and recording
[normal] and  monitoring complaints is o
[normal]nly the start of the process.  The process is 
[normal] also designed to help staff in public organisations focus less on the process and more on responding well.  The
[normal]re is a strong emphasis 
[normal]in the procedures 
[normal]on empowering 
[normal]all 
[normal]front-line staff to resolve problems 
[normal]a
[normal]s close to the frontline as possible. T
[normal]he
[normal] CSA 
[normal]also seeks to share
[normal] good practice and has 
[normal]established 
[normal]forums for complaint handlers
[normal] to meet to discuss improvements and common issues.  Additional support is given by our training unit. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The SPSO Training Unit[bold] [bold]Th
[normal]e SPSO training unit predated the reviews and
[normal] was created in 
[normal]response to requests from organisations 
[normal]in our jurisdiction 
[normal]for help and 
[normal]was initially influenced by a similar unit at the Local Government Ombudsman.  
[normal]This has since evolved considerably as 
[normal]requests 
[normal]for training increased following the Sinclair report in 2009 which recommended that public organisations invest in training for staff and also that the status of complaint handlers be improved within organisations.  
[normal]When the 
[normal]model 
[normal]procedures were 
[normal]developed there were 
[normal]further requests for us to 
[normal]support the process with good complaint handling skills
[normal] training
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our website SPSO 
[normal]T
[normal]raining
[normal] now hosts several e-learning modules.  These are free t
[normal]o members of staff in the organisations
[normal] under our jurisdic
[normal]tion. 
[normal] The modules
[normal] currently available on the site are desi
[normal]gned for front-line staff
[normal] to help them understand their role and emphasise the benefits of resolving complaints quickly
[normal]. 
[normal] We have had 2,5
[normal]00 staff sign up direct through our own website and know org
[normal]anisations who have chosen to directly host the e-learning on their own internal websites have signed up many more. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal]also deliver direct training for staff who unde
[normal]rtake the investigation stage
[normal] and in 2012/13 
[normal]delive
[normal]re
[normal]d
[normal] 71 courses
[normal].  
[normal] We are currently wo
[normal]rking closely with NHS Education Scotland 
[normal](NES) 
[normal]and 
[normal]e-learning 
[normal]training for frontline NHS staff launched in
[normal] May 2013
[normal].  We are 
[normal]providing 
[normal] training
[normal] direct
[normal] to GP practice managers 
[normal]alongside
[normal] NES and expect to have an investigation skills training e-learning mo
[normal]dule 
[normal]for NHS staff 
[normal]available early next year.  
[normal]Our e-learning modules have attracted considerable interest and we have had requests from organisations outside our jurisdiction to access these, including some international contacts
[normal] to use them
[normal]. 
[normal] To give an 
[normal]example, w
[normal]e have had a direct request from a local authority in New Zealand
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] We know NHS England have considered our modules as they look to develop their own approach. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]While we do not charge for e-learning 
[normal]we do for direct delivery
[normal] training and do so on a cost-recovery basis.  
[normal]We sought and received
[normal] Scottish Government 
[normal]funding 
[normal]for the technical side of the e-learning and the NHS have funded their own e-learning. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Looking ahead [bold]There is currently an impetus around complaints handli
[normal]ng as a result of the 
[normal]reviews, and the implementation of the new models.  
[normal]However, culture change and leadership remain the most significant factors in improving complaints handling.  
[normal]While
[normal] tr
[normal]aining seeks to support this,
[normal] 
[normal]I have 
[normal]also 
[normal]been meeting Chief Exe
[normal]cutives and others to encourage 
[normal]greater visibility 
[normal]and reporting 
[normal]and 
[normal]provide 
[normal]additional guidance and support for the way governance structures 
[normal]across the public services 
[normal]should be responding to complaints.
