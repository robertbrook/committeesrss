[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[FOIL]]] (The Forum of Insurance Lawyers) exists to provide a forum for communication and the exchange of information between lawyers acting predominantly or exclusively for insurance clients (except legal expenses insurers) within firms of solicitors, as barristers, or as in-house lawyers for insurers or self-insurers. FOIL is an active lobbying organisation on matters concerning insurance litigation. &#xa0;

[[[FOIL]]] represents over 8000 members. It is the only organisation which represents solicitors who act for defendants in civil proceedings.

[[[ fraudulent claims]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Further reforms]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;It is already recognised, by a ban on the practice by CMCs, that it is undesirable for potential claimants to be offered an immediate inducement to bring a claim. Inevitably some claimants will be encouraged to make a fraudulent claim by the promise of an immediate benefit, before they have had a chance to think through the consequences of such a step. FOIL believes that the ban should be extended to law firms to completely outlaw this practice. &#xa0;When asked during the course of giving oral evidence to the Committee, what compensation would be appropriate for a whiplash injury, James Dalton from the ABI replied that it was “whatever society determines is the right amount which will then be built into insurance premiums”. FOIL would suggest that, bearing in mind the heavy burden claims place on motorists and the current concerns over the high cost of living, society may reasonably consider that the current level of compensation for whiplash claims is adequate. Without intervention the level of damages set out in the Judicial College Guidelines will continue to rise. FOIL would suggest that steps should be taken to ensure that, for a period, damages in low value RTA claims should not rise further.  This is a matter which ultimately will need to be considered by the judiciary but FOIL would welcome the Committee’s examination of the issue. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
