"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mencap&#xa0;About MencapWe support the 1.5 million people with a learning disability in the \nUK\n and their families and carers. We fight to change laws and improve services and access to education, employment and leisure facilities, supporting thousands of people with a learning disability to live their lives the way they want. See \nwww.mencap.org.uk \nfor more information. \n&#xa0;\nWe are also one of the largest providers of services, information and advice for people with a learning disability across England, Northern Ireland and \nWales\n.\n&#xa0;\nAbout learning disabilityA learning disability is caused by the way t\nhe brain develops before, during or shortly after birth. It is always lifelong and affects someone's intellectual and social development. It used to be called mental handicap but this term is outdated and offensive. Learning disability is \nnot\n a mental illn\ness. The term learning difficulty is often incorrectly used interchangeably with learning disability.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction &#xa0;\nMencap’s vision is for a truly inclusive society, where people with a learning disability \nare valued equally, and get the support they need to live fulfilling lives.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the International Development Committee’s inquiry into Disability and Development, with a focus on ensuring disabled people are included in international development p\nrogrammes.\nThis submission focuses on the important principles which underpin inclusive education and inclusive employment practice.\n Many of these principles will underpin inclusive practice in relation to other areas of people’s lives as well. We hope a sha\nred understanding of these prin\nc\ni\nples will \nhelp \nensure that people with a learning disability are fully included in development pr\nogrammes.\n&#xa0;\nInclusive education practiceMencap believe that children and young people with a learning disability should be educated within their local communities alongside their brothers, sisters, friends and neighbours where they are enabled to reach their full potential. \nChildren with a lear\nning disability should attend a school in their local community that:\nWe supp\nort the policy of progressive realisation set out in the UN Convention. This recognises the importance of moving towards a system of mainstream educational provision which can provide for all disabled children, and which enables them to succeed in all area\ns of school life. Mencap recognises that for some children, because of the nature of their support needs, there will always be the need for specialist support, but believes that this can be developed in a range of settings that facilitate inclusion and eng\nagement within the local community. \nThese include:\nMencap’s aspirations for the inclusion of children with a learning disability \nwithin mainstream school settings is based on the belief that there must be robust alternatives to the way that special educational needs are currently provided for in segregated settings before parents could feel confident for their children to be educate\nd in inclusive settings as above.\n&#xa0;\nMencap believes that for children with learning disabilities to be able to grow up in a world that includes them in all areas of society, they must have equal opportunities to engage with their peers from all backgrounds,\n be equipped with personal skills to progress and have presence as a valued member in the community.\nPractice guidance around inclusive educationCurrently, the SEN Code of Practice sets out the practice guidance for professionals working with children and\n young people with Special \nEducational Needs (SEN)\n.\n In addition to this, the government has also issued Inclusive Schooling guidance that sets out practical advice for schools and local authorities on inclusive practices.\n The guidance promotes 7 key prin\nciples of an inclusive education service:\nIt goes further to state that inclusive schools have:\nThe SEN system is currently being reformed as part\n of the Children and Families Bill that is passing through Parliament. As part of these reforms, (due to be implemented as of September 2014) the current Code of Practice and the Inclusive Schooling guidance is being merged into a single 0-25 SEN Code of P\nractice.\nThe draft version of this document is still not finalised, but it has several sections on inclusion, principally set out on pages 86-88. For example it sets out that \"where a child or young person has SEN but does not have an EHC plan they must b\ne educated in a mainstream setting barring very certain circumstances\".\nThe new Code of Practice also refers to the provisions of the Equality Act, which include school and local authority duties not to discriminate against, and must make reasonable adjust\nments for, disabled children. Public bodies are also under wider duties to promote equality of opportunity.\nInclusive employment practicePeople with a learning disability are more excluded from the workplace than any other group of disabled people. Research shows 65% of people with a learning disability want to work, and that with the right support they make highly valued employees. However\n, only 7% of adults with a learning disability are in paid employment, and even then it is often for part-time hours and low pay. \nMencap believes that:\nThere are many barriers to people with a learning disability accessing employment, including employer prejudice. However, Mencap believes that people with a learning disability should also get the support they need to get and keep real \npaid jobs in mainstream settings and that, in order to help achieve this, the government should increase supported employment provision for people with a learning disability and guarantee long-term funding for this support. The definition of supported empl\noyment is as follows:\nThis model is based on a number of important principles:\nIn order to foster a truly inclusive society, Mencap believes that people with a learning disability should be proper\nly and meaningfully included in the workplace and be given the opportunity to get and hold down a job. Employers should make reasonable adjustments where required and, in addition to these obligations, Access to Work funding is available to pay for aids an\nd adaptations, transport costs, a communicator at a job interview, a support worker job coaches. \nPractice guidance around inclusiveMencap has produced its 'I Want To Work' guide for employers that highlights good p\nractice in employing people with a \nlearning disability\n.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0581-2001-SEN-CodeofPractice.pdf\n \nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrde\nringDownload/DfES-0774-2001.pdf\n \nhttps://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/downloadableDocs/Draft%20SEN%20Code%20of%20Practice.pdf\n \nhttp://www.mencap.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2008-10/LDW_factsheets_ENG.pdf.\n"
