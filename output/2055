defaultDiane Tranter – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultEvidence for De-Regulation BilldefaultA relatively straight forward means of accomplishing many of the objectives of the above proposed legislation would be to make all un-surfaced tracks (green lanes) 
defaultRestricted Bywaysdefault  instead of Byways open to all Traffic (
defaultBOATSdefault). This would simplify the legislation, reduce the legal processes and save Local Authorities, and tax payers, millions of pounds.
defaultBOATS allow the use of green lanes by any motorised vehicles. Trail bikes, 4x4s and quad bikes are now using them in their thousands, tearing up the surfaces and destroying the natural environment and peace in our most cherished countryside. They deter walkers, cyclists and horse riders from safely accessing their legal rights of way. 
defaultTo stop the use by recreational motorised vehicles (as desired by 85% of the population in a recent poll) at present takes many months or years of legal argument and public enquiries and costs Local Authorities an enormous amount of resources as each route has to be argued on a case by case basis. In the meantime, motorised use and the destruction of the routes continues.
defaultThe Highway Authority is legally obliged to repair badly damaged surfaces. Derbyshire County Council have recently spent over 300,000 pounds on one route alone in the Peak District National Park. It is now being torn apart all over again – utter madness!
defaultThe really sad and silly part is I suspect the original drafting of the legislation by DEFRA was a mistake in the first place. They used a definition of ‘historic vehicular rights’. The problem is, historic vehicle rights meant
default a horse and cart travelling at 3mph which can’t be equated with high powered trail bikes travelling at 20+mph or 300hp 4x4s.
