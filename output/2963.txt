&#xa0;Written evidence from Ian Williams (SRN 009)“The LASER model shows that the impact on morning peak travel of loosening the land use policy guidance would be a rise in car passenger-km by 4% by 2016 in the South East and East of England, over and above the level under Current Policy. … This suggests that the rise in the car passenger-km would be between 3-4% over the Current Policy Scenario, which is equivalent to 15-20% of the total forecast growth in car passenger-km for the period 1997/98 to 2016.” (page 56, WSP &amp; Arup, 2005)Williams I &amp; Y Jin (2013)  The Impacts of Urban Densification on the Supply and Demand for Transport.  Presented to the European Transport Conference, ETC13 at Goethe University, Frankfurt, September, 2013.WSP  &amp; Arup (2005)  Impacts of Land Use Planning Policy on Transport Demand and Congestion.  Final Report for Department for Transport Contract Number PPAD /151/1.  http://www.wspgroup.com/upload/documents/PDF/news%20attachments/PPG13_Final_Report.pdfOctober 20131 of 5 See http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/npp/national-population-projections/2008-based-projections/index.html
