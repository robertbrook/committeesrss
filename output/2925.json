"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dee Speers (PH25)&#xa0;\nThe second inquiry, entitled, Parliament’s Ombudsman service, will look at the work of the Ombudsman \nI have noted the PASC may be looking at \np\narticular issues \nwhich \nmay include\n:\nBearing in mind the findings of the Health Select Committee two years ago which reported \nhttp://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/health-committee/news/11-06-28-clreoprt-substantive-/\n I can only offer my experience of NHS Complaints.\nUsing your guidance: \n1) How departments record and provide information on complaints received?\nInformation is collected\n,\n reviewed and then either refused or sent to “reconsideration” for a few months ….then often refused! \nI believe the system is set up to fail complainants and the term “local resolution” is more often a\n request to “escalate to PHSO “if not happy”\n \n but \nreferral to PHSO \nneeds more than “if not happy”  as I know to my cost!\nI realise you don’t investigate individual complaints and my experience of PHSO process is what I need to convey:\na) there was no investigation as “not enough records” \n(isn’t that a reason to investigate?)\nb) A case worker left during assessing my case and left a note on file of “unremedied Injustice” This has been routinely ignored.\nc) Recent access to email conversations from SHA SUI Investigation Manager clearly shows the Investigation manager lied re my “alleged agreement ” on the Terms of Reference for the SUI Investigation into my sons death in hospital. This investigation was offered 6 years later and at no time was the PHSO office seeking my advice on anything! \nd) Dame Julie Mellor asked me to a meeting with her to discuss Baroness Fritchies Report.\n \nhttp://www.ombudsman.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/19664/Fritchie_report_FINAL.pdf\n I agreed and was advised that restrictions would be placed on the meeting re what we could discuss. I was told \nI couldn’t discuss any\nthing re my sons experience (which is why I am still here) and \nI refused to attend. \nI wonder how many others are closed down too.e) I wrote to PHSO on November 17\nth\n 2012 to state why I needed to retain my democratic right to question policy and process and since then one reply dated 14\nth\n February 2013 telling me “we will not be revisiting this decision and theres nothing more I can add” I ‘m sorry but the case remains closed. \nI wonder how many others told this too?  How effectively complaints handling is lead within government?I refer you to the Health Select Committee Report which states “NHS Complaints system is not working”\n Still! \nOne point is it costs in the region of £32m per year for the PHSO process but less than 2% of complaints are investigated. Is this because PHSO is working on other areas eg as with Equitable Life?\nHow complaints are being used to drive innovation and service improvement?In my opinion \nand from 8 years experience in NHS Complaints, Complaints are not being used to drive innovation and service improvement.. There is a woeful lack of integrity and many are taking full advantage of the fact complaints are seen in such a poor light.\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
