EIS 17
default&#xa0;
defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultTearfund defaultTearfund is a Christian relief and development agency working in partnership with organisations in around fifty countries, often working alongside or 
defaultthrough networks of local churches, as well as responding directly in response to significant disasters.
default&#xa0;
defaultTearfund welcomes the opportunity to input into this inquiry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs an active member of the Publish What You Pay Coalition, we endorse their submission 
defaultbut wish to build on this with some specific points. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultImpact of the UK signing up to EITIdefault&#xa0;
default1. The UK formally launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) over ten years ago. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWorldwide, the EITI is seen to have several benefits, 
defaultincluding; strengthening accountability and good governance; tackling corruption and enabling missing funds to be recovered; 
default&#xa0;
defaulta more efficient system of revenue collection; 
default&#xa0;
defaulta systematic framework for collaboration between companies, civil society, governm
defaultent and other stakeholders; reducing corporate risk to extractive companies by clearly showing what a company is paying to a government;
default demonstrating the contribution that the extractive sector makes to a country; and providing information that 
default&#xa0;
defaultenables 
defaultcitizens and civil society to hold governments accountable for their use.
default2. Cases such as the 2009 Nigerian EITI audit, which 
defaultidentified an $800 million USD discrepancy in what oil companies said they paid in taxes, royalties and signature bonuses and wha
defaultt the government claimed to have received, highlights the potential for greater transparency which the EITI process can bring. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Nigerian EITI has made efforts to collect this money, as well as further unpaid taxes identified in previous and subsequent 
defaultaudits, and has thus far succeeded in collecting over $400 million USD in unpaid taxes.
default3. 
defaultIn May 2013, the UK committed to become an EITI implementing country. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis was a welcome statement, with the UK demonstrating global leadership on this issue ahead
default of the G8 Summit. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith the UK calling for a ‘global standard’ for extractive industry transparency, the UK EITI commitment signals that the UK is ‘practicing what it preaches’. 
default&#xa0;
default4. However, the real benefit and impact of the UK joining the EITI will be 
defaultdetermined once the UK makes strides to become EITI compliant, and whether the UK models and implements the highest degrees of transparency and the optional recommendations in the revised EITI standard.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTearfund’s research in Peru has demonstrated t
defaulthat for the EITI to be useful to communities and to result in the desired accountability, the revised EITI standards need to be implemented in full - both here in the UK and in other EITI countries.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn particular:
default- There needs to be contract transparenc
defaulty in order that communities know the terms and conditions of contracts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Peru there were concerns that many of the contracts were not negotiated in the interests of the country but were the result of underhand political deals - greater contract transpar
defaultency would help address this.
default 
default&#xa0;
default- 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EITI reports need to include context, in order to convey the bigger picture. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Peru, the lack of contextual analysis and the lack of links with other initiatives severely undermines the potential impact of the EITI 
defaultreports. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe requirement in the revised standard to publish the context, including production figures; disclosure of the license holders; the revenue allocations to state, local and other accounts; and a description of the fiscal regime, is welcome but in
default time must go further so that EITI reports also link to other kinds of information (e.g. on local government budgets and environmental laws).
default6. The UK has the opportunity to model best practice with its EITI compliance - to implement the optional recommen
defaultdations in the revised EITI standard, to link the EITI report to other relevant information and to present the EITI data in an accessible, comprehensible and usable format - in line with the UK’s commitment under the Open Data Charter. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will enable UK
default citizens to more readily understand the data and ensure that the UK continues to act as a world leader on this issue, living up to its ambition to be the most open and transparent government in the world.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBest practice in engagement between the extractdefaultive industries and NGOsdefault7. Tearfund’s
default joint research in Peru has highlighted some of the challenges of NGOs engaging in the EITI process, particularly in terms of the discernible impact on promoting transparency, public debate and accountability for the revenues obtained by the extractive ind
defaultustries. The research found that in Peru, the EITI reports were published at public meetings in the capital Lima (where specialists, state officials, NGOs and representatives of extractive firms attended), but in the regional meetings the attendance was mu
defaultch poorer and the meetings not well publicised. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis led to less accountability and sometimes greater mistrust.
default8. The UK can learn from this experience and consider how to ensure that citizens and local groups based outside of London, particularly where 
defaultbased relatively near to extractive industry pr
defaultojects such as accessing unconventional
default gas, can be supported and engaged in the process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain, the way the UK publishes the EITI report and data will be an important determinant as to how NGOs and local com
defaultmunities engage in the process.
defaultGoing forward - the UK as a global leader on extractive industry transparencydefault9. The UK is to be commended for taking forward this agenda - most notably for supporting the passage of the EU Accounting and Transparency Dire
defaultctives and for making progress on extractive industries transparency at the G8 in June. 
default&#xa0;
default10. To prevent the momentum from stalling, the UK should continue to work to transpose the EU Directives quickly, as it committed to do at the G8, completing transpos
defaultition by the end of 2014. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK must ensure that the data resulting from the implementation of the EU Directives is accessible and usable in accordance with the principles outlined in the G8’s Open Data 
defaultCharter, in order that communities worldwide can ea
defaultsily view and interpret the payments made by UK extractives firms.
default11. In addition, the UK has the opportunity to build on the ongoing international progress and call for a global mandatory reporting standard, equivalent to the EU Directives. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA global agr
defaulteement is needed to ensure that all extractive companies, no matter where they are listed, are required to publish what they pay to foreign governments, on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs countries with the largest global share of ex
defaulttractive companies, the G20 has a key role to play - particularly Australia, South Africa and Brazil. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith Australia soon to assume the G20 Presidency, the UK Government should work with other G20 members to ensure that there is an agreement on, and a com
defaultmitment to, mandatory legislation at next year's G20 Summit in Brisbane.
