"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI was asked \nby the Committee \nto comment on a number of specific points in the light of my earlier submission of evidence. I address these points here.\n The first two points are addressed in some detail, the last two only in outline, because of exigencies of time. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe decision in \nÅkerberg\n \nFransson\n \nprompted \nextra-judicial \ncriticism from the President of the German Constitutional Court, and \nled its First Senate \nto \nstate \nin a decided case \nthat \njust because a provision has some connection with the abstract scope of EU law\n,\n or incidentally interacts with EU law, is not sufficient to trigger the application of the Charter. \nThe criticism has also been noted \nextra-judicially \nby Lord \nMance\n. \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe critique \nis based on \narguments advanced \nby \nAdvocate\n \nGeneral \nCruz \nVillalón\n,\n \nviz\n that the relevant Swedish law was not enacted to implement the 2006 VAT directive. The AG, while cognizant of the legal fact that the directive had to be adequately enforced, felt that this was insufficient to regard the case as coming within ‘implementation’ for the purposes of Article 51 of the Charter, \ngiven that the relevant Swedish rules on administrative and criminal enforcement for tax evasion were general in scope, see \nparas\n. 56-65 of the AG’s Opinion.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CJEU’s reasoning on this in \nÅkerberg\n \nFransson\n is contained in the following \nextract\n. \n24. In the case in point, it is to be noted at the outset that the tax penalties and criminal proceedings to which Mr \nÅkerberg\n \nFransson\n has been or is subject are connected in part to breaches of his obligations to declare VAT.\n25. In relation to VAT, it follows, first, from Articles 2, 250(1) and 273 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (OJ 2006 L 347, p. 1), which reproduce inter alia the provisions of Article 2 of the Sixth Directive and of Article 22(4) and (8) of that directive in the version resulting from Article 28h thereof, and second, from Article\n&#xa0;\n4(3) TEU that every Member State is under an obligation to take all legislative and administrative measures appropriate for ensuring collection of all the VAT due on its territory and for preventing evasion (see Case C-132/06 Commission v Italy [2008] ECR I\n&#x2011;\n5457, paragraphs 37 and 46). \n26. Furthermore, Article 325 TFEU obliges the Member States to counter illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the European Union through effective deterrent measures and, in particular, obliges them to take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union as they take to counter fraud affecting their own interests (see, to this effect, Case C-367/09 SGS Belgium and Others [2010] ECR I-10761, paragraphs 40 to 42). Given that the European Union’s own resources include, as provided in Article 2(1) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, \nEuratom\n of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (OJ 2007 L 163, p. 17), revenue from application of a uniform rate to the harmonised VAT assessment bases determined according to European Union rules, there is thus a direct link between the collection of VAT revenue in compliance with the European Union law applicable and the availability to the European \nUnion budget of the corresponding VAT resources, since any lacuna in the collection of the first potentially causes a reduction in the second (see, to this effect, Case C-539/09 Commission v Germany [2011] ECR I-0000, paragraph 72).\n27. It follows that tax penalties and criminal proceedings for tax evasion, such as those to which the defendant in the main proceedings has been or is subject because the information concerning VAT that was provided was false, constitute implementation of Articles 2, 250(1) and 273 of Directive 2006/112 (previously Articles 2 and 22 of the Sixth Directive) and of Article 325 TFEU and, therefore, of European Union law, for the purposes of Article 51(1) of the Charter.\n28. The fact that the national legislation upon which those tax penalties and criminal proceedings are founded has not been adopted to transpose Directive 2006/112 cannot call that conclusion into question, since its application is designed to penalise an infringement of that directive and is therefore intended to implement the obligation imposed on the Member States by the Treaty to impose effective penalties for conduct prejudicial to the financial interests of the European Union.\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere will inevitably be differences of view as to whether a Member State can be regarded, in the words of the ECJ in \nÅkerberg\n \nFransson\n,\n \nas acting within the scope of EU law so as to trigger the application of the Charter. It may be helpful in this regard to go back to first principles when assessing the conflicting views of the CJEU and \nthe \nAdvocate General/German Federal Constitutional Court on this issue.\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDirectives impose obligations on Member States, and accord them choice as to form and methods of implementation, provided that the objectives of the directive are attained within the tim\ne specified for implementation. A Member State may, for example, choose among any of the following non-exhaustive list of methods to implement \nthe obligations in \na directive. It might simply copy out the entirety of the directive into national law; it might enact a short law adopting the directive; it might use existing national legal rules and apply them to all or certain parts of the directive; it might use an admixture of primary and secondary law to implement different parts of the directive. It would be wrong in principle\n, \ngenerate considerable uncertainty \nand lead to formalism \nfor the application of the Charter to Member States to turn on the precise method of implementation chosen. \nIt should also be noted that Article 51 renders the Charter applicable to Member States when they are implementing Union law, which in the case of a directive will include the directive itself and other obligations held by the CJEU to flow from the directive. \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsider the present case in the light of th\ne preceding \nprinciple. \nThe VAT Directive in \nÅkerberg\n \nFransso\nn\n \ndated from 2006, but was the culmination of earlier directives dating back more than thirty years. The CJEU had made it clear in earlier case law that the regime of VAT Directives imposed an obligation on Member \nStates \nto \ntake\n all \nlegislative\n and administrative \nmeasures\n \nappropriate\n for \nensuring\n collection of all VAT due on \ntheir\n \nterritory\n and for \npreventing\n \nevasion\n. It \nfollows\n \nthat\n correct \nimplementation\n of the directive \nrequires\n \nMember\n States to have \nsome\n \nregime\n for \npenalizing\n \nthose\n \nwho\n \nevade\n VAT. A national \nlegal\n system \nmay\n \nchoose\n to \nfulfil\n \nthis\n obligation in a \nnumber\n of \nways\n: \nit\n \nmight\n \ninclude\n \nsuch\n provisions in the national \nprimary\n \nlaw\n \nthrough\n \nwhich\n the directive \nis\n \nimplemented\n \ninto\n national \nlaw\n; \nit\n \nmight\n do \nso\n \nthrough\n an \nadditional\n \nprimary\n \nlaw\n; \nit\n \nmight\n use \nsecondary\n \nlaw\n; \nit\n \nmight\n \ndraw\n on \nexisting\n national \nlaw\n and \napply\n \nit\n to \nfulfil\n the \nrequisite\n obligation \nfrom\n the directive. \nThese\n options are open to the \nMember\n State \nprecisely\n \nbecause\n a directive \nallows\n \nMember\n States \nchoices\n as to \nmethods\n of \nimplementation\n. The \nfact\n \nthat\n \nSweden\n chose to use an \nexisting\n national \nlaw\n to \nfulfil\n the obligation \nflowing\n \nfrom\n the directive \nwas\n \ntherefore\n \nperfectly\n \nlegitimate\n. It \nwould\n \nhowever\n \nbe\n \ncontrary\n to \nprinciple\n if the application of the Charter to the \nMember\n State \nwere\n to \nturn\n on \nthe \nmethod\n \nchosen\n for \nfulfilling\n the obligations \nflowing\n \nfrom\n the \ndirective\n.\n The \ndeterminative\n issue \nis\n \ntherefore\n not \nwhether\n the \nSwedish\n \nlaw\n in issue in \nÅkerberg\n \nFransso\nn\n \nwas itself enacted to implement the VAT directive, but whether it was being used to implement the obligations flowing from the directive, which it clearly w\nas. \nThe contrary conclusion entails the following untenable proposition: the Charter would be triggered if a Member State chose to implement the relevant obligations by, for example, enacting discrete legal provisions dealing with the enforcement obligation solely in relation to the EU VAT directive, but it would not be applicable if the Member State chose to meet the obligations through application of existing enforcement rules to \nEU \nVAT, even though the content of the rules is the same. \nNor with respect do I agree with the view that the interaction between the national law and EU \nlaw \nwas in some way merely incidental\n in \nÅkerberg\n \nFransso\nn\n. VAT is a primary source of EU revenue, and the penalty regime for evasion is therefore central to that revenue base. \n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI was asked to consider \nhow extensive \nare \nthe safeguards in Article 1(2) and 2 of P\nrotocol\n 30\n, and to comment on \nAG \nTrstenjak's\n analysis of them in \nFransson\n.\n \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArticle 1(2) provides that: \n‘\nIn particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates \njusticiable\n rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.\n’\n \n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArticle 1(2) is clearly worded and serve\ns\n to prevent the creation of \njusticiable\n rights in relation to Title IV except insofar as Poland and the UK have provided for such rights in national law. \nThe principal qualification to this proposition is that Article 1(2) of Protocol 30 only prevents the creation of such \njusticiable\n rights insofar as they might otherwise flow from the Charter. It is not a barrier to the creation of such rights insofar as they might be based on \nanother legal \nground that is capable of giving rise to rights \nstricto\n \nsensu\n. Th\nus, for example, \nUK \nworkers cannot rely on Article 27 of the Charter to generate rights to information, but this does not preclude such rights flowing from directives \ninsofar as they \ncover this area (see Charter Explanations, p. 10). The same is true in relation to, for example, Article 30, protection from unjustified dismissal, in the sense that directives have provided such protection in some spheres at least.  \n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAG \nTrstenjak\n \nregards \nArticle 1(2) of Protocol 30 \nas \nreaffirm\ning\n the principle, set out in Article 51(1) of the Charter, that the Charter does not create \njusticiable\n rights as between private individuals\n, and also believes that it rules out \nnew EU rights and entitlements being derived from Articles 27 to 38 of the Charter of Fundamental \nRights, on which those entitled could rely against the United Kingdom or against Poland. \nThe first half of the preceding sentence represents orthodoxy, (the Charter itself does not have horizontal application as between individuals); the second half of the sentence is the most natural legal interpretation of Article 1(2).\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArticle 2 states that: ‘\nTo the extent that a provision of the Charter refers to national laws and practices, it shall only apply to Poland or the United Kingdom to the extent that the rights or principles that it contains are recognised in the law or practices of Poland or of the United Kingdom.’\n \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArticle 2 \nis\n an important limitation on the application of \nthose\n Charter \nrights\n \nthat\n \nmake\n \nreference\n to national \nlaws\n and practices. The Charter \nis\n \nambiguous\n as to \nwhether\n the right \nasserted\n must \nbe\n \nrecognized\n in the national \nlaw\n of the \nparticular\n \nMember\n State \nagainst\n \nwhich\n the \napplicant\n \nseeks\n to \napply\n \nit\n. Article 2 \nsafeguards\n \nagainst\n \nthis\n \nreading\n, by \nmaking\n \nit\n \nclear\n \nthat\n the right or \nprinciple\n must \nbe\n \nrecognized\n in the \nlaw\n of the UK. \nWhether\n \nthat\n \nis\n \nso\n \nis\n \nnonetheless\n \nstill\n an issue of EU \nlaw\n. \n \n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAG \nTrstenjak\n \nmakes\n \ntwo\n points \nconcerning\n Article 2: First, \nit\n \nis\n not possible to \ninfer\n \nfrom\n Article 2 of Protocol No 30 a \ngeneral\n \nopt\n-out \nfrom\n the Charter of \nFundamental\n \nRights\n for the \nUK \nand \nP\noland\n. \nSecondly\n, \nArticle 2 of Protocol No 30 \napplies\n \nsolely\n to provisions of the Charter \nthat\n \nmake\n \nreference\n to national \nlaws\n and practices.\n&#xa0;\nI \nagree\n \nwith\n \nboth\n points.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA third issue that I was asked to consider was the likelihood that the Charter might be read so as to establish horizontal rights, given that courts, including national courts, must in accord with Article 51 \nrespect the rights, observe the principles and promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers\n.\n \nI was asked also to consider \nwhether parallels with the effects on the courts of the HRA \ncould \nbe drawn, e.g. in privacy or employment litigation (e.g. \nBenkharbouche\n v Embassy of Sudan; \nJanah\n v\n&#xa0;\n Embassy\n of Libya, 4 October 2013, EAT).\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe horizontality issue is complex as I noted in my earlier submission, and this is borne out by detailed academic study.\n \n Suffice it to say the following for the present. \n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst, \nI think it very unlikely that the CJEU will interpret the Charter so as to render its provisions in general \ndirectly \napplicable as between private parties. There will not in the jargon of the trade be direct horizontality flowing from Charter, whereby individuals could use the Charter as the cause of action so as to impose obligations on other private parties. Such an interpretation does not sit well with the language of Article 51 and it would provoke strong opposition from some national courts. AG \nTrstenjak\n \nin \nNS \nclearly felt that such direct horizontality was ruled out by Article 51. \n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecondly, particular Charter rights that correspond with rights found in the Lisbon Treaty may however have horizontal impact,\n \nin the sense that \nthe \nrelevant \nTreaty provisions have been interpreted in this way by the CJEU.\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThirdly\n, the issues raised as to whether bills of rights should have direct horizontal impact are themselves complex and I do not explore \nthem \nfurther here, other than to say that the arguments against such horizontality are weaker than is commonly perceived. \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally\n, \nsome \nnational legal systems do give \ntheir \nnational bill of rights some measure of indirect horizontal impact, whereby the rights are used as interpretive devices \nwhen construing, for example, private law precepts of contract and tort, or statutes that affect private relations, with the consequence that the interpretation which is most compatible with the relevant constitutional right is preferred.\n \nIt would be difficult for national constitutional courts that employ this strategy to object \nto its being used by the CJEU. Indirect horizontal effect of this kind fits with the injunction in Article 51 that EU and national institutions, including courts, must ‘\nrespect the rights, observe the principles and promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers\n’. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fourth of the additional issues that I was asked to address is concerned with the \nextent to which the Charter can really be said to be declaratory of pre-existing EU fundamental rights, and how the answer to this issue fits with the injunction in Article 6(1) TEU that the Charter does not extend the competence of the EU as defined in the Treaties.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArticle 51(2) provides that ‘t\nhe Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties\n’\n.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Charter was self-consciously drafted so as to be declaratory of existing rights, rather than constitutive of new rights. This is reflected in the Preamble, which states that: ‘\nThis Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the Union and for the principle of subsidiarity, the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Union and by the Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the European Court of Human Rights\n’\n.\n The Explanations attached to the Charter go to considerable length to explain the provenance of each Charter right by locating it in one of the sources \nlisted in the Preamble. \nThere are three relevant points that should be made about this drafting strategy.\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst, although each Charter right is duly located in one of the sources listed above the very fact of their inclusion in the Charter\n, which has \nthe same status as the TEU and \nTFEU, \ngives some rights greater force than they would have had hitherto. Thus, for example, a particular Charter right may be found in an international obligation or in a Social Charter adopted by the EU, but the impact of such a right within the EU and national legal order will be greater by its inclusion in the Charter, which has the same legal status \nas\n the constituent treaties.  \n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecond,\n \nit is generally accepted that \nArticle 51(2) prohibits construction of the Charter such as to afford new or modified legislative competence to the Union. \nThis \ndoes\n not\n,\n however\n,\n preclude the claim for certain new entitlements\n,\n provided that they could be satisfied through the exercise of existing competence. \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThird, \nthe Charter \nrights can be used as interpretive devices when construing EU action or Member State action that falls within the scope of EU law, in order to ensure that the relevant provision is given the best possible reading in the light of the applicable Charter right. It is also open to the CJEU to invalidate EU legislative, delegated or implementing acts for failure to comply Charter rights. It is also possible for the CJEU to find pursuant to Article 267 TFEU that Member State action violates EU law for failure to comply with Charter rights. \nJanuary\n 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;\n D \nLeczykiewicz\n, ‘Horizontal Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights’ (2013) 38 European Law Review 479.\n"
