"&#xa0;\nSusan Henwood – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI have lived in Sheffield for about thirty five years and have walked extensively, if slowly, in Sheffield's surroundings and the Peak District National Park.  Like literarily millions of other visitors to the PDNP, I greatly appreciate the work done by the National Park Authority and value highly the environment and quiet tranquillity that the PDNPA and adjoining local authorities work to protect and preserve. The national parks constitute a national resource but, unfortunately one that is under dire threat from increasing off road car and motorcycle use.\n&#xa0;\nOutdated laws have been used to set horse and cart use as the criteria for justifying the use of  4 x 4 off road vehicles and motorcycles on paths and tracks that were never intended for them.  As a result, severe and disproportionate  levels of wear, tear and pollution  are being caused that will be costly to maintain in the long term and that degrade or prevent use by other people and local communities.  Increasing use by off-road vehicles also increases noise and  exhaust pollution and conflicts with the purposes of designated areas of natural beauty, designated sites of Special Scientific interest (SSSI's) and the national parks themselves.\n&#xa0;\nThe Deregulation Bill could be an  opportunity to reduce the problems and damage caused by inappropriate vehicle use in the countryside  Classifying green lanes and Byways Open to all Traffic  (BOATS) as Restricted Byways, would greatly simplify the current system, reduce red tape and introduce a more realistic framework for regulation. I would hope that the Parliamentary Committee advising on the Deregulation Bill would see the potential  for positive use of the Bill and advise accordingly to protect our heritage and countryside.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n2\n of \n1\n&#xa0;\n"
