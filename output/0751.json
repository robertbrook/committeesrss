"Written evidence from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (LTC 08)&#xa0;\nThe \nChartered Society of Physiotherapy \n(\nCSP\n)\n welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the \nHealth Select Committee i\nnquiry into the Management of Long Term Conditions. \n&#xa0;\nThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) is the professional, educational and trade union body for the UK’s 51,000 qualified physiotherapists, physiotherapy students and support workers. 97\n per cent\n of qualified physiotherapists are CSP members. \n&#xa0;\nPhysiotherapy enables people with long term conditions (LTC) to move and function as independently as possible, maximising quality of life, physical and mental health and well-being\n and social participation\n. With a focus on quality and productivity, physiotherapy puts meeting patient and population needs, and optimising clinical outcomes and the patient experience, at the centre of all it does. \n&#xa0;\nPhysiotherapy has a key role to play in care for people with a range of \nLTCs\n including stroke\n;\n \nmultiple sclerosis \n(MS) \nand \nother inflammatory diseases; \nParkinson’s disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; arthritis\n;\n musculoskeletal disorders\n;\n \nlymphodoema\n; asthma\n;\n mental health; chronic pain; and \nfalls in the frail and elderly.\n CSP’s membership includes clinical specialists working with patients with these conditions and their carers\n. \nThe evidence we submit draws on\n \nthis expertise\n. We would be pleased to supply additional information on any of the points raised in our evidence at a later stage.\n&#xa0;\nCSP Evidence &#xa0;\nSummary of key points&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n              \nThere is significant scope \nfor varying\n the current mix of services, \nrequiring \nsustained resource reallocation\n towards\n community-based services, prevention, early intervention and \nreablement\n/rehabilitation. There is also \ns\ncope to make better use of the skills and knowledg\ne \nwithin\n the healthcare workforce. \nPhysiotherap\nists\n have a detailed understanding of the \nphysiological\n, social, physical and environmental causes of ill-health within people and populations\n and\n a high level clinical\n reasoning. Working \nacross a variety of settings\n, \nthey can \nco-ordinat\ne and lead\n effective and integrated services for people with LTCs. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nNorthumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Tru\nst established an Early Supported \nDischarge team\n to support stroke survivors in the community. This m\nulti-disciplinary team including physiotherapists\n has\n resulted in the average length of stay in hospital being reduced to half the national average and savings of around £500, 000\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThe \nHOPE Specialist Service at the North East Lincolnshire Care Trust provides a ‘one-stop-shop’ for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n and older people at risk of falling. The team\n includes \nphysiotherapists\n, \nsupport worker specialists, volunteer ‘rehab buddies’ and expert patients\n. Hospital admissions were reduced (1 per person attending the \npulmonary rehabilitation course\n)\n, and over four years, the falls and post hip fracture \nrehabilitation programme has seen an 8 per cent reduction in visits to A&amp;E and a 13 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for people who have fallen\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n4\n              \nPhysiotherapy staff\n work in \nRapid Response Teams and \nEmergency Departments\n. \nWirral University Teaching Hospital ha\nve\n developed a service to support the A&amp;E department by pr\noviding\n physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n assessment and\n reports and a range of practical follow-up services\n.\n The service has demonstrated significant reductions in bed days for the hospital.\n&#xa0;\n2.              The readiness of local NHS and social services to treat patients with LTCS (including multiple conditions) within the community&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nPhysiotherapy\n,\n \nas part of a\n multi-disciplinary \ncare pathway,\n has been shown to be clinically and cost effective \nin\n treat\ning\n patients with a wide range of long term conditions\n in the community setting.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nCOPD\n is the fifth biggest killer in the UK, and the second most common cause of emergency admissions in the UK. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes \nare\n proven to reduce the length of hospital stay and re-admissions\n \n. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n3\n \n              \nMany\n musculoskeletal disorders (\nMSDs\n)\n are \nLTCs, \nand\n can \nbe \nboth a causal factor and \ncaused by\n other LTCs. \nEarly intervention with physiotherapy \nis \nclinically and cost effective\n. Self-referral to \ncommunity \nphysiotherapy has been demonstrated to \nsave money and improve access\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n4\n              \nThe greatest potential for central nervous system adaptation and recovery occurs in the early stages of \nMS\n and \nearly access to \np\nhysiotherapy can reduce disability. \nP\nhysiotherap\ny\n,\n as part of a speciali\nst \nneurorehabilitative\n service, \nh\nas\n a key role in managing specific symptoms of MS including pain, spasticity and the prevention of secondary complications. Results from clinical trials of \nMS exercise programmes\n have demonstrated benefits in muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness, aerobic thresholds and activity levels and functional ability\n. \nO\nver a six month period, a physiotherapy-led community \nservice\n in Newcastle resulted in a decrease in GP and hospital consultant visits\n, the cost of the service \nwas\n offset by a reduction in bed days\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n5\n              \nTwo out of every 1000 people in the UK suffer from lymphoedema. Early access to specialist physiotherapy-led intervention prevents the most disabling aspects of the condition associated with poor management. \nI\nn the \nAbertawe\n Bro \nMorgannwg\n University Health Board in Wales, a lymphoedema team includ\ning\n specialist physiotherapists was established in 2004\n. This\n reduced \ncellulitis\n \nepisodes\n for \nlymphoedema\n patients from 58 per cent to \n9\n per cent\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n6\n              \nWhile there are many examples of excellent practice, \nthere \nare insufficient community-\nbased services for the treatment and management of \nLTCs\n, and a lack of integration between services in community and acute settings that can limit an individual’s recovery or rehabilitation\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.\n7\n              \nResearch conducted by the CSP and The Stroke Association in 2010 found that a quarter of stroke survivors had to wait longer than one month after discharge\n for physiotherapy\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n8\n \n              \nIn 2011 the CSP and the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) published \na report\n which \nrevealed a third of patients n\not\n being referred for physiotherapy, a third waiting for more than one year, and just \none in ten waited less than one month. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n9\n \n              \nS\nhort term savings\n \nthrough cuts in services \nand replacing experienced staff with\n staff on junior grades\n \nin community services\n \nfor people with \nLTCs\n,\n \nrisk \nadditional \nand mo\nre\n costly need\ns\n for social care, \nmedical interventions\n and longer hospital stays, as well as other financial costs to society\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.              The practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditions &#xa0;3.1\n              \nPhysiotherapists and other allied health professionals (AHPs) have a unique insight and expertise working with patients and in multi-disciplinary teams across care settings in the management of \nLTCs\n, which should inform \ncommissioning \nand service redesign\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.              The ability of the NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focussing on individual conditions&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe impact of multi-morbidity is profound. People with several \nLTCs\n have markedly poorer quality of life, poorer clinical outcomes and longer hospital stays, and are the most costly group of patients that the NHS \ntreats\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n2\n \n              \nPhysiotherapy takes a per\nson-\ncentred approach to care, \ntaking into account the totality of an individual’s health and wellbeing needs, \nsupporting \nself-manage\nment\n and \ninformed choices\n. \nPhysiotherapists \na\nddress multiple and complex\n needs of patients through high-\nlevel clinical reasoning, diagnosis and treatment skills. \nPhysiotherapists are \naccustomed to working in a variety of settings, across health and social care, and can be a valuable point of continuity and transition for patients moving from one setting to another. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n3\n              \nThe \nProactive Care: Long Term Condition\ns\n \npilot project \nstarted in April 2012 in the South Kent Coast CCG. Patients are supported by a multi-disciplinary team including a GP, community matron, health care assistant, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, pharmacist, health trainer, care manager and mental health professional. Patients are offered a 12 week package of support \nto improve\n the management \nand self-management \nof \ntheir \ncondition. Evidence shows a 15 per cent reduction in A\n&amp;E\n attendance, 55 per cent reduct\nion in non-elective admissions \nand \n75 per cent \nreport \nimprovement in functional quality\n. S\navings to date are £22\n5, 938\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.\n4\n \n              \nP\nhysiotherapists in Brighton and Sussex Trust \nrun exercise groups \nfor people with \nLTCs\n,\n in an aquatic physiotherapy pool\n. Services are\n access\ned\n through patient charities (National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society, Parkinson’s \nUK\n, Arthritis Care and the local Osteoporosis Society)\n. \nThis allows community-\nuse of the facility when not being used and generates income. \n&#xa0;\n5.              Obesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addressed&#xa0;5.1\n              \nO\nbesity is a contributing factor to a range of\n LTCs\n, including the physical stresses associated with obese bodi\nes and \ntheir\n impact on \npatient\n’\ns neuromusculoskeletal and ca\nr\ndiorespiritory systems, \nmovement, function and exercise-\nrelated risks.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n5.\n2\n              \nPhysiotherapists\n have a diverse skills set to identify strategies for the prevention and management of obesity\n, and\n the communication skills to build up trusting relationships required to address psychological and emotional barriers to taking up physical activity and accessing services. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nThe ‘Lose Weight Feel Great’ service in Ashton, Leigh and Wigan PCT\n offers general health and wellbeing services as well as specialist weight management, that people can self refer to. One-to-one care is delivered by physiotherapist or dietician. Activate, the physiotherapy-led obesity service in Tower Hamlets has in its second year seen childhood obesity declining against a rising nation trend, despite local deprivation\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n4\n              \nPhysiotherapists support the management \nand prevention \nof \nobesity \nthrough prehabilitation of individuals awaiting \nsurgery\n, \nand optimising post-\noperative recovery. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n5\n              \nT\nhe emerging practice of specialist bariatric physiotherapy\n \nprovide\ns\n an \nunderstanding of the whole spectrum of available weight management interventions \nto support\n patients \nto access\n the most appropriate services for them\n. \nThe CSP\n recommends\n the growth of \nbariatric \nphysiotherapy, and for the routine inclusion of physiotherapists within weight management teams. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long term conditions &#xa0;6.1\n              \nLiverpool City Council runs an ‘Exercise for Heath Scheme’ at \nits\n leisure facilities. \nIn 2008 the Musculoskeletal Therapy Team at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital \nstarted directly \nrefe\nr\nr\ning\n patients\n. \nAmong other benefits , this led to a reduction in\n outpatient phy\ns\niothera\npy appointments for total knee replacements. \n&#xa0;\n7.              The implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demand &#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nPhysiotherapy rehabilitation has a crucial role in keeping older people independent \nand\n restoring their independen\nce\n, reducing\n the numbers of people requiring social care support or residential care, or delay\ning\n the need for such support.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nEach year 35 per cent of over 65\n’s\n, and around 45 per cent of people over 80 fall in the community.\n \nAmong the over 75’s injury from falls is the leading cause of mortality. \nHalf of all people who have a fall will fall again in the next 12 months\n, \nincreas\ning\n mortality, rates of hospitalisation and institutionalisation.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nThe physiotherapy-led Glasgow Falls Prevention Programme sees nearly 175 patients a month in their homes to assess risk factors and intervene to modify these. Between 1998 and 2008 admissions due to falls in the home\n reduced by\n 32 per cent, \nfalls in residential institutions by\n 27 per cent and \nfalls in the street by\n nearly 40 per cent. Over the same period, the number of admissions for hip fractures decreased by 3.6 per cent (compared with an increase of nearly 2 per cent in England\n)\n.\n \n7.5\n              \nI\nnvestment in community physiotherapy services for older people is poor in many parts of England\n, and\n older people discharged from hospital and needing continuing rehabilitation, or those who have had a fall or a musculoskeletal injury at home, face long waiting\n times\n. This \nincreases\n dependency \non\n social services and \nthe NHS.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.              The interaction between mental health conditions and long term physical health conditions&#xa0;8.1\n              \nFour million people with long term \nphysical \nconditions also have a mental health problems\n.\n \nFor many people the experience of a \nLTC\n, including chronic pain, can result in \nanxiety, stress, \ndepression and other mental health issues. \nThere are psychological factors in behaviours around eating and exercise tha\nt can cause or exacerbate some LTCs\n. \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n              \nPhysiotherapists often work with psychologists on multidisciplinary teams for people with \nLTCs\n, and on mental health teams. \nAs the ‘physical expert’, the physiotherapist has a key role in enabling physical activity for health promotion, disease prevention and relapse, and makes a significant contribution in the delivery of lifestyle, weight management and wellbeing programmes. They can act as care co-ordinator supporting service users to access services as and when needed. By utilising a rehabilitation and recovery model physiotherapists work with service users to develop and facilitate strategies for the journey through wellbeing and recovery.\n&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \nAs part of \nmulti-professional team\ns,\n physiotherapists support care pathways\n and focus on the individual by: m\naximising service user independence\n; i\nmproving both physical and mental healthcare and the intrinsic link between the two\n; d\nemonstrating flexibility in their role to improve person-centred care\n; w\norking across sector and agency boundaries as part of integrated care pathways.\n&#xa0;\n9.              The extent to which patients are offered personalised services (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes)&#xa0;\n9.1\n              \nPhysiotherapists are ideally placed to support the personalisation agenda, using their broad skills set to empower patients to take responsibility for their own health and ach\nieve patient-\ncentred outcomes.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.2\n              \nS\nelf-referral to physiotherapy is an excellent example of a personalised service w\nhich leads to better outcomes. \nNHS Evidence has included self-referral to physiotherapy for musculoskeletal conditions in QIPP\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.3\n              \nBristol Community Health’s Community Neurology Service \naims\n to enable all \npatients with a long-\nterm neurologic\nal condition to \nmaintain independence at home. \nW\norking\n with\n NHS South of England and the Health Foundation they \nembedded\n the principals of patient centred care\n,\n shared decision making and patient self-management. Bristol Community Health now plans to introduce patient-held care plans for patients with \nlong-\nterm \nneurological \nconditions.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.4\n              \nThe Locomotor Service\n is a \ncommunity physiotherapy service\n, which is part of Homerton University NHS Trust\n and manages 89\n per cent\n of musculoskeletal patients in the community.\n The Locomotor service has a chronic pain interdisciplinary service within it, allowing a smooth pathway from initial physiotherapy assessment to interdisciplinary management. The Locomotor sets goals \nwith patients with chronic pain, to achieve personal function and quality of life goals. Patients are taught to manage persistent pain and flare-ups, and as a result visit \nA\n&amp;\nE and their GPs with pain less frequently. Patients are also taught how to manage their medicines. \n&#xa0;\n10.              Services provided for people with diabetes &#xa0;10.1\n              \nPhysiotherapy not only helps to prevent type 2 diabetes, it can also have a profound effect on managing and treating diabetes and its associated complications. \n&#xa0;\n10.2 \n              \nP\nhysiotherapists support patients to m\naintain good blood glucose control and achieve optimal body weight, through lifestyle advice and \nindividualised\n exercise plan\ns. \nPhysical activity has been shown to improve glycaemic control to levels comparable to pharmaceutical intervention and should be a fundamental component of the interventions \nto manage\n type 2 diabetes\n.\n10.3 \n              \nPhysiotherapists provide pain relie\nf\n and\n help \nprevent and manage \ndiabetic \nfoot problems through \nadvice, education and \ng\nait and posture training.\n \nP\nhysiotherapists manage a range of musculoskeletal conditions commonly seen within the diabetic population, including shoulder adhesive capsulitis, which occurs in up to 30% of patients with diabetes. \n10.4 \n              \nPhysiotherapy is an essential component of pre and\n post-amputation rehabilitation\n, supporting\n \npre-operative assessment; decisions around amputation level; preparation for surgery; \npain and wound management\n. It\n \nsupport\ns\n individuals \nto regain independence and social participation, \nthrough \nprosthetic \nrehabilitation and use of other adaptive equipment\n.\n11.              The definition of LTCs, and how this can provide more effective management of interventions necessary to bring about service change &#xa0;\n11.1\n              \nBecause chronic pain is not a singular disease entity or condition-specific, there is a tendency for this vital area to be ignored. \nT\nhose living with chronic pain have higher incidence of poor mental health, poor sleep, poor physical mobility, obesity and related illnesses. \nThey\n are also high consumers of health resources\n.\n We suggest cross referencing to the work of the National Pain Audit\n.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n \n \nPhysiotherapy works.
