"Supplementary written evidence from \nSanjeev\n \nAppiccharla\n (SLC 04\n1\n)\n&#xa0;\nThe Additional Written Evidence is a submission by the author in his personal capacity. The Additional \nEvidence presents examination of the \nWorst Case Accident Scenario of bus full of school children being struck by a\n high speed train at an Automatic Half Barrier Crossing\n.  \nThe Case study shows that the societal risk resulting from a hazardous event of a train crash into bus carrying passenger\n(s) or workers at Automatic Half Barrier or Full Barrier Crossings or Unmanned Private Crossings are real and fall into intolerable zone. \nThis submission is to be read together with the earlier \nAdditional Written Evidence and \nWritten Evidence SLC 015. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAuthor is British Naturalised citizen since 2006. \nAuthor‘s experience in system safety engineering research and experience is evidenced by the publications of peer reviewed publications at the Institute of Engineers and Technology ( IE\nT) International System Safety Conf\nerences in 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor was employed at RSSB from 2004 till 2010 as a System Engineer and deployed the System for Railway Investigations Methodology at RSSB\n for identifying hazards and analysing risks of few signalling systems\n. This methodology showed that RSSB Safety Risk Assessment \nand Decision Making Process \nsuffer from \nwhat is known as Group-think bias\n. \nThis finding was shared with the community of \nrailwa\ny \nengineers at the IET System Safety Conference October 2010. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor was awarded a Letter of Gratitude by the IET in 2009 for his contribution to the UK HSE Consultation Document,’’ Be Part of Solution, the UK HSE’s Strategy for the 21st\n Century’’. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis paper presents\n the results of analysis of \nspecific type \nof \nl\nevel crossing acc\nident \nusing \nthe System for Railway Investigations Methodology (SIRI)\n. An unpublished paper by author explored the risks of a bus-train \ncollision and established the fact operating in knowledge based behaviour using the widely accepted Skill-Rules-Knowledge Framework will lead to a \nfata\n bus and train collision due to the lack of effective measures to prevent such an occurrence\n (Appicharla,\n 2009)\n. \nIn this \nlatest \napplication, the\n SIRI Methodology explores two\n kinds of in\nterfaces. First, \ninterfaces between the hazard (release event of uncontrolled energy), the victims and the system of barriers and controls to prevent the uncontrolled energy\n f\nrom harming the victims. Second, interfaces between information item available from historical accident data and using Bayesian approach to risk assessment for updating the information item to verify biases inherent in subject matter experts risk analysis\n.\n Examination of these interfaces \nby the analyst \npresents a complete picture of human latent and active errors. \n&#xa0;\nThe aim of the study is to produce a\n comprehensive \ndiscussion of factors that can contribute to a \npotential sever\ne\n accident as \nusing the public\nly available data. The study results are submitted to the Transport Select Committee to inform their decision making\n process \non the theme of Safety at Level Crossings. \n&#xa0;\nThe study assumes that the actions \nof \nstaff and management of the UK Emergency service\ns of \nTrain Operating Company, British Transport Police, and NHS staff in rendering assistance to the affected members of public \nin the aftermath of accident \nare good and are not studied in this paper\n (Regulator, 2008)\n. \nFurther, author has noted that the en\nvironments in which these professionals practice their skills are not regular, and not conducive to experimental observations. \nAuthor has noted that BBC News has reported about certain NHS trust\n(s)\n \nare \nfailing to achieve \nthe \nduty of care expected of them. \nHowever, \nthese human errors \nthat occur \nin the area of medicine are not studied in this paper\n (News, 2013)\n \n&#xa0;\nIllusion of understanding is a term borrowed from Nobel Laureate, Daniel \nKahneman\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. The illusion of understanding is graphically illustrated in the enigmatic picture shown on the next page. \nOur perceptions are not stable can be learnt from the double perception resulting from viewing the picture of a woman in the Figure\n 1. This can be treated as a case in epistemic blindness. \nThe case of double perception is an active subjective of research for psychologists. \n&#xa0;\nAn\nother\n example of epistemic blindness is the legal case of Essex Level crossing Accident. Judge Turner accuse\nd Network Rail of \"corporate blindness\". He said: \"The Company unreservedly apologises for its failures which contributed to the deaths of these young girls.\" Network Rail, in part by itself and in part through its predecessor \nRailtrack\n, failed to ensure t\nhat the risks were properly assessed, controlled or managed.\" \n \nThe company concedes that the procedures or standards in place for conducting level crossing risk assessments before 2005 were deficient.\" (BBC News 2012)\n (Appicharla, 2012)\n.\n&#xa0;\nFigure \n1\n \nThe picture shows an old crone or a 19\nth\n century young girl, depending upon the perspective of person looking at the picture.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a lack of awareness on the part of professionals working in the railway world-wide that accident and \nrisk analysis form two parts of the same coin: successful \nS\nystem \nSafety M\nanagement. This lack of awareness is reflected in the way the formal requirements for accident and incident investigation are specified\n (RSSB, 2008)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe information structure \nin th\ne RSSB mandated Railway Group Standard \nimposed on the Infrastructure managers and railway undertakings to investigate accidents or incidents to establish\n the causes leading to the adverse or unwanted outcome are as under\n: \na) The events leading up to the a\nccident or incident \nb) The immediate cause(s) \nc) The underlying cause(s)\n&#xa0;\nIf the above information structure is applied to the Herefordshire Level Crossing Accident\n 2011\n, \nthen \nfrom the inspec\nti\non of the \nmap\n(\nFi\ng\nure \n2\n) \n drawn based upon the qualitative data provided by\n the RAIB Investigation Process reveals several \nerrors that cannot be categorised\n into\n the\n aforementioned three categories. \n&#xa0;\nThe location o\nf stop signal ML 42 is an action taking by project personnel in 2003 when fitting the Train Protection Warning Signal at the Stop Signal 42. This latent event does not appear in the RAIB Report. Further, all organisations like RAIB/ORR/RSSB/Network Rail/AT\nOC/TOC/IRSE/BTP maintain studied silence over this aspect. Is TPWS required to be fitted to all stop signals at the level crossings? If yes, then why was it fitted to a signal that was not provided with adequate stop-distance? If TPWS is required to be fit\nted at all stop signals then why it is not fitted at stop signals to prevent trains crashing into vehicles with barriers raised? \n&#xa0;\nAuthor does not have access to data which RAIB/RSSB/N\network Rail/ TOC possess \nand therefore is not in a position to answer th\nese questions. However, this igno\nrance does not prevent author \nexamin\ning\n the potential case for train-bus collision\n scenario\n. \n&#xa0;\nFigure \n2\n: Herefordshire Level Crossing Accident Event Causal Factor Analysis Diagram \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe\n SIRI\n analysis started with the recording of facts connected with the potential accident(s) \nof bus –train collision \nwhich is treated as the top event or loss event in the Management Oversight and Risk Tree \nDiagram\n \n(MORT\n). MORT \nforms an essential p\nart of \nthe hazard causal analysis stage of \nthe SIRI Methodology.\n A \nset of \nMORT \nquestions relates to \nexamination of \ndata analysis in relation to the \nidentified\n hazardous event\n and its analysis and strategy to deal with it\n. \n&#xa0;\nAccident\n(\ns\n)\n \ninvolving loss of li\nves \nreveal the efficacy and adequacy of active (preventative) or protective (passive) barriers. \nNear miss events are warning signs of impending disasters. \nHumanity has had to deal with false alarms as well as real alarms disguised as noisy signals in relat\nion to the impending danger. Decision theorists have spent their efforts to explain illusion of validity of our skills and knowledge learnt in one environment to their application in other environment. The concept of illusion of validity is discussed by No\nbel Laureate, Daniel \nKahneman\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n&#xa0;\nIt is a world- wide phenomenon that in the case of level crossings, system of signalling rules and operational rules for front-line staff and their users constitute active safety (barriers) system in the eyes\n of the executives\n,\n staff of the railway firms\n and the police and judiciary as well\n.\n The activity of organising, participating, sharing information on their experiences gives these people immense pleasure. Since the beginning of the 21\nst\n century, they have\n organised 12 such events. The latest one being that was organised at London in 2012. \nHere is the \nurl\n to the event. \nhttp://www.levelcrossing2012\n.org/papers/Pages/Paper\ns-and-Presentations.aspx\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAuthor is unaware of how statistics of accidental events have yielded the British Transport Constabulary the knowledge of underlying causes. \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe C\nhief \nConstable \npresented eight causes\n at the conference as under:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad \nvehicle driver error: 53%\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad accidents and stranded vehicles: 7%\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnvironment: 11% \nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVandalism: 4%\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEquipment: 1%\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad vehicle deliberate actions( including suicide):17%\ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSignaller, crossing keeper, and track worker error: 7%\nh)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSPAD, over speeding and train dr\niver error: &lt; 1% \n   \n&#xa0;\nPsychologists (belonging to industrial and social ergonomics domain), and economists (belonging to industrial and capital economics\n domain\n) who attend and study papers from such conferences share a common illusion of understanding of \ntrying to balance safety with productivity. \n&#xa0;\nThis illusion of understanding reveals itself \nagain \nwhen we try to count and aggregate different objects in a basket when looking at them. For example, it is easy to count two apples and three apples together a\nnd sum them up as five apples. But this delight in mathematics soon flounders into pain as soon as we spot two apples and three oranges together and repeat the same exercise again to arrive five ?? things in the ?? basket?? . \n&#xa0;\nAuthor learns f\nrom the \ninfor\nmation displayed on the UK\n HSE \nWebsite informing its readers \nBest Practice\n for Risk Management\n, risk assessment should cover both societal and individual risk. The GB Rail Industry excludes societal risk from its risk assessments was noted in the RSSB docu\nment published by author in a peer reviewed publication in 2010\n (Appicharla, 2010)\n. This is a latent human error in the GB Rail Industry Risk Management Processes. \nTwo accident cases of bus being trapped on the level crossings have come to author’s attenti\non. The case of \nEgham\n level crossing in 2000 where the bus driver managed to avert the accident by emptying the bus before it was struck. In 2003, a mini-bus carrying three workers was stuck. In 2012\n, \na video posted on the You tube shows how a double \ndecker\n bus got trapped. In another incident, the double \ndecker\n bus crashed into the barrier\n. \nThe BBC News informs that another bus driver was involved in a similar incident in Devon in November 2012\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe historical data till date since 2000s pertaining\n to the train –bus collisions world-wide is captured in the Table 1. \n&#xa0;\nDate \nCountry where the fatal event occurred\nNumber of fatalities\nStatus of Barriers \n 17\nth \nOctober 2000  \nEgham\n Level Crossing,  United Kingdom\n0 \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/976558.stm\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/17/transport.uk\n31\nst\n May 2001\nIndia \n38\n&#xa0;\n23\nrd\n August 2001\nUnited Kingdom \n0 \n3 \ninjuries, no data \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1505734.stm\nJune 2002 \nIndia \n32\nGates were closed\n20 Feb 2002 \nEgypt \n9\n&#xa0;\n9\nth\n July 2003\nUnited Kingdom \n3 \nUn-manned private crossing  \n20 September 2003\nPakistan \n27\n&#xa0;\n16 April 2004\nTurkey \n7\n&#xa0;\n27 April 2005 \nSri-Lanka\n35\nClosed Level Crossings ( Meaning not known) \n21 Aug 2006\nMexico \n21\n&#xa0;\n28 December 2006\nTurkey \n49\n&#xa0;\n2\nnd\n June 2008\nFrance \n5\n&#xa0;\n16\nth\n July 2008\nEgypt \n40\nNo data \n3\nrd\n September 2008\nArgentina \n17\n&#xa0;\n 14 Aug 2009\nRomania \n11\n&#xa0;\n25\nth\n Aug 2010 \nSouth Africa \n8\n&#xa0;\n12\nth\n October 2010 \nUkraine\n42 \n&#xa0;\n7\nth\n July 2011\nIndia \n3\n8\n&#xa0;\n30\nth\n July 2012\nPoland \n8\nNo barriers\nMarch 2012 \nArgentina\n0\nBus stranded\n12\nth\n October 2012 \nEgypt \n50\nBarriers did not lower\n19\nth\n September 2013 \nCanada \n6\nLowering \n11\nth \nOctober 2013\nUSA ( logging truck)\n1\n&#xa0;\n24 October 2013\nAustralia \n0\nAHB crossing, barrier lowered\nhttp://lxinfo.org/2013/10/25/perth-western-australia-train-collides-with-bus-on-level-crossing/\n30 October 2013\nKenya \n11\nNo information\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 1: Data collected from UK BBC and Reuters News Websites on 08 November 2013 18.46 hrs.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBased upon the data, the mean time between fatal events (Mean Time between Fatal Events, MTBFE) is calculated as the number of fatal events\n pe\nr \nreported\n \nperiod as a ratio of the total number of opera\nting hours in the reported \nperiod. \n&#xa0;\nMTBFE = Total number of fatal events in the Reporting Period / Total number of hours in the Reporting Period…………………………………………………..[1] \n&#xa0;\nMTBFE = 1\n9\n counts of fatal \ne\nvent / (13years\n*10,000\n hrs per year\n)\n (\napprox. \noperating h\nours\n per year) = .000\n192 \nhrs \nper annum. \n U\nsing a scientific notation, \nthe probability works out to \n1\n. 92 chances\n per 10,\n 000 opportunities\n. \nOr a chance of bus-tra\nin collision manifests in \nevery 5,200 \nyears. \nIf the process of bus –train interaction be considered as a managed one then the failure rate signifies that the process is a very defective one. \nThe que\nstion of whether the \nrisk \nfigure \nis acceptable is e\nxamined in the following text\n. \n&#xa0;\nDefinition: \nAverage, which is the arithmetic mean, and is calculated by adding a group of numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers\n. The average number of fatalities \nper accident works out to 17\n.7\n8\n. \n&#xa0;\nA\ns\n we are not aware of actual mechanisms \nunderlying\n such fatal events\n, the risk posed by assets like level crossing \nleading to fatal bus-train crash based upon the data \ncan be worked out as under \nas per the UK HSE definition of risk. \n  \n&#xa0;\nDefinition: Risk is the mathematical product of frequency o\nf and severity resulting from the fatal event. \n&#xa0;\nThus, \nrisk of fatal train –bus collision from the above \nworld –wide \ndat\na per\n annum \nfor the last decade \nworks out to 17.78\n*.\n000192=.00342\n.\n \nFrom RSSB perspective, \na worst case a\nccident with 25 fatalities per a\nnnum or more works out to \n(25*.0013) = .00325\n. \nThis data has been sourced from the data presented by RSSB to the UK Law Commission and can be found in the \npara\n 26 of the UK Law Commission’s Regulator Impact Assessment documents. \nThe\n risk f\nigu\nre computed by\n RSSB is lower\n fro\nm author’s risk estimate by \n4.96\n \n%\n taking author\n’s\n estimate as base figure\n (Young, Septmeber 2013)\n.  \n&#xa0;\nAuthor\n has assumed that RSSB’s aggregate risk estimate with\n 25 fatalities has the same statistical significance as\n the\n risk from a single collision event from risk manager’s perspective. However, socia\nl and political \nperspective, a single\n hazardous event \nof 25 fatalities \nhas different meaning as shown by public response to Ladbroke Grove \naccident\n (Wolff, 2002)\n. \n \nIn the ab\nsence of any data on the SIMIS and ALCRM databases, RSSB or Network Rail\n on bus and train \ncollision\n hazardous event \nwill\n \nmake it difficult\n for them to produce\n an \nrisk \nestimate.  \nRRUKA industry co-chair Colin Dennis (Director of Policy, Research and Risk, R\nSSB), and George \nBearfield\n (Head of Safety Knowledge and Planning, RSSB)\n have discussed the difficulty in predicting risk. In their address to the \nRRUK \naudience in 2012, they \nnoted that there is a lot of good data and information on past events, but that i\nt is not predictive and that the sheer length of processing time required means that it is at best giving an indication of the level of risk 6 months ago. The rail industry wants to have a better understanding of how risk might change in the future, so tha\nt we can plan for it and mitigate its effects, rather than just react to it with little time for thinking\n (RRUK, 2013)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nGiven the foregoing self confession, author is unable to accept the claim that RSSB Safety Risk Model is the most advanced in the worl\nd and its justification for the support it gives to the safety assurance when it cannot identify accident pre-cursors involving local and wider human factors\n (RSSB, 2013)\n.   \nMoreover,  author drew reader’s attention \nin October 2013 \nto the fact that ex Brit\nish Railway Boa\nrd members \nthought that mean time between failures of the Solid State Interlocking System is 1,000 times the age of the Universe at the time of Newton Junction Accident in 1991. The Newton Junction Accident Report is freely available on the \nRailway Archives website. \n&#xa0;\nNobel Laurea\nte Daniel \nKahneman\n cautioned \nagainst blaming experts for their failing to forecast accurately in an unpredictable world (pp241)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n.  As per Daniel \nKahneman\n claims for correct intuitions in an unpredicta\nble situation are self-delusional at best, sometimes worse. In the absence of valid- cues, intuitive “hits” are due to either luck or to lies. The rule to remember is that intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment\n. Author notes that this rule applies to author as well as \na \nrailway firm’s executives.  \n&#xa0;\nArthur Schopenhauer noted in the early 19\nth\n century, that firms have a tendency of issuing bank notes without making adequate capital provision(pp123)\n (Schopenhaeur,\n 1813/2006)\n. This tendency is still prevalent among firms in the 21\nst\n century has become public knowledge in 2008. Arthur Schopenhauer argued that both David Hume and Immanuel Kant did not comprehend the phenomena of cau\nsation correctly (pp106)\n (Schopenhae\nur, 1813/2006)\n. Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell argued\n \nArthur Schopenhauer did not refute inductive hypothesis advanced by David Hume in his treatise of History of Western Philosophy\n (Russell, 1945)\n.  \nHowever, with the Bayesian approach to accident and risk analysis by advanced by \nNobel Laureate Daniel\n \nKahneman\n, objection raised against Arthur Schopenhauer is no longer tenable. \nNobel Laureate Daniel \nKahneman\n draws our attention to the fact that an insti\ntutional risk manager acting as an agent on behalf of an organisation has to note the decision dilemma between intensely loss-averse moral attitudes and efficient risk management has no simple \nand \ncompelling solution (\npp342).  However, GB Rail industry exe\ncutives behave as if \nthey have a simple and compelling solution to the problem of harm arising at level crossings: educate \nand enforce rules and regulations on \nthe public. \n&#xa0;\nRoger Ford echoes author’s sentiments. \nRoger Ford writes in the latest issue of Modern Railways that the past president of IRSE, Francis How, explained \nwhy concept of “safety” went missing \n  \nfrom the Rail Technical Strategy Leadership’s document. Because Britain’s railways are among the safest \nin Europe and while it I always important to look for ways of improving safety that it is not our most important priority in terms of achieving a major improvement\n (Ford, November, 2013)\n. \nRoger Ford’s solution is to set up a new discipline called Transitio\nn Safety Management to deal with changes and how to maintain safety during those changes so that we do not lose safety on the way.  \n&#xa0;\nRisk assessor\ns and electronic \nengineers’\n constant refrain is that o\nf inherent uncertainty at the atomic level of matter.  \nLet us consider their objection. \nAtomic physicists are aware of the striking feature of the unstable particles in the atomic world is their stability. No excited state of atom is truly discrete, stationary and permanent. For example, an electron orbiting B\nohr’s orbit during a time period of 10\n-15 \nseconds lives in that state for a period of 10\n-8 \nseconds. During this period \nof 10\n-8 \nseconds, an electron goes through \nsome \n10\n7 \noscillations\n (pp46)\n (Merzbacher, 1961)\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nHowever, if we extend the \nNobel Laureate’s \nBohr’s model to the entire universe\n under the th\nesis that everything is produced \nby chance occurrence\n \nleads to \nan absurd conclusion\n.  \nWe cannot be actors and observe all results of our actions at the same time. \n \nBut risk assessors and institutional risk ma\nnagers continue to operate in the GB Railways as if we were living in an atomic world full of changes without any measure of certainty and level crossing users possess either dull intellects or are risk takers.  \n&#xa0;\nLet us consider the proposition that n\no one has experienced that a lotus flower can be produced by an apple tree and vice versa. \nArthur Schopenhauer recognised this fact\n, like G.W \nLibeniz\n, before him. \n \nArthur Schopenhauer drew attention to the fact that \napplication of \nthe empirical principle o\nf causation \nto anything apart from \nchanges in the states of empirical given world is an abuse of the \nprinciple (\npp110)\n (Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)\n. \nAuthor notes that analogous type \nof reasoning led Nobel Laurea\nte, Erwin Schrodinger, to formulate \nhis famous t\nhought\n experiment\n, Cat experiment. The consideration of Schrodinger Cat experiment can lead one to \nlearn how Schrödinger to sought\n support for \nhis beliefs in \nthe \nAdvaita\n Vedanta philosophy as stated in\n his 19\n43/\n44 talk\n (Schrödinger, 1943)\n. \n&#xa0;\nAnyone who \nwit\nnessed the proceedings of the Safety at Lev\nel Crossings Inquiry will not\n h\nesitate \nto praise the dignity of individual families\n whose members \nhave suffered harm at the level crossings. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf we assume that the above data is po\nssessed of some kind of \ncentral \ntendency then it is \npossible\n to work out \nthe mea\nn rate of fatalities and\n the confidence interval for the given data set.\n&#xa0;\nThe following definition\n of Confidence Interval is taken from the Microsoft Excel package licensed to use by Microsoft to the author. \nBooks on Statistics can also be consulted for verification. \n&#xa0;\nThe confidence interval is a range of values. Your sample mean, x, is at the centre \nof this range and the range is x ± CONFIDENCE.NORM. For example, if x is the sample mean of delivery times for products ordered through the mail, x ± CONFIDENCE.NORM is a range of population means. For any population mean, μ0, in this range, the probabilit\ny of obtaining a sample mean further from μ0 than x is greater than alpha; for any population mean, μ0, not in this range, the probability of obtaining a sample mean further from μ0 than x is less than alpha. In other words, assume that we use x, \nstandard_\ndev\n, and size to construct a two-tailed test at significance level alpha of the hypothesis that the population mean is μ0. Then we will not\n \nreject \nthat\n hypothesis if μ0 is in the confidence interval and will reject that hypothesis if μ0 is not in the confidence interval. The confidence interval does not allow us to infer that there is probability 1 – alpha that our next package will take a delivery time \nthat is in the confidence interval.\n \nTherefore, based upon the alpha of .05 and a three sigma deviation, the confidence interval for the data set of fatalities is computed to \na mean value of \n17.78 ± 1.75978\n. \nHowever, \nwe find that range of \nfatalities\n o\nbserve\nd fall outside this range\n. Therefore, the thesis of 3 sigma deviation is not true. We must seek an alternate figure to satisfy the dispersion in the data. Based\n u\npon the alpha of .05 and \n80\n sigma deviation, the confidence interval for the data set of fatal\nities\n is worked out to a mean value of \n17.78±\n31.35\n. \nAuthor is unable to comprehend how \nany risk assessor \ncan\n find any \nmeaningful \npattern \nof risk \nfrom such widely dispersed data of fatalities. \n&#xa0;\nNow, let us consider how our intuitive explanations \nmis\n-lead u\ns into thinking \nthat \nwe comprehend the causal factors correctly. \n&#xa0;\nThe application of \nBayes\n Rules is argued by Nobel Laureate, Daniel \nKahneman\n is chapter 16 of his treatise\n on human thinking (pp166-167)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n.  The case \nscenario\n involves a hit-r\nun accident in the night. First, information item is that there are 85% of the cabs operating in the city of Blue colour. The second information item is that eye witness identified the car as blue one. The third information item is that the witness reliabi\nlity in successfully identifying the two colours is 80% of the time. \n&#xa0;\nThe Box 1 below is an application of \nBayes’s\n rule to infer the changes in the \nenvironment\n. This example is drawn from the medical science paper published in Nature magazine in 2009\n (The\nodore J Perkins, 2009)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe prior probability of an un-observed random variable X, based upon the another random variable say Y is observed\n can be computed using the Bayesian rule\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn the case of hit and run scenario, the variable X takes a value of 0.15 \nbased upon the prior probability. Given the fact that an eye witness account has observed a blue colour, and the reliability of the eye witness to be 80%, we can update our prior pro\nbability information in the following way. \n&#xa0;\nThe visualisation of the above relation between two random variables X and Y is shown in Figure \n3\n.\n This depicts the four –fold pattern suggested by \nNobel Laureate Daniel\n \nKahneman\n(pp 310-333)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. Au\nthor \nas noted the \nNobel Laureate Daniel\n \nKahneman\n insight that decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes. This insight was revealed \nin form of \nthe subjective biases on the part of \nmembers of \nJap\nanese civil engineering society and executives of \nnuclear\n plant operator, supplier and other agencies whose actions contributed to the Japanese Nuclear Accident studied by author\n (Appicharla, 2013)\n. \n&#xa0;\nFigure \n3\n: Diagram showing conditional probabilities between two random variables X and Y\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nP(X = \nNot Green /\n Given Y) = P(Y\n= \nBlue\n/ X= \nBlue\n) \nP(X= \nBlue\n) /\n \nP(Y= Blue). \n&#xa0;\nThe probability of P(Y= \nBlue\n)\n= \n( Y = Not Green / X = Not Green)\n* P(X = Not Green) \n +  P( Y = Not Green / X = Green)\n* P( \n \nX = Green)\n              \n              \n              \n       = .15*.8 +.85*.2\n              \n              \n              \n       = .29\nP( Y = Not Green / X = Not Green)\n*\n \nP(X = Not Green)  \n = .15*.8 =.12\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, \nP(X = Not Green / Given Y= Blue) = .12/.29 = .0041 = 41%. This \nresult \nis different \nfrom 15% base rate information as well as 80% of the eye witness reliability\n available to us to form a risk judgement on the road accident. \n&#xa0;\nSimilarly, in\n the \ncase of level crossing accident, railway firm’s world-wide informs\n us that 90% of the times, the\n system of barriers and co\nntrols were ON\n \nie\n they were closed\n. \nBy this statement\n it\n is meant that the user of level crossing is presented with adequate audio-visual warning of impending danger in the form of a train. \nThis may be called as the variable X. \n&#xa0;\nEye witness accoun\nts inform us that bus driver \nran past the closed barriers. Assuming that the eye witness reliability is 90%, we can update our prior information \nin \nfollowing\n way \nusing the\n above examples. \n \n&#xa0;\nP( X = Barriers \n \nON\n) \n/ Y= Barriers \nON\n) \n= P (Y= Barrier \nON\n / X= Barrier OFF\n)*P (X= Barrier OFF\n) +\n P \n(Y\n = Barriers ON /X = Barriers ON\n) *P (X = Barriers \nON\n)\n \n= .9*.9+.1*.1= \n0.82. \nNow, \nP (Y= Barrier ON / X= Barrier ON)*P (X= Barrier ON) = .9*.9= .81\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, \nP(X = Barriers ON) / Y= Barriers ON\n) = .81/.82= 98.7%.  Thus, our prior information Rate has been updated from 90% to 98.7%. \n&#xa0;\nAt first sight, t\nhe above calculation seems to support the railway firms’ idea that railway firms are not responsible for the accidents conditioned on the fact\nual\n e\nye witness account attest to the idea that barriers were ON at the time of accident. However, \nif \nour information from eye witness \naccount \nis\n not \nreliable\n then railway \nfirms’\n \nclaim is \nnot tenable. For example, in the a\nbove historical data, only four\n cases o\nf \nthe \nbus crashes have eye witness accounts. If we use this figure, then our prior informati\non will get updated to = .9*.16/(.9*.16+..875)= 62%\n or \nfrom 90% to \n62\n%. \nThis subtle point is overlooked by many railway authorities\n and executives and staff of railway firms\n. \n An example of this\n lack of eye-witness account can be explained by the level crossing accident in 2001\n. \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe \nMoulinearn\n level crossing near \nBallinluig\n in Perth and Kinross\n has seen fatal accidents in 1953, 200\n1 and 2009. The 1953 and 2001 accidents were investigated and the gate operator and road user were blamed by railway firms British Railway Board and \nRailtrack\n respectively. It is not clear to author as to why RAIB failed to investigate the 2009 accident. \n&#xa0;\nThe previous quantitative risk assessments by Prof Stott’s review showed that 1.62 parts in 10,000 were admitted in UK HSE 1998 document\n. The QRA conducted in 1987 did recommend a conversion of automatic level crossings. In comparison with the above figu\nre, the risk figure worked out earlier as 1.92 parts in 10,000 require an intervention to improve the protection afforded to \nthe level\n crossing users. \nNobel Laureate Daniel \nKahneman\n insight that the structure of complex system involving many components wit\nh low failure rates may have overall high probability of failure due anchoring bias is relevant here(pp428)\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor has noted the fact researcher(s) in safety critical domain tend to disto\nrt risk communications. But author thinks that they are ready to consider the errors in reviewing published literature. \nFour\n examples known to the author is discussed below\n in relation to the current risk regulating regime\n. \n&#xa0;\nFirst, \nAuthor came across a pa\nper in 1998 that claims that unreliability (wrong side failures) of the Automatic Half barriers was less than 2\n% \n(\nHessami, March 1998)\n. The same percep\ntion prevails on the part of ex-HMRI personnel like Stanley Hall \nand train driving experts think that lev\nel crossing(s) never fail unsafely (Hall.S &amp; Mark, 2008). \n&#xa0;\nSecond, i\nn a review of the author’s published paper in 2010, the research conducted by DNV for the European Railway Agency has drawn conclusions contradicting author’s own conclusions (DNV, June 2\n013). The report can be accessed from the ERA website. The exact review is reproduced on the next page. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor had raised the issue with the European Railway Agency and DNV. The corrections suggested by author to the DNV and ERA are as the following via \nprivate communication on 29 October 2013.\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSynopsis of paper. The final sentence could be re-written to state that “This revealed situations in which a hazard arose for one \ndutyholder\n and the mitigation was not controlled by a separate \ndutyholder\n and hence\n in disaggregating the system level standards, measures such as these were lost”.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLearning points relevant to risk regulation regimes and implications for the EU rail risk regulation regime. It should be made clear that these are DNVs interpretation and no\nt the authors.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLimitations. It should be made clear that the author’s experiences relate to the UK rail environment between 2006 and 2010.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther references of note. SA requested that the reference to “Taking Safe Decisions” be removed as he had reference\nd it in the study in a negative sense (i.e. being critical of its findings) and by including it as a reference of interest it might be construed that the study supported it.\n&#xa0;\nAuthor is waiting \nfor \nthe European Railway Agency’s \nresponse to the above as DNV \nhas\n expressed their readiness to amend their research. \n&#xa0;\nSIRI 2010 paper had drawn attention to this fact stating that other statutory bodies like Highways Authority or Local Councils and private individuals are involved in the matter and these interfaces \nneed to be included in the Risk Equation. The UK Law Commission have published their recommendations to the Ministry of Transport in September 2013 to amend the law to allow duty of co-operation to be extended beyond the Infrastructure Manager and Railway \nUndertaking to other statutory authorities as well to facilitate faster closure of level crossings and bring all level crossings to be regulated by the UK Health and Safety at Work 1974 Act.\n&#xa0;\nThird, if the UK Law Commission has recommended that the law\n on level crossings be reformed in September 2013 to align with the UK HSE Best Practice for Risk Management, then how can the GB Industry claim that they were complaint with the law as the law as it applies t\no the level crossings itself found to be incons\nistent and complex to apply? \n&#xa0;\nFourth, t\nhe \naccident investigator \nand train driver account of the safety critical incident are not reliable\n due to hindsight bias\n in operation\n. The observations of accident and train driver’s information \ncannot be included in\n the Bayesian inference process as the random variable X is unobservable\n in the risk analysis\n (Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThus, from Bayesian application to risk assessment(s), it is impo\nrtant to recognise five\n facts. First\n, it is possible to use two information i\ntems through the Bayesian Rule to infer about the unobserved random variable. Two, reliability of the eye witness accounts must be known beforehand. \n \nThird, for truly random process, the probabilities\n from relative frequency interpretation\n cannot exceed 50\n%. \n \nFourth, we are not intuitive Bayesians. Fifth, we become \nLaplacians\n due to operation of hindsight bias. \n&#xa0;\nApart from the \npotential \naccident analysis, the study has shown that research in the molecular systems biology argue that Bayesian approach is relevant in the \ndecision making area of risk analysis. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe\n \nchances of\n a train-bus collision increase with the following conditions\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe proximity of schools, farms, structure of roads leading to the AHB/ABCL and Unmanned Private Crossings afford chances of greater harm.  Apart from the long term measures of replacing lev\nel crossings with suitable replacement like bridges etc, intermediate measures to safe-guard against loss of protection can be made. \n&#xa0;\nAs reported by the Telegraph report in 2012\n, it is \nclear,\n as ruled by the \nMagistrate, it\n is better to mandate \na clear \nvehicle \nspace be afforded to the bus drivers\n ( and others as well)\n before they follow the traffic onto the crossing space. \n \nWith this measure specified for the bus drivers, it is also mandatory that TPWS be installed at the stop signal to prevent a train e\nntering the crossing space when the barriers are raised. Modifications to the signalling systems and Highway Agency’s Rules and Regulations may be necessary as a result. \nUnwanted occurrences like increased costs of signalling projects, \n costs of civil engi\nneering projects, \nwaiting times at the level crossings, reduction in BTP police to monitor level crossings after a period \netc are tasks for economists and lawyers to argue over and is beyond the data available to the author. \n&#xa0;\nThe idea that a vehicle stopp\ning ahead behind the level crossing barriers \ncan be treated as a barrier \nadvanced by Professor Stott’s Review \ndoes not accord\n with the UK HSE Best Practice for Risk Management. This practice calls for designing safety into the system. \nImproving crash worth\niness of train vehicle from the collision with a vehicle on the level crossings may be appealing to few engineers and organisations\n. But this method of \npassive barrier system is not so appealing if the crashing event can be prevented in first place by othe\nr engineering measures. \n&#xa0;\nIn all the accident studies studied using the SIRI Methodology, author found that \na stakeholder\n in the form of s\nuppliers, operator, and /or a researcher \nhad a premonition of danger and made efforts to stop the operations \nor limit \nthe damage\n. The examples of Fukushima 2011, Space Shuttle Challenger 1986 illustrate this point\n and refute the Charles Per rows Normal Accident Theory\n (Perrow, 1984)\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Additional Written Submission examined the worst case accident scenario \nof bus-train collision \nusing the SIRI Methodology taking into account insights generated by Nobel Laureate Daniel \nKahnman’s\n treatise on human thinking about rare events and risk as\nsessments. The case study showed that the potential accident has a high probability of failure of 1.92 parts in 10,000   and in comparison to the UK HSE 1987 study that revealed a risk of 1.6 parts in 10,000\n. The\n \n1987 \ndocument called for improvement in the\n working of level crossings. \nThis study complements other Submissions made already. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor appeals to the members of Transport Select Committee to introduce reforms to improve protection afforded to road users keeping in view the various types of road us\ners. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nThe video can be accessed here: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOLjgL4SVz8\n The news item can be accessed here: \nhttp://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/9984976.Bus_in_railway_crossing_drama/?ref=ar\n The news item can be accessed here\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-19820950\n URL can be accessed here : \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1318220.stm\n \nURL: \nhttp://paulthorn.co.uk/healthandsafety/Risk%20Management/Quantified%20Risk%20Assessment%20HSE.pdf\n URL: \nhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/researc\nh/rrpdf/rr359.pdf\n URL: \nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9646593/The-moment-a-bu\ns-driver-got-stuck-squeezing-through-level-crossing.html\n"
