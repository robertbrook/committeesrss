"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Cycle to Work Alliance (the Alliance) (CYS0044)\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary:–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission is made by the Cycle to Work Alliance\n (the Alliance)\n, on behalf of \nits\n members – Cyclescheme, Cycle Solutions, Evans Cycles and Halfords. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur comments are\n focussed on how the cycle to work sche\nme can encourage people to take-\nup\n cycling,\n \nthus creating the critical mass to make \nthe transport mode\n safer. Additionally, we look at the role the scheme has in making vital safety equipment \nmore affordable for commu\nters who cycle to work. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe submission argues that better governmental promotion of the scheme could help increase up-take, \nand improve the safety of cycling for Britons. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nalso consider the role employers can play in increasing the safety of their staff who commute \nto work by bike. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend the \ncommittee\n calls on \nGovernment to ensure the scheme is adequately promoted, so as to increase the number of cyclists on the road\n and therefore improve their safety. \n&#xa0;\n1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction to the cycle to work scheme:–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe cycle to work scheme is a government-supported, tax-efficient and salary-sacrificed employee benefit that provides a mode through which employers can encourage their worke\nrs to take up cycling.\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough the scheme, employers loan bicycles and safety equipment to their employees as a tax-exempt benefit for the purpose of commuting to and from work. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the end of the loan period, the employer may choose to give their employee\n the option of purchasing \nthe bike and the equipment.\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scheme can save employee\ns\n up to 42% o\nf\n the cost of safety equipment\n. By \ndoing so, the \nscheme \nincentivises riders to purchase the equipment that wil\nl make their cycle to work safer\n. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo date, over 55\n0,000 individuals have taken part in the scheme, which also involves over 2,220 bike retailers \nand\n over\n \n32\n,000 employers.\n \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough supportive of the scheme, Government could do more to aid its promotion\n and remove barriers to entry\n,\n \ntherefore delivering g\nreater levels of sustainable transport and improving public health. \n&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncouraging cycling &amp; changing behaviours–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key element of the cycle to work scheme’s effectiveness in improving\n cycling\n safety is\n through\n increasing the critical mass of cyclists on the roads. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs CTC, the national cycling charity notes\n,\n increasing cycling uptake is the surest way to improve safety. According to research, the Netherlands saw a 45% increase in cycling from 1980-2005 and a co\nrresponding 58% decrease in cyclist fatalities\n. Overall, \nthe CTC\n suggest that doubling the amount of cyclists on the road can reduce casualties by a third. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith this in mind, the cycle to work scheme is a proven mechanism for increasing cycling uptake, a\nnd therefore improving cycling safety.\n In the first half of 2013, industry data suggests \nthat the scheme encouraged over 44,000 commuters to start cycling to work by bicycle.\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch conducted by the Cycle to Work Alliance shows that 54% of scheme users \ndid not cycle to work up before they joined the initiative.\n Similarly, 72% said they would not have bought their bike and safety equipment had they not been offered through the scheme.\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe financial savings that commuters make on the cost of their bike an\nd the safety equipment through the scheme is the fundamental aspect in their decision to sign up to the scheme. 98% of scheme users say that the\nse savings were either important or very important in their decision to join the scheme, and start cycling to wo\nrk. \n&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinancial savings &amp; employer involvement–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey to the positive impact that the cycle to work scheme has on cycling safety is the \nfinancial savings that scheme users make on the cost of safety equipment.\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough its tax efficiency, the scheme sees users\n saving up to 42% on the cost of such equipment. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly, a\nll members of the Cycle to Work Alliance have discussions with new users about the need for safety equipment, and the risks run if they chose not to wear such products. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the nature of the scheme as an employee benefit, it \nalso \nplays an important role in opening up the dialogue between employers and their staff on cycling and cycling safety. \n&#xa0;\n4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConclusions &amp; recommendations–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe cycle to work scheme is a Government-back\ned initiative that encourages people to commute to work by bike through making cycling and safety equipment more affordable.\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy doing so, the scheme increases the critical mass of cyclists on the road, which is arguably the most \neffective way to improve th\ne safety of cyclists. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditionally, the scheme increases the affordability of cycling safety equipment, and all users are encouraged to invest this in this upon their initial interactions with providers of the cycle to work scheme. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, the scheme is crucial in opening the dialogue between employers and employees on the merits of cycling, and related safety issues. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Alliance recommends that the Committee encourages Government to do more to promote the scheme, so as to improve\n cycling safety more generally. With the recent devolution of public health and sustainable transport responsibilities to local authorities, there is currently a concern that the scheme is not being adequately promoted. \n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Committee should call on Government – particularly the Department for Transport – to ensure that local authorities and employers are well aware of the scheme and its benefits to both users and improving cycling safety more generally. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n CTC\n              \n2007\n              \nSafety in Numbers \nhttp://www.ctc.org.uk/sites/default/files/ctc_safety_in_numbers_0.pdf\n Cycle to Work Alliance \n              \n2013\n              \nThe Green Way to Work \nhttp://cycletoworkalliance.org.uk/n\news_41_2538974460.pdf\n"
