[[[ Animal Rescue Conservation Centre]]]&#xa0;As an Animal Welfare Charity we are sometimes called into situations that people have bought Primates without having taken into account fully the practicalities. On the other hand we have lots of people keeping Primates in the U.K. who do so in a manner outlined in the Guidelines.The majority of Primate Species rightfully come under the “Dangerous Wild Animals Act”, these species are policed by the Licensing Authorities (Local Councils), and this provision seems in most part to work very well.However the major problems seem to be with those Primates that do not fall under the “Dangerous Wild Animals Act”, species of Callithrix for instance are offered for sale on the internet and in other retail establishments (some controlled by Pet Shop legislation). It is these smaller Primate Species that seem to fall through the net of regulation.If these species were regulated in the same way that the “Dangerous Primates” are, as used to be the case, then most of the nightmare would be done away with. It is also common knowledge that less people would keep these animals if they were regulated in this way.A great concern to Welfare Organisations such as ours is that if an outright ban came into place then a lot of the keeping of such species would be driven underground along with large numbers of animals being “dumped” into the various Animal Rescue Centre’s throughout the country.If a change in law was deemed to be needed, as some organisations would have you consider, then some sort or amnesty would need to be involved so that animals already in private hands could continue to live out their days as they are, otherwise the Welfare Sector could become awash with unwanted animals.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
