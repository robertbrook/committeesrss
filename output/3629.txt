[[[The new treatment of the value time is profoundly unsatisfactory]]]

[[[. It neither ]]]

[[[properly ]]]

[[[discusses the issue of working on trains, nor provides ]]]

[[[the evidence ]]]

[[[to justify the new approach. ]]]

[[[It def]]]

[[[ies]]]

[[[ common sense – why would businesses be willing to pay as much to reduce ]]]

[[[already ]]]

[[[productive time as unproductive time? The]]]

[[[ proportion of business passengers using HS2 has very substantially increased (from about 28% to 38%), ]]]

[[[more than offsetting the reduction in unit values.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Conclusion]]]

[[[: ]]]

[[[The ]]]

[[[crowding benefits are not ]]]

[[[realistic. De-crowding benefits are attributed to HS2 ]]]

[[[when the real alternative (51m]]]

[[[It is surprising that despite all the reviews of the business case there is still no provision ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]November 2013&#xa0;                             The Economic Case for HS2: Summary of Key Changes to the Economic Case since August 2012, DfT ‘…we have undertaken a comprehensive review of the evidence on values which have been estimated using different academic approaches. This shows that the values we use for business travel time savings lie very comfortably in the middle of the range suggested by other research evidence. The Department has therefore concluded that these values are a suitable representation of businesses’ willingness-to-pay for quicker journeys and take appropriate account of the extent to which people work on trains. ‘ Strategic Case page 34 section 89 Box 1, Page 6 of draft webtag 3.5.6, October 2013 The National Passenger Survey gives the proportion of business travellers on Virgin trains to be 29%, page 31 of the Virgin Trains Spring 2013 survey Table 7 page 20.

The Review examined prior KPMG and Spatial Economic Research Centre (SERC) work that used an alternative “GVA assessment” approach. The ITS review concluded:‘….. it remains clear that further work on methods and techniques will be needed beforeGVA assessment could become part of ‘mainstream’ appraisal.’ Web tag 3.5.4 para 2.1.4. states that the Monetised Costs and Benefits exclude any wider economic impacts; although, wider economic impacts can be included in the Appraisal Summary Table.
