default3. Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? default&#xa0;
defaultAGCAS believes that there is probably insufficient congruence between efforts directed at NEETs and those which could be deployed to move graduates from “underemployment” into graduate level employment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDestinations data and follow up surveys conducted by AGCAS member services in the UK (representing 135 HE institutions) tend to show that significant numbers of new graduates move into non graduate roles as continuations of part time roles undertaken whilst studying or as part of a lifestyle over career choice in which staying in their university city in any job which will pay the rent is chosen over pursuit of a graduate level job which may require relocation. The latter can apply to both those who feel tied to the locality having studied close to home and those traditional “going away to college” students who are very keen to stay in the university city to which they moved from their family home. In either case underemployed graduates can create a blockage to entry level jobs, which in turn can exacerbate youth unemployment. Thus, initiatives which help graduates to move into graduate level work can have a dual benefit.
default&#xa0;
defaultSurveys (at University of Leeds for example) have shown that clarity of career direction is probably the single most important barrier to employment success for recent graduates. In England, the diminishing visibility of public secto
defaultr careers guidance
default (as distinct from skills and work experience) for more able young people prior to university reduces awareness and understanding of the crucial importance of well-informed career choice in finding a route into the opportunity structure and creating employment success. Initiatives which bolster graduate careers guidance are at least as important as those designed to provide work experience. AGCAS, through its member services - the graduate careers guidance experts, would be well-placed to respond to any such initiative.
default&#xa0;
defaultInterventions which encourage businesses to locate away from national capital cities and into less advantaged regions could also be considered in this context. The choice for many UK graduates can seem to be between a graduate level job in London (or to some extent another UK or EU capital) and a non-graduate job in either their home area or university town or city. Consideration could be given to measures which might reduce with pressure on the infrastructure of London and other major capital cities and create economic growth in outlying UK / EU regions.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother issue in the graduate labour market throughout the EU is the prevalence of unpaid internships which, in extreme cases, can lead to direct substitution for paid employment and which certainly mitigate against social mobility and equal opportunities to graduates from UK regions (as many are in or near London, where few graduates from more remote regions have access to affordable accommodation) In the UK, the biggest problem is a lack of enforcement of existing legislation. However, in other parts of the EU, there is a lack of legislation.

default5. How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? 
default&#xa0;
defaultSubsidised graduate placements work very effectively, particularly when breaking down barriers with SMEs who often fail to recognise or understand the benefits a graduate can bring their organisation. Newcastle University, for example, is currently delivering an ERDF programme called Graduate Apprentices and more than 90% of graduates recruited on a three month subsidised placement are retained by their employer at the end of their placement. As well as creating jobs, programmes such as this, and, for example,  Unlocking Cornish Potential in the South West, derive real benefits from operating at a local or regional level, such as in advising employers on competitive graduate salaries for their region and industry, rather than taking national figures. Initial subsidies are crucial to these programmes in the first instance.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ECIF (Economic Challenge Investment Fund) launched by BIS/HEFCE in England as an anti recessionary measure in 2009/10 was essentially billed as a small business support initiative with a focus on workforce development, but a substantial and particularly successful element was that devoted to graduate internships. In the Yorkshire and Humber region, a consortium of AGCAS members, led by the University of Leeds Careers Centre demonstrated through timely, high volume delivery, that providing the funding support directly to HE careers services, with their connections to both target audiences of local businesses and unemployed graduates was a recipe for success.
default&#xa0;
defaultAllocating funding to existing, successful activities as well as new initiatives, should also be considered. For example, in many regions of the UK, higher education institutions are collaborating in the delivery of job portals for graduates, providing an easy way for businesses in the region to access graduates (eg 
defaultwww.gradsouthwest.com
default). These services are free for employers to use and give them access to talented, well-educated job seekers. For the students and graduates these portals provide access to local opportunities, many with SMEs, as well as insight into jobs they might not otherwise have considered, important given the competition for traditional graduate roles and the ever-changing labour market.  Allocating funds to help successful projects to continue would benefit regional economies as well as individual businesses and graduates and would be preferable to always favouring new, experimental initiatives over those with excellent track records.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn area of growing interest among students and graduates is self employment and funding here could help graduates grow new businesses with a view to employing others. Funding here could be utilised for start up advice and business incubation space targeted at graduates. It should be noted that in many cases HE careers services are in a good position to link business start up support to high quality careers guidance, making for well informed realistic choices and high potential for business sustainability. AGCAS is well-placed to co-ordinate such activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the most wasteful aspects of numerous initiatives in both graduate employment and enterprise is the failure of the central agencies and/or retained third parties to do any research on what is already being delivered by HEIs. This can lead to major inefficiencies based on misunderstanding. AGCAS and its member services are extremely well placed to help agencies to avoid this oft-repeated pitfall.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8. How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? 
defaultSocial media have an important part to play in modern job search and employability. However, job seekers often need to be trained in digital literacy as it applies to the employment market. With this support, social media can be a powerful tool in aiding social mobility. Without it, social media can simply be a tool for the already well connected to be even better connected. Many AGCAS member services have well developed e-guidance systems – see comments under 3 above.
