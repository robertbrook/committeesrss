[normal]RMP 09[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by Consumer Futures[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About Consumer Futures[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Consumer F
[normal]utures (previously Consumer Focus)
[normal] is the statutory consumer watchdog 
[normal]for 
[normal]postal services 
[normal]across the 
[normal]United Kingdom, of energy across Great Britain and of water
[normal] in Scotland. It has a wider role in applying learning and insight across other regulated markets.
[normal] 
[normal]We use evidence, analysis and argument to put consumers at the heart of policy-making and market b
[normal]ehaviour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Consumer Futures 
[normal]works
[normal] to protect and promote the interests of consumers in 
[normal]regulated markets
[normal]. Our role is not only to consider current issues facing consumers, but to look ahead to the potential for problem
[normal]s
[normal] or opportunities 
[normal]and 
[normal]identify action to be taken
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the designated universal service provider, 
[normal]Royal Mail provides an essential service to consumers and businesses across the UK. The arguments for private or public ownership must be judged in terms of what is the best way to
[normal] maintain and improve that service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whether in private or public ownership, consumers and businesses needs for value and 
[normal]quality services from Royal Mail are the same.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Postal services across the UK face significant challenges from the
[normal] incre
[normal]asing use of digital technology;
[normal] the consequential reduction in letter volu
[normal]mes and increase in parcel mail;
[normal] 
[normal]and the changing needs of users.
[normal] Growth
[normal] in market competition presents 
[normal]risks and opportunities for Royal Mail. Whether in the public or privat
[normal]e sector, understanding and responding to consumer needs and changing behaviour will be crucial to effectively competing in the market and sustaining a universal postal service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]OFCOM’s primary duty, 
[normal]to secure the universal postal service, should not be c
[normal]onflated with protecting the financial position of Royal Mail. It will be nece
[normal]ssary to ensure that Royal Mail 
[normal]provides an efficient service
[normal]. 
[normal]OFCOM must apply rigorous monitoring and assessment processes to ensur
[normal]e consumers are not left liable 
[normal]for the price
[normal] of corporate failure. Exercising its duties in securing the universal service; promoting competition; assessing affordability; and ensuring vulnerable consumers, especially in remote and rural locations, have access to this essential service is incumbent 
[normal]upon OFCOM regardless of the nature of the ownership of Royal Mail.  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Royal Mail’s 
[normal]contractual 
[normal]relationship with Post Office Ltd (POL) is only one facet of an environment in which 
[normal]POL will 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]need to be able to offer commercially competitive pr
[normal]oducts and services which meet the needs of consumers
[normal], at a time and place of their convenience
[normal].
[normal] The contract between Royal Mail and POL is not altered by any change in Royal Mail ownership.  
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Until relatively recently, Royal Mail had enjoyed a dominant position in the 
[normal]postal services
[normal] market which provided a relatively secure revenue base for its operations. However, full liberalisation of the mail market in 2006, electronic substitution 
[normal]of letters and changes in the composition of mail volumes have altered the landscape
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Upstream competition, where mail is collected and sorted by an access operator
[normal] and then delivered via Royal Mail
[normal], has grown at a far greater rate than end-to-end
[normal] competition
[normal] (
[normal]collection, sorting and 
[normal]delivery
[normal] by another postal operator
[normal]). In 2011, 
[normal]postal regulator, 
[normal]OFCOM noted that around 40 per cent of mail volumes, excluding parcels, were currently 
[normal]collected
[normal] and sorted
[normal] 
[normal]by access operators but delivered by Royal Ma
[normal]il. This was in sharp contrast with end-to-end competitors who delivered less than 1 per cent of letters and large letters
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite 
[normal]TNT UK commencing, in April 2012, the expansion of its 
[normal]access operation to 
[normal]offer its customers end-to-end 
[normal]services 
[normal]in 
[normal]West London
[normal],
[normal] with reported delivery volumes as of
[normal] December 
[normal]2012 
[normal]at an average of 345,000 items per week
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]nformation provided by PostNL 
[normal]to OFCOM, to facilitate its analysis of end-to-end competition, highlights that, due to cash constraints, it would need
[normal] €50 to €80 million of external investment in order to be able to complete a full rollout of end-to-end services in the UK
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no
[normal] information 
[normal]available 
[normal]publicly 
[normal]identifying
[normal] if and when Post NL might realise 
[normal]its
[normal] desired investment and ambition
[normal] for
[normal] a
[normal] full rollout of end-to-end services in the UK
[normal].
[normal] There is, however, no expectation from the regulator that those plans will be achieved in the short to medium term with
[normal] OF
[normal]COM
[normal] stat
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]‘under current projections TNT Post’s market share is expected to be 
[normal]low in the early years of its [business] plan’
[normal] and that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as the 
[normal]business model has yet to be tested
[normal], it is
[normal] therefore 
[normal]‘
[normal]necessary to recognise there is a degree of uncertainty around TNT Post’s business plan’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While e
[normal]nd
[normal]-
[normal]to
[normal]-
[normal]end competition has a 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]greater impact on Royal Mail revenues 
[normal]than access competition – with 
[normal]Royal Mail 
[normal]still 
[normal]retain
[normal]ing some 
[normal]85 to 90% of revenue
[normal]s
[normal] from access mail
[normal] - 
[normal]competition 
[normal]across
[normal] the postal market can provide 
[normal]distinct 
[normal]benefits to 
[normal]consumers
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he initial competitive entry 
[normal]by TNT
[normal] UK
[normal] 
[normal]has already demonstrated 
[normal]one of the
[normal] benefits of competition
[normal] – Royal 
[normal]Mail 
[normal]recently 
[normal]announced significant investment in barcode technology which will allow business customers to electronically track delivery of their le
[normal]tters
[normal], 
[normal]a value-added service originally offered by
[normal] TNT UK in its West London operations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Value-added, competitive and innovative products which appeal to business customers, and therefore helps 
[normal]retain
[normal] 
[normal]or win
[normal] their custom, assists in securing the financial
[normal] viability of a universal service for residential and business consumers alike. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Decline in mail volumes is well documented. In 2010, the updated review
[normal] of the postal services sector carried out by Richard Hooper for the Department for Business, Innovati
[normal]on 
[normal]and Skills noted that in 2005 the average Royal Mail daily mail bag contained 84 million addressed letters, packets and parcels but that by 2010 this was down to 71 million items. The following year, OFCOM identified that 
[normal]the UK postal sector had seen the steepest decline in volumes of any 
[normal]European country, falling by 25% since 2006, with Royal Mail volumes now approximately 62 million items per day
[normal].
[normal] The updated review by Richard Hooper also notes that 
[normal]‘Royal Mail predicts
[normal] a further decline in Royal Mail addressed inland letter traffic volumes of over 20% between 2010/11 and 2015/16’
[normal].
[normal] Royal Mail’
[normal]s 
[normal]recent 
[normal]preliminary results for 2012-2103 report an 8% drop in addressed letter volumes from 2011-2012 
[normal]with 
[normal]some
[normal] 14,079 million 
[normal]addressed letters 
[normal]handled by Royal Mail in 
[normal]year
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Royal Mail has nevertheless recorded an increase in parcel volumes and revenues. Figures from 
[normal]the 2012-13
[normal] preliminary 
[normal]results
[normal] show
[normal] an increase from 1,016m parcels 
[normal]in 2011-12
[normal] to 1,081m
[normal] parcel
[normal]s
[normal] in 2012-13
[normal], 
[normal]an increase of 65m.
[normal] Parcel revenue figures 
[normal]depict
[normal] a 13% year-on-year increase between 2011-12 and 2012-13, rising to some £2,979m of the total £7,766m UK Parcels, International &amp; Letters (UKPIL) business. 
[normal]While not sufficient to offset decline in other mai
[normal]l volumes, internet retail distribution has provided positive growth for parcel carriers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rapid change and innovation is however taking place in both the mode of delivery for some retail products which had contributed to growth in parcel volumes – such a
[normal]s books, audio &amp; video content which are being digitally downloaded
[normal] or streamed
[normal] in ever greater numbers – and in providing greater convenience of delivery for other, non-digitisable, products – such as clothing
[normal] and e
[normal]lectronic equipment
[normal] – with the expansion
[normal] of click &amp; collect services and pick-up point services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While parcel volumes and revenue have increased for Royal Mail in this more competitive sector of the 
[normal]postal
[normal] market, innovations and changing consumer behaviour in relation to the delivery of retai
[normal]l products purchased online presents further risks to Royal Mail’s delivery volumes, which could in turn weaken growth or reduce income or profits in 
[normal]delivery
[normal] revenues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The capability, capacity and drive to innovate are critical components for any market 
[normal]player looking to offer a consumer-focussed postal service. Retaining postal communication and delivery as a credible choice in an increasingly digital world also requires the availability of value-for-money, affordable products and services which meet the
[normal] needs and demands of consumers and business customers.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our research report, Sense and Sustainability
[normal], interrogated residential and SME consumers’ needs from the postal service over the medium-term. We found that residential consumers expect greater innovation in terms of the delivery options for packets and parcels, including extending the number of pick
[normal] up points, longer opening hours and more convenient locations – including pre-specified locations such as pubs or corner shops. SME consumers would like to see a range of delivery options offered, as is currently the case with all major courier companies,
[normal] such as timed deliveries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It will be incumbent upon Royal Mail to be able to respond to these challenges in order to continue to fulfil its role as the designated universal service provider. It will need to offer innovative, cost-effective products and 
[normal]delivery solutions and maintain a dynamic approach 
[normal]to a changing market and evolving consumer needs. Failure to adapt and respond to these challenges could have an adverse impact on the sustainability of the universal postal service and the ability of Roya
[normal]l Mail to deliver that service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Royal Mail is subject to a declining market share of a declining 
[normal]letters 
[normal]market. Against this backdrop, Government identified securing a sustainable universal postal service as th
[normal]e central tenet of its postal policy and primary duty of the postal services regulator. Adopting the recommendations of the Hooper review, Government enacted the strategy it would employ and actions it would take in pursuit of this objective via the Postal
[normal] Services Act 2011, including specifically allowing for private investment in Royal Mail; the transfer of the historic R
[normal]oyal Mail pension 
[normal]deficit to Government; and reform of the regulatory framework.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Postal Services Act, 2011, also explicitly sets o
[normal]ut the minimum services that must be included in a universal postal service. The requirements set out in 
[normal]Section 31 of 
[normal]the Act are for provision of:

[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Royal Mail
[normal], as the sole designated universal service provider,
[normal] 
[normal]is obliged to provide 
[normal]these services as a minimum. It
[normal]s 
[normal]continuing 
[normal]ability to do
[normal] so
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]a significant consideration for OFCOM 
[normal]and was an important feature of the debate surrounding recent legislative a
[normal]nd regulatory changes.
[normal] 
[normal]The new regulatory framework
[normal] 
[normal]specifically p
[normal]e
[normal]r
[normal]mits
[normal] OFCOM
[normal] 
[normal]to take 
[normal]proportionate 
[normal]steps to 
[normal]protect the 
[normal]sustainability
[normal] 
[normal]of the universal service or 
[normal]address any “unfair”
[normal] financial burden on a universal service provider
[normal] in its provision
[normal] of the universal service
[normal].
[normal] It should however be noted that there is no definitive analysis
[normal] from OFCOM
[normal], as yet, as to whether 
[normal]provision of 
[normal]the universal postal service is a net cost 
[normal]or net profit for
[normal] Royal Mail
[normal] or 
[normal]any assessment of the
[normal] indirect impact 
[normal]of providing the universal postal service 
[normal]on the 
[normal]profitability of Royal Mail
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]M
[normal]easures available 
[normal]to OFCOM
[normal] to protect the universal service, 
[normal]should that
[normal] be deemed necessary, 
[normal]include
[normal]:
[normal] imposition of General Universal
[normal] Service Conditions (GUSC) on other end-to-end competitors
[normal] 
[normal]– conditions such as 
[normal]an
[normal] 
[normal]obligation to deliver a minimum 
[normal]number of days 
[normal]per week to each address
[normal] in the area of operation or imposition of a minimum geographic coverage requirement on a given operator;
[normal] the creation of a Universal
[normal] Service c
[normal]ompensation fund
[normal] – where contributions could 
[normal]be 
[normal]required
[normal] from other postal operators or 
[normal]from 
[normal]additional 
[normal]charges p
[normal]aid by 
[normal]consumers
[normal]; 
[normal]alteration of the 
[normal]obligations requiring Royal Mail to provide other operators with 
[normal]access 
[normal]to its delivery network or imposing ‘access’ conditions on other postal operators obliging them to allow Royal Mail, and others, access to their del
[normal]ivery network; and 
[normal]the tendering out of
[normal] 
[normal]elements of the universal service which were found to be a financial burden on the current designated universal service provider
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]OFCOM
[normal] 
[normal]also has a general duty to encourage competition in postal services, providing
[normal] that does not interfere with its primary duty to safeguard the universal service, with a view to delivering better outcomes for consumers.
[normal] 
[normal]Of note, in 
[normal]respect
[normal] of consideration of its primary and additional duties following notification from TNT UK about i
[normal]ts trial end-to-end delivery 
[normal]service, OFCOM stated that 
[normal]‘On the basis of the evidence provided to us and the analysis we have conducted, we do not consider it necessary to exercise our regulatory powers now to impose any new conditions (including the impos
[normal]ition of General Universal Service Conditions) for, or in connection with, securi
[normal]ng the universal postal service’
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Competition 
[normal]in the provision of postal services has opened the door to innovation and
[normal] choice for consumers and business customers. While 
[normal]there has been some concern expressed publicly that competition in the postal services market could lead to adverse impacts on Royal Mail, and its ability to deliver the universal postal service, the suite of measures available to OFCOM to safeguard the un
[normal]iversal service are capable of mitigating any potential adverse impacts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Consumer 
[normal]Futures would
[normal],
[normal] in fact
[normal],
[normal] caution that ill-considered use of these measures could lead to less favourable outcome
[normal]s
[normal] for consumers through, for instance, the stifling or restriction of competition in the postal services market or the creation of a perverse incentive on Royal Mail to not address inefficiencies as competitors providing lower cost services could find thems
[normal]elf liable for providing subsidy to Royal Mail, thereby forcing them to either keep prices artificially high to avoid the subsidy situation or increase prices to afford payment of a subsidy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Specific
[normal] concern
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]have also been 
[normal]expressed 
[normal]that
[normal] competitive pre
[normal]ssure may see Royal Mail seek to 
[normal]withdraw from 
[normal]elements of the universal service 
[normal]which 
[normal]it has been s
[normal]uggested are loss making – such as 
[normal]daily 
[normal]deliveries to remote or rural areas – or to rebalance tariffs in a way which rai
[normal]ses prices for rural consumers. However, 
[normal]as mentioned above in section 3.2, 
[normal]t
[normal]he
[normal] existence of a uniform tariff and six-day-a-
[normal]week collection and delivery
[normal] service as part of the 
[normal]minimum requirements of the 
[normal]universal postal service
[normal] is enshrined in 
[normal]primary leg
[normal]islation.
[normal] Were Royal Mail to find itself financially burden
[normal]ed
[normal] by these specific requirements of the universal service then OFCOM is able, as mentioned in section 3.4 above, to take steps to ensure these requirements are met. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]OFCOM’s primary duty
[normal], and th
[normal]e tools and mechanisms available to it, 
[normal]to secure the universal postal service and
[normal] ensure the mini
[normal]mum requirements of the service are
[normal] met
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]are not 
[normal]altered
[normal] by, and have no impact upon, the 
[normal]nature of the 
[normal]ownership of Royal Mail.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While OFCOM’s primary duty to secure a sustainable universal postal service is welcome, protection of the universal postal service should not be conflated with protecting Royal Mail’s revenues. OFCOM is required to have regard not only 
[normal]to the fin
[normal]ancial sustainability 
[normal]of the universal service but also its efficient provision. It also has a duty to ensure that the
[normal] uniform tariff for
[normal] universal postal service 
[normal]products 
[normal]is
[normal] affordable
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While Royal Mail is the
[normal] 
[normal]sole 
[normal]designated
[normal] universal service provider, its economic viability remains a significant factor in sustaining the universal postal service. The Royal Mail modernisation programme, which began in 2006-07, has seen action taken to decrease costs and increase efficiency but
[normal] as OFCOM notes, 
[normal]‘Since volumes have started to decline in 2006, Royal Mail has in most years been unable to reduce costs at a sufficient pace to offset the rate of decline in its revenues’
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Royal Mail’s 
[normal]most recent financial statements 
[normal]show that in the UK Parcels, International and Letters (UKPIL) business, 
[normal]significant investment continues to be made in pursuit of 
[normal]modernisation with e.g. the deployment of automation equipment. However, these 
[normal]statements
[normal] also show that
[normal] the 
[normal]modernisation pr
[normal]ogramme is not 
[normal]delivering the anticipated
[normal] 
[normal]cost savings in other expenditure areas. For example, people costs 
[normal]increased by 4.6%
[normal] 
[normal]between 2011-12 and 2012-13 over a period when there was also a 46% increase in “property and project” costs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Unless 
[normal]able to deliver efficiency 
[normal]gains that exceed the effect of volume decline,
[normal] Royal Mail is likely to fi
[normal]nd itself in a vicious cycle of 
[normal]ha
[normal]ving
[normal] to 
[normal]increase
[normal] prices
[normal] 
[normal]for consumers 
[normal]which in turn is likely to 
[normal]further 
[normal]suppress demand, 
[normal]leading to additional 
[normal]volume de
[normal]cline. Unit costs would increase 
[normal]which subsequently puts
[normal] 
[normal]even 
[normal]greater
[normal] 
[normal]upward pressure on prices.
[normal] The continued viability of an 
[normal]affordable univ
[normal]ersal service would be at stake
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rigorous
[normal] monitoring and analysis of the progress of the modernisation programme in driving efficiencies must be undertaken 
[normal]by OFCOM 
[normal]together with the application of robust 
[normal]pressure on
[normal] Royal Mail to make efficiency gains
[normal]. C
[normal]onsumers 
[normal]should not have to 
[normal]face increased
[normal] prices 
[normal]or reduced standards 
[normal]as a result of corporate failure
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]OFCOM
[normal] 
[normal]will also need to carefully scrutinise and continuously monitor 
[normal]the effects of price rises on the affordability of mail services, pa
[normal]rticularly for those 
[normal]consumers 
[normal]who rely on the postal service. 
[normal]The impact of any substantial increase in price could accelerate 
[normal]the switch away from using mail
[normal] in turn putting greater strain on the financing of the universal postal service, or cause those who can least afford any increa
[normal]se and cannot use alternate means
[normal] – such as low-income, low-internet users – to 
[normal]bear a disproportionate amount of the cost
[normal].

[normal]I
[normal]n April 2012
[normal],
[normal] OFCOM
[normal] reformed the price control framework for
[normal] 
[normal]Royal Mail with
[normal] 
[normal]most price controls removed. As a result of evidenc
[normal]e and representations from Consumer Focus and 
[normal]others at the time, 
[normal]OFCOM
[normal] extended the
[normal] safeguard cap on Second Cl
[normal]ass Standard Letters to include 
[normal]Large Letters, packets and parcels up to 2kg
[normal] sent Second Class,
[normal] in 
[normal]an attempt
[normal] to ensure there would always be a
[normal]t 
[normal]least o
[normal]n
[normal]e
[normal] affordable 
[normal]option 
[normal]for consumers. T
[normal]here
[normal] remains, however, 
[normal]significant scope for 
[normal]further 
[normal]price rises for 
[normal]these additional products now covered by the safeguard cap.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In establishing the safeguard cap, 
[normal]OFCOM 
[normal]assessed that the price parameters did
[normal] n
[normal]ot raise affordability concerns for small business or residential customers
[normal]. However, with 
[normal]some vulnerable consumer
[normal] 
[normal]segments 
[normal]more 
[normal]liable to rely
[normal] 
[normal]on postal services – and 
[normal]therefore
[normal] more captive to price rises and more negatively
[normal] impacted by them – than 
[normal]others
[normal],
[normal] OFCOM will require to be proactive in assessing whether price rises in stamps and basic mail products are causing financial difficulty across 
[normal]the diversity of 
[normal]consumer and SME segments
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whether Royal Mail is in public or private ownership, 
[normal]OFCOM
[normal] must 
[normal]remain v
[normal]igilant in its monitoring of prices and efficiencies to ensure that Royal Mail is not 
[normal]permitted to raise
[normal] prices without making the 
[normal]cost 
[normal]efficiencies necessa
[normal]ry to ensure the sustainability 
[normal]of the universal
[normal] postal
[normal] service.
[normal] Consumer needs and a thorough understanding of
[normal] 
[normal]consumer behaviour 
[normal]must be at the centre of regulatory policy development
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] any proposed changes 
[normal]considered in 
[normal]the context of their direct and indirect impacts on consumers
[normal] and on the 
[normal]sustainability 
[normal]of a 
[normal]u
[normal]niversal 
[normal]postal 
[normal]service
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following f
[normal]ormal separation of Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd 
[normal](POL) 
[normal]in April 2012, 
[normal]with each forming a separate legal entity, 
[normal]their relationship is now governed by commercial contracts. A financially 
[normal]significant
[normal] 
[normal]contractual
[normal] arrangement remains between 
[normal]the two organisations 
[normal]in respect of 
[normal]retail postal services and in respect of 
[normal]mail access 
[normal]and distribution 
[normal]points.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]OFCOM specify
[normal] certain mail access and distribution requirements, 
[normal]within the conditions imposed on Royal Mail as the designated universal ser
[normal]vice provider
[normal],
[normal] in order to meet the legislative requirements relating to the collection 
[normal]and delivery of mail. Royal Mail fulfils aspects of those 
[normal]conditions 
[normal]via the Mails Distribution Agreement 
[normal]with 
[normal]POL
[normal].
[normal] Additionally, Royal Mail is the only postal operator to use POL, and therefore local Post Office branches, as either a retailer of postal se
[normal]rvices or as an acceptance or collection point for postal items.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While not a party to the contract, Government has
[normal] 
[normal]stated
[normal] that the Mails Distribution Agreement 
[normal]‘will continue in force for a period of at least ten years from its commencement date – 26 Mar
[normal]ch 2012’
[normal].
[normal] It has also confirmed that there is provision for a review of the terms of the agreement, five years into its duration, and that either party 
[normal]‘may seek a review of the agreement’s terms ... where there has been a material adverse effect on POL o
[normal]r Royal Mail
[normal]’
[normal]. 
[normal]Furthermore, Governm
[normal]ent has also confirmed that there are limited circumstances, reflecting contractual law and practice, under which the agreement could be terminated by either party – such as persistent or material breach of the agreement
[normal] by the other party
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pressures already exist on POL to modernise their offering in the postal service market with increased competition in both the retail 
[normal]postal services sector
[normal] and
[normal] the parcel acceptance and collection sector
[normal]. 
[normal]Additional challenges 
[normal]also exist for POL
[normal] 
[normal]– for 
[normal]example, 
[normal]the current contract with the Department for Work &amp; Pensions for the payment of welfare benefits and pensions 
[normal]through post office branches 
[normal]is scheduled to end in 2015, with a possible extension to 2017. Any new contract fo
[normal]r the provision of these payment services would be subject to procurement regulations and open competition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regardless of the nature
[normal] of, or any change in, 
[normal]the ownership of Royal Mail, POL will need to 
[normal]be able to 
[normal]respond to 
[normal]these
[normal] pressures
[normal] and challenges
[normal] and offer commercially competitive products and services which meet the needs of consumers and their desired quality and convenience
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Consumer Futures would expect Royal Mail, whether in public or private hands, to ensure that selling practices and stan
[normal]dards, associated with
[normal] its products and services, in post o
[normal]ffice branches me
[normal]e
[normal]t with consumer 
[normal]needs and 
[normal]expectations and the required contractual expectations.
