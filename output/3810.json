"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Institute of Engineers (CYS 054)&#xa0;\nThe Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) \nunderstands the concerns after \nthe \nrecent deaths of a number of cycle users on the streets of London. Many, including the Mayor of London, have \nidentified, \namongst other aspects\n,\n the role of engineering as means to improving safety\n for cyclists\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nICE \nis a UK-based international organisatio\nn representing over 80,000 members around the world, who range from professional civil engineers to students. It is an educational and qualifying body and has charitable status under UK law. Founded in 1818, the ICE has become recognised worldwide for its \nexcellence as a centre of learning, as a qualifying body and as a public voice for the profession. Under our Royal Charter, ICE takes seriously its role as a learned society and we actively contribute to the development of public policy at all levels of Go\nvernment.\n&#xa0;\nICE has drawn upon the knowledge of its members to respond to previous Government consultations on \ntransport policy issues and welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this inquiry by outlining how to \nimprove safety for cyclists in our towns an\nd cities\n from a civil engineering perspective\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1. Whether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and cities&#xa0;\n1.\n1\n              \nTable 1 \nshows the number of pedal cyclists who have been killed\n or seriously injured \n(KSI) \nin Great\n Britain in the years 2002 to 2012. The t\nable also shows an estimate of the number of billion kilometres cycled derived from the National Travel Survey (\nand \nusing \nmid-year population \nestimates\n)\n and, separately, the same estimate from the N\national Road Transport Estimates.\nTable 1 Pedal cycle numbers killed and seriously injured, and rates per cycle kilometre travelled&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Distance cycled estimates&#xa0;KSI per distance cycled estimatesYearAverage distance cycledAverage trip lengthGB PopulationNTS EstimateNRTE EstimatePedal cyclist KSINTS estimateNRTE estimate&#xa0;\nMiles / person / year\nMiles\n1000s\nbill.cycle.kms\nbill.cycle.kms\nNumber\nKSI /\n \nmill.cycle.kms\nKSI /\n \nmill.cycle.kms\n2002\n36.16\n2.16\n57622.1\n3.33\n4.40\n2450\n0.735\n0.557\n2003\n37.15\n2.34\n57849.6\n3.44\n4.40\n2411\n0.701\n0.548\n2004\n38.69\n2.39\n58131.6\n3.60\n4.10\n2308\n0.641\n0.563\n2005\n36.14\n2.44\n58511.1\n3.38\n4.30\n2360\n0.697\n0.549\n2006\n39.21\n2.38\n58842.7\n3.69\n4.50\n2442\n0.662\n0.543\n2007\n40.29\n2.85\n59226.5\n3.82\n4.10\n2564\n0.672\n0.625\n2008\n42.02\n2.55\n59623.2\n4.01\n4.60\n2565\n0.640\n0.558\n2009\n45.55\n2.91\n60003.1\n4.37\n4.80\n2710\n0.620\n0.565\n2010\n42.45\n2.82\n60462.6\n4.11\n4.80\n2771\n0.675\n0.577\n2011\n48.85\n3.02\n61470.8\n4.80\n4.90\n3192\n0.664\n0.651\n2012\n52.69\n3.19\n61881.4\n5.22\n5.00\n3340\n0.640\n0.668\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe number of people killed or seriously injured needs to be considered relative to a measure of exposure. The \nmeasure of exposure\n used in the table above is the distance cycled. There are two problems with this measure\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis evidence does not make inter-modal comparisons, and distance is a good measure for trend over time. The problem, more clearly shown in Figures 1 and 2 below\n, is that our idea of whether the rate of being killed or injured is increasing or decreasing over time is dependent on whether we place more reliance on the estimates based on the National Travel Survey or the estimates based on the National Road Traffic \nEstimates.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nIt is an open question therefore, as to whether the trend in cyclists being killed and seriously injured has been increasing or decreasing over time. ICE is aware that the issue of the accuracy of the estimates for the number of cycle\n kilometres travelled is one which the Department for Transport is currently considering.\n \nRecommendation 1: The Department for Transport should be urged to move quickly towards being able to make more accurate estimates of the distance cycled so that meaningful cycle casualty exposure measures can be derived.&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nThe \nTransport Select Committee \nasks \nwhether cycling is safe\n:\n On the one hand, the answer to the question lies in the minds of those\n who\n might choose to cycle, or who might choose \nnot \nto cycle. On \nthe other hand, the answer might lie in deciding whether the rate at which cyclists are killed and seriously injured lies above or below some arbitrary threshold. Taking either the standpoint of the potential traveller, or the standpoint of policy makers, \nit is clear that it would be highly desirable to create conditions which make our towns and cities more attractive and comfortable to cycle around, and through doing so, will make them also safer. We cannot be complacent about the current rate of injury an\nd death and we need to consider ways of reducing risk to cycle users, as well as all users.\n \n \nRecommendation 2: Clear national objectives and targets need to be established and backed with appropriate resources, leadership and will, so that local interpretation and implementation is effective.&#xa0;\n2.               What central and local Government could do to improve cycling safety? &#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nCycling \nhas advantages over other modes mainly over shorter journey distances up to perhaps 5 miles\n (\nor \nperhaps \n10 miles for a proportion\n of the population who are fit and able\n)\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe Highways Agency does \nalso \nneed to consider the needs of cycle users, particularly where \nthe\n \nmotorway and trunk road system causes severance.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nT\nhe action\ns\n that local highway authorities \n(and the Highwa\nys Agency) \ntake \nstem directly from \nthe direction and leadership that they see emanating from central government. \nThe \nICE \nthinks \nthat national \ndirection\n and\n leadership needs to be provided on \ndesign guidance \nwhich is still currently developing \nfor provision\n for cycle traffic\n. The\n ICE is aware that the Department for Transport is considering its approach on \nthis issue at the present time. \nRecommendation 3: The Department for Transport provides leadership in design guidance which is still currently developing.&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nThere is some excellent experience now available across a wide range of local authorities on designing highway infrastructure and managing that infrastructure through appropriate traffic regulation orders in such a way as to promote cycling and also \nto \nmake cycling safer. There are also some very poor examples of changes which have been made to the highway network which neither support the needs of cyclists, nor make cycling safer. The\n ICE recommends that the \nlimited extent, continuity and quality of \ncurrent \ncycl\ning\n infra\nstructure should be addressed as follows\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.                Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nWe answer this question by first briefly reviewing the nature of provision in Northern Europe.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nIn \nthe \nNetherlands, there is more of an emphasis than \nhas been apparent to date in the UK on routes and lanes which are separate from motor traffic. This is particularly the case where motor traffic speeds and volumes are higher. This ‘segregation’ has become a main focus of discussion about cycling provision\n, particularly in London, and is commonly discussed in the context of roundabout design (for example, the ‘Dutch style roundabouts’ currently being trialled by the Transport Research Laboratory for Transport for London).  Arguably the more important featur\ne of cycling provision in The Netherlands is the nature of the comprehensive networks for cycle users.  These routes tend to be more direct, remove difficult barriers to movement, and above all are networks where it is quicker and easier to use the bike bi\ncycle than the car.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nDenmark,\n on the other hand, are more prepared to mix cycle traffic with motor traffic. This is characterised at traffic signal controlled junctions where cycle users typically return from a cycle lane kerb-separated from the carria\ngeway to join other traffic to progress through junctions.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nClearly there are\n difficulties\n in simply \napplying \nDutch or Danish approaches to the UK situation.  An important area of difference is the law surrounding traffic management. The UK does not \nhave ‘strict’ or presumed liability in road traffic law, which is where the default assumption is that the driver of a motor vehicle is liable to give compensation in civil law in cases where they collide with vulnerable road users.  Northern Europeans als\no have different rules for the use of the road, for example, helpful time saving protocols at signal controlled junctions where pedestrians and turning traffic can move at the same time, with the traffic giving way where there is conflict.  These differenc\nes in law\n, and regulation,\n \nare likely to have been the mechanisms by which \ndifferent culture\ns\n of responsibility, and hence consequent behaviour\ns, have been established over a period of time\n.\n \nRecommendation 7: ICE would encourage investigation of potential traffic law and regulation changes which may permit beneficial change in road user behaviour. &#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nWhile some cities such as Bristol, Cambridge and London have seen significant rises in levels of cycle use in the last decade there are other places, ostensibly with the ready-made infrastructure in place, such as Milton Keynes and Stevenage, where success\n in raising cycling levels has been harder to come by. \nThese significant rises in levels of cycling are to be welcomed, but seemingly the inter-relationships between motor traffic and cycle users have not reached the level of maturity shown in countries wi\nth currently high levels of cycle use.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nThe problem with ‘segregated’ cycle routes \nthat have been provided in the UK in the past have been that \ntheir purpose has been to remove cycle traffic from the carriageway, with the point being to provide less hi\nndered movement motor traffic on the highway. Unless cycle routes are designed for the needs of cycle users they will remain underused and, as the evidence suggest\ns\n, no safer than the highway.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nThe problem with provision for cycling historically in th\ne UK is that it has always been seen as, a ‘problem’ mode.  \nT\nhis has been based on the misplaced notion that the activity itself is risky, rather than the surrounding motor vehicles which pose most of the risk. Traffic management has generally been concern\ned \nmainly\n with maximizing capacity and minimising delay, but we are \nnow \nseeing recognition that, in fact, appropriate traffic management in many urban areas is well achieved through speed management, such as the introduction of 20mph limits and zones.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nThe challenge now \nis to \ntake the mode seriously enough to make the necessary quality of provision through comprehensive networks which are attractive and comfortable.\n To be well designed for cyclists’ needs, we know from Dutch design guidance what they ne\ned to be like: direct, comfortable and attractive. Off-road routes need to be well engineered in geometric terms and have sufficient width. Where routes coincide with routes also available for motor traffic, care needs to be taken in the design to continue\n to provide sufficient safe space for movement.\n Provision within the highway will include areas which are segregated from motor traffic and areas which are integrated with motor traffic. Where segregation exists, particular care needs to be taken to ensure\n that the advantages of speed and flexibility of the bicycle are not lost, and that the points where cycle traffic diverges and merges with motor traffic are safe.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nSo far as HGVs are concerned, the ICE \nhas \nnot argue\nd\n for\n the \nprohibition of HGVs from c\nity centres at peak hours\n. This is for reasons linked with the necessity for the goods as well as people to be moved around urban areas to maintain the economic life of urban areas. We do think that we will see changes, however, in how ‘last mile’ delivery is undertaken in the fut\nure, with the potential for consolidation centres at urban peripheries where the disadvantages of trans-shipment are outweighed by the advantages of less vehicle mileage wasted \nin \ncongested urban \nconditions\n. We also think there is likely to be further grow\nth in cycling being part of the mix of modes providing last mile delivery.\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nContinued pressure should be brought to bear, however, on hauliers training their drivers in schemes such as FORS, which help raise awareness and skill amongst HGV drivers whe\nn they are driving in situations where there are many vulnerable road users present.\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n              \nThe ICE has been pleased to work with on a draft of Work Related Road Risk Standards for Construction Logistics with Transport for London and others. This document i\ns currently being finalised and will address some of the issues particularly relevant to construction vehicles. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n12\n              \nWith this in mind, \nICE would like to raise issue with the recent \nGovernment announcement for HGV driver training exemption designed \nto cu\nt costs and bureaucracy\n, where s\nhort distance repair and testing drivers \nare \nto be made exempt from additional professional driving tests and training\n.  \n&#xa0;\n3.13\n              \nU\nnder current European rules, anyone who drives heavy goods vehicles or buses must complete a C\nertificate of Professional Competence but around 76,000 who drive them for short distances, for the purposes of delivering or repairing them, will soon be exempt.\n  Two exemptions, made following a consultation, are to be made this \nautumn\n: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n14\n              \nICE has wri\ntten to Government on this issue, and would again like to express our concern at this exemption.  Regardless of whether mechanics or valets are carrying passengers or goods, it remains that they are still driving heavy vehicles in potentially congested urb\nan areas, and should be fully trained to do so.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n15\n              \nICE urges the Transport Select Committee to address this issue, as we are concerned at the potential for what we consider to be \nan\n unnecessary change in legislation\n, which we fear could lead to further \ncollisions\n, or at worst, further fatalities\n.  \n&#xa0;\n4.               Additional points&#xa0;\n4.\n1\n              \nIn closing, we would welcome the opportunity to participate in the oral evidence session on 2 December 2013\n, where a member of our Cycling Working Group would be happy to\n expand upo\nn our evidence further. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n For a review of the evidence see John Franklin’s web page \nhttp://www.cyclecraft.co.uk/digest/research.html\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/driver-training-exemption-set-to-cut-costs-and-bureaucracy\n \n"
