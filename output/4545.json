"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Core Cities (LTD0035)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis response represents the collective view of the \nCore\n \nCities\n, \nBirmingham\n, \nBristol\n, Leeds, Liverpool, \nManchester\n, \nNewcastle\n,\n \nNottingham and \nSheffield\n.\n&#xa0;\nCore \nC\nities are a unique and united local authority voice to promote the role of our ci\nties in driving economic growth\n.\n  \nWe represent the councils of the 8 largest city economies outside of \nLondon\n. \nThese cities drive local and underpin national economies. Working in partnership, we aim to enable each city to enhance their economic performance and make them better places to \nlive, \nwork,\n visit and do business.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nC\nore \nC\nities group has a track record of 15 years as a cross party group, led by the city leaders. It is a \nself-selected\n and funded group.\n&#xa0;\nCore\n \nCity\n urban areas deliver 27% of \nEngland\n’s wealth and are home to one \nthird of the country’s population.\n&#xa0;\nThe Cities are though punching below their weight – our second tier cities should be more economically successful compared with cities of similar scale and r\no\nle in other European and OECD Co\nuntries.  For example just for\n Core C\nities to punch their weight at the national average would provide the country with an additional £1.3 billion per annum.\nLocal Transport infrastructures require radical improvement to maximise economic growth and support improving quality of life an\nd the local environment\n but o\nur governan\nce and services are fragmented. O\nur \nCapital\n \nCity\n enjoys the benefits of a strategic transport body, Transport for \nLondon\n, with an integrated single set of policy and investment powers to plan for transport in the cap\nital. Across our core cities there is no equivalence which can ensure\n that\n transport maximises economic, socia\nl and environmental benefits – \nCore Cities\n are operating under a structure that is heavily centralised to central government. Excluding recent cha\nnges to business rate local retention, which makes little difference in this respect, \n \n 95% of all tax raised in English Cities goes to national government.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nUK\n ranks only 34th in the world for its infrastructure, 6th in the G8 countries, and only spen\nds 1.5% of GDP on infrastructure compared to 6% in \nJapan\n and 3% in \nFrance\n. Public transport investment in the capital now stands at £644 per head compared with £243 per head for the \nWest Midlands\n and the North of England combined.\n  \nLondon\n’s performance is \ncritical to the nation, but Core Cities are important too and in fact deliver more economically.  The capital has enjoyed very significant transport investment over \nthe last two decades. Over the last 20 years \nLondon\n has benefited from the implementation o\nf significant new transport infrastructure, including \nThames\n link\n, Jubilee Line extension, upgrades for the Olympics, and HS1 we estimate this to be around £40bn. The rest of the country has on the other hand benefited from the West Coast Main Line upgrade\n, New Street Gateway, \nBirmingham\n and under construction the Northern Hub, around £12bn. \n&#xa0;\nWith HS2 most of our great cities will be connected, so they can become a single and powerful engine for economic growth. However to maximise this it is imperative to\n maximise connectivity within and between Core Cities. The Transport network has a crucial role in supporting growth and rebalancing the  economy. Independent forecasts demonstrate that our Core Cities have the potential to deliver an additional 1.16 milli\non jobs and £222 billion into the national economy by 2030. Supported by Core Cities research Oxford Economics, Arup and Volterra have estimated that there is a potential for HS2 to deliver a further 400,000 additional jobs in the Core Cities and support t\nhe delivery of 1 million jobs in total across the wider urban area.\nThe Chair of the Committee, Louise Ellman MP, has said: \n“There have been a number of changes in the arrangements for funding and delivering transport projects locally. We want to investigate the complex network of bodie\ns involved in local transport decisions and find out how they work together both within and across local authority boundaries. We are also interested in hearing about the different funding schemes that are available and the extent to which these meet local\n needs.”\nThe key messages from the Core Cities in relation to this line of inquiry are the need for:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Core Cities response to the inquiry questions are outlined below.\n&#xa0;\nQ1. What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Governments proposals were welcome, based as they were on the rationale that they can be focused on providing local areas with flexibility to ensure priorities meet local \nneeds and be proactive to lever in economic development. Whilst it did not reduce the number of funding pots, Major Scheme, Integrated Transport ITB and Capitalised Maintenance blocks, local control over all 3 meant less silo based approach to transport fu\nnding and a more integrated approach to solutions.\nThe positive experience of devolution in the \nUK\n is also reflected in Europe where \nEuropean\n \nCities\n and Regions have far more influence over their local transport networks in terms of planning, managing and\n \ndeveloping and running these networks than is the case in \nEngland\n outside of London TfL. In \nFrance\n for example a transport tax on salary is provided directly to the local authorities for transport and allows their Mayor to for example stand on a mandate to\n deliver a tram in their first 5 year term. A key reason why so many more cities in \nFrance\n are benefiting from modern urban transport systems.\nCertainty of funding is also key, the initial allocation of 4 years is welcome however as part of their City Deal\n some Core Cities negotiated a 10 year deal (6 years fixed, 4 years indicative). This should be extended to all Core Cities. Such certainty of funding is a key requirement for the current ongoing review of future operating models for the Highways Agency.\nT\nhe Assurance requirements required by the DfT have however effectively required the same assessment requirements and techniques, such as WEBtag, which has resulted in little or no saving in respect of scheme appraisals. It is not uncommon for the cost of a\nppraisal to be upwards of 10% of the scheme construction cost.\nFor the period beyond 2015, Major Scheme funding and prioritisation was devolved to Local Transport Bodies constituted of LEPs, ITAs and other key stakeholders. However in 2013, the requirement\n of Strategic Economic Plans by LEPs, which includes Major Scheme and ITB funding within the associated Single Local Growth Fund, now leaves the role and function of ITAs and LTBs in this regard under question. \nA single allocated pot comprising all capita\nl funding streams should be made available to all Core Cities, based on the TfL model, as a 10 year allocation.\nAdvantages\nA single pot of funding as outlined for a 10 year period will provide certainty over funding and appropriate planning, development an\nd prioritisation. We believe this should become a permanent on-going arrangement, bring local transport for Core Cities into alignment with the national transport bodies and Transport for \nLondon\n.\nBig improvement on previous process of annual Funding Settle\nment approach which left little time to plan accordingly\nAllows for programme flexibility especially to react to external influences or opportunities e.g. ability to capture and support new development opportunity\nDisadvantages\nIn 2010, the reduction in th\ne number of funding pots available from the DfT was combined with major reduction in capital allocations. In 2009/10 for example the total West Midlands Metropolitan Area capital allocations via all funding streams was £77.062M. For 2011/12 the same capita\nl allowances was £41.071M, a 47% cut. \nMajor Scheme funding devolution to LEP areas means the ability to fund larger strategic schemes is not seen to be feasible. A scheme of £20M \napprox.\n is now effectively the largest scheme which could be practically fun\nded through the Major Scheme allocations for 2015-19\nDevolution of Major Scheme funding to local areas could have been an opportunity for Local Areas to reduce development costs and speed up approval timeframes, however imposition of WEBtag based appraisal\n requirements by Government is likely to see such benefits minimised.\n&#xa0;\nQ2. Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?&#xa0;Governments original rationale of devolution was to empower local areas and allow flexible, dynamic transport government and delivery structures reflective of local economic geographies. However, Government does appear to have contradicted this approach by\n imposing new structures and bodies, Local Transport Body’s LTB’s, rather than allowing local determination towards transport through the exiting local authority processes. \nMost of the Core Cities effectively have 8 different organisations undertaking sim\nilar transport functions: Core City, Integrated Transport Authority ITA, Passenger Transport Executive PTE as promoter and deliver of Passenger Transport schemes, LTBs prioritising Major Schemes, Local Enterprise Partnerships developing SEPs and promoting \neconomic development which includes access to transport funding with the Single Growth Fund, Highways Agency, Network Rail and DfT for rail franchises. In practice, the differing remits, funding and covering geographies is likely to lead to inefficiencies \nbetween strategic planning, development and delivery of schemes and initiatives.\nA model similar to London TfL for Core Cities would greatly simplify and streamline the system.\nWhilst the significant cuts in Local Authorities is obviously having an impact,\n the ability for local authorities to determine their appropriate processes and structures together with certainty of funding, would greatly reduce the resource requirement. This together with a reduction in the overdependence of national government of com\npetitive bids, 3 major bidding rounds in 2013 alone, would greatly assist with capacity.\n&#xa0;\nQ3. What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the Core Cities, strategic\n cross boundary transport planning across the travel to work areas is vital and reflects the realities of transport patterns and requirements of an urban area both for internal cross boundary movements and wider within the economic catchment of the metropo\nlitan area.\nAgain, the differing bodies, organisation an\nd authorities covering varying\n geographical areas with different responsibilities towards funding allocation, strategic planning and delivery is likely to lead to inefficiencies between strategic plan\nning, development and delivery.\nIn the West Midlands for example, whilst the ITA is presently tasked by the Local Transport Act (2008) to undertake strategic cross boundary transport planning, decision making on Major Schemes is now undertaken by 3 separat\ne LEP/ LTBs who have a specific focus on promoting economic development, covering different geographical areas to existing structures such as ITAs/ Shire Counties and their Metropolitan District Authorities. There is a danger such a focus misses other tran\nsport needs and priorities such as connecting people to jobs, addressing severe road congestion, reducing environmental impacts.\nHowever\n a number of other \nCore\n \nCity\n areas are\n moving toward a model similar to that of a Combined Authority which will see the \nLeaders directing Transport Strategy and Policy within the wider \narea.\nTo enable this model to work effectively however the Core City’s and their regions need a mechanism akin to ‘duty to cooperate’ not only with adjacent authorities but also with the High\nways Agency and Network Rail and be involved in Policy development in respect of Rail Franchising, Aviation and Seaports.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q4. How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?&#xa0;\nCore Ci\nties believe that local bodies largely do work well together, a number have or are implementing Combined Authority models. This reflects historical working processes and relationships. However, there does need to a stronger responsibility for national tran\nsport agencies, such as the Highways Agency and Network Rail, to work closely with local bodies such as ITAs and LEPs to ensure alignment between local needs and their investment programmes. \nCore Cities itself has a Cabinet arrangement, led by Sir Richard\n Lease, Leader of Manchester with each of the Core Cities Leader’s having a portfolio. Sir Albert Bore having the Transport Portfolio. Supporting this are a number of working groups that share good practice and help make a collective case for better transp\nort in their areas.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ5. Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs previously stated there has been a significant cut in \ntransport capital spend\n,\n although the significant proposed increase in the last spending review is acknowledged\n,\n notwithstanding that a significant proportion of this is not within the li\nf\ne of this parliament. For example the \nWest Midlands\n has seen a signi\nficant reduction in capital funding blocks. In 2009/10 total West Midlands Metropolitan Area capital allocations via all funding streams was £77.062M. For 2011/12 the same capital allowances was £41.071M, a 47% cut. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition there is as previously sta\nted a significant funding gap with \nLondon\n. \nPublic transport investment in the capital now stands at £644 per head compared with £243 per head for the \nWest Midlands\n and the North of England combined.\n  \nLondon\n’s performance is critical to the nation, but Core\n Cities are important too and in fact deliver more economically.  The capital has enjoyed very significant transport investment over the last two decades. Over the last 20 years \nLondon\n has benefited from the implementation of significant new transport infr\nastructure, including Thameslink, Jubilee Line extension, upgrades for the Olympics, and HS1 we estimate this to be around £40bn. The rest of the country has on the other hand benefited from the West Coast Main Line upgrade, New Street Gateway, \nBirmingham\n \nand under construction the Northern Hub, around £12bn. \n&#xa0;\nInvestment in any transport scheme is a highly efficient approach to supporting the economy as materials are purchased, jobs are created in building the scheme and it improves productivity of the \nwider economy. It is estimated that for every £1 invested in construction generates £1.86\n to the economy\n. Whilst the Government has recognised this and has increased funding for national agencies to historical high levels for the period 2015-19, local tran\nsport funding (covering Major Schemes, Integrated Transport and Maintenance Blocks) for 2015-19 is \nonly \n£2.244bn per annum compared to £1.968Bn in 2009/10 an increase of 14% or the equivalent of 1.9% per annum.\n&#xa0;\nRing fencing of conc\nessionary fares budget i\ns also helping to distort\n local transport support spending and can now account for around 50% of most authorities public transport spending.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q6. What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Single Local Growth Fund (SLGF) is an opportunity for the underinvestment in local transport to be addressed as discussed in previous answers. But it must be recognised that the majority of the funding is disproportion\nately from local transport pots, Major Schemes, ITB and Local Sustainable Transport Funding LSTF \n and as such \nadds another element in the local transport framework in an area and could possible lead to a democratic deficit.\nDespite this the £2bn per annum \npot is a welcomed start, however given the competitive nature of the fund, the government still retains control over funding allocations – against the premise of devolution. \nThe original Major Scheme and ITB Funding was formulaic, a significant\n proportion \nof this, over 50%, \nis now competitive.\n&#xa0;\nThere is also a question re the future role of the LTB’s beyond 2019 that has yet to be addressed.\n&#xa0;\nA more equitable solution would be for the complete devolution of this fund, and other transport sources, to\n \nCore \nCities\n and their regions \nso that they can focus the resource on urban areas which are often the focal point of journeys, hubs of economic activity, population growth and therefore the location where investment in transport issues will generate the largest \nbenefits. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAlthough\n the Government’s approach will allow for investment in smaller scale schemes l (&lt;£20M \napprox.\n) and larger schemes (&gt;£500M \napprox.\n) by the national agencies/ companies, the ability to fund ‘mid-range’ schemes i.e. £20M - £500M locally, vital for transforma\ntional changes to local area economies, is considerably more challenging. Mid-range schemes across conurbations largely cover rapid transit (light rail and bus), rail schemes or stations. \n&#xa0;\nThis means funding opportunities for these types of schemes will \nfocus on sovereign/ private investment funds\n, EIB and general borrowing\n, \nwith repayment through a mix of fare box, \ncouncil tax levy increases (noting the Governments statutory requirements for a local referendum to facilitate such increases\n. Such a mechani\nsm was agreed with Leeds City Deal only for it to be subsequently legislated against!), Workplace and Congestion Charging, \nTax Incremental Financing or private sector contributions through mechanisms such as the Community Infrastructure Levy. \n&#xa0;\nTo maximise\n the Transport requirement \nto\n enable Core Cities to operate at their full potential in terms of Growth and GVA requires significantly enhanced flexibility, to the level enjoyed by TfL, in maximising public transport benefits, including reviewing Transport \nLevy Referendum arrangements and simplifying public transport contracting processes.\n&#xa0;\nThese funding approaches all require the promoting area/ authority to take on financial risks/ guaranteed investment returns not otherwise required by the public funding \nof the smaller scheme or national schemes identified above. Equally, such investment funds expose themselves to risk that result in projected patronage and revenues being optimistic. Such risk is therefore priced into schemes, inflating costs or returns.\n&#xa0;\nWith small schemes and nationally significant schemes not exposed to such risks, Government could expedite delivery through underwriting risk to provide a proportionate balance of risk between the public and private sector. For example, the DfT presently u\nnderwrites new rail services for a period of time until patronage, revenues and operating costs become established to inform further decision making. \n&#xa0;\nIf a similar approach was applied to mid-range schemes, the public sector funding could pump-prime a sch\neme with a long term concession then let after a pre-determined number of years. Once the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be \nmodelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the\n concession could then be recycled to fund other mid-range transport schemes. \n&#xa0;\nWith such measures in place, the lower cost of risk built into financial models and decision making by local areas and the private sector would be reduced by creating an enviro\nnment of greater funding certainty to unlock investment to create jobs and growth.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q8. How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe Core Cities already consider there to be strong lines of local democratic accountability, however \nthere is concern re the potential accountability in respect of LEP’s and SEP’s. For the Local Growth Fund it needs to be the case that democratic accounta\nbility is a key requirement. However \nin the spirit of devolution, local areas should be allowed to develop appropriate structures to undertaken government requirements \nrather than imposing structures. \n&#xa0;\nIt could be argued that at present the national gover\nnments organisational and technocratic hold over local transport decision – making in \nEngland\n outside of \nLondon\n is overriding the local decision making particularly in areas such as bus deregulation and train franchising to the local electorate to too grea\nter degree.\n&#xa0;\nEngland\n after all is recognised as having one of the most centrally controlled governance structures in Europe (Second Tier Cities in \nEurope\n – Professor Michael Parkinson)\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPage \n8 of \n8&#xa0;\n"
