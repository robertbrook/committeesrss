"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n Colin Clarke (CYS0099)\n&#xa0;\nDear Members\n&#xa0;\nThe \nUK\n has the ability to improve safety for cycling but a combination of regulation, practices,\n design standards, cycling culture and training plus other general road safety \nimprovements are required\n to achieve good \nto excellent \nresults. \n&#xa0;\nMain topics;\n&#xa0;\n1\nImpro\nvements\n to the \nHighway Code\n required\n in regards to cycling\n&#xa0;\n2\nDesign standards for cycling\n infrastructure \n&#xa0;\n3\nGeneral road safety improvements and consequences for cycling\n&#xa0;\n4\nFunding and overseeing changes\n without undue delays\n&#xa0;\n5\nMeasuring results and effe\ncts\n&#xa0;\nPart 1Improvements to the Highway Code in regards to cyclinghttps://www.gov.uk/high\nw\na\ny-co\nd\ne\n&#xa0;\nIn May 2013 the CTC voted\n for my motion \nseeking changes to the Highway Code\n, \nto improve safety and benefit \ncyclists (vote 2665 for, 7 against\n,\n \nrefer\nhttp://www.ctc.org.uk/sites/default/files/ersvotingreport2013.pdf\nhttp://www.ctc.org.uk/file/Public/agmagenda.pdf\n &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nS\nuggestions for\n change\n;\n&#xa0;\nIntroductionhttps://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction&#xa0;The \nIntroduction to the Highway Code includes: \n“\nAlthough failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see \nThe road user and the law\n) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.”\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction\n \n&#xa0;\nFor c\nyclists this can create a \nproblem in that the Code uses the word ‘should’ when applied to advice on what to wear\n, Rule 59, see below\n. \nFor pedestrians the word ‘should’ is not use\nd. \n&#xa0;\nAdvice for pedestrians states;\n  (\nhttps://www.gov.uk/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35\n )\nRule 3\nHelp other road users to see you. Wear or carry something light-coloured, bright or fluorescent in poor daylight conditions. When it is dark, use reflective materials (e.g. armbands, sashes, waistcoats, jackets, footwear), which can be seen by drivers using headlights up to three times as\n far away as non-reflective materials.” \n&#xa0;\nIn practice compensati\non is sometimes reduced for\n people cycling\n due to not \nwear\ning\n extra safety aids and pedestrians usually gain full compensation.\n&#xa0;\nTo provide for fair compensation and support people’s right\n to \nwear their normal clothing\n, the following changes are suggested. \n&#xa0;\nAdding a\n sentence to the ‘\nIntroduction’,\n“However, liability should not be based on wearing extra safety aids in the case of pedestrians and cyclists.”\n \nand revising Rule 59 as below.\n&#xa0;\nRule 59 https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82\nCurrent version shown in\n Italics\n&#xa0;\nClothing.\n You should wear\nand\nr\newording Rule 59,\n c\nould provide\n the framework\n for social equality.\nClothing.\n&#xa0;\nThe advice to wear a helmet was added to the Code in 1993 when evidence was still being collected and it was p\nremature. In 2013 there is\n evidence for a\nnd against promotin\ng their use, from both safety and social perspectives.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRule 163 \n– suggested changes\nhttps://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘pass vulnerable road users with extra care and generous clearance’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRule 213 – suggested \nch\na\nn\nges\nhttps://www.gov.uk/road-users-requiring-extra-care-204-to-225/motorcyclists-and-cyclists-211-to-213\n&#xa0;Take extra care passing cyclists, \npreferably leave 1.5m or more but at least a minimum passing distance of one metre between the motor vehicle and a bicyclist for speeds up to 30 mph. At higher speeds more space should be provided and sufficient to prevent contact with the person operating\n the bicycle if the person were to fall into the driver’s lane of traffic. Pass with care and not at excessive speed.\n&#xa0;\nRule 239Parking (239 to 247)\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/waiting-and-parki\nng/parking-239-to-247\nincludes\n;\n‘\nyou \nMUST ensure you do not hit anyone when you open your door.

These do not generally result in high quality consistent standards for infrastructure and in some cases engineers will not provide cycling facilities at all or \nprovide sub guidelines recommendations or not \nfollow the\n gui\ndelines.\n \nA new\n approach is needed based on\n standards that form the minimum requirement for cycling \ninfrastructure\n. One standard already in use in Victoria, Australia, ‘\nDesign standards for bicycle facilities’\n, they provide \n \n'Cycle Notes',\n a series of \n21 \nin\nformation bulletins on design standards for cycling infrastructure.\nhttp://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoa\nndservices/Bicycles/StrategicDirectionsForCycling/BicycleFacilityDesignStandards.htm\nThe detail design \nof infrastructure for cycling is an important safety aspect\n and guidelines are not adequate to meet the needs required.\n The aim is for the ‘standards’ to direct the design engineers to what is required for best practice\n and reduce their design time and costs\n. The \nNetherlands\n also provide high design standards and a \nUK\n ‘Design standards’ would need to apply best practice\n su\nch as CROW\n when possible, for more information refer \nhttp://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/wiki/dutch-cycle-infrastructure\n \n. \n&#xa0;\nPart 3General road safety improvements and consequences for cyclingIf Parliament passed a\n \nCycling \nPromotion and Road Safety Bill\n, (see \nAppendix \nA\n for deta\nils)\n \nthis \nwoul\nd show that Parliament was\n send\ning\n a strong message\n to improve safety for cycling\n. In \nWales\n they \nhad\n a consultat\nion on cycling and \nthis\n may help to improve safety, see; \nhttp://wales.gov.uk/consultations/transport/activetravelbill/?lang=en\n&#xa0;\nRoads\n in \nUK\n cities have\n developed over centuries and were not designed for large HGV type vehicles\n. Delivery of goods to inner cities should be limited to \nusing \nvehicles of about 2m wide and 8\nm long as a general rule\n \nfor\n a maximum\n size\n.\n \nOne e\nxamples of \na \nvehi\ncles near to being s\nuitable is\n t\nhe \nMWB Hi-Roof Van at 1.9m wide and 5.7m long can carry 1300 kg.  \nhttp://www.rabbitsvehiclehire.co.uk/vehicle/mwb-hi-roof-van/\n \n&#xa0;\nThis would provide for more passing clearance for cyclists and reduce the risk when turning. \nIt w\nould also benefit general traffic flow. \nIf\n some\n larger vehicles \ngained permission\n then\n some restrictions on \nnot \ndelivering\n during peak traffic\n hours\n could be r\nequired\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nPart 4Overseeing changes without undue delaysA ‘Cycling Minister’ with just cycling to focus on may be the best approach and reporting to the Cabinet. \nFunding for urban areas and rural locations, e.g. \ne.g. designing safer\n junctions \nand \nprovisi\nons for crossing ‘A’ roads \nwould require a higher level of short term funding. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPart 5Measuring results and effectsThe \nshort and long term effects would need evaluating\n. Measuring pas\nsing clearanc\nes\n to see if on average \na lo\nwer proportion of drivers \npass\n \ntoo close\n.\n If a change in driving culture oc\ncurs with more consideration given to \nc\nyclists would need assessing\n. \nAccident data for all road users can be evaluated against the trends. \n&#xa0;\nAppendix AProposed, Cycling Promotion and Road Safety BillAims -1 Promote a cycling consciousness that reflects in safer driver’s behavio\nu\nr. \n2 To reduce conflicts between all road users and improve road safety.\n3 Develop quality cycling in\nfrastructure and junction designs/provisions.\n4 Improve cycling networks across \nEngland\n and \nWales\n.\n5 Create jobs and \nencourage \nextra visitors.\n6 Increase the combined use of cycling and public transport.\n7 Reduce traffic pollution by more people cycling an\nd reduced speed limits.\n8 Improve health by more people cycling more often.\n9 Improve cycling safety by ‘Safety in Numbers’ \nContents1Standard of cycling infrastructure1.1 A revised standard for cycling provisions and infrastructure shall be provided\n.\n1.2\n Cycling infrastructure and provisions shall be maintained and repaired so that they are safe and fit for purpose.\n2Making the road environment more suitable for cyclingTo reduce cyclists feeling squeezed or threatened by motorised traffic, the foll\nowing \nprovisions shall be introduced;\n2.1 No overtaking of cyclists shall be permitted at the \npedestrian \nrefuge or crossing or for a distance of 10m either side of the refuge or cros\nsing.\n2.2 Separate bypass cycle lane shall be provided at refuges if possi\nble\n.\n3Passing clearance and speed restriction for motor vehicles passing cyclists.3.1 \nRefer prop\nosed Highway Code changes above.\n3.2\n On narrow roads, 5 m or less in width, the permitted maximum motor vehicle speed is 20 mph when passing\n cyclists. \n4Maximum Speed limits4.1\nTo \nreduce deaths and serious injuries and \nimprove road safety for all road users the following speed limits shall apply unless signed otherwise. \nMotorways\n refer present Code\n‘A’ roads dual carriageways 60 or 70 mph, depending on ri\nsk level and if prov\nided with \nseparate cycle paths.\n‘A’ roads dual carriageways 60 mph, if not provided with separate cycle paths\n.\n‘A’ roads single carriageways 60 mph, if provided with separate cycle paths\n.\n \n‘A’ roads single carriageways 50 mph, if not pr\nov\nided with separate cycle paths. \nRural roads with centre lines and a minimum width of 6m\n and good sight lines\n, 50 mph. \nRural roads without centre lines 40 mph\n.\nUrban roads 40 mph, 30 mph, 25 mph and 20 mph limits to suit the situation.\n \n&#xa0;\nNotes\n4A\nThe 25 \nmph limit compared with the 30 mph roughly halves the fatality risk, see page\ns\n 12 Fig 4, \n13 Fig 5, (40 km/\nhr\n v 50km/\nhr\n).\nhttp://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/muarc276.pdf\n \nP\nrobability of death reduces f\nrom about 0.65 at 30 mph (50 km/\nhr\n) to 0.3 at 25 mph (40 km/\nhr\n). \nhttp://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/p\nublications/road_traffic/world_report/speed_en.pdf\nMany roads in urban areas are suited to 25 mph limits rather than 30 mph limits.\n \n&#xa0;\n4B\nThe GB accident data for 2011 shows 979 deaths in non-built up areas compared with 816 for built up areas. Most \ndeaths occurred on ‘A’ roads. For cycling ‘A’ roads pose a high risk and changes are needed urgently. The above suggestions could help lower the number killed and relate directly to the provision of cycling infrastructure.\n5Junction layout and design5\n.1\n Road\n junctions need to be rated for risk to cyclists, starting with ‘A’ roads. Staggered junctions are often used by cyclists to cross major roads and many improvements are required.\n6Funding of cycling infrastructure and general provision for cycling6\n.1 \nLong term f\nunding at a rate of £10 per person (index linked) or three perc\nent of the transport budget to\n be provided \nfor\n cycling facil\nities. Short term e\nxtra funding to assist\n.\n7Lower drink drive limit7\n.1 To reduce the permitted blood alcohol level f\nor drivers from 80 m\ng per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg.\n7\n.2 Zero blood alco\nhol limits for young drivers. \n&#xa0;\nNote\n7A\nhttp://www.nice.org.uk/media/3FE/1A/Blo \n... Review.pdf\nThere is strong evidence that someone’s ability to drive is affected if they have any alcohol in their blood. Drivers with a BAC of between 0.02 and 0.05 have at least a three times greater risk of dying in a vehicle crash. This risk incr\neases to at least six times w\nith a BAC between 0.05 and 0.08.\n&#xa0;\n7B\nhttp://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/conten ... 1.full.pdf\n (USA report)\nStudies show a 3 to 17 fold increas\ned risk of a fatal MVC with BAC &lt; 0.08 g/dl compared to sober drivers.(17 factor for 16-20 age group).\n8Amended the arrangements for changing the clocks in the winter and summer.\nrefer\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/p ... 65/665.pdf\n page 10.\nThe Department has strong evidence that more than\n80 fewer people would be killed each year on \nGreat Britain\n’s roads if the Government\namended the arrang\nements for changing the clocks in the winter and summer.\nNotes on costs;CongestionThe Department for Transport's (\nDfT's\n) estimated that the cost of congestion to business is set to rise by £10-12 billion over the period from 2003 to 2025 (expressed in 2\n002 prices). Adding in the value of the lost time experienced by other travellers raises this figure to £23-24 billion per annum.[2] \nCutting congestion in towns and cities by more people cycling, assume 33% more, could result in more than £0.5 billion in\n savings as a guide estimate.\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/p ... /87204.htm\nHealth“Take obesity: it already costs our NHS a staggering £4\n billion a year. But within four years, that figure’s expected to rise to £6.3 billion\n.” David Cameron, 16 May 2011.\nObesity cost approximately £66 per person and expected to in\ncrease to about £100 per year.  \nPotential savings by more cycling could be appr\noximately £1 b\nillion per year. \nhttp://fullfact.org/factchecks/NHS_refo ... ealth-2732\nTourismInternationally, 1\n2 % of Germans cycle to work, 27% Netherlands, 18% Denmark, 80+milion people in the USA have bicycles. The \nUK\n cycling to work rate is about 1%-2% but in some cities is much higher. The \nUK\n travel credit £19 billion compares with a debit of £32 billion. Loss\n approximately, £13 billion per year, average approximately £200+ per person. Providing more and better cycling facilities and improved road safety measures would result in more visitors and more people cycling within the \nUK\n. Potentially from a transfer of\n 0.5% (1 in 200) in extra visitors to the UK and a reduced level of travellers overseas, a net benefit to the UK could be approxim\nately £255 million per year. \nAnnual saving for \nUK\n, approximately £255 million per year.\nFuel and accident savingsMany motor \nvehicle journeys are less than 3 miles and by more people cycling, savings could be made of p\notentially £1 billion per year. \nA depressingly high proportion of short trips are mad\ne by car, 23% under a mile, 33% \n1 – 2 miles, and 79% 2 – 5 miles.\n \nR\nefer\n \nhttp://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files ... s%2016.pdf\n \n Reduced accidents to cyclists and all road users could potentially save £1 billion per year.\n \nhttp://www.roadsafe.com/news/article.aspx?article=1317\nJob creationhttp://www.bikeleagu\ne.org/resources/rep ... _Dec20.pdf\nThe link provides estimates of 14 jobs per million dollar spent - about 20 per million pounds. Tourism jobs would add to these numbers. Estimating at 25 jobs per million pounds and £10 per person would result in 15000 \nextra jobs being created. \nSummary of costsPotential savings \nfrom a ‘\nCycling Promotion and Road Safety Bill\n’ \ncould be more than £3 billion per year compared with an estimated cost of £0.6 billion per year. Over a 10 year period a net return of £24 billio\nn appears possible.\n \nAppendix BAuthors details\n, \nColin Clarke\n, \n9 The Crescent, \nStamford\n \nBridge\n, \nYork\n, \nEngland\n, YO41 1BU.\nTel 01759 373045\n, \nEmail \ncolinclarkecycling@hotmail.co.uk\n \nRetired\nQualified \nCycling Coach 1970, British Cycling Federation (not active)\nCycled in more than\n 20 countries, ex racing experience.\nPolytechnic \nAssociateship\n in Mechanical Engineering \nHuddersfield\n Polytechnic 1974.\nTrained as a Mechanical Engineer.
