default              
defaultBroadly, 
defaultthere are
default 
defaultsignificant
default concerns over the measures
default, as set out in our response document, and
default voice
defaultd
default in 
defaulta 
defaultmeeting with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) as part of the consultation process. 
defaultFurther, 
defaultthe draft legislation that now forms part of the Finance Bill not only fails to address these concerns, but has in fact created a number of new questions
default, not least over the subjective nature of what has been proposed
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthese concerns
default are set out
default,
default in general terms, below. Please note that we also intend to separately respond to the t
defaultechnical consultation on 
defaultthe draft clauses to the
default Finance Bill 2014
default, and so will
default reserve comments on the specifics of the legislation for our Finance Bill representatio
defaultns.
default1.3
default              
defaultIn brief, 
defaultit is 
defaultfelt
default that
default the
default draft
default 
defaultlegislation is not wholly appropriate because, fundamentally, it 
defaultfail
defaults
default 
defaultto achieve the stated objectives for the following reasons:
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultA
default number of these issues 
defaulthave arisen 
defaultas a direct result of the apparent flaws in the consultation process.
default2.1.1
default              
defaultT
defaulthe subjective nature of the draft legislation
default is 
defaulta 
defaultcause for concern
default. 
defaultThis will unavoidably create uncertainty in the legislation and cannot, therefore, be considered 
defaultan effective, nor indeed ap
defaultpropriate approach to creating the law
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn particular, based on the draft legislation, there is real uncertaint
defaulty and confusion 
defaultover 
defaultcertain terms and definitions included in the legislation, such as how to define whether a member has 'significant influence' over a partnership's business function. 
default2.1.2
default              
defaultSome further examples of subjectivity within the 'salaried mem
defaultber' provisions that are likely to give rise to 
defaultconfusion 
defaultare:
default&#xa0;
default2.1.3
default              
defaultT
defaulthe changes are intended to ensure that partnerships, and their members, are taxed as the Government intended. 
defaultThis 
defaultwill
default be difficult to achieve
default, 
defaulthowever, 
defaultas the lack of 
defaultcertainty over the application of the new rules
default will arguably undermine the effectivene
defaultss of what has been proposed. 
default2.2.1
default              
defaultA
default number of practical questions were raised during the consultation process. 
defaultIt is noted
default that 
defaultseveral
default of these comments have been considered in the draft legislation. Nevert
defaultheless, 
defaultquestion marks remain
default 
defaultover significant aspects of the new legislation including, for example,
default over 
defaultthe practicalities of moving a 'salaried member' from being taxed on the current year basis, to the payroll. In fact, it would appear that little or 
defaultno thought has been given to the 
defaultimpact of 
defaultthe individual members' 
defaultcessation
default/overlap rules
default thus far
default. 
default2.2.2
default              
defaultThere is
default also
default uncertainty, based on the draft legislation, as to whether actions taken by 
defaultLimited Liability Partnerships (
defaultLLPs
default)
default to ensure that membe
defaultrs are not treated as salaried members – say, an increase in capital contributions to satisfy condition C – will be disregarded under anti-avoidance provisions, even where the member’s risk increases as a result.  
default2.2.3
default              
defaultFurthermore, the fact remains that 
defaultaffected businesses have only a matter of weeks to implement any necessary changes such as the introduction, in some cases, of a new payroll system for 'salaried members'.
default With only 10 weeks before the proposed commencement date, there is still very little
default guidance available on the transitional rules in particular, making the transition an unnecessarily confusing, and complicated task.
default 
defaultIt should be noted that, far from being simply a case of someone's tax status altering, the 
defaultpotential
default changes go to the he
defaultart 
defaultof
default 
defaultthe
default culture of the business, and how an 
defaultindividual's
default status in their field is conveyed. No business should be forced to rush such a cultural change with key personnel simply to speed up the implementation of new tax 
defaultguidelines
default.
default Such 
defaultforced change is
default not beneficial for either the individual impacted, or the firm's prospect of continuing to generate profit and therefore contribute taxes.
default2.2.4
default              
defaultThis situation is 
defaultclearly not
default ideal, and is of course further complicated by the fact that businesses will be expected to apply the rules before the finalisation of the legislation, based on the fact that Finance Bill 2014 is unlikely to be published until the end of March 2014 before
default receiving Royal Assent sometime later in the summer (in line with previous years). 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.5
default              
defaultIf, as is likely to be the case in the limited time available, many firms look to obtain additional amounts of capital from those current partners who do not meet 
defaultthe criteria as laid out, this will require significant bank funding to the sector. 
defaultIt is evident from discussions with the main banks active in the sector that 
defaultwhilst
default they are willing to fund healthy businesses, they are 
defaultbeing
default asked to:
default&#xa0;
default2.2.6
default              
defaultThis, at a time when the financial health 
defaultof
default the sector is under significant st
defaultrain and causing the banks significant 
defaultconcerns
default due to recent (and 
defaulton-going
default) examples of failures where the banks have been hit hard. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.7
default              
defaultWe do
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt believe that the timescale as set out in the legislation allows the banks 
defaulttime
default to undertake due process 
defaultin reviewing these applications for additional capital loans and believe that as a result
default, the banks will have to either:
default&#xa0;
defaultNeither of the above is a desirable outcome for the UK economy.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.8
default              
defaultThis
default would appear to be
default an inherent flaw in the current policy, and 
defaultwill 
defaultonly 
defaultserve to 
defaultcreate 
defaultfurther
default uncertainty. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1.1
default              
defaultT
defaulthe 'tax information and impact notes' that accompanied the draft legislation
default commented
default that the measures will have a "negligible impact on businesses".
default&#xa0;
defaultH
defaultowever, h
defaultaving to deal with complex, subjective leg
defaultislation is a drain on businesses’ time and resources. 
defaultBy way of an example, 's
defaultalaried members
default'
default will not have the same employment rights as individuals with contracts of service, as the proposed rules are stated to apply for the purposes of the Income Tax 
defaultActs. Businesses may find
default 
defaultthat individuals are unwilling to become members in case they are treated as employees for
default the purposes of 
defaulttax
default and 
defaultN
defaultational Insurance contributions (NIC),
default but without the employment protection that 
defaultnormally comes with the addition
defaultal tax and NIC liabilities that accompany employment. This could impact on succession and limit an LLP’s ability to raise capital.  
default&#xa0;
default3.1.2
default              
defaultThe types of uncertainties referred to above will be a distraction also. 
defaultIt is expected
default, therefore,
default that the full ex
defaulttent of the draft legislation will indeed have a detrimental effect on UK busin
defaultess
default, and would question how it has been concluded that this is not the case. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1.3
default              
defaultIt may also be noted
default that the potential impact of the measures is more wide ranging than even HMRC previously envisaged. This was clearly evidenced by the fact that the expected yield from the measures increased significantly from the original estimate. 
default3.2.1
default              
defaultThe original consultation document set out the Government's belief that the existing rules surrounding the taxation of members of a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP
default),
default are effectively open to abuse. It is stated that this produces "unfairness in the tax s
defaultystem". 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.2
default              
defaultIndeed, achieving 'fairness' was a recurring theme throughout the proposals, and understood to be fundamental to the introduction of the new measures. However,
default 
defaulti
defaultt is generally felt that the wide ranging effect of the draft legislation is, i
defaultn fact, somewhat
default 
defaultheavy handed and disproportionate. Furthermore, 
defaultit is likely that
default the measures will, in fact, put partnerships at a disadvantage when compared to other business vehicles available, such as a company, for example.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2.3 
default              
defaultOther examples
default 
defaulto
defaultf where the draft legislation
default 
default(in respect of the new salarie
defaultd member status) 
defaultwill give rise to potential 'unfair' outcomes include
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is questionab
defaultle
default, therefore, 
defaultwhether
default the proposed legislation can be said to achieve the objective of 'preserving fairness'.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.1
default              
defaultThe introduction of complicated new legislation (and some 55 pages of guidance) 
defaultalso sends out a mixed message with regards to the coinciding agenda 
defaultto simplify
default the UK tax administration.
default 
defaultAs stated
default above
default, the new legislation will create additional uncertainty and add another layer of complexity for businesses to have to deal with.
default3.3
default.2
default              
defaultAs stated in our response to the original consultation, 
defaulta much simpler solution existed in that it 
defaultwould be possible for HMRC to challenge the status of members simply by 
defaultremoving any perceived presumption of self-employment and using existing case law.
default However, the intention is to remove that perceived presumption and then introduce new legislation that is unsatisfactory (examples as to why being set out above). 
default3.3.3
default              
defaultThis point comes into sharp focus when one considers that HMRC will have to continue 
defaultto use existing case law when looking at LLPs formed outside the UK and traditional partnerships.  
default3.3.4
default              
defaultIronically, and not strictly a tax point, for the purposes of pension auto-enrolment, the test to determine who is within the ambit of the rules is wh
defaultether the individual is either an employee or a worker. As stated above
default,
default salaried members of LLPs will not be employees for all purposes and will not satisfy the employment test. It is understood that the tests, as recommended by the 
defaultpensions
default regulator, as
default to whether an individual is a worker are the existing employed/self-employed tests. 
default3.3.5
default              
defaultFurthermore, a
defaults these are essentially anti-avoidance measures, questions may be raised as to whether the GAAR 
defaultcould
default/should
default 
defaultinstead 
defaultbe applied to counteract the resp
defaultective tax advantages 
defaultthat the draft legislation is intended to counteract
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile it is suggested in the con
defaultsultation document 
default(at paragraph 3.55) that the use of profit and loss allocations
default, in particular,
default may be outside the scope of these rules, it is 
defaultunderst
defaultood
default that any uncertainty could be removed by the provision of specific guidance on the point in question.
default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultHMRC's 
defaultTax Consultation 
defaultFramework,
default sets out the five stages to tax policy development:
default&#xa0;
defaultStage 1 
default              
defaultSetting out 
defaultobjectives and identifying options.
defaultStage 2 
default              
defaultDetermining the best option and developing a framework for implementation including detailed policy design.
defaultStage 3 
default              
defaultDrafting legislation to effect the proposed change.
defaultStage 4 
default              
defaultImplementing and monitoring the c
defaulthange.
defaultStage 5 
default              
defaultReviewing and evaluating the change.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultReferring specifically to the original consultation document, it was set out that "while there are some aspects of detailed policy design that are still open, this consultation is at stage 3 and is 
defaultabout ways to achieve the objectives stated in the consultation document while ensuring that the proposals do not have unexpected impacts."
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultFirstly,
default only inviting comments from professional advisors (and other stakeholders) at this late stage will (ev
defaultidently) give rise to practical issues
default. 
defaultUnfortunately, it would now appear that
default the introduction of the new rules will be rushed into place
default,
default without proper consideration. This should not be the case when introducing new law. This approach will inevitably g
defaultive rise to 
defaultineffective
default legislation
default,
default to the detriment of both the businesses affected, and to the integrity of, and general confidence in, the UK tax administration.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultFurthermore, 
defaultit simply cannot be said that the consultation period has sufficiently d
defaultealt with a number of the 'unexpected impacts' that have arisen. As stated above, question 
defaultmarks remain over the practical implications of the introduction of the new rules in particular
default, while 
defaultthe significant uprating of the expected revenue yield (as ide
defaultntified in the Autumn Statement 2013 documentation) is clear evidence that HMRC had failed to fully appreciate the implications of what had been proposed. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultHowever, in this case, 
defaultit would appear that 
defaultHMRC 
defaulthas chosen to
default ignore
default 
defaultthe 
defaultevident 
defaultfailings in i
defaultts approach
default. Indeed, rather than accept that the under estimate was as a result of any apparent flaws in the proposals
default,
default and seek to correct the position, as 
defaultmight otherwise 
defaultbe expected during an on-going consultation process, there would seem to be somethi
defaultng of a congratulatory tone to the announcement regarding the 
defaultadditional £1.9 billion in revenue it now expects to recover. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultIn summary, the subjective nature of what has been proposed puts serious doubt over whether the 
defaultlegislation, as d
defaultrafted, will operate as intended. 
defaultIndeed, the significant uncertainty arising as a result of 
defaultthe proposed new rules
default could effectively act to undermine 
defaultthe Government's overall objective of ensuring a 
defaultbalanced,
default and competitive tax system.
default 
default5.2
default              
defaultAs such, 
defaultit 
defaultis
default strongly 
defaultrecommended that
default the Government reconsider the proposals and, at the very least, consider delaying the introduction of the new rules to allow 
defaultfor a further period of consultation and analysis of all possible impacts.
