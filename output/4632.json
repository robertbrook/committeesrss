"&#xa0;\nAFS0061Written evidence submitted by COMPASS-Suffolk COMPASS was a parent-led campaign group local to the Great Cornard Upper School\n (GCUS) pyramid in South Suffolk. The group formed in the autumn of 2010 to ensure that there was open debate on a proposed Free School in Stoke by Nayland (a village in the catchment area for GCUS) and to inform local parents and community members about t\nhe implications of a new Free School in the area. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission sets out in brief our experience as a parent-led group in Suffolk in regard to proposed Free Schools. It provides evidence for point 1 of the Committee\n’\ns enquiry: \n“\nThe process for approving\n, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors\n”\n.\nSUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011 the Stoke by Nayland Academy Trust (SbNAT) applied to the DfE to open an 11-16 school in Stoke by Nayland (a village in South Suffolk). This bid was\n unsuccessful. The Seckford Foundation then applied to the DfE in 2012 to open an 11-16 school on the same site. This bid was also unsuccessful.\n Stoke by Nayland is in a part of Suffolk with a significant surplus of secondary-school places. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPASS formed\n in response to a free school proposal in Stoke by Nayland, in order to promote open debate about the issues that would arise should the free school bid be successful. Both SbNAT and the Seckford Foundation refused to engage in public debate with us.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPA\nSS submitted a thorough explanation of our grounds for opposing the school to the DfE in both 2011 and 2012, and requested a meeting to discuss these further. On both occasions we were advised that there was no opportunity to raise our concerns with the Df\nE until or unless the bids reached the \n‘\npre-opening\n’\n \nstage. We considered this a weakness in the free schools application process.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPASS\n’\ns view was (and remains) that it is not possible to establish a new school in an area with a large surplus of school \nplaces without it having a negative impact on existing provision and the wider community. Therefore the application process should include, at an early stage, the promotion of open public debate and an opportunity for those opposing the proposal to be hear\nd. Instead, there was a culture of secrecy about both the free school proposals and the application process. This was perpetuated by the DfE\n’\ns refusal to meet with us and hear our concerns. \nBACKGROUND AND HISTORYLocal Context and Stoke by Nayland Academy Trust&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposed closure of middle schools in Suffolk (a process known locally as the Schools Organisation Review or SOR) coincided from 2010 with the opportunity for parent-led groups to apply to the DfE to open a Free School. This led to a number of f\nree school applications in the county for 11-16 schools, all in small towns where there was some parental opposition to the closure of the middle schools. In 2011 a parent-led group, the Stoke by Nayland Academy Trust (SbNAT), applied to open an 11-16 scho\nol in Stoke by Nayland from September 2013, intending to use the site of the middle school in that village which was set to close in July 2013.  \nEstablishment and make-up of COMPASS&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPASS was formed in response to that application. We were concerned abo\nut the absence of informed debate about the benefits and potential risks of a new 11-16 free school in Stoke by Nayland, and formed COMPASS as a campaign group in order to promote open debate on the issue.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPASS was a single-issue community campaign group with no political affiliation \n–\n \nthough some individual members and supporters do hold a range of strong political views. It had a core organising group of eight: six parents with children at GCUS and loca\nl primary schools, one of whom was also a governor at GCUS and another of whom was on the equivalent of the PTA. Two further members were teachers at GCUS, one of whom is also a Liberal Democrat councillor.\nCampaign&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPASS held a number of public events a\nt local schools \n–\n \nboth formal meetings and informal drop-in sessions, and provided information which was publicised on our website and via social media, and circulated to parents by the schools in the GCUS pyramid (with permission from the headteachers inv\nolved). \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving gained local support from parents and community-members in the area that would have been affected by the opening of a new school, COMPASS organised a petition opposing the free school. This was submitted to the DfE, alongside a document out\nlining the reasons for our opposition to the proposed free school, to coincide with the deadline for Free School applications. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposal by SbNAT was rejected by the DfE.\nSeckford Foundation Proposal&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012 SbNAT ceded control of the bid for an 11-16 \nschool in Stoke by Nayland to the Seckford Foundation (who had also bid to open two more free schools in Suffolk \n–\n \nBeccles and Saxmundham). COMPASS continued to provide opportunities for local debate on the proposed free school. We again submitted a compre\nhensive document to the DfE outlining our opposition to the proposed school, with a request to meet the DfE and discuss our concerns in greater depth. The proposal by the Seckford Foundation in 2012 was also rejected by the DfE.\nOutcome&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe two application\ns to run an 11-16 Free School in Stoke by Nayland were both rejected. COMPASS as a campaign group is therefore no longer active, although members of the group continue to be actively involved in schools in the area.\nCOMPASS’S POSITION&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur concerns fell int\no three categories:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe actual school offer from the proposing groups (paragraphs 16-17);\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe lack of transparency or opportunity for open public debate in the free school application process at conceptual and application stages (paragraphs 18-24);\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nimpact that opening a new 11-16 school in our area would have on existing schools and the Schools Reorganisation already underway in Suffolk (paragraphs 25-30).\nEducational Offer&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBoth proposers sought to provide a small secondary school and, in their focus\n on academic subjects, struggled to avoid the association that their school would be selective. As such their proposals were divisive. The proposals were carefully marketed and drew heavily on anger amongst some parents about the proposed closure of the mi\nddle school, and claims that could not be substantiated (such as the value of small schools). Because of the lack of public debate, it was not possible to test out these assumptions in a calm and measured way to enable parents to make a fully informed choi\nce about what was on offer.  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere were a number of other concerns about the actual school offer in both years, but these are not explored in this document as the proposals were unsuccessful.\nLack of Transparency&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeither SbNAT nor the Seckford Foundation \nmade their business cases for the proposed school available to the public. Neither organisation provided information about the numbers registering for the proposed schools, despite requests to do so. It was therefore impossible for the bidders to respond a\ndequately to the concerns of local parents about the educational offer they would be in a position to make should their application have been successful, or about the impact that the proposed school would have had on existing schools.\nLack of clarity&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom \nthe outset in 2010 it was also difficult to discern the difference between local anger at the closure of middle schools and local support for the proposed free schools. Free schools were publicised as extending choice following the closure of middle school\ns, even though the closure of middle schools did not reduce choice of school, simply the year groups at which pupils change schools. It is therefore possible that proposers and DfE may have colluded in allowing those opposing closure of the middle schools \nto feel \n–\n \nmistakenly \n–\n \nthat their voice had been heard.\nLack of accountability of the proposers to the local community&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSbNAT refused to enter into public debate with COMPASS, and instead sought to denigrate our campaign. The Seckford Foundation did provide\n communications events for parents to find out about the proposed school and to invite registrations, but refused to acknowledge the existence of local opposition or to enter into open dialogue about the proposed free school. Both argued \n–\n \nand the free sch\nool application process supported this position \n–\n \nthat the free school proposals could be considered in isolation from the impact they may have on existing provision and that there was no need for discussion with the wider community at that stage of the pr\noceedings.\nFreedom of Information Requests (FoI)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the paucity of information available about the decision-making process for approving a free school and the actual bids submitted by SbNAT and the Seckford Foundation, COMPASS sought to use Freedom of Information requests to elicit more detailed infor\nmation about the applications and approval process. However on a number of occasions, information requested via FoI was turned down on the grounds that it was not in the public interest, and still refused following further challenge. Unsuccessful FoIs incl\nuded: \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na request in July 2011 to establish the evidence of demand contained in the SbNAT free school application;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na request in October 2011 enquiring about the reasons the SbNAT bid was rejected;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na request in April 2012 for the release of minutes, notes or\n action points from a meeting held in November 2011 to discuss free schools in Suffolk between DfE and Suffolk County Council (SCC) officials.  FoI was served to both DfE and SCC in this case; following appeal to both organisations the final response was t\nhat no notes or action points were recorded.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResponses received from the DfE to our FoI requests served only to heighten our concerns about the lack of transparency in the free school application process, and raised further questions about the robustness o\nf the process.  The following extract is an example.  It is taken from the DfE response to an appeal about the refusal to release information about the reasons the SbNAT bid was rejected:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nThe panel also discussed the points raised in your email of 1 Janua\nry 2012.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘\nIt is in the public interest to understand why a free school application has failed, because public money has been spent in the course of the process, and there is a general presumption that government should be open and transparent.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is in the\n public interest to know the general reasons why free school applications have failed, as this is likely to be of use to other Free School applicants who can then adapt applications accordingly.\n’\nWe do not publish the reasons for failure of individual proj\nects because the process is competitive, where applications are compared against each other and a range of contextual information is taken account. This means that there is no minimum benchmark for an application to be successful because it is dependent on\n the number and quality of applications received within the round. This could potentially vary significantly from one round to the next. Therefore, releasing information about individual unsuccessful projects may be unhelpful to future applicants and could\n stifle innovative solutions.\n”\nNo democratic process&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPASS sought unsuccessfully to discuss our concerns with the DfE in 2011 and 2012. The DfE\n’\ns position was that wider discussion about a free school would only be held if the application were through to the pre-opening stage. Given that pre-opening de facto implies that a school will open, this effectively renders invalid any local opposition to \nthe proposal and severely limits any potential for democratic process. \nImpact on Existing Schools&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuffolk is a relatively small LEA but has a significant surplus of secondary school places \n–\n \nparticularly in the areas in which free schools were proposed (o\nr have since opened).  This point was put to the DfE by the Local Authority. By 2016, given the existing level of surplus plus the provision of additional 11-16 free schools, nearly one third of the secondary school places planned for Suffolk will not be u\nsed. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is important because carrying a significant surplus of places leads to consequent burdens in cost, and reduces the cost-effectiveness of education spending in the authority overall. It should be noted that in Suffolk, per-capita funding at key s\ntage 4 is already lower than in other LEAs. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Authority data made it clear that an additional free school in Stoke by Nayland would add more surplus places, and place significant financial strain on existing schools, including GCUS, should pupils who \nwere expected to attend existing schools instead go to the new free school. Through a consequent reduction in budget, this in turn would reduce the educational offer existing schools could make to their remaining pupils. Thus the opening of a free school i\nn a locality with surplus places could lead to a reduction in educational offer for all local pupils \n–\n \nas clearly acknowledged in the DfE\n’\ns own impact assessment for Saxmundham Free School which was only recently made public.\nImpact on SOR (N.B. Paragraph\ns 24-26 concern the context in Suffolk, rather than the case of Stoke by Nayland \nper se\n.)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DfE inviting (and in some cases approving) applications for free schools in Suffolk at the same time the Local Authority was already undertaking a major reorganis\nation of schools in the county has complicated planning for the Authority, for schools and for local parents. It will also make it impossible to ascertain whether any future successes or failures are due to the advent of the free schools or the closure of \nthe middle schools. This is because it has resulted in a piecemeal approach to raising standards in the county rather than a strategic response. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe free schools that have been opened in Suffolk (and the proposed one in Stoke by Nayland) are all small secondary schools. The DfE and Local Authority appear to hold contradictory views about the size of secondary schools: the Authority proposed 1200 pu\npils as the optimum number for a school to be financially viable and offer a broad and balanced curriculum, yet the free school proposals have all been for schools of 540 pupils maximum.  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuffolk is a rural county. Schools therefore rely on school transpo\nrt arrangements, responsibility for which remains with the Local Authority. The DfE required Local Authorities to provide transport to free schools, yet the process of approving free schools in Suffolk occurred without reference to the need for school plac\nes. This raises the very real possibility that the introduction of free schools in an area may reduce parental choice, not expand it, because parents in a rural area may need to make choice based on how their children will get to school.\nCONCLUSIONS&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCOMPAS\nS was formed to promote public debate about a proposed free school and facilitate expression of local opposition to that proposal. It was formed because the Free School application process as it stands at present does not facilitate open dialogue with the \ncommunity or proper public testing of proposals and the assumptions within them at an early enough stage. This includes, crucially, no open acknowledgement of the impact a new free school in a locality with surplus places could have on existing provision. \nThus what could be an exercise in bringing together community stakeholders to support local schools instead becomes divisive and wasteful of resources.   \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn submitting this evidence to the Select Committee, COMPASS are hopeful that the Committee will cons\nider the need for more transparency and open debate as part of the Free Schools application process going forward. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nGreat Cornard Upper School changed its name in September 2013 to Thomas Gainsborough School\n"
