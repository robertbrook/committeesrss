"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Dr Ruth Levitt and William Solesbury, Visiting Senior Research Fellows, King’s College London, Dept of Political Economy (SCE0020)&#xa0;\nSummary 1. Our memorandum responds to the third of the questions on which the Committee invited views from outside observers: \nWhat more needs to be done? \nIn doing so, it takes as a starting point the ‘clear vision of the future’ in Chapter 8 of\n the Committee’s\n report on \nSelect committee effectiveness, resources and powers\n of 8 November 2012 (Second Report of Session 2012–13, HC 697)\n, which \nstated : \nOur aim is that committees should be respected, listened to and feared by departments and ministers for the quality of their investigations, the rigour of their questioning, the depth of their analysis, and the value of their reports…Their ability to do their job will not be limited by constraints on access to information or the witnesses they wish to hear from, and they will be able to draw\n \non expert advice and research. (Para 136)\n2. We believe that these objectives \nalso \nneed to \ntake into account t\nhe government’s commitment to ‘open policy making’,\n \nas stated in its \nCivil Service Reform Plan\n (June 2012), wh\nich advocates a greater contribution \nto policy development\n from sources of \nexpertise \no\nutside Whitehall departments\n.\n3. S\nelect committees increasingly need to identify, question and analyse these external sources \nof expertise as an integral part of their scrutiny of ministerial and official performance\n. \n4. Select committees should see it as their own responsibility to \npursu\ne\n \nthis more thorough \n’evidence trail’\n (somewhat like an\n audit trail for financial accountability\n). C\nommittee members and their advisers need to \nenhance their knowledge and \nskills\n in order to evaluate and comment wisely on the ‘evidence trail’.\n \n&#xa0;\nAbout the authors5\n. Dr Ruth Levitt and William Solesbury \nstudy \nthe \nuses and effectiveness of the policy \nexpert\nise that ministers and departments seek from sources \noutside Whitehall\n \nfor \npolicy development.\n Their earlier work includes research on\n the contribution of outsiders brought into government departments as \ndirect \nappointees to the Senior Civil Service, as non-executive board members and as members of policy units.\n In 2012 \ntheir research on policy tsars revealed the growth in the scale and scope of such public appointments over the last four \nadministrations.\n \nThe\nir \nnew research\n, \nAdvising Ministers\n, will \nevaluate the effectiveness and impact of \nan even broader range of way\ns in which expert advice is brought to bear on policy.\nOpen policy making6\n. The g\novernment’s \nCivil Service Reform Plan\n (June 2012) favoured what it termed ‘open policymaking’ and promoted greater outsourcing of policy advice as a step towards that:\nWhitehall has a virtual monopoly on policy development, which means that policy is often drawn up on the basis of too narrow a range of inputs and is not subject to external challenge prior to announcement….the need to maintain a safe space for policy advice should not be used to prevent the maximum possible openness to new thinking or in the gathering of evidence and insight from external experts.\nThe Prime Minister, appearing before the House of Commons Liaison Committee on 3 July 2012, expressed this from a ministerial perspective:\nWe should also recognise that the civil service does not have a monopoly on policy wisdom, so we have what we call policy contestability. On some occasions, we should go outside the civil service and say, ‘Here’s a particular challenge’ – for example setting up the green investment bank – ‘Can you help us O think-tank or O academic body, in developing this policy?’\n&#xa0;\nSources of external expertise6\n.\n \nIn \nadvocating the \nopening up \nof \npolicy making, the government has given no comprehensive statement of what it considers \nto be \nthe appropriate sources of outside expertise. \nOf course s\nome \nsources \nhave \nalready \nlong \nbeen in use\n, such as advisory committees, researchers, respondents to consultations\n. O\nthers are relative newcomers, such as think tanks or policy tsars\n. Y\net others\n, once much more frequently used, \nhave fallen out of favour, notably Royal Commissions.\n \n7. \nSome \nexternal \nsources are commissioned on the initiative of ministers or departments to provide evidence or advice; others provide one or both on their own initiative in the hope that they will be heard.\n This is reflected in the \nfollowing list of sources of external expertise:\n&#xa0;\nA. Minister or department initiates\n&#xa0;\nB. External source initiates\nWith ‘open policy making’ the evidential basis of policy that a select committee might wish to explore may well be drawn from \nmore than one of these \nsources.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nThe utility of \nall these \nsources should be evaluated in terms of:\nand, not least important, \n&#xa0;\nSelect committee practice9\n. \nS\nelect committees have \nsometimes recognised \nexternal contributions to policy development\n in their area\n. \nRecently, f\nor example:\n10. These exemplify a common t\nendency \nto examine such\n \ncontributions to policy \nin isolation, \npossibly prompted \nby newsworthy developments. \n  But \n external sources of evidence and advice increasingly deserve attention in the more strategic, forward looking\n \nscrutiny of department performance that the earlier Liaison Committee\n’s Second R\neport recommended (in Chapter 4).\n \nThis could either be in committee inquiries on a policy or in their reviews of departmental Annual Reports.\n \n11. \nSelect committees should see it as their own responsibility to \npursu\ne\n \nthis more thorough \n’evidence trail’\n (somewhat like an\n audit trail for financial accountability\n). Of course the term ‘evidence trail’ should not be taken as suggesting a simple, linear relationship between evidence and policy. It is well established that evidence and policy interact and influence each other in both directions and over time.\n12\n.\n C\nommittee members and their advisers\n need \nto \ndevelop their skills to \nadopt a more ‘forensic’ approach\n in order\n to identify and question the evidential basis of department\ns’\n polic\nies and policy intentions, from whatever source\n.\n \nC\nommittees’ research funding \nmay perhaps be \nused to this end.\n&#xa0;\n15 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nEvidence-informed policy: what difference do outsiders in Whitehall make? \nESRC UK Centre for Evidence Based Policy and Practice, Working Paper 23, 2005\n;  \nhttp://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/politicaleconomy/research/cep/pubs/papers/assets/wp23.pdf\n.\n Policy tsars: here to stay but more transparency needed, King’s College London\n, \n2012\n; \nhttp://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/politicaleconomy/research/tsarsreport/Tsars-Final-Report-Dec-2012.pdf\n.\n HM Government, The Civil Service Reform Plan, June 2012, p. 14.\n House of Commons Liaison Committee, Oral evidence from the Prime Minister, 3 July 2012, Q60, Session 2012-13, HC 484-i.\n"
