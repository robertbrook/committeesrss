"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI should like to give my views on the flagrant bias shown by the BBC – it really should be renamed as the\n Labo\nur\n Broadcasting Corporation!\n   Over the past few years it has steadily got worse, with bias eviden\nt both in TV \nand radio \ncontent.  Radio comedy programmes such as \nThe News Quiz\n and \nThe One Show\n are examples.  Morning news features on Radio 4 have also show\nn a strong left-leaning bias.\nThe Corporation seems to be stuffed with employees who are obviously much sympathetic to leftist views such as those published in the Guardian newspaper.  Recent criticisms of actions by the Guardian in publishing facts almost\n certainly detrimental to the country’s security were scarcely mentioned on \nBBC \nTV and radio news programmes.  Emphasis has\n long\n been on ‘savage Tory cuts’, and if there occurs anything that could be seen as detrimental to the Tory party it is pounced upon\n gleefully by the news team!\nBBC interviewers tend to be hard on those holding right-wing views but very soft on those holding left-wing views.  Left-wing interviewees are generally afforded more air-time than their right-wing counterparts.\nThe BBC seems t\no be accountable to no-one when large pay-offs and expensive relocation plans of dubious value are implemented.\nBBC\n bias seems to be increasing rather than de\nc\nreasing and I \nfeel it is wrong for the nation to have \nto pay a Licence Fee to fund such \npropagand\na\n broadcasting.  The BBC should be an\n impartial\n organisation, as once it was!\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
