[normal]Written Evidence from Healthwatch England [PHS0036][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Healthwatch England welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Public Administration Committee on your inquiry into 
[normal]Complaints: do they make a 
[normal]difference
[normal]. We hope that this provides a useful insight into the public’s concerns with the complaints systems and our proposed solutions for improvement and reform across health and social care.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Concerns about the complaints systems for health and social care are not new. In 2000, the Ritchie inquiry published its findings which looked at why concerns about Rodney Ledward, over a 16 year period, were not dealt with 
[normal]promptly to prevent his patients from being harmed
[normal]. Ledward had faced numerous complaints from over 500 women and their families before being struck off by the GMC for serious professional misconduct in 1998.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The report recognised that many people did no
[normal]t know how to complain or to whom to complain to, and heard evidence that there was considerable dissatisfaction in the way complaints are dealt with both at local and national level. The inquiry found that the c
[normal]omplaints procedure was so complicated that 
[normal]it would have probably acted as a deterrent to both staff and patients. It went on to state that 
[normal]complaints procedures were lengthy, cumbersome and time consuming and not in anyone's best interests. In their view the establishment of a simple and straightf
[normal]orward procedure for dealing with complaints would work to the benefit of patients and Trust employees (including doctors) alike. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Just four years later (in 2004), an independent inquiry
[normal] was underway into the murders of over 200 patients by their GP, Dr.
[normal] Harold Shipman over a period of more than 20 years. Significant concerns were raised about the complaints system. In its conclusions, the inquiry recommended a
[normal] single portal by which complaints or concerns could be directed or redirected to the appropriat
[normal]e quarter, incorporating a single national telephone number and internet service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Worryingly, concerns about the inadequacy of complaints processes were highlighted in the serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009. 
[normal]Sir Robert Francis QC, who led two public inquiries
[normal] into the failings, found that 
[normal]Trust management and governance lacked a culture of listening to patients and there were inadequate processes for dealing with complaints or supporting people to raise conce
[normal]rns that they had about their treatment or care. The second inquiry went on to suggest that a uniform process of complaints handling should be applied, and the making of a complaint should be easy to do with the facilitation of a speedy resolution, whereve
[normal]r possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further reports this year (2013) from Professor Sir Bruce Keogh
[normal], Professor Don Berwick
[normal] and the Clwyd /Hart review
[normal], commissioned by the Prime Minister, recognised that there has 
[normal]been a systematic failure to listen to, and act upon, the conce
[normal]rns of patients, carers and families and these failures resulted in neglect, poor quality care and even death.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Healthwatch England is concerned by the lack of progress made on improving and reforming complaints systems in health and social care, and we be
[normal]lieve that action must be taken now to prevent another crisis. To this end, Healthwatch England has prioritised work on complaints reform
[normal] and we welcome the opportunity to give evidence to the committee about our concerns with the current system and propo
[normal]sals for reform.
[normal] Our proposals for improvement and reform are based on own work on complaints and reviewing of previous proposals and actions made by independent inquiries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In June 2013, Healthwatch England launched a video report
[normal] 
[normal]exploring the public’s experience of health and social care complaints systems. Our work with consumers and sector leaders enabled us to identify six core principles for complaint reform. People told us that they wanted a system of complaints handling and 
[normal]advocacy that was: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have been working with the public to develop a new framework of consumer rights for health and social care
[normal]. The eight rights
[normal] we have developed are based on the international guidelines adopted by the United Nations in 1985, and expanded in 1999.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We took these eight international consumer rights and tested them with representatives from local Healthwatch and the public, drawing
[normal] on their own experiences of the health and social care system. People helped us to develop the rights at a deliberative workshop, reflections after the event that we captured on video and through nearly two thousand interviews during the summer of 2013. W
[normal]e also spoke to academics and researchers about the rights and explored different international and domestic models to make sure we hadn’t missed anything.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The complete set of rights is listed below. In relation to complaints specifically, the public focu
[normal]sed on a right to be listened to and provided us with many examples of where the complaints system and advocacy had let them down.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Based on these consumer rights, and the public’s principles for reform, we propose three roles that the Healthwatch network could take on to increase independence, accountability and effectiveness in the health and social care complaints s
[normal]ystem. We believe there is a role for Healthwatch in:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consumers do not know where to turn when they have a concern or complaint about a health or social care service. There are multiple local and national complaints system, regulators and contact points, meaning
[normal] the system is hard to navigate and few people are able to find a timely resolution for their complaint.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our own research found that 3 in 5 of the public do not feel they have a clear way of providing feedback and at least half of the concerns they have a
[normal]re never reported, primarily because they did not have any confidence that their complaints would actually be dealt with
[normal]. People shared with us experiences that resulted in a substantive lack of trust and confidence in complaints handling and concerns of 
[normal]independence and sufficiency of resolution processes. This means that many instances of poor care and treatment are not registered and could mean poor practice unnecessarily escalates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similarly, we are concerned that the current 2009 complaint regulation
[normal]s
[normal] effectively prevent ‘worried bystanders’ from registering any concerns or complaints they have about a health or care service. We strongly recommend an amendment to existing regulations to enable ‘worried bystanders’ to raise concerns and would like to 
[normal]explore further the value that anonymised complaints could make to the improvement of local health and social care services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are supportive of the ideas, promoted by Parliamentary &amp; Health Services Ombudsman (PHSO), for consumers to have a single point
[normal] of contact during their journey through the complaints system – and we are aware of the possibility that NHS England will develop this. The scale of this service would not be appropriate for Healthwatch to deliver and it potentially threatens the value we
[normal] could offer in independent oversight, scrutiny and support of the complaints system. However, we would want to ensure that any such system would meet the needs of consumers and fits with the existing or future role Healthwatch could play in the complaints
[normal] landscape.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We feel it should be the role of Healthwatch to support consumers to navigate the system and to support them to understand what to expect when they raise a concern or complaint. 
[normal]Based on the recommendations of the recent Clwyd Hart review
[normal] into NHS hospitals complaints systems, Healthwatch England is committed to coordinating a consumer-facing complaints campaign to raise awareness about people’s rights to make complaints and the standards they should expect from complaints handling and adv
[normal]ocacy services. To support this we are keen to collaborate with the Department of Health, the PHSO, the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) and others to develop and promote a complaints supplement to the NHS Constitution
[normal], which explicitly articulates the st
[normal]andards that consumers should expect from local and national complaints handling services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to this, we are supporting local Healthwatch to undertake pilot work to improve local complaints systems in low performing commissioner or provider area
[normal]s and to develop good practice in specified communities (i.e. for people with mental health conditions or living in areas of multiple deprivation). We believe that this will result in co-designed practical solutions to improve local complaint systems and e
[normal]nable Healthwatch England to share this with the wider network to be replicated in other areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Advocacy is support for people who are making a compla
[normal]int – from assistance with letter writing through to help navigating a complex system and representation in meetings that may be confusing or distressing for individuals. This service is particularly important when a complaint spans more than one resolutio
[normal]n process (local, courts, fitness to practice) and because many people feel vulnerable or exposed at the time of making a complaint about their care or treatment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Complaints advocacy in the NHS is far more developed than in social care. 
[normal]Initially, 
[normal]Community Health Councils (established in 1974
[normal]) had a remit to give
[normal] advice and support to members of the public on how to go about making a complaint about their local health services, until they were abolished in 2003
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently support is offered thro
[normal]ugh NHS Complaints Advocacy Services (NHS CAS)
[normal], which replaced the 
[normal]Independent Complaints Advocacy Service (ICAS) for the NHS that operated from September 2003 to April 2013. Whereas NHS CAS are commissioned by local authorities, ICAS were commissioned on
[normal] a regional basis to provide 
[normal]support for people wishing to complain about their treatment or care received under the NHS
[normal]. The total 
[normal]indicative budget for the commissioning of NHS CAS was £14.2m
[normal], which includes an additional settlement to cover the lost e
[normal]conomies of scale that were achieved under ICAS. Whilst NHS CAS is primarily commissioned to focus on health complaints, in some areas (based of commissioner appetite or provider passion) support is also offered to those who have a social care complaint.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current complexity and inconsistency of local advocacy and support offers need resolving. There are concerns the sufficiency and coverage of local NHS CAS and the extent to which they are supporting individuals to find local resolutions to their concer
[normal]ns or complaints. In some areas NHS CAS have been commissioned to the same organisation that runs the local Healthwatch. In these areas we are starting to see a more consolidated complaints advocacy and support offer. However, there is now an inconsistency
[normal] in access to complaints advocacy across local areas reliant on the appetite of councils and availability of resource. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Coverage for social care complaints advocacy is under significant threat as there is no overall duty on councils to provide independent
[normal] support to those raising a concern or making a complaint. Increasingly, councils are cutting the discretionary advocacy they commission as local budgets come under significant pressure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additionally, we are hearing concerns about the independence and poo
[normal]r / inconsistent standards of service among Patient Advice and Liaison Services (PALs) and inadequate signposting and collaboration with local NHS CAS and local Healthwatch. PALS were created in 2002 to provide information and on the spot help where patien
[normal]ts want to resolve a problem without making a formal complaint. Its role was to provide confidential advice, support and reassurance, and to resolve small problems locally. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PALS should be resourced to ensure staff are fully aware of the complaints proced
[normal]ure and trained to recognise and address complaints by either providing information on the complaints procedure or referring the complainant to the local NHS CAS. Whilst the Health and Social Care Act
[normal] abolished commissioner (Primary Care Trust) PALS, prov
[normal]ider (hospital) PALS remain in place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To end the current inconsistency in the system, we propose the Government establish a new consolidated complaints advocacy offer that spans health and social care, and all settings. Healthwatch England are keen to wor
[normal]k with the Department of Health, and advocacy providers to design and promote new standards for this consolidated complaints advocacy offer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further, we propose that existing NHS CAS contracts be kite-marked under the Healthwatch brand and required to col
[normal]laborate with local Healthwatch. This would simplify entry in the system for consumers as well as ensuring oversight of the quality of the advocacy offer. 
[normal]Once existing contracts for NHS CAS and / or local Healthwatch have been fulfilled, we believe there 
[normal]is an opportunity for the Government to reconsider how a consolidated advocacy and support offer might be commissioned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that these solutions should enable Healthwatch England to develop a source of national data on local health and social care 
[normal]complaints, which is currently not held at a 
[normal]national level, allowing us to identify national trends and concerns that need to be acted upon.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, we note that Rt Hon. Oliver Letwin (Minister for Government Policy), in his evidence to your committee, 
[normal]announced further reviews into complaints systems, which includes the NHS. We would also hope that Healthwatch England are offered the opportunity to champion consumer interest in such a review and ensure that learning from new efforts to improve and refor
[normal]m the health and social complaints systems is adequately captured.
