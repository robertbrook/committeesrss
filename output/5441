[normal]Written evidence submitted by Tim [bold]Yeo[bold] MP, Chair,[bold]Energy and Climate Change Committee (FTF 11)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your letter of 16 December.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am replying in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Energy and 
[normal]Climate Change Committee. I draw in particular on my experience as Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee in the last Parliament. I was conscious of 
[normal]the difficulty of maintaining the focus of the Committee as the date for a 
[normal]possible General Election drew nearer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Against this background I believe that fixed-term Parliaments and the 
[normal]consequent greater certainty about the dates of General Elections will be helpful 
[normal]to the work of Select Committees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the current Parliament it will be easier for the Energy and Climate Change 
[normal]Committee to plan its work 
[normal]programme
[normal] right through until the spring of 2015 in the clear knowledge that the House of Commons will still be in session at that 
[normal]time. This will mean that both Members and Committee staff can remain 
[normal]focused on completing a fuller 
[normal]programme
[normal] than would be possible if there was 
[normal]uncertainty about the date of the General Election.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Inevitably the ability to achieve consensus in Committee reports may be eroded 
[normal]as election campaigning begins in earnest but even this consideration will be 
[normal]made somewhat easier by the removal of uncertainty about the election date. 
[normal]As Members and Committee staff become accustomed to fixed term 
[normal]Parliaments, there may be greater scope for better strategic planning, right at the start of a Parliament, on what the Committee wants to achieve over five 
[normal]years. This may, for example, help Committees to take a proactive approach to 
[normal]scrutiny and help set the agenda in its policy area.
