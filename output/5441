defaultWritten evidence submitted by Tim defaultYeodefault MP, Chair,defaultEnergy and Climate Change Committee (FTF 11)default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter of 16 December.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am replying in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Energy and 
defaultClimate Change Committee. I draw in particular on my experience as Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee in the last Parliament. I was conscious of 
defaultthe difficulty of maintaining the focus of the Committee as the date for a 
defaultpossible General Election drew nearer.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgainst this background I believe that fixed-term Parliaments and the 
defaultconsequent greater certainty about the dates of General Elections will be helpful 
defaultto the work of Select Committees.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the current Parliament it will be easier for the Energy and Climate Change 
defaultCommittee to plan its work 
defaultprogramme
default right through until the spring of 2015 in the clear knowledge that the House of Commons will still be in session at that 
defaulttime. This will mean that both Members and Committee staff can remain 
defaultfocused on completing a fuller 
defaultprogramme
default than would be possible if there was 
defaultuncertainty about the date of the General Election.
default&#xa0;
defaultInevitably the ability to achieve consensus in Committee reports may be eroded 
defaultas election campaigning begins in earnest but even this consideration will be 
defaultmade somewhat easier by the removal of uncertainty about the election date. 
defaultAs Members and Committee staff become accustomed to fixed term 
defaultParliaments, there may be greater scope for better strategic planning, right at the start of a Parliament, on what the Committee wants to achieve over five 
defaultyears. This may, for example, help Committees to take a proactive approach to 
defaultscrutiny and help set the agenda in its policy area.
